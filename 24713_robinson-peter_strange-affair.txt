peter robinson strange affair book in the inspector banks series for sheila though our brother is upon the rack as long as we ourselves are at our ease our senses will never inform us of what he suffers they never did and never can carry us beyond our own person and it is by the imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his sensations adam smith thetheory ofmoralsentiments a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity proverbs chapter one was she being followed it was hard to tell at that time of night on the motorway there was plenty of traffic lorries for the most part and people driving home from the pub just a little too carefully red bmws coasting up the fast lane doing a hundred or more businessmen in a hurry to get home from late meetings she was beyond newport pagnell now and the muggy night air blurred the red taillights of the cars ahead and the oncoming headlights across the road she began to feel nervous as she checked her rearview mirror and saw that the car was still behind her she pulled over to the outside lane and slowed down the car a dark mondeo overtook her it was too dark to glimpse faces but she thought there was just one person in the front and another in the back it didnt have a taxi light on top so she guessed it was probably a chauffeured car and stopped worrying some rich git being ferried to a nightclub in leeds most likely she overtook the mondeo a little farther up the motorway and didnt give it a second glance the latenight radio was playing old blue eyes singing summer wind her kind of music no matter how oldfashioned people told her it was talent and good music never went out of style as far as she was concerned when she got to watford gap services she realized she felt tired and hungry and she still had a long way to go so she decided to stop for a short break she didnt even notice the mondeo pull in two cars behind her a few seedylooking people hung around the entrance a couple of kids who didnt look old enough to drive stood smoking and playing the machines giving her the eye as she walked past staring at her breasts she went first to the ladies then to the café where she bought a hamandtomato sandwich and sat alone to eat washing it down with a diet coke at the table opposite a man with a long face and dandruff on the collar of his dark suit jacket gave her the eye over the top of his glasses pretending to read his newspaper and eat a sausage roll was he just a gardenvariety pervert or was there something more sinister in his interest she wondered in the end she decided he was just a perv sometimes it seemed as if the world was full of them that she could hardly walk down the street or go for a drink on her own without some sad pillock who thought he was gods gift eyeing her up like the kids hanging around the entrance or coming over and laying a line of chat on her still she told herself what else could you expect at this time of the night in a motorway service station a couple of other men came in and went to the counter for coffeetogo but they didnt give her a second glance she finished half the sandwich dumped the rest and got her travel mug filled with coffee when she walked back to her car she made sure that there were people around a family with two young kids up way past their bedtime noisy and hyperactive and that no one was following her the tank was only a quarter full so she filled it up at the petrol station using her credit card right there at the pump the perv from the café pulled up at the pump opposite and stared at her as he put the nozzle in the tank she ignored him she could see the night manager in his office watching through the window and that made her feel more secure tank full she turned down the slip road and eased in between two juggernauts it was hot in the car so she opened both windows and enjoyed the play of breeze they created it helped keep her awake along with the hot black coffee the clock on the dashboard read am only about two or three hours to go then she would be safe penny cartwright was singing richard thompsons strange affair when banks walked into the dog and gun her low husky voice milking the songs stark melancholy for all it was worth banks stood by the door transfixed penny cartwright he hadnt seen her in over ten years though he had thought of her often even seen her name in mojo and uncut from time to time the years had been kind her figure still looked good in blue jeans and a tight white tshirt tucked in at the waist the long ravenswing hair he remembered looked just as glossy as ever in the stage lights and the few threads of gray here and there made her look even more attractive she seemed a little more gaunt than before a little more sad around the eyes perhaps but it suited her and banks liked the contrast between her pale skin and dark hair when the song ended banks took advantage of the applause to walk over to the bar order a pint and light a cigarette he wasnt happy with himself for having started smoking again after six months or more on the wagon but there it was he tried to avoid smoking in the flat and he would stop again as soon as hed got himself back together for the moment it was a crutch an old friend come back to visit during a time of need there wasnt a seat left in the entire lounge banks could feel the sweat prickling on his temples and at the back of his neck he leaned against the bar and let pennys voice transport him as she launched into blackwater side she had two accompanists one on guitar and the other on standup bass and they wove a dense tapestry of sound against which her lyric lines soared the next round of applause marked the end of the set and penny walked through the crowd which parted like the red sea for her smiling and nodding hello as she went and stood next to banks at the bar she lit a cigarette inhaled made a circle of her mouth and blew out a smoke ring toward the optics that was an excellent set banks said thanks she didnt turn to face him gin and tonic please kath she said to the barmaid make it a large one banks could tell by her clipped tone that she thought he was just another fan maybe even a weirdo or a stalker and shed move away as soon as she got her drink you dont remember me do you he asked she sighed and turned to look at him ready to deliver the final putdown then he saw recognition slowly dawn on her she seemed flustered embarrassed and unsure what to say oh yes its detective chief inspector burke isnt it she managed finally or have you been promoted afraid not he said and its banks but alan will do its been a long time yes penny got her gin and tonic and raised it to banks who clinked it gently with his pint glass sláinte sláinte said banks i didnt know you were back in helmthorpe well nobody put on a major advertising campaign banks looked around the dim lounge i dont know you seem to have a devoted following word of mouth mostly anyway yes im back in the old cottage what brought you here i heard the music as i was passing banks said recognized your voice what have you been up to lately a hint of mischief came into her eyes now that would be a very long story indeed and im not sure it would be any of your business maybe you could tell me over dinner some evening penny faced him and frowned her brows knit together searching him with those sharp blue eyes and before she spoke she gave a little shake of her head i cant possibly do that she whispered why not its only a dinner invitation she was backing away from him as she spoke i just cant thats all how can you even ask me look if youre worried about being seen with a married man that ended a couple of years back im divorced now penny looked at him as if hed missed the point by a hundred miles shook her head and melted back into the crowd banks felt perplexed he couldnt interpret the signals decode the look of absolute horror hed seen on her face at the idea of dinner with him he wasnt that repulsive a simple dinner invitation what the hell was wrong with her banks gulped down the rest of his pint and headed for the door as penny took the stage again and he caught her eyes briefly across the crowded room her expression was one of puzzlement and confusion she had clearly been unsettled by his request well he thought as he turned his back and left redfaced at least she didnt still look so horrified the night was dark the sky moonless but filled with stars and helmthorpe high street was deserted streetlights smudgy in the haze banks heard penny start up again back inside the dog and gun another richard thompson song never again the haunting melody and desolate lyrics drifted after him across the street fading slowly as he walked up the cobbled snicket past the old bookshop through the graveyard and on to the footpath that would take him home or to what passed for home these days the air smelled of manure and warm hay to his right was a drystone wall beside the graveyard and to his left a slope terraced with lynchets led down step by step to gratly beck which he could hear roaring below him the narrow path was unlit but banks knew every inch by heart the worst that could happen was that he might step into a pile of sheep shit close by he could hear the highpitched whining of winged insects as he walked he continued to think about penny cartwrights strange reaction to his dinner invitation she always had been an odd one he remembered always a bit sharp with her tongue and too ready with the sarcasm but this had been different not sarcasm not sharp but shock repulsion was it because of their age difference he was in his early fifties after all and penny was at least ten years younger but even that didnt explain the intensity of her reaction she could have just smiled and said she was washing her hair banks liked to think he would have got the message the path ended at a doublebarreled stile about halfway up gratly hill banks slipped through sideways and walked past the new houses to the cluster of old cottages over the bridge since his own house was still at the mercy of the builders he had been renting a flat in one of the holiday properties on the lane to the left the locals had been good to him as it turned out and hed got a fairly spacious onebedroom flat upper floor with private entrance for a very decent rent the irony was he realized that it used to be the steadman house long ago converted into holiday flats and it was during the steadman case that he had first met penny cartwright bankss living room window had a magnificent view over the dale north past helmthorpe folded in the valley bottom up to the rich green fields dotted with sheep and the sere pale grass of the higher pastures then the bare limestone outcrop of crow scar and the wild moors beyond but his bedroom window looked out to the west over a small disused sandemanian graveyard and its tiny chapel some of the tombstones so old that you could scarcely read the names anymore leaned against the wall of the house the sandemanian sect banks had read somewhere had been founded in the eighteenth century separating itself from the scottish presbyterian church its members took holy communion embraced communal property ownership practiced vegetarianism and engaged in love feasts which banks thought made them sound rather like eighteenthcentury hippies banks was a little pissed he realized as he fiddled with his key in the downstairs lock the dog and gun hadnt been his first port of call that evening hed eaten dinner alone in the hare and hounds then had a couple of pints in the bridge still what the hell he was on holiday for another week and he wasnt driving maybe hed even have a glass of wine or two he was still off the whiskey especially laphroaig its distinctive taste was the only thing he could remember about the night his life nearly ended and even at a distance the smell made him feel sick could the drinking have been what put penny off he wondered had she thought he was drunk when he asked her to dinner but banks doubted it he didnt slur his works or wobble when he walked there was nothing in his manner that suggested hed had too much no it had to be something else he finally opened the door walked up the stairs and unlocked the inside door then switched on the hall light the place felt hot and stuffy so he went into the living room and opened the window it didnt help much after he had poured himself a healthy glass of australian shiraz he walked over to the telephone a red light was flashing indicating messages on the answering service as it turned out there was only one message and a surprising one at that his brother roy banks wasnt even aware that roy knew his telephone number and he was also certain that the card and flowers he had received from roy in the hospital had come in fact from his mother alan shit youre not there and i dont have your mobile number if youve got one that is you never were much of a one for technology i remember anyway look this is important believe it or not youre about the only one who can help me now theres something i cant really talk about this to your answering service it could be a matter of life and death he laughed harshly maybe even mine anyway ill try again later but can you ring me back as soon as possible i really need to talk to you urgently please banks heard a buzzing noise in the background someones at the door ill have to go now please call ill give you my mobile number too roy left his phone numbers and that was that puzzled banks listened to the message again he was going to listen a third time but he realized there was no point he hated it when people in movies kept playing the same message over and over again and always seemed to get the tape in exactly the right spot every time instead he replaced the receiver and took a sip of wine hed heard all he needed roy sounded worried and more than a little scared the call was timed by his answering service at pm about an hour and a half ago when banks had been drinking in the bridge roys phone rang several times before an answering machine picked up roys voice in a curt nononsense invitation to leave a message banks did so said hed try again later and hung up he tried the mobile number next but got no response there either there was nothing else he could do right now maybe roy would ring back later as he had said he would often banks would spend an hour or so perched on the window seat in his bedroom looking down on the graveyard especially on moonlit nights he didnt know what he was looking for a ghost perhaps but the utter stillness of the tombstones and the wind soughing through the long grass seemed to give him some sort of feeling of tranquillity not tonight no moon no breeze the baby downstairs started crying the way it did every night around this time banks turned on the tv there wasnt much to choose from films a chat show or news he picked the spy who came in from the cold which had started half an hour ago that didnt matter hed seen it many times before and he knew the plot by heart but he couldnt concentrate as he watched richard burtons edgy intense performance and tried to pick up the threads he found his mind wandering back to roys phone call felt himself waiting for the phone to ring willing it there was nothing he could do about it right now but the sense of urgency and fear in roys voice disturbed him he would try again in the morning in case roy had simply gone out for the night but if he couldnt get in touch then he would head for london himself and find out just what the hell was going on why did people have to be so bloody inconsiderate as to find bodies so early on a saturday morning wondered detective inspector annie cabbot especially when banks was on holiday and she was on call it wasnt only that she was losing her weekend and detective inspectors dont get paid overtime but that those first crucial hours of an investigation were made all the more difficult by people being for the large part unavailable making information harder to ferret out and this was a particularly beautiful saturday morning offices would be empty services reduced as everyone loaded a picnic basket in the car along with the kids and headed for the nearest stretch of grass or sand she pulled to a halt behind the blue peugeot on a quiet stretch of country road halfway between eastvale and the al it had been just after half past seven when the station desk sergeant rang and woke her from an uneasy dream she immediately forgot and after a quick shower and a cup of instant coffee she was on the road the morning was still and hazy with the drone of insects in the air it was going to be just the kind of day for a picnic by the river dragonflies and the scent of wild garlic perhaps a bottle of chablis cooling in the water maybe her sketch pad and a few sticks of charcoal after a few nibbles of wensleydale cheese the type with cranberries was her favorite and a couple of glasses of wine it would be time for a nap on the riverbank maybe a pleasant dream enough of that she thought walking over to the car life had other plans for her today annie could see that the cars left wing had made contact with the drystone wall so much so that the wing had buckled and scratched and the impact had brought down a section of the wall there were no traces of skid marks no tire tracks at all on the dry tarmac surface there was already activity around the peugeot the road had been closed to all nonpolice traffic and the immediate area around the car had been taped off that would cause a few problems when the tourists started to dribble in annie thought but it couldnt be helped the integrity of the scene had to be preserved the photographer peter darby had finished photographing the body and the car and had busied himself videotaping the immediate area detective sergeant jim hatchley and detective constable winsome jackman who both lived closer to the scene were already there when annie arrived hatchley standing by the roadside and winsome sitting half in and half out of the unmarked police car what have we got annie asked hatchley who as usual looked as if hed been dragged through a hedge backward the little piece of tissue paper he had stuck to a shaving cut on his chin didnt help much a young woman dead behind the wheel of her car said hatchley i can see that for myself snapped annie glancing toward the open driversside window bit prickly this morning arent we maam said hatchley whats up get out of the wrong side of bed annie ignored him she was used to hatchleys taunts which had only grown more frequent since she had been made inspector and he remained a sergeant cause of death she asked dont know yet nothing apparent no obvious marks no bruising and officially shes not even dead yet not until the doc says she is annie refrained from pointing out that she knew that perfectly well but youve examined her she pressed on i had a quick look thats all didnt touch anything winsome checked for a pulse and found none were still waiting for doc burns so she could have died of a heart attack for all we know i suppose so said hatchley but like i said shes very young it smells a bit fishy to me any idea who she is theres no handbag no driving license nowt at least not as you can see looking through the windows maybe she was forced to pull over that makes more sense than a young woman traveling alone stopping voluntarily for a stranger on a dark country road you can see she hit the wall maybe someone was chasing her i checked the number plate on the computer guv said winsome walking over from her car the cars registered to a jennifer clewes lives in london kennington twentyseven years old we dont know for certain its her yet annie said so find out all you can right guv winsome paused yes wasnt there another one another what asked annie another murder like this one young woman found dead on the side of a road the m not the a but even so yes said annie i remember reading about it in the papers i cant remember the details look into it will you yes guv winsome walked back to her car annie looked at hatchley again has detective superintendent gristhorpe been informed yes maam says to keep him uptodate that made sense annie thought no point having the super come running down here if the woman had pulled over into the layby and died of a heart attack asthma brain aneurysm or any of the other random failures of the flesh that cause sudden death in otherwise healthy young people who was first officer on the scene pc farrier over there hatchley pointed to a uniformed police constable leaning against a patrol car pete farrier annie knew him he worked out of western area headquarters the same as she did had done for years according to all accounts and was a reliable sensible bobby annie walked over to him what happened pete she asked who called it in couple over there maam farrier pointed to a man and a woman some yards away from the scene they were sitting on the grass by the side of the road and the man had his arm around the woman whose head was buried in his chest annie thanked farrier and walked back to her car took her latex gloves from the murder kit in the boot and slipped them on then she walked over to the peugeot she needed to have a closer look at the scene gather some first impressions before dr burns arrived and started his examination already a number of flies had settled on the womans pale face annie shooed them away they buzzed angrily around her head waiting for the chance to get back the woman sat in the drivers seat slumped slightly forward and listing to the left her right hand grasped the steering wheel and her left held the gear stick her seat belt was fastened firmly in place holding her up and both the front windows were open the key was still in the ignition annie noticed and a travel mug sat in its holder the victim wasnt a big woman but her breasts were quite large and the seat belt ran between them separating them and causing them to appear even more prominent she looked to be midtolate twenties which matched jennifer clewess age and she was very attractive her skin was pale and probably had been even before her death her long hair was dark red dyed annie guessed and she was wearing a pale blue cotton blouse and black denim jeans there were no apparent marks on what they could see of her body as hatchley had noted and no sign of blood her eyes were open a dull vacant green annie had seen that look before felt that stillness hatchley was right though there was something very fishy about the whole setup fishy enough at least to warrant a thorough preliminary investigation before deciding upon the scale of the inquiry as annie examined the scene she made notes of what she observed and thought for later use when annie had finished she walked over to the couple who had found the body they were very young she noticed as she got closer the man was ashen and the woman he was holding still had her face buried in his shoulder though she didnt appear to be heaving with sobs the man looked up and annie squatted beside them im detective inspector cabbot from western area headquarters she said i understand you found the car the woman turned her face away from the protection of the mans shoulder and looked at annie she had been crying that was clear enough but now she just seemed shocked and hurt can you tell me what happened annie asked the man we already told the policeman in the uniform he was the first to get here i know said annie and im sorry to make you go through it again but itll help if you tell me theres nothing to tell really is there love he said to the woman who shook her head first off why dont you tell me your names this is sam samantha he said and im adrian adrian sinclair okay adrian where do you live sunderland annie thought shed noticed a hint of geordie bur in his voice though it was faint were on holiday adrian paused and stroked samanthas hair on our honeymoon in fact well theyd certainly remember it for as long as they lived annie thought and not for the right reasons where are you staying adrian pointed up the hillside were renting a cottage greystone just up there annie knew it she made a note and what were you doing down here by the road just walking adrian said it was such a beautiful morning and the birds woke us so early they were dressed for walking annie noticed not professional ramblers with the plasticcovered ordnance survey maps around their necks ashplants boots and expensive goretex gear but simple sturdy shoes light clothing and a rucksack what time did you arrive here it must have been a bit before seven adrian said what did you find the car stopped in the layby just like it is now did you touch it no i dont think so annie looked at samantha neither of you no samantha said but you might have touched the roof adrian when you bent to look inside its possible adrian said i dont remember at first i thought maybe she was looking at a road map or asleep even i went over to see if she needed any help then i saw her with her eyes open like that and we might never have gone over unless unless what well it was me really sam said i mean like he said adrian just thought it was someone pulled over to rest or look at a road map but you didnt why not i dont know really sam said its just that it was so early in the morning and she was a woman alone i thought we should make sure she was all right thats all she might have been attacked or upset or something maybe it was none of our business but you cant just leave can you walk on by a little color came to her cheeks as she spoke anyway when we got closer we could see she wasnt moving just staring down like that and it looked as if shed hit the wall i said we should go over and see what was wrong with her did you know she was dead when you looked through the window well said adrian ive never seen a dead person before but you can sort of tell cant you yes annie thought having seen far too many you can tell nobody home samantha gave a little shudder and seemed to melt deeper into adrians embrace and the flies she said what flies annie asked on her face and her arms flies she wasnt moving she wasnt even trying to swat them away i thought how much they must be tickling her annie swallowed were the windows open yes said samantha just like they are now we really didnt disturb anything i mean weve seen morse and frost on television im sure you have i just have to make certain i dont suppose you saw anyone heard any other cars or anything no what did you do when you found her rang the police adrian pulled a mobile from his pocket he wouldnt have had much luck with it around these parts a few months ago annie reflected but coverage had been improved a lot recently and theres nothing else you can tell me no look were just so devastated can we go home now i think sam needs a liedown and i could do with a strong cup of tea how long are you staying at greystone annie asked weve got another week stick around said annie we might want to talk to you again annie went back to rejoin hatchley and saw dr burnss gray audi arrive she greeted him and they walked over to the peugeot this would be a difficult examination for dr burns annie knew because the body was sitting upright in an enclosed space and he could hardly move it before dr glendenning the home office pathologist arrived she also knew that dr burns was aware the scenesofcrime officers would be eager to give the car a thorough goingover so he was being extra careful not to touch any surfaces and damage any possible prints even though he was wearing disposable gloves it was the police surgeons job only to determine and pronounce that the girl was dead the rest was up to the pathologist but annie knew that dr burns would like to give her some idea of time and cause if at all possible after feeling for a pulse and examining the womans eyes then listening for a heartbeat through his stethoscope dr burns confirmed that she was indeed dead the corneas havent clouded yet he said which means shes probably been dead less than eight hours im sure the flies have laid their eggs already which youd expect to happen quite soon in summer with the windows open but theres no sign of advanced insect activity another indication were dealing with a relatively recent death dr burns slipped off a glove and slid his hand inside the womans blouse under her arm best i can do as far as temperature is concerned he said noticing annies curious glance it does help give an approximation shes still warm which confirms that death occurred only a few hours ago it was a warm night said annie how long cant say exactly but id guess about five or six hours at the most he felt the womans jaw and neck rigors present where youd expect it to be and as the heat probably speeded that up were still working within much the same parameters annie looked at her watch between two and four in the morning then i wouldnt swear to it of course said dr burns with a smile but that sounds about right and dont tell dr glendenning ive been making wild guesses you know what hes like about that sort of thing any thoughts on cause of death thats a bit more difficult said dr burns turning to the body again there are no visible signs of strangulation either ligature or manual and no petechial hemorrhaging which youd expect with strangulation also no signs of a stab wound no blood that i can see at any rate itll have to wait until dr glendenning gets her on the table could it have been a heart attack or something like that it could have been heart attacks arent so common in healthy young women but if she had some sort of genetic disorder or preexisting condition lets say its within the realm of the possible but unlikely dr burns turned back to the body and probed gently here and there he tried to unloosen the womans hand from the steering wheel but couldnt thats interesting he said rigor hasnt progressed as far as the hands yet so it looks as if were dealing with cadaveric spasm what does it mean in this case dr burns stood up and faced annie it means she was holding the wheel when she died and the gear stick annie thought about the implications of that either the woman had just managed to pull into the layby when she died or she was trying to drive away from something or someone annie stuck her head through the car window uncomfortably aware of the closeness of the corpse and looked down one foot on the clutch the other on the accelerator gear stick in reverse and ignition turned on she reached out and touched the travel mug it felt cool as she moved back annie smelled just a hint of something vaguely sweet and metallic she told dr burns he frowned and leaned forward apologizing that he had no sense of smell gently he touched the womans hair and pulled it back to expose her ear then he gasped good lord he said look at this annie bent over and looked just behind the womans right ear was a tiny starshaped hole around which the skin was burned and blackened with a sootlike residue there wasnt much blood and what there was had been hidden by her long red hair annie was no expert but it didnt take an expert to realize that this was a gunshot wound fired from close quarters and if there was no gun in sight and the woman had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the gear stick then it could hardly have been a selfinflicted gunshot wound dr burns leaned through the window in front of the woman feeling the other side of her skull for signs of blood and an exit wound nothing he said no wonder we couldnt see anything the bullet must be still inside her skull he stepped away from the car as if washing his hands of the whole affair okay he said thats all i can do for now the rest is up to dr glendenning annie looked at him and sighed then she called hatchley over inform superintendent gristhorpe that weve got what looks very much like a murder on our hands and wed better get dr glendenning and the socos down here as soon as possible hatchleys face dropped annie knew why and she sympathized it was the weekend but all leave would be canceled sergeant hatchley probably had plans to go and watch the local cricket team and have a boozeup with the lads afterward but not now she wouldnt even be surprised if banks was called back depending on the scale of the investigation she looked down the road and her heart sank as she saw the first media vans arriving how quickly bad news travels she thought chapter two unaware of the excitement just a few miles down the road banks was up and around before eight oclock that morning coffee and newspaper on the table in front of him mild hangover held at bay by aspirin he hadnt slept at all well mostly because he had been waiting for the phone to ring and he hadnt been able to get that song penny cartwright had been singing out of his mind strange affair the melody haunted him and the lyrics with their images of death and fear troubled him his window framed a view of blue sky above the rising northern daleside and the gray flagstone roofs of helmthorpe about half a mile away at the valley bottom dominated by its church tower with the odd turret on one corner it was similar to his view from the wall by his old cottage just a slightly different angle but it failed to move him he could see that it was beautiful but he couldnt feel it there seemed to be something missing some connection or perhaps there was a sort of invisible shield or thick fog between him and the rest of the world and it dimmed the power of all he had held dear to move him in any way music landscape words on a page all seemed inert and impotent distant and unimportant since the fire had consumed his home and possessions four months ago banks had become withdrawn and taciturn he knew it but there was nothing he could do about it he was suffering from depression but knowing that was one thing changing it quite another it had started the day he left the hospital and went to look at the ruins of his cottage he hadnt been prepared for the scale of the damage roof gone windows burned out inside a shambles of charred debris nothing salvageable hardly anything even recognizable and it didnt help that the man who had done this had got away after a few days convalescing at gristhorpes lyndgarth farmhouse banks had found the flat and moved in some mornings he didnt want to get out of bed most nights he spent watching television any old rubbish and drinking he wasnt drinking too much but he was drinking steadily mostly wine and smoking again his withdrawal had driven the wedge even deeper between him and annie cabbot who desperately seemed to need something from him he thought he knew what it was but he couldnt give it to her not yet it had also cooled his relationship with michelle hart a detective inspector who had recently transferred to sex crimes and child protection in bristol much too far away to maintain a reasonable longdistance relationship michelle had her own problems too banks realized whatever it was that haunted her was always there always in the way even when they were laughing or making love theyd been good for each other for a while no doubt about it but now they were down to the just good friends stage that usually comes before the end it seemed as if the fire and subsequent spell in the hospital had put his life on pause and he couldnt find the play button even work when he got back to it had been boring consisting mostly of paperwork and interminable meetings that never settled anything only an occasional pint with gristhorpe or jim hatchley a chat about football or the previous evenings television had relieved the tedium his daughter tracy had visited as often as she could but she had been studying hard for her finals brian had dropped by a few times too and now he was in a recording studio in dublin with his band working on a new cd their first as the blue lamps had done okay but the second was slated for much bigger and better things more than once banks had thought of counseling only to reject the idea he had even considered that dr jenny fuller a consultant psychologist he had worked with on a number of cases might be able to help but she was on one of her extended teaching gigs australia this time and when he thought more about it the idea of jenny delving into the murky depths of his subconscious didnt hold a lot of appeal maybe whatever was there was best left there when it came down to it he didnt need any interfering shrink poking around in his mind and telling him what was wrong he knew what was wrong knew he spent too much time sitting around the flat and brooding he also knew that the healing process the mental and emotional process not merely the physical would take time and that it was something he had to do alone make his way step by weary step back to the land of the living no doubt about it the fire had burned much deeper than his skin it wasnt so much the pain hed endured that hadnt lasted long and he couldnt even remember most of it but the loss of all his worldly goods that had hit him the hardest he felt like a man adrift unanchored a helium balloon let float off into the sky by a careless child what was worse was that he thought he ought to be feeling a great sense of release of freedom from materialism the sort of thing gurus and sages spoke about but he just felt jittery and insecure he hadnt learned the virtue of simplicity from his loss had learned only that he missed his material possessions more than he ever dreamed he would though he hadnt yet been able to muster up the energy and interest to start replacing those items that could be replaced his cd collection his books and dvds he felt too weary to start again he had bought clothes of course comfortable functional clothes but that was all still he reflected munching on a slice of toast and marmalade as he scanned the reviews section of the newspaper things were definitely improving a little each day it was becoming easier to get out of bed on a morning and he had got into the habit of occasionally taking a walk up the daleside opposite his flat on a fine day finding the freshness and exercise invigorating he had also enjoyed penny cartwrights singing the previous night and was beginning to miss his cd collection a month or so ago he wouldnt even have bothered reading the reviews in the paper and now brother roy who hadnt even rung or visited him in the hospital had left a mysterious urgent message and had not called back for the third time since he got up that morning banks tried roys numbers he got the answering machine again the recorded voice telling him to leave a message and the mobile was still switched off unable to concentrate on the newspaper any longer banks checked his watch and decided to ring his parents they should be up by now there was just a chance that roy was there or that they knew what was going on he certainly seemed to keep in touch with them more than with banks his mother answered and sounded nervous to be getting a call so early in the day in her world banks knew earlymorning phone calls never meant good news alan what is it is there something wrong no mum banks said trying to put her at ease everythings fine youre all right are you still recovering still recovering said banks look mum i was wondering if our roy was there roy why would he be here the last time we saw roy was our anniversary last october you must remember you were here too i remember said banks its just that ive been trying to ring him his mothers voice brightened so you two are making it up at last thats good to hear yes said banks not wishing to disabuse his mother of that scrap of comfort its just that i keep getting his answering machine well hes probably at work you know how hardworking our roy is always got something or other on the go yes banks agreed usually something about two shades away from being criminal whitecollar though which didnt seem to count as crime to some people when banks thought about it he realized he really hadnt a clue what roy actually did to make his money only that he made a lot of it so you havent heard from him recently i didnt say that as a matter of fact he rang about two weeks ago just to see how your dad and i are doing like the implied rebuke wasnt lost on banks he hadnt rung his parents for a month did he have anything else to say not much except hes keeping busy he might be away you know have you thought about that he did say something about an important business trip coming up new york again i think hes always going there i cant remember when he said he was going though okay mum said banks thats probably where he is thanks very much ill wait a few days and call him when he gets back home you make sure you do alan hes a good lad is roy i dont know why you two havent been getting on better all these years we get along fine mum we just move in different circles thats all hows dad same as ever banks heard the rustle of a newspaper the daily mail his father read just so he could complain about the conservatives and a muffled voice in the background he says to say hello right said banks say hello back well take care of yourselves ill call again soon mind you do said bankss mother banks rang off tried roys both numbers once again but still no roy there was no way he was going to wait a few days or even hours from what he knew of roy under normal circumstances if he had buggered off somewhere and not bothered to ring back banks would have assumed he was sunning himself in california or the caribbean with a shapely young woman by his side that would be typical of him and his mefirst attitude as far as roy was concerned there was nothing in life you couldnt get through with a smile and a wad of cash but this was different this time banks had heard the fear in his brothers voice he deleted the message from his answering service threw a few clothes along with his toothbrush and razor into an overnight bag checked that the lights were out unplugged all the electrical items and locked the flat behind him he knew he wouldnt get any rest until he got to the bottom of roys odd silence so he might as well drive down to london and find out what was happening himself detective superintendent gristhorpe called the meeting in the boardroom of western area headquarters after lunch and di annie cabbot ds hatchley crime scene coordinator ds stefan nowak along with dcs winsome jackman kev templeton and gavin rickerd sat in the high stiffbacked chairs under the gaze of ancient wool barons with roast beef complexions and tight collars their notes and files were set in neat piles on the dark polished table beside styrofoam cups of tea or coffee pinned to corkboards on the wall by the door were peter darbys polaroids of the scene it was already hot and stuffy in the room and the small fan gristhorpe had turned on didnt do much good soon when the investigation got seriously under way more manpower would be allocated but these seven would remain the core team gristhorpe as senior investigative officer and annie who would do most of the fieldwork as his deputy and administrative officer rickerd would be office manager responsible for setting up and staffing the murder room hatchley would act as receiver there to weigh the value of every piece of information and pass it on for computer entry winsome and templeton would be the foot soldiers tacking down information and conducting interviews others would be appointed later statement readers action allocators researchers and the rest but for now it was of prime importance to get the system into place and into action it was no longer merely a suspicious death jennifer clewes if that was really the name of the victim had been murdered gristhorpe cleared his throat shuffled his papers and began by asking annie for a summary of the facts which she gave as succinctly as possible then he turned to ds stefan nowak any forensics yet its still early days said stefan so im afraid all i can give you at the moment is what we dont have go on well the road surface was dry and there are no discernible tire tracks from any other vehicle also we havent turned up any physical evidence discarded cigarette ends spent matches that sort of thing there are plenty of prints on the outside of the car so that will take vic manson a while to sort out but they could be anyones what about inside the car gristhorpe asked its in the police garage right now sir we should know something later today there is one thing yes it looks as if she was definitely forced off the road the left wing hit the drystone wall but there was no damage to the right wing at least not that i could see annie said thats right stefan agreed the car that forced her over didnt make physical contact pity we might have got some nice paint samples keep looking said gristhorpe anyway stefan went on whoever it was must have got in front of her and veered to the left rather than come at her directly from the side well said gristhorpe what do you do if a youre a woman alone and a car comes up fast behind you on a deserted country road at night id say either you take off like a bat out of hell or you slow down and let him get by and put as much distance as possible between the two of you said annie exactly only in this case he forced her over to the side of the road the gear stick annie said what gristhorpe asked the gear stick she was trying to get away she was trying to reverse thats the way it looks said stefan but she wasnt fast enough said annie no and she stalled do you think annie went on that there might have been two of them why asked gristhorpe stefan looked at annie and answered it was uncanny she thought how often their thoughts followed the same pathways i think di cabbot means he said that if the driver had to put on the brake unfasten his seat belt and pull out his gun before getting out those few seconds might have made all the difference yes said annie though why we should assume a murderer would be so lawabiding as to wear a seat belt is stretching it a bit and he may have already had his gun out and not bothered to turn off the ignition but if someone was there to leap out say someone in the back with his gun ready and no seat belt to unfasten then she wouldnt have had time to recover from the shock and get herself into reverse remember shed probably be panicking hmm said gristhorpe interesting and possible lets keep an open mind for the time being anything else not really said stefan the victims been taken to the mortuary and dr glendenning said he should be able to get around to the postmortem sometime this afternoon in the meantime it still looks very much as if death was due to a single gunshot wound above the right ear any ideas about the sort of weapon used weve found no trace of a cartridge so either our killer was smart and picked up after himself or he used a revolver at a rough estimate id say its probably a twentytwo caliber anything bigger would most likely have left an exit wound stefan paused we might not have had a lot of practice with gunshot wounds around these parts he said but our ballistics specialist kim grainger knows her stuff thats about it sir sorry we cant be a bit more helpful right now early days yet said gristhorpe keep at it stefan he turned to the rest of the group has anyone verified the womans identity yet he asked not yet said annie i got in touch with lambeth north it turns out their di at kennington is an old friend of mine dave brooke and he sent a couple of dcs to her address nobody home theyre keeping an eye on the place and there are no reports of her car being stolen no sir so its still more than within the realm of possibility that the registered keeper of the vehicle is the person found dead in it yes unless she lent her car to a friend or hasnt noticed its gone missing yet do we even know for certain that she was alone in the car gristhorpe asked no annie looked at stefan im assuming thats something theyll be able to help us determine down at the garage stefan nodded perhaps anyone run her name through our system i did sir said winsome name prints description nothing if she ever committed a criminal act we didnt catch her it wouldnt be the first time gristhorpe said all right first priority find out who she is and what she was doing on that road in the meantime i assume were already making doortodoor inquiries in the general area of the incident yes sir said annie problem is theres not much in the general area as you know it happened on a deserted stretch of road between the a and eastvale in the early hours of the morning weve got people going from house to house but theres nothing except a few holiday cottages and the occasional farmhouse within a mile each way of the car nothings turned up so far nobody heard the shot not so far an ideal place for a murder then gristhorpe commented he scratched his chin annie could see by the stubble that he hadnt shaved that morning hadnt combed his unruly hair by the looks of it either still personal grooming sometimes took backstage when it came to the urgency of a murder investigation at least as far as the men were concerned kev templeton was far too vain of course to look anything but his gelled athletic and trendy best not to mention cool as antarctica but jim hatchley had definitely taken a leaf out of gristhorpes book gavin looked like a train spotter right down to the national health specs held together over his nose by a plaster winsome was immaculate in pinstripe navy trousers and matching waistcoat over a white scallopneck blouse and annie felt rather conservative in her plain pastel frock and linen jacket she also felt unpleasantly sweaty and hoped it didnt show finding herself doodling a cartoon of kev templeton in full seventies gear complete with the afro and tight gold lamé shirt annie dragged herself away from her sartorial musings admonishing herself once again for having difficulty concentrating these days and got back to the matter in hand jennifer clewes gristhorpe was asking her a question and annie realized she had missed it sorry sir gristhorpe frowned at her i said do we have any idea where the victim was driving from no sir said annie then perhaps we should set about canvassing allnight garages shops open late that sort of thing if the victim really is jennifer clewes annie said hoping to make up for her lapse in concentration then the odds are that she came from london as the road she was found on leads to and from the a which connects with the m that makes it even more likely motorway service stations then kevin templeton suggested good idea dc templeton said gristhorpe ill leave that to you shall i wouldnt it be better to get the local forces on it sir thatll take too much time and coordination we need results fast better if you do it yourself tonight just what i always fancied templeton grumbled driving up and down the m sampling the local cuisine gristhorpe smiled well it was your idea and i hear they do a very decent bacon panini at woodall anything else dc jackman mentioned that there had been a similar crime some months ago annie said gristhorpe looked at winsome jackman eyebrows raised oh yes sir said winsome i checked the details its not quite as similar as it appears on first glance even so said gristhorpe i think wed like to hear about it it was near the end of april the twentythird the young womans name was claire potter aged twentythree lived in north london she set off at about eight oclock on a friday evening to spend the weekend with friends in castleton she never got there her car was found in a ditch by the side of a quiet road north of chesterfield by a passing motorist the following morning and her body was found nearby raped and stabbed the way it looks is that her car was forced into a ditch by her assailant the pathologist also found traces of chloroform and characteristic burning around her mouth where was she last seen trowell services nothing on the service stations closedcircuit tv asked gristhorpe apparently not sir i had a brief chat with di gifford at derbyshire cid and the impression i got was that theyve reached a dead end no witnesses from the cafeteria or garage nothing the mo is different too annie pointed out yes said gristhorpe jennifer clewes was shot not stabbed and she wasnt sexually interfered with at least not as far as we know but you think there could be some connection dc jackman well sir mused winsome there are some similarities stopping at the services being forced off the road a young woman there could be any number of reasons why he didnt assault her this time and he could certainly have acquired a gun since his last murder maybe he didnt enjoy stabbing maybe it was just a bit too up close and personal for him okay said gristhorpe good work well keep an open mind last thing we want is to let a serial killer slip through our hands because we dont see the connection i take it youll be activating holmes yes sir said winsome the home office large major enquiry system was an essential tool in any major investigation every scrap of information was entered into the computer and connections were made in ways even a trained officer might easily miss good gristhorpe stood up okay any there was a knock at the door and gristhorpe called out come in dr wendy gauge dr glendennings new and enigmatic assistant stood there looking as composed as ever that mysterious selfcontained smile lingering around her lips the way it always did even when she was bent over a corpse on the table rumor had it that dr gauge was being groomed as glendennings successor when the old man retired and annie had to admit that she was good yes said gristhorpe wendy gauge moved forward ive just come from the mortuary she said we were removing the victims clothing and i found this in her back pocket she handed over a slip of lined paper clearly torn from a notebook of some sort which she had thoughtfully placed in a transparent plastic folder her killer must have taken everything else from the car dr gauge went on but well her jeans were very tight and she was you know sitting on it annie could have sworn dr gauge blushed gristhorpe examined the slip of paper first then frowned and slid it down the table for the others to see annie could hardly believe her eyes but there scrawled in blue ink and followed by directions from the motorway and a crude map of helmthorpe were a name and address alan banks newhope cottage beckside lane gratly near helmthorpe north yorkshire by the time his colleagues back in eastvale were speculating as to what his name and address were doing in a murder victims back pocket banks was in london making his way through the earlysaturday afternoon traffic past the posh restaurants and maserati showrooms toward his brother roys south kensington house just east of the gloucester road it was years since he had driven in london and the roads seemed more crowded than ever he had never seen where roy lived before he realized as he drove under the narrow brick arch and parked in the broad cobbled mews he got out and looked at the whitewashed brick exterior of the house with its integral garage next to the front door and a mullioned bay window above it didnt look big but that didnt matter these days a house like this in this location would probably fetch eight hundred k or more on todays market banks reckoned maybe even a million and a hundred k of that youd be paying for the privilege of having the word mews in your address all the houses stood cheek by jowl but each was different in some detail height facade style of windows garage doors wroughtiron balconies and the overall effect was of quiet almost rural charm a nook hidden away from the hurlyburly that was literally just around the corner there were houses on all three sides of the culdesac and the red brick archway only wide enough for one car led to the main road helping to isolate the mews from the world outside beyond the houses at the far end a tower block and a row of distant cranes angled like alien birds of prey marred the view of a clear sky there were hardly any other cars parked in the mews as most of the houses had private garages the few cars that were on display were bmws jaguars and mercedes and bankss shabby little renault looked like a poor relation not for the first time the thought crossed his mind that he needed a new car it was a hot morning for june hotter here than up north and he took off his jacket and slung it over his shoulder first he checked the number against his address book it was the right house next he pressed the doorbell and waited nobody came perhaps banks thought the bell didnt work or couldnt be heard upstairs but he remembered hearing it buzz on roys phone message he knocked on the door still no answer he knocked again occasionally a car would pass by the archway on old brompton road but otherwise the area was quiet after knocking one last time banks tried the door to his surprise it opened banks could hardly believe it from what he remembered roy had always been securityconscious fiercely protective of his possessions had probably been born that way one of the first things he had done as soon as he was old enough was save up his pocket money to buy a padlock for his toy box and woebetide anyone caught touching his bike or his scooter banks examined the lock and saw that it was the deadbolt kind which you had to use a key both to open and to close behind the door were a copy of that mornings times and a few letters bills or junk there was the keypad of a burglaralarm system just inside the hall but it hadnt been activated to the left was a small sitting room rather like a doctors waiting room with a beige threepiece suite and a low glasstopped coffee table on which lay a neat pile of magazines banks flipped through them mostly business and hitech between the sitting room and the kitchen at the back of the house ran a narrow passage with a door on the right near the front leading to the garage banks peeked in and saw that roys porsche was parked there the car was locked the bonnet cold back in the house banks took the door that led to a narrow flight of stairs he stood at the bottom and called roys name no reply the house was silent except for the myriad daily sounds we usually tune out distant traffic the hum of a refrigerator the ticking of a clock a tap dripping somewhere old wood creaking banks shuddered someone had just walked over his grave his mother would say he couldnt put his finger on what it was but he felt a distinct tingling up his spine fear there was no one in the house he was reasonably sure of that but perhaps someone was watching the place banks had learned to trust his instincts over the years even if he hadnt always acted on them and he sensed that he would have to move carefully he walked into the kitchen which looked as if it had never been used for anything but making tea and toast the whole downstairs sitting room passage and kitchen was painted in shades of blue and gray the paint smelled fresh a couple of framed photographs in highcontrast blackandwhite hung in the passage one was a female nude curled on a bed the other a hill of brickterraced houses leading down to a factory its chimneys smoking cobbles and slate roofs gleaming after rain banks was surprised he hadnt known that roy was interested in photography or in art of any kind but then there was so much he didnt know about his estranged brother in the kitchen stood a small rustic wooden table with two matching chairs surrounded by the usual array of countertops toaster storage cupboards fridge oven and microwave the table was clear apart from an opened bottle of amarone with the cork stuck back in and half hidden behind the bottle a mobile phone banks picked up the phone it was off so he turned it on it was an expensive model the kind that sends and receives digital images and there was plenty of battery power left he tried the voice mail and text functions but the only messages were the ones he had left was roy the kind of person who would forget to take his mobile with him when he went out under normal circumstances especially as he had given banks the number banks doubted it the same way he doubted that roy would deliberately leave his front door unlocked or forget to turn on his burglar alarm unless he was really rattled by something a wine rack stood on one of the counters and even banks could tell that the wines there were very highend clarets chiantis and burgundies above the rack hung a ring of keys on a hook one of them looked like a car key banks put them in his pocket he checked the fridge it was empty except for some margarine a carton of milk and a piece of moldy cheddar that confirmed it roy was no gourmet cook he could afford to eat out and there were plenty of good restaurants on old brompton road the back door was locked and the window looked out on a small backyard and an alley beyond before going upstairs banks went back to the garage to see if the car key on the ring fit the porsche as he had suspected it did banks opened the drivers door and got in he had never sat in such a car before and the luxurious leather upholstery embraced him like a lover he felt like putting the key in the ignition and driving off somewhere anywhere but that wasnt why he was here the cars interior smelled clean and fresh with that expensive hint of leather from what banks could see there were no empty crisp packets or pop cans on the backseat or cellophane wrappers on the floor nor was there one of those fancy gps gadgets that would tell banks what roys last destination had been in the side pocket was a small aa road atlas open to the page with reading in the bottom right and stratforduponavon at the top left there was nothing else except the cars manual and a few cds mostly classical banks got out and checked the boot it was empty next banks ventured upstairs a much larger living space than downstairs because it extended over the garage at the top of the stairs he found himself on a small landing with five doors leading off the first led to the toilet the second to a modern bathroom complete with power shower and whirlpool bath there were the usual shaving and dentalcare implements aspirin and antacid and rather more varieties of shampoo conditioner and body lotions than banks imagined roy would need he also wouldnt need the pink plastic disposable razor that sat next to the gel for sensitive skin not unless he shaved his legs at the back was a bedroom simple and bright with flowerpatterned wallpaper double bed duvet dressing table drawers and a small wardrobe full of clothes and shoes everything immaculate roys clothing ran the gamut from expensive casual to expensive business banks noticed looking at the labels armani hugo boss paul smith and there were also a few items of womens clothing including a summer dress a black evening gown levis an assortment of shortsleeve tops and several pairs of shoes and sandals the drawers revealed a few items of jewelry condoms tampons and a mix of mens and womens underwear banks didnt know whether roy was into crossdressing but he assumed the female items belonged to his girlfriend of the moment and as there was nowhere near enough womens paraphernalia to indicate that a woman actually lived there she probably just kept a few clothes along with the items in the bathroom for when she stayed over banks remembered the young girl who had been with roy the last time they met she had looked about twenty shy with short shaggy black hair streaked with blond a pale pretty face and beautiful eyes the color and gleam of chestnuts in october she also had a silver stud just below her lower lip she had been wearing jeans and a short woolly jumper exposing a couple of inches of bare flat midriff and a navel with a ring in it they were engaged banks remembered her name was colleen or connie something like that she might know where roy had gone banks could probably trace her from roys mobiles phone book of course there was no guarantee that she was still roys fiancée or that the clothes and toiletry items were hers next to the bedroom and quite a bit larger was what appeared to be roys office furnished with filing cabinets a computer monitor fax machine printer and photocopier again everything was shipshape no untidy piles of paper or yellow postit notes stuck on every surface as in bankss office the desk surface was clear apart from an unused writing tablet and an empty glass of red wine the dregs hardening to crystal on a bookcase just above the desk were the standard reference books atlas dictionary dunn and bradstreet whos who roy certainly kept his life in order and banks remembered that he had been a tidy child too after playing he had always put his toys carefully away in their box and locked it his room even when he was a teenager was a model of cleanliness and tidiness he could have been in the army bankss room on the other hand had been the same sort of mess hed seen in most teens bedrooms on missing persons cases hed known where everything was his books were in alphabetical order for example but he had never fussed much about making his bed or tidying the pile of discarded clothes left on the floor another reason his mother had always favored roy banks wondered if roys computer would tell him anything the flatpanel monitor stood on the desk but banks was damned if he could find the computer itself it wasnt on or under the desk or on the shelf behind there were a keyboard and a mouse but keyboard mouse and monitor were no use without the computer even a novice like banks knew that given roys interest in electronic gadgets banks would have expected a laptop too but he could find no signs of one nor a handheld he remembered roy showing off a flashy new palm one of those gadgets that do everything but fry your eggs in the morning at the party last year needless to say there was nothing so remotely useful as a filofax roy would keep all that information on his computer and his palm and it seemed that they were both gone still banks had the mobile and that ought to prove a fruitful source of contact numbers there was a nikon coolpix digital camera in one of the pigeonholes behind the computer desk banks knew a little about digital cameras though his cheap canon was well below roys range he managed to switch it on and figured out how to look at the images on the lcd screen but there was no memory card in it no images to see he searched around the adjoining pigeonholes for some sort of imagestorage device but found nothing that was another puzzle he realized all the things you expect to find around a computer zip drive tape backups or cds were all conspicuous in their absence there was nothing left but the monitor mouse and keyboard and an empty digital camera one other gadget remained a g ipod another little electronic toy banks had thought of buying he dipped in at random hearing snatches of arias here and a bit of an overture there banks had always thought his brother a bit of a philistine didnt know he was an opera buff that they might have something in common from what he could remember when banks had been into dylan the who and the stones roy had been a hermans hermits fan one of the songs banks stumbled across was didos lament from purcells dido and aeneas and he found himself listening for just a little longer than he needed feeling a lump in his throat and that burning sensation at the back of his eyes he always got when he heard when i am laid in earth the upsurge of emotion surprised him another good sign he had felt little or nothing since the fire and thought that was because he had nothing left to feel with it was encouraging to have at least a hint that there was life in the old boy yet he browsed through the ipods contents and found a lot of good stuff bach beethoven verdi puccini rossini there was a complete ring cycle but nobodys perfect thought banks least of all roy still the extent of his good taste was a surprise the telephone was like a mini computer system in itself banks managed to dial and find out that the last incoming call was the one he had made himself that morning before setting off for london roy hadnt subscribed to the extra service that gave the numbers of the last five callers banks realized it probably didnt matter as he had called at least five times himself the phone was hooked up to a digital answering machine and after a bit of dodgy business with the buttons banks discovered three messages all from him the other times he had called he hadnt bothered leaving one banks thought he heard a sound from somewhere inside the house he sat completely still and waited what if roy came back and found banks going through his personal things and business records how would banks talk his way out of that one on the other hand banks would be relieved to see roy and surely roy would understand how his phone call had set off alarm bells in the mind of his policeman brother nevertheless it would be embarrassing all around a minute or two passed and he heard nothing more so he put it down to one of the many sounds an old house makes banks opened the desk drawers the two bottom ones held folders full of bills and tax records none of which seemed in any way unusual at a casual glance and the top drawers were filled with the usual stuff of offices adhesive tape rubber bands paper clips scissors scratch pads staplers and printer cartridges the shallow central drawer contained pens and pencils of all shapes and sizes banks stirred them around with his hand and one struck his eye it was thicker and shorter than most of the other pens squat and rectangular in shape rather than round thinking it might be some kind of marker he picked it up and unclipped the top it wasnt a pen where the nib should have been instead there was a small rectangle of metal that looked as if it plugged into something but what a computer most likely banks put the top back on and clipped it in his shirt pocket the last door led to a large living room above the garage it was the front room with the bay window banks had noticed from the street the color scheme here was different reds and earth colors a desert theme there were more framed blackandwhite photographs on the walls too and banks found himself wondering if roy had taken them himself he didnt know whether you could take blackandwhite photos of that quality with a digital camera but maybe you could he could still dredge up no memory of his brothers interest in photography as far as banks knew roy hadnt even belonged to the camera club at school and most kids did that at some time in the vain hope that whoever ran it would sneak in a nude model one day this room like the rest of house was clean and tidy not a speck of dust or an abandoned mug anywhere banks doubted roy cleaned it himself more likely he employed a cleaning lady even the entertainment magazines on the table were stacked parallel to the edge hercule poirot style a luxurious sofa bed sat under the window facing the other wall where a fortytwoinch widescreen plasma tv hung wired up to a satellite dish and a dvd player on looking more closely banks noticed that the player also recorded dvds under the screen stood a subwoofer and a front center speaker and four smaller speakers were strategically placed around the room it was an expensive setup one that banks had often wished he could afford banks walked to the fitted wall cabinets and cast his eye over the selection of dvds and cds what he saw there puzzled him not for roy the latest james bond or terminator movie not schoolgirl porn or jenna jameson but fellinis kurosawas ran and throne of blood herzogs fitzcarraldo bergmans the seventh seal and truffauts the four hundred blows there were some films that banks could see himself watching the godfather the third man and a clockwork orange but most of them were foreignlanguage art films classics of the cinema there were a few rows of books too mostly nonfiction on subjects ranging from music and cinema to philosophy religion and politics another surprise in a small recess stood one framed family photograph banks studied roys large collection of operas on both dvd and cd the magic flute tosca otello lucia di lammermoor and others a complete bayreuth ring cycle the same as the one on the ipod there was also a little fifties jazz and a few hollywood musicals oklahoma south pacific seven brides for seven brothers but no pop at all except for the blue lampss debut banks was pleased to see that roy had bought brians cd even though he probably hadnt listened to it he slid it out and opened the case wondering what it would sound like on roys expensive stereo system instead of the familiar blue image on the cd he saw the words cd rewritable and that the disk held megabytes or minutes of playing time banks stuck the cd in his jacket pocket and went over to sit on the sofa several remotecontrol devices rested on the arm and when he had worked out which was which he switched on the tv and amp just to see what the setup looked and sounded like it was a european football game and the picture quality was stunning the sound of the commentary loud enough to wake the dead he turned it off banks went back into the office and took the writing tablet from the desk and a pen from the drawer and carried them down to the kitchen with him at the kitchen table he sat down and wrote a note explaining that hed been to the house and would be back in case roy returned while he was out and asked him to get in touch as soon as possible he wished now that he had thought to bring his mobile so he could leave a number but it was too late he had left it on his living room table next to his unused portable cd player having got out of the habit of using it over the past few months then he realized he could take roys he wanted to check through the entries in the phone book anyway so he might as well have the use of it in case roy needed to get in touch with him he added this as a ps to the note then he put the mobile in his pocket on his way out he tried the most likelylooking key and found it fit the front door chapter three what do you make of it annie gristhorpe asked they were sitting in the superintendents large carpeted office just the two of them and the sheet of paper lay between them on gristhorpes desk it wasnt bankss writing annie was certain but beyond that the whole thing was a puzzle she had certainly never seen the dead woman before nor had she ever heard banks mention anyone called jennifer clewes that in itself meant nothing of course she realized in the first place it might not be her real name and in the second banks may well have been keeping many aspects of his life from her including a new girlfriend but if she was his girlfriend why did she need directions and his address perhaps she had never visited him in gratly before was she new on the scene annie doubted it the way banks had been behaving lately withdrawn moody and uncommunicative was hardly conducive to pulling a new girlfriend who would take him on the shape he was in and this woman was young enough to be his daughter not that age had ever stopped a man but perhaps even more important was that she had ended up with a bullet in her head knowing banks had its dangers as annie well knew but it was not usually fatal i dont know sir id say the most likely explanation is that its her own writing maybe she copied it down over the phone well be able to find out for sure when we get a sample of jennifer clewess writing have you been able to get in touch with dci banks hes not at home and his mobiles turned off ive left messages well lets just hope he gets one of them and rings back id really like to know why a young woman was driving up from london to see him in the middle of the night and ended up with a bullet in her head he could be anywhere annie said he is on holiday after all he didnt tell you where he was going he doesnt tell me much these days sir gristhorpe frowned and scratched his chin then he leaned back in his big padded chair and linked his hands behind his head hows he doing he asked im the last person to ask sir we havent really talked much since the fire i thought you two were friends i like to think we are but you know alan hes hardly the type to open up when he doesnt want to i think perhaps he still blames me for what happened the fire and all after all phil keane was my boyfriend whatever the reason hes been very quiet lately to be honest i think its partly depression as well i cant say im surprised it happens sometimes after illness or an accident about all you can do is wait till the fog disperses what about you me im fine sir coping annie was aware how tight and unconvincing her voice sounded but she could do nothing about it anyway she was coping after a fashion she certainly wasnt depressed just hurt and angry and perhaps a little distracted gristhorpe held her gaze for just long enough to make her feel uncomfortable then he said we need to find out why the victim had alans address in her back pocket and we cant ask her theres a flatmate sir said annie the lads from lambeth north got bored with hanging around outside and went in for a look jennifer clewes was sharing with a woman called kate nesbit at least there were letters there addressed to a kate nesbit and a jennifer clewes have they talked to this flatmate shes not home work on a saturday maybe or she might have gone away for the weekend gristhorpe looked at his watch better get down there annie he said let your old pal at kennington know youre on your way find the flatmate and talk to her yes sir annie stood up there is one other thing yes annie gestured toward the scrap of paper this address i mean it is alans address but its not where hes living now i noticed that said gristhorpe you think it might be significant well sir annie said hand on the doorknob hes been living at that flat in the old steadman house for four months now youd think everyone who knew him knew him at all well at any rate would know that i mean if it was a new girlfriend or something why give her his old address youve got a point gristhorpe scratched the side of his nose what action do you think we should take about dci banks yes gristhorpe paused you say hes not answering his phones thats right neither his home phone nor his mobile we need to find him as soon as we can but i dont want to make it official yet ill get winsome to ring around his family and friends see if anyone knows where he is i was thinking of dropping by dci bankss place both of them just to have a look around you know make sure nothings been disturbed good idea said gristhorpe are you sure youre all right on this annie looked over her shoulder of course i am sir she said why shouldnt i be out in the street banks tried knocking on a couple of neighbors doors but only one answered an elderly man who lived in the house opposite i saw you going into roys the man said i was wondering if i should ring the police banks took out his warrant card im roys brother he said and i am the police the man seemed satisfied and stuck out his hand malcolm farrow he said as banks shook hands pleased to meet you come inside i dont want to intrude on your time but think nothing of it now im retired every days the same to me come in well have a snifter banks followed him into a living room heavy with dark wood and antiques farrow offered brandy but banks took only soda much too early in the afternoon for spirits what can i do for you mr banks farrow asked alan please its about roy what about him lovely fellow that brother of yours by the way couldnt wish for a better neighbor you know cheerful considerate capital fellow thats good to know said banks judging by the slight slur in his voice and the network of purplish veins around his bulbous nose that malcolm farrow had already had a snifter or two i was just wondering if you had any idea where hes gone you mean hes not back yet apparently not did you see him leave yes it was about half past nine last night i was just putting the cat out when i saw him going out just after the phone call banks realized was he alone no there was another man with him i said hello and roy returned my greeting like i said you couldnt wish for a more friendly neighbor this other man said banks did you get a good look at him afraid not it was getting dark by then you see and the street lightings not very bright besides to be perfectly honest i cant say my eyesights quite what it used to be probably pissed to the gills too banks thought if today was anything to go by anything at all you can remember he said well he was a burly sort of fellow with curly hair fair or gray im sorry i didnt notice any more than that i only noticed because he was facing me at first for a moment while roy had his back turned why did roy have his back turned he was locking the door very securityconscious roy is you have to be these days dont you i suppose so said banks wondering how the door had come to be unlocked and the burglar alarm unarmed when he got there where did they go got in a car and drove off it was parked outside roys house what kind of car im not very good with cars havent driven in years so i havent taken much of an interest it was light in color i can tell you that much and quite big looked expensive and they just drove off yes had you see the man before i might have if it was the same one was he a frequent visitor i wouldnt say frequent but id seen him a couple of times usually after dark so im afraid i cant do any better with the description was either of them carrying anything like what anything suitcase cardboard box not that i could see that meant that roys computer equipment must have been taken later by someone with a key you didnt see or hear anyone else call after that did you sorry my bedrooms at the back of the house and i still manage to sleep quite soundly despite my age im glad to hear it said banks look is there something going on you say roys not come home its probably nothing banks said not wanting to worry farrow he put his tumbler of soda down and stood up you know ill bet they went off to some pub or other had a bit too much theyre more than likely back at the other blokes place right now still sleeping it off it is saturday after all he started moving toward the door i suppose youre right said farrow following but its not like him especially as hed only just got in pardon said banks pausing in the doorway well hed just come back in oh not more than ten or fifteen minutes earlier about quarter past nine i saw his car watched him park it in the garage i must say he seemed in a bit of a hurry the phone call to banks had been timed at pm which meant that roy had rung him a short while after he had arrived home where had he been what was it he couldnt talk about over the telephone while he was on the phone someone had come to his door and a few minutes later roy had gone out again most likely with the man who had rung his doorbell where had they gone thank you for your time mr farrow said banks i wont trouble you any longer no trouble you will let me know wont you if you hear anything of course said banks and why shouldnt i be all right with it annie thought as she parked at the top of the hill and walked toward the old steadman house any romantic involvement shed had with banks was ancient history so what did it matter whether he was seeing this jennifer clewes except that she was dead and banks had disappeared annie paused a moment on the bridge it was one of those earlysummer days when the world seemed dipped in sunshine and life should be simple yet for annie it was not without a tinge of melancholy like the first sight of brown on the edges of the leaves and she found her thoughts turning to the unresolved problems that haunted her there was a time she remembered when banks had just come out of the hospital that there was so much she wanted to say to him to explain to apologize for being such a fool but he wouldnt let her get close so she gave up in the end they simply carried on working together as if nothing of any consequence had happened between them but something had happened phil keane annies boyfriend had tried to kill banks had drugged him and set fire to his cottage annie and winsome had dragged him out in time to save his life and phil had disappeared officially it wasnt annies fault no blame how could she have known but she should have known she kept telling herself she should have recognized the signs banks had even hinted but she had put it down to jealousy she had never been so wrong about anything or anyone before shed screwed up relationships of course but that sort of thing happened to everyone nothing like this complete and utter humiliation and it made her angry she was a detective for christs sake she was supposed to have an instinct for people like phil keane she should have sussed him out herself in some ways what had happened to her was worse than the rape she had endured over three years ago this was total emotional rape and it stained her soul because she had loved phil keane though she loathed to admit it to herself now the very thought of him running his hands over her body pleasuring her penetrating her made her feel sick how could she have seen no deeper than the charm the good looks the keen intelligence that allembracing energy and enthusiasm for life that made her and everyone else in his presence feel special singled out for grace well she knew now that beneath the charm was an immeasurable and impenetrable darkness the lack of conscience of a psychopath fused with the motivating greed of a common thief and a love of the game an enjoyment of deceit and causing humiliation for their own sakes but was his charm merely on the surface the more annie thought about it the more she came to believe that phils charm was not simply a matter of surface veneer that it was deeply rooted in the rest of his being a tumor inseparable from the evil at his core you couldnt just scratch the surface and see the terrible truth beneath the surface was as true as anything else about him such speculations shouldnt be allowed on a fine day like this annie told herself battening down the anger that rose like bile in her throat whenever she thought about phil and what had happened last winter but ever since then she had been searching for a hint as to where he might have gone she read all the boring police circulars and memos she used to ignore pored over newspapers and watched tv news looking for a clue an unexplained fire somewhere a businessman conned out of his fortune a woman used and cast aside anything that fit the profile she had compiled in her mind but after nearly six months all she had was one false lead a fire in devizes that turned out to have been caused by careless smoking she knew he was around somewhere though and when he made his move as he surely would then she would have him a young boy in short trousers shirt hanging out sat on the bank of gratly beck fishing hed be lucky to catch anything in such fastflowing water annie thought he waved when he saw her watching him annie waved back and hurried on to the steadman house after checking out both banks flat and his cottage she would have to hurry to darlington to catch a train to london the three twentyfive would get her into kings cross just after six all being well it would be quicker than driving and she didnt fancy negotiating her way through the central london traffic all the way south of the river to kennington she would leave her car at darlington station annie passed the tiny sandemanian chapel and overgrown graveyard and walked down the path to the holiday flats two houses had been knocked into one the insides refinished to make four spacious selfcontained flats two up two down she knew banks had one window that looked out on the graveyard because he had mentioned how apt that seemed but she hadnt been inside he hadnt invited her though she knew it was futile annie rang bankss doorbell a tiredlooking young woman holding a baby to her breast opened the door to the downstairs flat having no doubt noticed annie walking up the garden path its no use she said hes out when did he leave annie asked who wants to know annie pulled her warrant card from her handbag im a colleague of his she explained theres something important i need to talk to him about the woman looked at her card but she obviously wasnt impressed well hes out she said again when did he leave annie repeated about eight oclock this morning just drove off did he say where he was going not to me and i wouldnt expect him to do you own these flats me and my husband we live in this one and rent out the others why i was wondering if i might have a look around i assume you have a spare key you cant do that its private the baby stirred made a few tentative burps she rubbed its back and it fell silent again look said annie this really is important i dont want to keep you here i can see you have the baby to deal with but id really appreciate it if youd let me have a quick look in dci bankss flat it would be so much less trouble than if i had to go and get a search warrant search warrant can you do that yes i can oh all right i suppose she said its no skin off my nose is it just a minute she went inside and returned with two keys which she handed to annie ill be wanting them back mind she said of course said annie i wont be long she felt the womans eyes boring into her back as she opened the door to the upper level and walked up the staircase to the upper flat at the top she opened bankss door and found herself in a small hallway with pegs for jackets and raincoats and a small cupboard for shoes and heavier clothing a pile of junk mail sat on a table under a giltedged mirror the first door she opened led to the bedroom annie felt strange poking around bankss flat with him not there especially his bedroom but she told herself it couldnt be helped somehow or other he had become connected to a murder investigation and he was nowhere to be found there was nothing in the bedroom anyway except a double bed hastily made a few clothes in the dresser drawers and wardrobe and a cushioned window seat that looked out over the graveyard must be quite a pickup line annie thought if you fancied sharing your bed with someone come sleep with me beside the graveyard it had a sort of ring to it then she took her mind off images of shared beds and went into the living room on the low table in front of the sofa sat a mobile phone and a portable cd player with headphones so wherever banks had gone he had left these behind annie thought and wondered why banks loved his music and he liked to keep in touch at least he used to looking around the room she noticed there were no books and no cds except the copy of don giovanni a gift from the lads that she had brought him in the hospital the cellophane wrapper was still on it there wasnt even a stereo only a small tv set which probably came with the flat annie began to feel inexplicably depressed she tried bankss answering service but there were no messages the kitchen was tiny and narrow the fridge full of the usual items milk eggs beer cheese a selection of vegetables bacon tomatoes a bottle of sauvignon blanc and some sliced ham all of it looking fairly fresh well at least he was still eating a couple of cardboard boxes under the small dining table were filled with empty wine bottles ready for the bottle bank annie glanced briefly in the toilet and bathroom a quick look through the cabinets revealing only what she would have expected razor shaving cream toothpaste and toothbrush were missing so he must have taken them with him amid the usual overthecounter medication there was one small bottle of strong prescription painkillers dated three months ago wherever banks had gone he clearly hadnt thought he needed them she stood in the center of the hall wondering if she could possibly have missed something then realized there was nothing to miss this was the flat of a faceless man a man with no interests no passions no friends no life there werent even any family photos it wasnt bankss flat couldnt be not the banks she knew annie remembered newhope cottage and its living room with the blue walls and ceiling the color of melting brie remembered the warm shaded orange light and the evenings she had spent there with banks in winter a peat fire had usually burned in the hearth its tang harmonizing with the islay malt she sometimes sipped with him in summer they would often go outside after dark to sit on the parapet above gratly beck looking at the stars and listening to the water and there would always be music bill evans lucinda williams van morrison and string quartets she didnt recognize annie felt tears in her eyes and she brushed them away roughly and headed downstairs she handed back the keys without a word and hurried down the path banks sat in a pub on old brompton road playing with roys mobile learning what the functions were and how to use them he found a call list which gave him the last thirty incoming outgoing and missed calls some were just first names some numbers and quite a few of the incoming calls were unknown the last call had been made at on friday afternoon to james banks pressed the call button and listened to a phone ring finally someone picked it up and uttered a frazzled yeah banks could hear david bowie in the background singing moonage daydream can i speak to james he said speaking my brother roy banks rang you yesterday i was wondering what it was about thats right said james he was ringing to make an appointment for next wednesday i believe yeah here it is wednesday at half past two appointment for what a haircut im roys hairdresser why is everything okay banks rang off without answering at least roy had been certain enough at on friday afternoon of being around next wednesday to make an appointment with his hairdresser banks had never done such a thing in his life he went to a barbers and waited his turn like everyone else reading old magazines banks washed down the last of his curry of the day with a pint of pride lit a cigarette and looked around it was odd being in london again he had visited many times since he had left mostly in connection with cases he was working on but with each visit he came to feel increasingly like a stranger a tourist though he had once lived there for over fifteen years still that had been quite a while ago and things changed downatheel neighborhoods became desirable residences and oncechic areas went downhill villains pubs became locals for the trendy young crowd and upmarket pubs started to go to seed he had no idea what was in these days london was a vast sprawling metropolis and banks had never even when he was living there been familiar with it beyond notting hill and kennington places where he had lived and the west end where he had worked south kensington might have been another city as far as he was concerned he turned his mind to roys disappearance oblivious to the ebb and flow of conversation around him he would run through the rest of the call list later back at the house he also wanted to check out the data cd there were plenty of internet cafés around and some of them would even allow him to read a cd and print out material but they were far too public and anything he did would leave traces he had violated his brothers privacy but he felt he had good reason whereas there was no reason at all to risk making any of roys secrets known to strangers he realized he didnt know anyone in london who owned a computer most of the people he had known there criminals and coppers alike had either moved retired or died except sandra his exwife who had moved from eastvale to camden town when she left him sandra would probably have a computer but his last meeting with her had been disastrous and she had hardly been a constant visitor in his days of need in fact she hadnt visited at all merely sent her condolences through tracy then there was the husband sean and the new baby sinéad no he didnt think he would be paying any visits to sandra in the foreseeable future he also couldnt go official with what hed got for the same reason he couldnt use an internet café in case the disk held something incriminating against roy if roy had been up to something dodgy banks wasnt going to shop him not his own brother he might give him a damned good bollocking and read him the riot act when he found him but he wasnt going to help put him in jail there was one avenue he could explore first someone who would probably be as interested in protecting roys reputation as he was banks stubbed out his cigarette and reached into his pocket for the mobile he scrolled through the list of names and numbers in the phone book until he found corinne that was roys fiancées name he remembered now copying the number down into his notebook then he put the mobile back in his pocket finished his drink and walked out to the street london was hot and sticky of all the places to be during a heat wave this was not one he would have chosen people were wilting on the pavements and the air was redolent with the smell of exhaust fumes and worse like rotting meat or cabbage banks didnt want to tie up the mobile again in case roy got his message back at the house and phoned so he sought out a public phone box and dug out an old phone card from his wallet he felt as if he were walking into the tin hut where the japanese locked alec guinness in the bridge on the river kwai sweat trickled down his sides tickling as it ran sticking his shirt to his skin someone had crushed a bluebottle against the glass making a long smear of dark blood he could even smell the warm paper of the telephone directory banks took out his notebook and dialed the number he had copied from roys mobile just as he was about to hang up a breathless voice came on the line hello corinne yes who is it my names alan banks roys brother you might remember me we met at my parents wedding anniversary party in peterborough last october of course i remember look im down in london and i was wondering if we could get together somewhere and have a chat maybe over a drink or something there was a pause then she said are you asking me out no sorry im getting this all wrong please excuse me blame the heat i mean thats why i thought a drink might be a good idea somewhere cool if there is such a place yes it is hot isnt it what do you mean then im afraid i dont follow i just need to pick your brains thats all i remember youre a policeman arent you yes but thats not why i mean its nothing official well youve certainly got my attention you could come over to the flat she paused ive got an electric fan in the office have you got a computer yes why great said banks when would be convenient well ive got a meeting with a client this afternoon im afraid free weekends are never a given if youre an accountant out on your own but i should be done by early evening say five oclock banks looked at his watch it was half past three all right he said good have you got a pen and paper handy ill give you my address banks wrote down the address and listened to corinnes directions just off earls court road not far from roys at all then though another world entirely he thanked her again escaped the sweat box and headed back to the pub by the time annie had walked over the bridge and along the lane to bankss cottage she had just about succeeded in regaining her equilibrium the builders had got as far as restoring the roof from the outside the place looked perfectly normal and one might even think someone lived there if it werent for the lack of curtains and the overflowing skip because it was saturday there were no workmen around though given how slow they had been annie thought the least they could do was put in a few extra hours to help get banks back where he belonged after all theyd been on the job close to four months now it was the first time annie had been back there since the night of the fire and just seeing the place evoked painful memories the feel of the wet blanket shed wrapped around herself the fire bursting out as she broke the door open the smoke in her eyes and throat bankss dead weight as she dragged him toward the door winsomes strength as she helped them over the last few feet a distance annie thought she couldnt make alone lying there on the muddy ground sputtering looking at bankss still figure and fearing him dead and almost worst of all remembering phil keanes silver bmw disappearing up the hill as winsome had first turned into bankss drive she took a moment to bring herself back to the present jennifer clewes had bankss address in her back pocket but it was this address annie reminded herself why was that she noticed tire tracks in the dust but they could have been anyones the builders for example and despite the sign that said beckside lane was a culdesac and a private drive cars often turned into it by mistake even so she made certain not to disturb the tracks annie walked up to the front door of the cottage though the building wasnt finished inside she guessed that the builders would keep it locked to discourage squatters and because they might sometimes leave their expensive tools there overnight which was why the splintering around the lock immediately caught her attention she leaned closer and saw that it looked fresh the door was new and not yet painted and the splintered wood was clean and sharp annies protective gloves were back in the boot of her car so she used her foot to nudge open the door gently and kept her hands in her pockets inside the place was a mess but a builders mess not a burglars by the looks of it the rooms were divided and the ceiling beams in place and most of the plasterboarding had been finished except the wall between the living room and the kitchen it felt odd to be standing there smelling sawdust and sheared metal rather than peat smoke annie thought the stairs looked finished solid enough and after a tentative step she ventured up the oncefamiliar bedroom was a mere skeleton with builders calculations and blueprints scrawled on the walls in pencil the second bedroom was similarly bare annie went back downstairs and out to the lane as she walked away she turned once more and looked back someone had broken into the cottage and recently she assumed the builders had locked up when they left on friday though she would have to check with them to be certain it could have been thieves of course but that seemed too much of a coincidence annie realized that she would have to bring in stefan nowak and the socos to see if they could establish any links between jennifer clewess car and bankss cottage if it was the same person who had killed jennifer clewes annie reasoned then he must have got hold of bankss address by some other means because jennifer clewes had it in the back pocket of her jeans perhaps he already knew where banks lived and when he had guessed where she was going and when they had got to a desolate isolated stretch of road he had shot jennifer and then carried on to bankss cottage to do what kill him too it would certainly make more sense to handle them one at a time but banks hadnt been there hed been about a quarter of a mile away in his temporary flat had banks any idea of what was going on was that why he had taken off so early in the morning that was the big question annie realized heading back up the hill to her car how much did banks know and how safe was he now and she knew that she probably wouldnt find out the answer to either question until she found the man himself corinne lived in the firstfloor flat of a fourstory building overlooking the narrow street not more than fifty yards away from earls court road she looked different from the young girl banks had met at his parents he thought as she greeted him at the door and asked him in her hair was longer for a start almost down to her shoulders and it was blond with dark roots the little stud was gone from below her lip leaving a small flaw in her clear skin and she looked closer to thirty than to twenty she also seemed more selfpossessed more mature than banks remembered her come into the back she said thats where the office is an electric fan stood on the table by the open window slowly turning through about ninety degrees every few seconds sending out waves of lukewarm air it was better than nothing everyone seems to work at home these days banks said sitting in a winged armchair corinne sat at an angle to him crosslegged the way some women seem to prefer and he guessed that this was the space she used to discuss business when clients called at the house a jug of water thick with ice cubes sat on the table between them along with two tumblers corinne managed to stretch her upper body forward and pour them both a glass while remaining crosslegged quite a feat banks thought considering he couldnt even sit in that position comfortably in the first place but corinne seemed to move with a dancers grace and economy that spoke of pilates and yoga they say teas refreshing in hot weather she said but the thought of drinking anything hot doesnt have much appeal at the moment this is fine said banks thank you corinne was wearing a plain orange tshirt tucked into her jeans and she wore a celtic cross on a silver chain around her neck she was barefoot banks noticed and her toenails were unpainted occasionally as she talked or listened her heartshaped face would tilt to one side she would bite her lower lip and her fingers would stray to the cross sunlight gilded the leaves outside the window and their shadows danced pavanes over the pale blue walls stirred by the lightest of breezes well she said i must say you had me all intrigued on the telephone im sorry if i my fault entirely i wasnt being clear i hope you dont take me for the kind of man who goes chasing his brothers fiancée she gave a brief tight little smile that indicated to banks that perhaps all was not as it should be in the fiancée department but he let it go for the time being she would get to it in her own time if she wanted anyway he went on its roy i want to talk to you about what about him do you have any idea where he is what do you mean banks explained about the phone call roys absence and that the door had been left unlocked thats not like him she said frowning none of it is i can see why youd be worried anyway to answer your question no i dont know where he is do you think you should go to the police i mean i know you are the police but i know what you mean said banks no i dont think so not yet at any rate i dont think theyd be very interested roys a grownup there could still be a simple explanation do you know any of his friends not really there was another couple we used to go out with occasionally rupert and natalie but i dont think roy has a lot of close friends banks didnt miss the used to but he let it go for the moment there was a rupert in roys mobile phone book banks would ring him eventually along with the rest of the names do you know a burly man with curly gray or fair hair he asked he drives a big lightcolored car an expensive model corinne thought for a moment then she said no sorry rupert drives a slategray beemer and natalies got a little beetle runaround she turned up her nose a yellow one when did you last see roy a week last thursday she fingered the cross look i might as well tell you things havent been going all that well for us lately im sorry to hear that any particular reason i think hes been seeing someone else she gave a little shrug it doesnt matter really i mean its not as if it was serious weve only been going out about a year were not living together or anything but i thought you were supposed to be engaged i think that was part of the problem really i mean id brought it up and roys impulsive neither of us is ready for marriage yet we called it off went back to the way we were that was when the trouble started i dont suppose you can take a big step back like that and expect a relationship to continue the way it was can you so the engagement had been postponed or demoted to going steady and the relationship had cooled like banks and michelles little brother up to his usual tricks at least corinne was to be spared the indignity of being wife number four even so banks said it must still hurt im sorry have you any idea who hes seeing no i dont even know if im right for sure its just a feeling you know little things well banks thought there were a few possible names and numbers in roys mobile phone book and call list how recently he asked just these past few weeks and before that things were fine at least i thought they were was there anything bothering him when you saw him last nothing that i could see he seemed much the same as ever except yes well as i said little things things a woman notices forgetfulness distance distraction that wasnt like him but he wasnt depressed or worried about anything not that youd know i just thought he had someone else on his mind and hed rather be with her what about drugs banks asked what about them come off it dont tell me you and roy never snorted a line smoked a spliff so what if we did apart from its being illegal which well ignore for the moment when you get into the drug world you get to meet some nasty people did roy owe his dealer money for example look it wasnt much just recreational a gram on the weekends that sort of thing nothing more than he can easily afford all right said banks how much do you know about his business dealings a fair bit youre his accountant right roy takes care of his own books oh i thought that was how you met well yes said corinne he got audited and a friend recommended me to him she twirled her celtic cross most of my clients are in the entertainment business writers musicians artists nobody really bigleague but a few decent steady earners roy was a bit different to say the least but i needed the money and before you ask everything was aboveboard she narrowed her eyes roy once told me he was sure you thought he was a crook i dont think hes a crook banks said not being entirely truthful i think maybe he stretches the law a bit finds the odd loophole thats all plenty of businessmen do what im wondering though is whether he had any reason to run off was his business in trouble had he lost a lot of money made some errors in judgment no roys books were good enough for me and the tax man look ive seen his house said banks the porsche the plasma tv the gadgets roy obviously makes quite a lot of money somehow you said he makes it legitimately have you any idea how hes a financier he still plays the stock market to some extent but mostly he finances business ventures what kinds all kinds lately hes been specializing in technology and private health care here all over the place sometimes he gets involved in french or german operations he has connections in brussels the eu and in zurich and geneva he also spends a lot of time and energy in america he loves new york roys no fool he knows better than to put all his eggs in one basket thats one reason hes been so successful she paused you dont know your brother at all do you before banks could answer she went on hes a remarkable man in many ways a financier who can quote kierkegaard or schopenhauer at dinner but he never forgets where he came from the crushing poverty he dragged himself out of it made something of himself and its what drives him he never wants to end up like that again what kind of a line had roy been spinning corinne banks wondered their childhood hadnt been that bad admittedly she had only seen the relatively decent house his parents lived in now and not the backtoback terrace behind the brickworks where they had lived until banks was eleven and roy six but even then crushing poverty was pushing it a bit they had always been fed and clothed and never lacked for love bankss father had always been in work until the eighties what did it matter that the toilet had been outside down the street and the whole family had had to share a tin bathtub that they filled with kettles of water boiled on the gas cooker they were no different from thousands of other workingclass families in the fifties and sixties its true we were never very close banks admitted slapping a fly from the knee of his trousers what can i say it just happens that way sometimes we havent got that much in common oh i know all about that said corinne i cant stand my younger sister shes a snob and a miseryguts i dont hate roy i just dont know him very well and im worried hes in some sort of trouble banks remembered the cd he had found in roys blue lamps jewel case and slipped it out of his pocket i found this at roys he said i wonder if you could help me with it of course it didnt take corinne long to put the cd in her computer and bring up the list of contents the icons were jpegs of them in all some were merely numbered others had names like natasha kiki and kayla corinne opened her image viewer and set a slide show going banks was looking over her shoulder hand resting on the back of the chair when the images started coming up on the screen the first showed a naked woman with a mans erect penis in her mouth sperm dribbling down her chin a stoned look in her eyes the next showed the same man entering the woman from behind an obviously feigned look of ecstasy on her face after that came several photos of an extremely attractive blond teenager in various stages of undress and revealing positions that was enough corinne abruptly ended the slide show and ejected the disk i suppose that just goes to show that roy isnt much different from most men when you get right down to it she said moving away from the computer banks could see that her face was red she handed the disk back to him maybe youd like to keep this is that all thats on it he asked short of looking at all files to make sure id say thats a pretty good guess of course youre welcome to check them all out but not here if you dont mind i find that sort of thing a bit demeaning not to mention insulting well banks thought it had been worth a try though he had nothing at all against images of naked women either alone or with partners banks had seen enough of the sordid side of the porn business to know how bad it could get especially if children were involved from what he had seen though roys collection looked ordinary the girls of age if a little on the young side in a way it made him feel a bit closer to roy to find out that he was human after all the dirty devil if only their mother knew but then his policemans mind kicked in if roy had taken these images himself on a digital camera say rather than simply downloaded them from the internet then he could be involved in a sleazy business did roy have anything to do with internet porn he asked corinne forgetting that she might not be the best person to ask always ready to think the worst of him arent you she said i cant see why youre always so quick to leap to his defense after what hes done to you corinne flushed with anger believe it or not im trying to help said banks well youve got a funny way of showing it she looked toward the cd and made a face anyway theres your evidence for what its worth banks took the cd at some point he would examine it more closely study each of the images just to make sure hotel rooms and outdoor locations had been identified from background features in internet porn one victim of child pornography in america had been identified from a blurredout school logo on her tshirt if roy had taken any of these pictures there was a chance of finding out where he had taken them and who the models were should it come to that but not here not now he had just about run out of questions to ask corinne and he could see that she had become edgy anxious for him to leave whether it was the effect of the images on the cd or something else he definitely felt that he had outstayed his welcome but he remembered the penlike object he had found in roys office drawer maybe corinne knew what it was he took it out of his shirt pocket and held it out to her any idea what this is corinne took the object from banks eyed it closely and removed the cap its a portable miniusb drive for storing information like that cd same idea but not quite as much space this ones only got megs not handy though you can clip it in your inside pocket just like a pen can we see whats on it corinne clearly wasnt comfortable delving into roys private affairs especially after what she had just seen on the cd banks had been at his job for so long that he had got used to digging deep into a persons private life as far as the police were concerned there are no secrets especially in a murder investigation he often didnt like what he found but hed developed a tolerance for peoples little quirks over the years most people when you get past their facade of normality have some sort of guilty secret something theyve tried to keep from the rest of the world and banks had come across most of them in his time from the harmless hoarders of newspapers and magazines whose homes were like labyrinths of tottering columns of print to the secret crossdressers and lonely fetishists of course they were all grief and horrorstricken humiliated that someone had found out their little secrets but to banks it was nothing special corinnes reaction made him realize for the first time in a while that what he did was unnatural and invasive in the short time he had been with her he had as good as implied that her exfiancé his brother was involved in drugs illicit sex and fraud all in a days work for him perhaps but not for a basically nice person like corinne had the job made him insensitive banks thought of penny cartwright again and her violent reaction to his suggestion of dinner last night was it something to do with what he did for a living the way he looked at the world at people she was a free spirit after all so did that make him the enemy corinne plugged the usb drive into her computer here we go she said and banks looked over her shoulder at the monitor chapter four shortly after half past six that saturday evening annie walked out of the oval tube station where shed been crammed in an overheated carriage with about five million people on their way home from shopping or visiting friends and relatives and headed down camberwell new road past the park on the corner young lads with shaved heads and bare upper bodies lounged on the grass drinking cans of lager and flexing their tattoos leering at every attractive woman who passed by a group of younger kids had set up makeshift goals with their discarded tshirts and were playing football just watching them made annie sweat then she saw phil he was on the other side of the street walking a dog some sort of little terrier on a lead but it was phil she was sure of it the same lazy grace in his step the casual but expensive clothes chin up slightly receding hairline hardly looking she dashed into the road aware of horns blaring around her and she had almost made it across when his attention was attracted by the noise he paused and looked toward her a puzzled expression on his face annie got to the pavement and stopped oblivious to the cursing of the last driver who had barely missed her it wasnt phil after all she realized there was a superficial similarity but that was all the man bent to pat his dog then with a curious backward glance he carried on walking toward the traffic lights annie leaned against a lamppost until her heartbeat returned to normal and cursed this wasnt the first time shed thought she had seen him she would have to be more careful in future less jumpy if she was to be realistic about it she had to realize that bumping into him in a street in london was the last thing that was likely to happen she was still wired from the train journey she would have to calm down she had made the and had even managed to find a seat in the quiet car but no matter how many windows had been open it had still been too hot and she had been thinking about phil which was probably why her mind had fooled her into thinking she had actually seen him across the street throughout most of the journey she had read the tabloids scouring the pages for any whiff of phil but had found nothing as usual she had to get a grip on herself despite the rule of quiet more than one mobile rang during the journey and annie could also hear the overspill from someones personal headphones it had made her think of banks and again she started wondering where the hell he was and what he had to do with jennifer clewess murder according to the woman with the baby banks had left under his own steam that morning but none of this explained what the hell was going on annie found the house just off lothian road the two dcs assigned to watch the flat were still sitting in the kitchen the man with his feet on the table shirtsleeves rolled up chewing on a matchstick and reading through a pile of letters and the woman sipping tea as she flipped through a stack of hello magazines two tipped cigarette butts lay crushed in a royal doulton saucer somehow both detectives managed to look like naughty schoolkids caught in the act though neither showed any trace of guilt annie introduced herself and how are things in the frozen north asked the man whose name was sharpe keeping his feet firmly on the kitchen table and the matchstick in the corner of his mouth he looked as if he hadnt shaved in about four days hot said annie what are you doing sharpe gestured to the letters just nosing about a bit afraid theres nothing very interesting just bills junk mail and bank statements all pretty much as youd expect no really juicy stuff people dont write letters the way they used to do they its all email and texting these days init considering that sharpe looked about twentyone it was odd to hear him being so critical of these days as they were probably the only days he knew but the irony in his tone wasnt lost on annie and the callous disregard which both of them seemed to display toward the victims home angered her okay thanks for keeping an eye out she said you can leave now sharpe looked at his partner handy and raised an eyebrow the match in the corner of his mouth twitched youre not our guv he said annie sighed fine she said if thats the way you want to play it my patience is already running a bit thin she took out her mobile went into the hallway and phoned di brooke at kennington station after a few pleasantries and the promise of a drink together later that evening annie explained the situation briefly then went back into the kitchen smiled at sharpe and handed him the phone the moment he put it to his ear his feet shot off the table and he sat bolt upright in his chair almost swallowing his matchstick his partner who hadnt said a word so far frowned at him when the call was over sharpe dropped the mobile on the table scowled at annie then turned to his partner and said come on jackie weve got to go he made a show of swaggering as slowly as possible out of the house which annie thought would have been funny if it hadnt been so pathetic and with one mean backward glance mouthed the word bitch and stuck his middle finger in the air annie felt inordinately satisfied when that little scene was over and she sat down and poured herself a cup of tea it was lukewarm but she couldnt be bothered to make a fresh pot one of the dcs had opened a window but it was no use there was no breeze to bring relief an empty strand of flypaper twisted in what little air current there was over the sink while she was waiting annie took out her mobile and rang gristhorpe in eastvale dr glendenning had finished the postmortem on jennifer clewes and had found nothing other than the gunshot wound her stomach contents consisted of a partially digested hamandtomato sandwich eaten at least two hours before death which bore out templetons theory that she had driven up from london and probably stopped at a motorway café on the way glendenning wouldnt commit himself to time of death except to narrow it down to between one and four in the morning the socos were still working the scene and would get around to examining bankss cottage as soon as they could they had found a partial print on the drivers door of jennifer clewess car but it didnt match any they had on file as it turned out annie didnt have long to wait for jennifers flatmate at about seven oclock the front door opened and she heard a womans voice call out jenn hello jenn are you back yet when the owner of the voice walked into the kitchen and saw annie she stopped dead in her tracks put her hand to her chest and backed away what is it she asked who are you what are you doing here annie took out her warrant card and walked over to her the young woman studied it north yorkshire she said i dont understand you broke into our house how did you do that i didnt see any damage to the lock weve got keys for all occasions said annie what do you want with me are you kate nesbit jennifer clewess flatmate yes she answered maybe youd better sit down said annie pulling out a chair at the table kate was still dazed as she lowered herself into the chair her eyes lighted on the saucer and her nostrils twitched whos been smoking we dont allow smoking in the flat annie cursed herself for not getting rid of the butts though their smell still lingered in the warm air it wasnt me she said putting the saucer on the draining board she didnt know where the waste bin was you mean someone else has been here annie lingered by the sink just two detectives from your local station i had words with them im sorry they were so rude it was necessary to get in believe me necessary kate shook her head she was a pretty girl in a very wholesome nononsense sort of way with her blond hair cut short blackrimmed oval glasses and a healthy pink glow on her cheeks she looked athletic annie thought and it was easy to visualize her tall rangy frame on horseback even the clothes she wore white shorts and a green rugbystyle shirt looked sporty whats going on she asked its not good news is it im afraid not annie sat down opposite her drink not for me tell me what it is its not daddy is it it cant be i was just there you were visiting your parents in richmond yes i go every saturday when im not working no said annie its not your father look this might be a bit of a shock but i need you to look at it she opened her briefcase and slipped out the photograph of jennifer clewes that peter darby had taken at the mortuary it wasnt a bad one she looked peaceful enough and there were no signs of violence no blood but there was no doubt that it was a photograph of a dead person is this jennifer clewes your flatmate kate put her hand to her mouth oh my god she said tears in her eyes its jenn what happened to her did she have an accident in a way look do you have any idea why she was driving up to yorkshire late last night i didnt know that she was did you know shed gone out yes we were home last night i mean we dont live in one anothers pockets we have our own rooms but my god i dont believe this she put her hands to her face annie could see that her whole body was shaking what happened kate annie said please try and focus for me kate took a deep breath it seemed to help a little there was nothing we wanted to watch on telly so we were just watching a dvd bend it like beckham jenns mobile went off and she swore we were enjoying the film anyway she went into her bedroom to answer it and when she came back she said there was an emergency and she had to go out to just carry on watching the film without her she said she wasnt sure when she would be back now youre telling me shell never come back what time was this i dont know i suppose itd be about half past ten a quarter to eleven that was consistent with the timing annie thought it would take about four hours to drive from kennington to eastvale depending on traffic and jennifer clewes had been killed between one and four oclock in the morning about three miles shy of her destination did she give you any idea about where she might be going none at all just that she had to go right then but thats just like her oh what i mean is that she wasnt very forthcoming about what she was doing where she was going even if i needed to know when shed be back for meals and such she could be very inconsiderate kate put her hand to her mouth oh listen to me how terrible she started crying its all right said annie trying to comfort her try to stay calm did jennifer seem worried frightened no not exactly frightened but she was pale as if shed had a shock or something have you any idea who made the call no im sorry what did you do after she left watched the rest of the film and went to bed look whats happened did she have a car crash was that it it cant have been her fault she was always a careful driver and she never drank over the limit its nothing like that said annie then what please tell me shed have to find out sooner or later annie thought she got up took a couple of tumblers from the glassfronted cupboard and filled them with tap water she passed one to kate and sat down again she could hardly bear kates imploring expression the wide fearful eyes and furrowed brow the tumbler shaking in her hands when kate heard what annie had to tell her her life would never be the same again it would be forever tainted forever marked by murder jennifer was shot annie said in a soft flat voice im really sorry shot kate echoed no she but i dont understand neither do we kate thats what were trying to find out do you know of anyone who would want to harm her harm jenn of course not the words came out in gulps as if kate were desperate for air kate put the glass down but she missed the edge of the table it fell to the floor and shattered she stood up and put her hand to her mouth then without warning her eyes turned up and before annie could reach her she crumpled in a heap on the kitchen floor look said corrine are you sure we should be doing this these are roys private business files after all its a bit late to get squeamish now said banks besides he said gesturing to the cd maybe its just more of the same corinne gave him a dirty look and turned back to the screen well she said at least the drive isnt passwordprotected and given roys concern with privacy said banks that probably means theres nothing really confidential on it or nothing incriminating he thought so whats the point perhaps its something he wanted me to find and read hed know id be no good at cracking passwords and such besides i need anything i can get business contacts activities habits anything theres quite a mix of stuff said corinne scrolling down some word documents money files excel spreadsheets powerpoint presentations market research reports memos letters can you print it out some of it corinne started selecting files and the printer hummed into action it was fast banks noticed can you also copy the contents to another thingamajig you mean a removable usb hard drive whatever can you do it of course i can or at least i could if i had a spare one will a cd do fine banks said just as long as we have a copy the cd as well what are you going to do with them im going to post it to myself said banks that way ill have a backup but it might mean nothing at all maybe roys just run off with his new girlfriend have you thought of that banks had look he said its true that i dont know roy very well and ill take your word that hes an imaginative and bold businessman rather than a crooked one but you didnt hear the phone call he sounded scared corinne he tried to make light of it but he did say it might be a matter of life and death is that like him corinne frowned no i mean im not saying hes a hero or anything but he doesnt usually back down from difficult situations and hes not an alarmist maybe hes been kidnapped or something has he ever mentioned that possibility no but you hear about it sometimes dont you not that often but trust me banks said somethings wrong there are just too many loose ends the missing computer for a start if someone went to the trouble to take roys entire computer and all the storage devices they could find then doesnt that seem suspicious to you they only missed the usb drive and the cd because both were hidden hidden in plain view banks might have added like poes purloined letter according to his neighbor malcolm farrow when roy got in the car with the other man neither was carrying anything someone must have gone back and taken the computer stuff between about half past nine last night and the time i arrived early this afternoon has it occurred to you that he might have come back and taken it himself corinne asked why should he where would he have taken it besides his cars still in the garage he doesnt own another does he no just his darling porsche youre right if he went anywhere hed have taken the porsche he loves that car i dont suppose he has another house does he somewhere hed go if he had to make a run for it a villa on the algarve perhaps roys not particularly fond of portugal and he doesnt own a place in tuscany or provence or anywhere else as far as i know at least he never took me to one he loves travel and holidays but he says its too much hassle owning property abroad it ties you down to just one place hes probably right corinne bit on her lower lip now youve got me really worried banks put his hand on her shoulder then took it away quickly not wanting her to get the wrong idea she didnt react ill find roy he said but lets have a look at some of these files first they might help us find out where to start looking you know more about his business affairs than i do thats not saying much anyway theres nothing here that looks even the remotest bit dodgy how can you tell corinne faltered a little well i dont suppose i can really as i said the drive isnt protected or encrypted and roys hardly likely to write down references to importing heroin is he so theres no way of telling as corinne spoke she opened and scanned various files the printer was still running not from these files everything looks aboveboard i think if he were trying to hide that sort of thing thered be something to set off alarm bells its not that easy besides as ive been trying to tell you roys not like that what about the money files simple income and expenditure company profitandloss sheets investment returns bank statements some offshore banking his finances are in pretty good shape roy did a lot of offshore banking anyone working at his level of income has to its a matter of keeping tax liabilities as low as possible its not illegal mostly were looking at memos and correspondence here you are of course welcome to examine them all at your leisure especially as you took them in the first place but id say youd be wasting your time roys on the board of a few hitech companies mostly interested in miniature informationstorage devices like that usb hard drive flash memory cards that sort of thing given the way the worlds going with mobiles digital cameras pdas mp players and various combinations it seems a wise enough area to be in smaller is better as a board member hes paid dividends what else is there recently roys become interested in private health care i remember him talking about it look she activated a powerpoint presentation that extolled the virtues and profits of investing in a string of cosmeticsurgery clinics hes on the board of a chain of health centers a pharmaceutical company a fitness club it all sounds very dull said banks i told you so but guess whos the one with the porsche no need to rub it in is there more a few marketresearch reports on health and hitech the kind of reports you buy the expensive kind i was hoping for a few names theyre here said corinne memos and letters between roy and various directors and companies he was involved with julian harwood for example ive heard that name you might well have done hes quite big in the private healthcare field these days directs the chain of clinics roys involved with anything from cancer to breast enlargement actually roy and julian have been mates for years harwoods not a doctor though no a businessman have you met him uhhuh you dont sound impressed maybe because thats exactly what he sets out to do impress people frankly i always found him a bit boorish but it takes all sorts it still doesnt make him a crook though so you dont think theres anything in there to suggest that roy was involved in any sort of illegal or dangerous business ventures you can see for yourself it all looks quite kosher i dont know about dangerous though what do you mean well just because it looks clean that doesnt mean the hitech companies he worked with werent selling illegal weapons guidance systems to terrorists or that the clinics werent involved in genetic manipulation maybe the cosmeticsurgery clinics gave gangsters new faces banks laughed like seconds you mean corinne frowned i dont know what you mean its a film rock hudson a man gets a new face new identity oh i see well i suppose my point is that theyre not exactly going to announce things like that in letters six feet high are they its a wideopen world you should know that even the most innocuouslooking enterprise on the surface can turn out to be a whole different matter if you dig a little deeper banks did know that and it didnt make him feel a great deal easier about roy corinne collected the pile of printed paper put it in a folder and handed it to him here be my guest banks picked up the folder put it in his briefcase and stood up thanks a lot he said youve been very generous with your time dont worry about it said corinne just find roy i will when you do will you let me know of course in the meantime you take good care of yourself if you think of anything else or theres anything you need well you can ring me on roys mobile he left it on the kitchen table thats how i got your number corinne frowned thats not like him she said not like him at all no said banks and left annie hadnt seen anyone faint since she was about nine when one of the women at the artists commune where she had been raised keeled over in the middle of dinner even then she overheard some of the adults talking later and the general agreement seemed to be that drugs were the cause in the case of kate nesbit it was most likely shock and perhaps the heat remembering her first aid annie placed kates feet on a chair to elevate her legs above heart level to restore the flow of blood to the brain then turned her head to one side so she didnt swallow her tongue she leaned close and listened kate was breathing without difficulty lacking smelling salts never in fact having seen or smelled any annie just made sure that kate hadnt cracked her skull when she fell and then went over to the sink to pour another glass of water she found a tea towel dampened it with cold water and brought it over with the glass then she got another glass of water for herself kate was stirring now her eyes open annie mopped her brow then lifted her into a sitting position so she could sip the water as soon as kate said she felt well enough annie helped her back into her chair then cleared up the broken glass before continuing the interview im so sorry kate said i dont know what came over me thats all right im just sorry i couldnt find an easier way to break it to you but shot jenn i can hardly believe it surely that sort of thing doesnt happen to people like us annie wished she could say it didnt what was it kate went on robbery not like that other poor girl claire potter yes it was on the news for weeks they still havent found the man you dont think we dont know yet jennifer wasnt sexually assaulted though thank god for that at least her things are missing annie said handbag purse so it could be robbery do you know if she carried much money with her no never she always said she could buy everything she wanted with her credit card or debit card that was true enough these days annie knew the only time people seemed to have a lot of cash on hand was when they had just withdrawn some from a cashpoint look annie went on you shared the flat with jennifer you must have been close i know youre upset but im relying on you to help me what was going on in jennifers life men work family friends anything think tell me about it there has to be an explanation if this wasnt just some senseless random attack maybe it was said kate i mean those things do happen dont they people killing people for no real reason yes but not as often as you think most victims know their killers thats why i want you to think deep and tell me anything you know kate sipped some water i dont know she said i mean we werent that close did she have any close friends there was this girl she used to go to school with up in shrewsbury where she grew up she came around once or twice can you remember her name melanie melanie scott annie definitely got the feeling that melanie scott wasnt on kates list of favorite people how close were they they went on holiday together last year it was before jenn moved in but she told me all about it sicily she said it was awesome do you have an address for melanie i think so she lives in hounslow i remember out heathrow way ill be able to dig it out before you go fine what was jennifer like quiet hardworking and she really cared about people you know maybe she should have been a social worker in annies experience the world of social work was hardly staffed by caring people wellmeaning perhaps but that was a different thing in her mind what about all those mysterious comings and goings thats just me being silly really i like to know where people are and when theyll be back jenn didnt always bother to let me know but she wasnt a party girl if thats what you mean or a clubber i think she was actually rather shy but she was bright and ambitious like i said she cared about people and she was funny i liked her sense of humor we used to watch the office on dvd together and wed both crack up laughing i mean wed both worked somewhere like that we knew what it was like ill miss all that kate added ill miss jenn she started to cry again and reached for the tissues im sorry i just cant its all right said annie is that what you always called her jenn not jenny kate sniffled and blew her nose yes its what she liked to be called she hated jenny she just wasnt a jenny like im not a katy or a kathy i suppose and like im not anne thought annie funny the way names contractions especially tended to stick she had been annie all the time growing up on the artists colony and only at school had people called her anne the two of you must have talked annie said what sort of things did she talk about the usual things christ thought annie this was like trying to get water out of a stone did you notice any change in her mood or behavior recently she asked yes she seemed very nervous and jumpy lately it wasnt like her nervous since when just these past few days did she tell you what it was about no she was even more quiet than usual do you think theres any connection between that and her reaction to last nights phone call the late drive i dont know said kate there might have been the problem was annie realized that jennifers mobile had been taken along with everything else still the phone company records might help do you know which network she used orange annie made a note to follow up then asked do you have anything with her handwriting on it what a note or something letter postcard kate turned to a corkboard on the wall by the door a number of far side cartoons were pinned there along with a few postcards kate went over and unpinned one of them a view of the eiffel tower and carried it over to annie jenn went to paris for a weekend break in march katie said she sent me this we had a good laugh because she got back here before it did did she go by herself annie asked taking a photocopy of the note found in jennifer clewess back pocket from her briefcase to compare the handwriting yes she said shed always wanted to go on the eurostar and they had a special deal she went around all the art galleries she loved going to galleries and museums to annies untrained eye the handwriting looked the same but she would have to get an expert to examine it can i keep this she asked i suppose so annie put the photocopy and the postcard in her briefcase you said she went alone annie went on but isnt paris supposed to be the city of romance jenn wasnt going out with anyone back then but she has been more recently i think so just think so well jenn could be very private i mean she didnt kiss and tell that sort of thing but shed been getting a lot of calls on her mobile lately and making a lot and shed stayed out all night on a couple of occasions she didnt usually do that since when a few weeks but this started before the odd behavior yes did she tell you his name i assume it was a he good lord yes of course but she didnt mention any names she didnt even tell me that she was seeing someone it was just a feeling i got from her behavior intuition i put two and two together but you said she seemed nervous and jumpy thats hardly the way a new relationship is supposed to make you feel is it and why was she so secretive didnt you ever talk about personal matters say if one of you split up with a boyfriend or something weve only been flatmates for six months said kate and nothing like thats happened to either of us in that time theres that one bloke keeps pestering her but thats all who her exboyfriend his names victor but thats all i know about him he keeps ringing and hanging around you dont think i dont think anything yet said annie are you sure you dont know his last name where he lives sorry said kate it was over before we started sharing or jenn thought it was what did she think about it was she frightened of him no just annoyed thats all how did you two become flatmates kate looked away id rather not say its private annie leaned forward look kate she said this is a murder investigation nothings private what was it an advertisement in the papers the internet what kate remained silent and annie became aware of the tap dripping in the sink she heard water spraying from a hose in a garden beyond the open window and a child squealed with delight kate oh all right all right i thought i was pregnant i did one of those home tests you know but i didnt trust it how does jennifer come into this it was where she worked she was an administrator at a private womens health center they specialize in family planning like the british pregnancy advisory service marie stopes annie remembered both of these from her own unexpected brush with pregnancy nearly three years ago though in the end she had gone to a national health service clinic its a new chain there are only a few of them open yet as far as i know whats it called the bergerlennox centre and they perform abortions not at the center itself no but they have satellite clinics and they arrange for abortions to be performed thats not all they do though they cover the whole range really do reliable pregnancy tests give advice and counseling physical exams arrange for abortions or put you in touch with adoption agencies social services whatever they take care of everything and theyre very discreet one of my friends at work told me about them why do you think its important i dont know said annie but the one thing she did know was that abortion was a red flag for a number of fringe groups and that people who worked at such clinics had been killed before do you have the address in my room ill get it for you when i get melanies fine said annie so how did the two of you meet you said jennifer worked in administration yes she ran the business side of things we got talking in the office while i was filling out the paperwork thats all she was explaining it to me how the system worked that sort of thing we just sort hit it off were about the same age and i think she felt a bit sorry for me anyway it turned out i wasnt pregnant and she asked me if i fancied a drink to celebrate when we got talking we found out that neither of us was happy living where we were so we decided to pool our resources and share we didnt know each other well but we got along all right where did she live before out hammersmith way she said it was a really tiny flat and the area wasnt very nice she didnt like walking there by herself at night can i have another glass of water please annie wondered why she was asking why she just didnt go and get it herself it was her flat after all shock probably the poor girl looked as if she was likely to faint again at any moment annie went over to the sink and filled the two glasses a fat bluebottle had got itself stuck on the flypaper and was pushing frantically with its legs trying to get away only succeeding in miring itself deeper in the sticky stuff with each new effort it made annie thought she knew what that felt like where did you live then she asked handing over the water thank you in richmond with my parents why did you leave was it because you thought you were pregnant oh no it wasnt anything to do with that i never even told them and the boy well hes long gone now richmond is just too far out i was spending all my time commuting i work in clapham im a librarian its only a couple of tube stops and on a nice day i can walk if ive got enough time i see said annie why do you think jennifer was so secretive about this new boyfriend if you ask me kate said lowering her voice i think hes married that made sense annie thought jennifer probably wouldnt have bragged about a relationship with a married man the fear of discovery was likely to make her nervous on edge and maybe the mobile was the safest way to communicate no chance of getting his wife on the other end but you have no idea what his name is or where he lives no im sorry how did they meet i dont even know if im right about any of it said kate my mother always said i have too much imagination for my own good guess where might jennifer have met someone what kind of places did she like to go nightclubs no ive already told you she wasnt like that besides she was usually too tired when she got back from work she often worked late at the center i mean shed go for a drink or a meal with friends from work now and then and maybe the two of us would go to the pictures once in a while then there was her friend melanie could it have been someone she met at work it might have been thats the most likely place isnt it annie nodded she knew that work was where she had met banks and in a way phil keane why wasnt she out with him on friday its the weekend after all people usually get together i dont know said kate she just said she was stopping in she did say she was expecting a phone call at some time but she didnt know exactly when her face started twitching again as if she was about the cry should i have known should i have stopped her annie went over and put a hand on her shoulder calm down kate she said theres nothing you could have done no way you could have known but i feel so useless some friend ive turned out to be its not your fault the best thing you can do is try to answer my questions as clearly and calmly as possible okay kate nodded but continued to sniffle and dab at her eyes and nose this phone call came between half past ten and a quarter to eleven yes i think so what about jennifers family annie asked where do they live how did she get along with them fine as far as i know said kate i mean she didnt visit them that often but they live in shrewsbury you dont when theyre so far away do you no said annie whose father lived even farther away in st ives can you find their address for me too now that we know it is jennifers body we found someone will have to let them know whats happened of course said kate ive got that one in my pda you know in case of emergencies or anything i never thought id need it for something like this she dabbed at her eyes again fetched her shoulder bag and gave annie the address annie stood up and now she said can i have a look at jennifers room while you dig out those other addresses chapter five banks left his car parked in corinnes street only a short walk from roys took the district line from earls court to embankment and walked up to the main post office behind trafalgar square there he bought a padded envelope and posted both cd copies roys business files from the usb drive and the sex images to himself at western area headquarters it was always a good idea he thought to have backup preferably stored in a different location he kept the original cd of jpegs and the usb drive in his briefcase along with the papers corinne had printed out for him after he had finished at the post office he dropped in at the first newsagents he saw and bought another packet of silk cut while he was paying he noticed one of the headlines in the evening paper and looked closer a young woman as yet unidentified had been found shot dead in a car outside eastvale north yorkshire no doubt if hed been on duty he would have caught the case but as things were it would be annies he didnt envy her having to deal with the media feeding frenzy guns always caused but perhaps gristhorpe would take care of the press the way he usually did banks lit a cigarette and started to walk he had often done so when he worked on the met and sometimes it helped him sort out his feelings or solve a problem whether it did or not he had always enjoyed walking around the west end at night no matter how much it had changed in character since his early days on the beat outside the pubs knots of people stood clutching pint glasses laughing and joking in leicester square jugglers and fireeaters entertained the crowds of american tourists in shorts and tshirts who milled around drinking water from plastic bottles it was a sultry evening and the square was bustling with people long queues for the odeon metal barriers up some premiere or other and everyone hoping to catch a glimpse of a star banks remembered doing crowd duty there once as a young pc in the early seventies one of the bond films the man with the golden gun he thought but that had been a cold night not far off christmas as he remembered he and his fellow pcs linking arms to keep back the onlookers as flashbulbs popped and they were flashbulbs back then and the stars stepped out of their limos he thought he saw roger moore and britt ekland but he could have been wrong he never was much of a celebrity spotter banks had loved going to the cinema back then he and sandra must have gone twice a week before the kids if he was on the right shift and sometimes if he was on evenings or nights theyd go to a matinee even after brian was born they got a neighbor to babysit now and then until undercover work made it too difficult for him these days he hardly ever went at all the last few times hed been to see a film there always seemed to be someone talking and the place was sickly with the smell of hot buttered popcorn the floors sticky with spilled coke it wasnt so much like going to the cinema anymore as it was like hanging out in a café where they showed moving pictures on the wall there was a new multiplex in eastvale an extension of the swainsdale centre but he hadnt been there yet and probably never would go banks made his way into soho it was going on for nine now still daylight but the sun was low the light fading and he was hungry he hadnt eaten since that wretched curry round the corner from roys place here the streets were just as crowded outdoor tables at the restaurants and cafés on old compton street greek street dean street frith street overflowing a whiff of marijuana drifted on the air mingling with espresso roasting garlic olive oil and middle eastern spices neons and candlelight took on an unnatural glow in the purple twilight smudged a little by the faint lingering heat haze boys held hands as they walked down the street or stood on street corners leaning in toward each other beautiful young women in cool flimsy clothing walked together laughing or hung on the arms of their dates banks made it to tottenham court road before the electronics shops closed and after little deliberation bought a laptop with a dvdrwcdrw drive it was light enough to carry easily in a compartment of his briefcase and it would do everything he needed it to do and more it also didnt break his bank account still bolstered by the insurance money from the fire he took out the manual and various extra bits and pieces put them in his briefcase too and left the packaging in the shop after that feeling hungry he headed back to soho on dean street banks found a restaurant he had eaten at once before with annie and had enjoyed like all the others the outside tables were crowded and the frontage was fully open to the street nevertheless banks persevered inside and was rewarded with a tiny table in a corner away from the street and the noise it was no doubt the least desirable table in the house as far as most people were concerned but it suited banks perfectly it was just as hot inside as out so location made no difference as far as that was concerned and a waitress came over almost immediately with the menu she even smiled at him banks mopped his brow with the serviette and studied the options the print was small and he reached for his cheap nonprescription reading glasses he had found himself relying on them for reading the papers and doing crosswords more often lately it didnt take him long to settle on steak done medium chips and a half bottle of château musar he sipped at his first glass of wine while he was waiting for his meal and the rich complex flavor was every bit as powerful as he remembered it annie had liked it too annie what was he going to do about her why had he been behaving like such a bastard after what she had done for him she was seriously pissed off at him he knew but surely if he really tried maybe he could break through the barrier of her anger truth be told things had been shaky between them ever since they broke up he had been jealous of annies relationships and he knew that she was jealous of his that was partly what had made his curt dismissal of her in the hospital so unforgivable but the circumstances had been exceptional he told himself he had not been in his right mind his steak and chips arrived and banks turned his thoughts back to roy with any luck he would turn up something from the computer stuff why would roy hide it otherwise a name a company something that would send him in the right direction the problem was that he would more likely than not turn up too much and banks didnt have a slew of dcs to send out on the streets to filter out the red herrings perhaps he could go back and enlist more of corinnes help she had said she would be willing for a moment a shadow of concern for corinne passed over him with a chill and he shivered had he brought her danger along with roys business secrets but he was sure he hadnt been followed to her house nor was there anyone on his tail now she would be all right he assured himself he would ring her first thing in the morning just to make sure he had only once had dinner with roy he realized as he bit into the juicy fillet they saw each other in passing at family gatherings of course though there had been few enough of those over the years and banks had been at roys first wedding but as far as the two them sitting down to dinner together there had been only the one occasion and the invitation had come out of the blue for no particular reason that banks could gather it was in the mideighties when the financial world was reeling under the shock of insidertrading scandals whatever he was now roy had been a stockbroker then and in his armani suit with his hundredquid haircut he looked every inch the successful businessman apple of his mothers eye banks had been a mess much as he was now he thought aware of the irony approaching burnout in london career and marriage held together by threads he was waiting to hear if his application for a transfer to north yorkshire had been approved when roy rang him one day at the office he wasnt even sure his brother knew where he lived at that time and asked him if he was free for dinner at the ivy the restaurant was packed with entertainment people and banks thought he recognized a star or two but he couldnt put names to faces they had certainly looked and acted as if they were stars after a half hour of family chat and polite inquiries into bankss career and wellbeing over a very expensive shepherds pie and an even more expensive bottle of burgundy roy had steered the conversation toward the recent scandals nothing was said overtly but banks went away with the impression that roy had been pumping him not that he knew anything but his brother had expressed interest in the way such investigations were done how the police gathered information what they thought of informers exactly where the law stood on the issue and so on it was done very well and it continued over the frozen berries and white chocolate sauce he had had for dessert but it was definitely a fishing expedition there was another thing too banks couldnt be certain but he had been around drugs enough to recognize the signs and he was sure roy was high coke he suspected after all that was the drug of choice back then among successful young men about town at one point in the evening roy excused himself to go to the toilet and came back slightly flushed and even more animated sniffling every now and then and that banks realized was probably when he first started thinking of his brother as a possible criminal before that he had merely been the annoying little brother the paragon against whom banks was matched and found wanting even now when banks looked back on their conversation that evening he still thought he was right that roy had been up to something and wanted to run down the odds on his getting caught well he hadnt got caught and now it seemed he had moved on to other things but were they more honest banks poured the last of the château musar into his glass maybe he should have ordered a whole bottle he thought but that was too much and he wanted to keep a reasonably clear head for tomorrow from what he could see through the clustered diners in the dim light the street outside was even busier the crowd was mostly young and theyd probably be drinking and clubbing until the early hours over coffee and cognac banks remembered that he had nowhere to stay he had forgotten to book a hotel room then he felt the pressure of the keys and the mobile in his pocket and he knew that he had decided where he was staying the minute he had pocketed them and left roys house it was useless trying to get a taxi at this hour in the maze of soho streets so he walked up to charing cross road where he picked one up in no time and asked the driver to take him to south kensington winsome had been patiently ringing bankss parents and children on and off for most of the afternoon and early evening without any luck when it came to bankss friends she was at a loss to know who they were he had left an old address book in his drawer but there werent many entries and some were so old the numbers were no longer in service it felt odd searching for her boss poring over the personal address book of someone she called sir and looked up to but there was no doubt that he might be able to answer a few questions winsome also realized that he might be in danger after all a woman apparently on her way to see him had been shot and his halfrenovated cottage had been broken into coincidence winsome didnt think so consulting the list of family phone numbers winsome had first called the daughter tracy in leeds when she had finally got through to her around teatime tracy said she had no idea where her father was the son brian wasnt answering his mobile so she left a message when she phoned bankss parents for the third time early in the evening a woman answered mrs banks winsome said yes who is this my names dc jackman i work with your son dci banks ive been trying to get in touch with you all afternoon sorry love weve been to visit my brother and his wife in ely why whats wrong has something happened to alan nothings happened mrs banks as far as we know everythings just fine hes on holiday this week but im sure you know how it is with this job im afraid we need him for something and its rather urgent he seems to have forgotten to take his mobile i was wondering if you knew where he was no dear said mrs banks he never tells us where hes going these days i dont suppose he does said winsome but it was worth a try have you spoken with him recently as a matter of fact he rang early this morning what about if you dont mind me asking oh i dont mind dear it was a little bit odd see he was asking about his brother about roy and well theyve never been very close so it was unusual for dci banks to be asking about him yes what did he want to know he wanted to know if i knew where roy was just like you want to know where alan is whats going on are you sure theres nothing wrong nothing to worry about mrs banks we just need him to help us out with something thats all could you give me his brothers address and phone number if youve got them of course said mrs banks i know his address by heart but im no good with numbers youll have to wait a moment while i look it up thats all right said winsome ill hold she heard the handset laid gently to rest on a hard surface then the sound of muffled voices a few seconds later mrs banks came back on the line and gave her the number hes got one of those mobiles do you want that number too she asked might as well silly business people having to stay in touch all the time said mrs banks makes you wonder how we managed without all these newfangled gadgets but we did didnt we listen to me go on youre probably too young to remember i remember said winsome who had grown up in a shack high in jamaicas cockpit country open to the elements without telephone or electricity or any of the other myriad things that seemed so essential to life in twentyfirstcentury britain mrs banks gave her the number and winsome said goodbye for a moment she sat thinking tapping her ballpoint on the pad then she found di cabbots mobile number and picked up the phone again sorry about blunt and useless said di brooke theyre a right couple of prize plonkers but its hard to get good help these days and they just happened to be on duty blunt and useless sharpe and handy get it annie laughed its all right weve got a few like that ourselves they were sitting in a noisy pub on brixton road drinking pints of directors bitter david brooke was about bankss age but he looked older and he was much more wellrounded with a placid moonshaped red face that always made annie think of a farmer and only a few tufts of ginger hair still clinging to his freckled skull his navyblue suit had seen better days as had his teeth and he had taken off his tie because of the heat which made him look even more like some yokel up from somerset for a wedding or a football match annies search of jennifer clewess room had yielded nothing of immediate interest except that jennifer collected porcelain figurines mostly fairytale characters liked frank sinatra tony bennett and ella fitzgerald and read hardly anything that wasnt to do with business and commerce apart from the occasional mills and boon novel if her clothes were not for work they were mostly casual jeans denim skirts and jackets tshirts cotton tops nothing lacy or flouncy she had one good frock and two pairs of black highheeled shoes the rest of her footwear consisted of trainers and sandals her computer at first glance revealed nothing out of the ordinary there was no diary and no personal papers only a calendar the days filled mostly with personal appointments she had a dentists visit scheduled for the thirteenth if there was anything else it was for the computer experts to find annie did however acquire a much better photograph of jennifer alive and smiling against an ocean backdrop kate nesbit told her it had been taken in sicily the previous year when jennifer had gone there on holiday with melanie scott her old schoolfriend from shrewsbury when she had finished at the flat annie phoned and booked a room for two nights at a hotel by lambeth bridge after first ringing gristhorpe again and clearing it with him tomorrow was sunday so the bergerlennox centre would most likely be closed annie would pay her visit first thing monday morning before heading back up north on sunday she would go and talk to melanie scott the local police would inform jennifers parents of their daughters death and drive them to eastvale to make a formal identification of the body so how are things going dave annie said its been a while too long if you ask me things are fine thanks actually the big news is that im up for promotion at last chief inspector congratulations dave said annie detective chief inspector brooke has a sort of ring to it doesnt it brooke chuckled it does how did the interview with the victims flatmate go he asked annie sipped some beer fine i didnt find out much but at least im building up some sort of picture of jennifer however vague you know what its like in the early stages i do indeed a slow business the poor woman though annie went on kate nesbit the flatmate she was really upset i finally managed to persuade her to let me fetch the woman from upstairs to sit with her until her parents can come over i phoned them and they said theyd be there as soon as possible whatll happen after that i dont know ill have someone keep an eye on her if you like drop by now and then see how shes doing not blunt and useless brooke smiled no i wouldnt wish them on the poor lass weve got some good police communitysupport officers all right said annie it sounds like a good idea thanks no problem i dont like to ask she went on but do you think you could also spare a couple of dcs to do a housetohouse id do it myself but id like to go out to hounslow to visit one of the victims close friends tomorrow and what would they be asking about if anyone has noticed anything unusual or suspicious strangers hanging about that sort of thing i think we can manage that said brooke wouldnt want our delicate dis feet getting sore would we youre a sweetheart dave annies mobile rang she excused herself and walked outside so she could hear properly when winsome gave her bankss brothers address and phone numbers and told her there was a possibility banks might be there she had to go back into the pub take her notebook out of her briefcase and write the information down she thanked winsome and hung up important news brooke asked we may have a lead on our missing dci annie said missing dci its a long story brooke nodded toward annies empty glass another why not said annie im not driving what about a bite to eat then you can tell me all about your dci over dinner here brooke looked around and pulled a face you must be joking lets have one more drink here then well find somewhere decent over the river if youre up for it thatd be fine said annie how are joan and the kids thriving thank you brooke paused youre not very subtle you know annie what do you mean you want to know if im still happily married whether i represent any sort of threat to you well i am and i dont do you behave like that whenever a man offers to buy you dinner oh youre buying i didnt know that thats all right then now youre hiding behind flippancy youre right said annie im sorry i should know better ive just had some bad experiences recently thats all want to talk about them annie shook her head the last thing she wanted to talk about was phil keane throttle him maybe hang draw and quarter him even better but talk about him no way brooke wasnt the type to make a pass and under ordinary circumstances she would have realized it he had been married to joan all those years ago when annie was a freshfaced young dc in exeter and brooke was her ds he was rather unimaginative and plodding as a detective but he had been kind to her and they had kept in touch sporadically over the years anyway his offer of a shared meal was exactly that and no more and it bothered her that she reacted as if she could no longer trust an old friend im sorry annie said i just wasnt thinking thats all right and im secretly flattered that you still think im a contender annie tapped him on the arm im sure you are she said but im bloody starving so how about we skip that other drink here and have one when we get where were going does your offer still stand the west end awaits us said brooke any chance we can go via south kensington it was late saturday night kev templeton thought gloomily and he was supposed to be shagging that gorgeous new redheaded clerk in records the one with the big tits and legs right up to her arse but instead he was driving up the m in rain so heavy that his windscreen wipers could barely keep up with it still this was the nextbest thing he told himself if not even better the thrill of the chase well not exactly a chase but at least he was out of the office on the road tracking down a lead driving through the night this was the life this was what he had joined the force for water cascaded from the windows lightning streaked across the sky and he could hear the thunder even over the chemical brothers cd he was playing at earsplitting volume he knew they didnt take him seriously back at headquarters just because he was young and took a bit of pride in his appearance they all thought he was some sort of clubcrazy dandy well he liked clubbing and he liked to look good but there was more to him than that one day hed show them all hed pass his boards and rise up the ranks like a meteor who did they think they were anyway gristhorpe was due to retire any moment now and he hadnt done any real detecting in years if ever banks was good but he wasnt a team player and he seemed to be quickly writing himself out of the script due to personal problems annie cabbot wasnt as shithot as she thought she was too emotional kev thought like she was always on the rag the only one that really scared him was winsome awesome as he called her secretly shed go far he could see her as his sidekick when he made superintendent could see shagging her too just the thought of it made him sweat those thighs he had first driven nonstop to the end of the motorway then turned around hitting toddington and newport pagnell service stations on the northbound m already showing jennifer clewess photo around without any success he hadnt eaten at either of the first two service stations and now as he approached watford gap it was going on for midnight and he was feeling peckish needed a piss too he might as well stop there at the road chef from what he had learned over the years motorway cafés were all overpriced and there wasnt much to choose between them all the roadside cafés seemed to have a slightly seedy aura at that time of night templeton thought or maybe watford gap services were always like that it was something to do with the lighting and the clientele not many nice middleclass families on the road at that hour not many old folks either most of them with the odd exception of a commercial traveler or a businessman on his way home from a late meeting looked like villains you probably wouldnt go far wrong templeton thought if you made the occasional swoop on motorway cafés bound to net a few faces from the wanted posters at any rate maybe hed pass on the idea to the brass then again maybe not theyd only steal the credit themselves a man came into the toilet and stood next to templeton at the urinal though there was plenty of free space elsewhere when he started to open a conversation the usual line about big knobs hanging out templeton zipped up whipped out his warrant card and shoved it in the mans face so hard he staggered back and lost directional control pissing all over his shoes and trouser bottoms fuck off pervert templeton said and think yourself bloody lucky i cant be bothered to arrest you for soliciting on your bike now templeton clapped once loudly the man turned pale his hands shook as he zipped himself up and without even pausing to wash his hands ran for the door templeton washed his hands with soap under hot water for thirty seconds exactly he hated poofters and as far as he was concerned theyd made a bloody big mistake when they made homosexuality legal all those years ago opened the floodgates they did just as they did with immigration as far as he was concerned the government should send all the poofters to jail and all foreigners back home except winsome of course she could stay up in the restaurant templeton ordered a cup of tea and sausage eggs and beans figuring you cant go wrong with something as basic as that and carried his tray to the first empty table he saw trying to ignore the smears of ketchup on the surface the eggs were overcooked and the tea was stewed but other than that the meal wasnt too bad templeton tucked in with as much enthusiasm as he could muster when he had finished he went up to the counter and spoke to the young asian lad who worked there his name tag identified him as ali were you working here last night about this time i was here said ali sometimes it feels like im always bloody here ill bet it does said templeton pulling the photo of jennifer clewes from his briefcase by the way im dc templeton north yorkshire major crimes did you happen to see this woman in here bloody hell is she dead ali asked paling ive never seen a dead person before the question is did you see her what happened to her templeton sighed theatrically look ali well get along a lot better if i ask the questions and you answer them all right he said yeah all right lets have a look then ali reached out his hand but templeton held on to the photograph keeping it just within his field of vision he didnt want alis greasy fingerprints all over it ali screwed up his eyes and looked at the photo longer than templeton thought he needed to then said yeah she was in here last night sat over there he pointed to a table what time cant remember its all the same when youre on nights was she alone yeah i remember thinking whats a goodlooking bird like that doing all alone on a friday night like did she seem upset or frightened in any way come again how did she behave just normal like she ate her sandwich well half of it at any rate i cant say i blame her those hamandtomatoes do get a bit soggy when theyve been sitting did anyone approach her at all no speak to her no but the bloke at the table opposite was definitely giving her the eye looked like a bit of a pervert to me too what do perverts look like templeton asked you know creepy like right how long did she stay dunno not more than ten fifteen minutes i suppose look arent you going to tell me what happened to her she was all right when she left here anybody follow her the bloke opposite the pervert went out not long after her but i wouldnt say he was following her i mean hed finished his sausage roll why would he want to hang around templeton gazed over the decor why indeed he said most people here theyre usually in a hurry see quick turnover and no one else took an interest in the woman no she make any phone calls not that i saw this pervert had you ever seen him before no can you describe him for me he was wearing a dark gray suit like a businessman wore glasses with black rims and he had a long jowly sort of face with a long thin nose short brown hair light brown oh yeah and he had dandruff reminded me of someone but i cant think who not the dandruff i mean the face how old would you say he was old maybe forty or so anything else you can tell me dont think so is this gonna be on crimewatch thanks for your help templeton left ali dreaming of tv stardom and walked back to his car the rain had stopped and dark puddles reflected the lights before setting off back up the motorway templeton walked over to the garage and into the night managers office there he found a sleepy young man behind the counter and showed his warrant card the boy seemed to wake up a bit im geoff he said what can i do for you were you working here last night yeah templeton took out the photograph again remember her she looks he frowned i dont know she looks dead said templeton just as well because she is do you remember her she was here you dont forget someone who looks like that in a hurry do you remember what time i cant say for certain but her credit card receipt should tell us she used plastic most people do petrols so bloody expensive and cards are convenient nowadays you can just swipe the card right by the pump you dont even have to come into the office not everyone likes to do it that way mind you some still prefer the human touch i dont suppose youve still got last nights receipts as a matter of fact said geoff i have theres no pickup till monday morning what are we waiting for her names jennifer clewes geoff located the credit card receipts and sucked on his lower lip as he made his way through them just give me a minute here i think this is it he held the receipt up for templeton to see am which meant shed get to the junction with the a about two and a half hours later it fit templeton thanked geoff and just on the off chance asked him about the old man ali had described the bloke with the dandruff old hatchet face thats the one yeah he was here too same time as her now i come to think of it i caught him giving her the eye when she was bending over with the pump cant say i blame him mind you like something out of fhm hey you dont think that seen him before not that i recall but we get so much traffic i dont suppose theres the remotest chance that he paid by plastic too geoff grinned flicking through the stack again i told you most of them do here you are right after hers a mr roger cropley do you have cctv as a matter of fact we do said geoff thunder rumbled in the distance geoff held up the slip and templeton read the details so there is a god after all he thought back at roys banks first checked the phone for messages there was only one and to his surprise it was from annie cabbot even more to his surprise it was clearly intended for roy because she addressed him as mr banks she had called around at the house earlier she said but he had been out would he please get in touch as soon as possible of course annie had no idea that roy was missing she sounded rather chilly and official banks thought wondering what she was doing in london could it have something to do with the murder she was investigating in eastvale it was after eleven now though and he didnt fancy getting into a complicated conversation with annie so late hed give her a ring in the morning he brought the open bottle of amarone upstairs and watched a clockwork orange on the plasma tv even with the surround sound turned low so as not to disturb the neighbors it still filled the room after that he fell asleep on the sofa the bottle still half full banks didnt hear the thunder nor did he see the lightning when the storm passed over the london area in the small hours of the morning what did awaken him however at shortly after three was the distinct melody of la donna è mobile coming from very close by as banks struggled to consciousness his first thought was that that he didnt remember putting a cd of rigoletto on before he went to sleep then he remembered roys mobile which sat on the table beside him he picked it up and sure enough that was the source of the sound the room was dark but with the help of the blue backlighting he found the right button to push hello he mumbled who is it at first he heard nothing at all except a slight background hiss perhaps some sort of static interference he thought he could hear someone making choking or gagging sounds as if they were trying to hold back laughter then he began to think that perhaps someone had rung by accident and the sounds came from a television playing in the background a similar thing happened to banks once when he had forgotten to lock his mobile somehow or other he had activated one of the numbers in his phone book and tracy got to listen to the questioning of a murder witness fortunately she couldnt make out the conversation clearly and she knew enough to switch off when she realized what must have happened still it made banks paranoid about locking the device after that or maybe this was kids someones idea of a joke the muffled noises went on followed by a thud and the unmistakable sound of someone laughing then as banks looked at the display a picture began to form it wasnt very sharp but it looked like a photograph of a man slumped in a chair asleep perhaps or unconscious his head to one side banks couldnt see whether there were other people around but given the sounds it might have been some sort of wild party why on earth would anyone want to send roy such a picture banks was still half asleep and not thinking at all clearly so he saved the picture and put the phone back on the table whatever it was he would be better equipped to deal with it in the morning chapter six the thunderstorm that swept across the southern half on the country during the night drove out the muggy weather and sunday dawned clear and sunny the streets rinsed and sparkling after the rain the temperature was still in the midtwenties but with the humidity all but gone it was a comfortable heat annie woke late after a refreshing sleep though her hotel room had been too hot and she had had to lie in her underwear on top of the sheets she had turned the control on the wall to cold but after nothing happened she concluded it was only for show perhaps if you believed it really worked then you would start to feel cooler but she didnt have that much faith after a lukewarm shower and a roomservice continental breakfast again scouring the sunday papers for any traces of phil keanes handiwork and finding none annie checked her mobile in case shed missed a message from roy banks but there was nothing she rang the number again and again she got the answering service this time she left an even more terse message she tried the mobile number but had no luck there either she didnt bother leaving a message next she rang melanie scott to make sure she would be at home then she checked in with gristhorpe at his home and found out that jennifer clewess parents were being brought to eastvale that morning to identify their daughter then annie set off for the tube first she had to take the northern line to leicester square then change to the piccadilly line which ran all the way out to heathrow given the more clement weather and the relative emptiness of the train her journey out to hounslow passed pleasantly enough some of it aboveground and she gazed on the rows of redbrick terraced houses playing fields concreteandglass office blocks she found melanie scotts house with the help of her a to z only about five minutes walk away from the hounslow west tube station cars filled every available parking spot on both sides of the street sun glinting on their windscreens so she was glad yet again that she wasnt driving the woman who answered the door looked to be in her late twenties the same age as jennifer clewes she was one of those excessively thin yet nicely shaped women with small breasts coathanger hips and a narrow waist she was wearing denim shorts which showed off her long tapered legs to advantage jetblack hair hung straight down to her shoulders and framed a pale oval face with large brown eyes button nose and full mouth the red lipstick stood out in contrast against the paleness of her skin annie hadnt told her much over the telephone but she must have suspected something was wrong and she seemed nervous anxious to hear the worst you said its about jenn she said as she pointed annie toward an armchair in the cramped living room the front window was open and they could hear snatches of conversation and laughter as people drifted by melanie sat on the edge of her chair and clasped her hands between her knees is something wrong what is it im afraid jennifer clewes is dead ms scott im sorry i cant think of any easier way to put it melanie just stared into a far corner of the room and her eyes filled with tears then she put her fist to her mouth and bit annie went over to her but melanie waved her away no im all right really its just the shock she rubbed her eyes and smudged mascara over her cheeks then took a tissue from a box on the mantelpiece youre a policewoman so there must be something suspicious about it right how did it happen no flies on melanie thought annie sitting down again she was shot she said oh my god its the woman they found in the car in yorkshire isnt it the one in the papers and on tv you said you were from yorkshire north yorkshire yes they wouldnt give her name out on the tv no said annie we have to be certain her parents havent identified the body yet she thought of showing melanie the photograph but there was no point in further distressing her kate nesbit had already identified jennifer and soon jennifers parents would confirm this i cant believe it melanie said whod want to kill jenn was it some pervert was she there was no sexual assault annie said do you know of anyone who would want to harm her me no i cant think of anyone when did you last talk to jennifer a few days ago wednesday i think on the phone i havent actually seen her for two or three weeks both too busy we were going to the pictures next weekend chickflick night i cant believe it she dabbed at her eyes again do you know if there was anything bothering her anything on her mind she did seem a bit preoccupied the last time i talked to her but i must admit jenn goes on about work a bit too much sometimes and i sort of tune out she was worried about work not specifically it was just someone she mentioned one of the late girls she said she worked at a familyplanning center i know said annie late girls what are they ive no idea thats just what she said a workmate late shift no i dont think so i dont think they worked in shifts its not a twentyfourhour center but sometimes she has contact with the clients through paperwork and billing and what have you or if theres a problem or something there was some woman that was how jennifer met kate nesbit annie remembered through the center can you remember her name im trying give me a moment she spoke it very quickly so i cant be absolutely sure but it was a rather odd name melanie paused and gazed out of the bay window a white delivery truck passed by blocking the sun for a moment carmen i think that was her first name yes carmen i remember thinking at the time that it sounded like an actresss name but thats cameron isnt it cameron diaz hers was carmen like the opera her last name was petri or something like that im sorry thats all right annie made a note of the name and put a question mark by late girl did jennifer she say what she was worried about no im sorry just that it was something this carmen said was carmen at the center to arrange for an abortion i assumed so said melanie but jenn didnt say i mean thats why people go there or for advice you know if theyre undecided they dont know what to do did jennifer have any particular stand on abortion what do you mean do you think shed advise clients against it suggest they keep the child and put it up for adoption instead oh i see no not really jenn believed it was a womans choice its just that some of the women were you know scared especially if they were young some of them just didnt know what to do but jenn wasnt an adviser or counselor there are other people to take care of that but she did have contact with the girls sometimes yes but youve no idea why jennifer was concerned about this carmen jenn just had a habit of getting involved in other peoples problems thats all it can be a bit of a drawback in her line of work most of the time she doesnt have any contact with the clients but sometimes like i said shes got too sympathetic a nature and she cant always be objective about things or people mind you its one of the qualities that makes her so special sorry made my god did jenn ever receive any threats because of her work you mean because she dealt with abortions yes there are a number of groups actively against it some of them violent she never mentioned it to me i mean i think there was a small demonstration once but nothing came of it certainly no violence anyway groups like that would tend to ignore the center itself because abortions arent actually performed there and many of the clients go on to have their babies and give them up for adoption so i dont think thats a very real possibility annie realized that jenns workmates at the center would probably be better informed on this topic she moved on it might be a good idea if you gave me a bit of background i understand you knew jennifer a long time ever since primary school we only lived two streets away from one another and we have the same birthday her poor mum and dad melanie picked up a packet of cigarettes from the arm of her chair and lit one sorry you dont mind do you she asked blowing out the smoke its your house said annie and your lungs she thought to herself what about later university we both did our postgraduate degrees at birmingham i took international business and jenn studied management what about your undergraduate degrees jenn studied economics at kent and i went to essex modern languages you kept in touch of course we were practically inseparable in the hols i understand that just last summer the two of you went on holiday together to sicily yes melanie frowned look may i ask just what youre getting at are you suggesting there was anything unusual about our friendship because if you are annie waved her hand no nothing like that none of my business anyway unless it contributed to jennifers murder no its just that her flatmate kate didnt seem to know an awful lot about jennifers life didnt really seem to know much about her at all thats hardly surprising said melanie jenns a very private person in a lot of ways she shared the flat because she had to londons so expensive but it didnt mean she had to share her life besides what well i got the impression from jenn that this kate was a bit of a nosy parker always asking questions a busybody wanting to know where shed been and who she was with jenn said sometimes it was worse than being at home with her parents annie had had a flatmate like that once in exeter a girl called caroline who had even gone so far as to question her on what sort of birth control she used and on what exactly went on those nights annie didnt return to the flat and some of carolines forays into annies sex life smacked of digging for vicarious thrills she never seemed to have a boyfriend of her own and annie guessed that was how she got her jollies not that annie gave much away or had even been up to anything most of the time why didnt she share with you hounslows too far out for her and i need to be here because of my work id hate to have to drive to heathrow and back every day from the city they didnt get along kate and jennifer i dont mean that you can get along with someone whos not the same as you cant you in general even if some of their habits annoy you as long as you keep a bit of distance true said annie sometimes its better that way thats what they were like they got along well enough kate kept the place clean and tidy didnt leave food to go rotten in the fridge remembered to lock the door when she went out didnt make a lot of noise that sort of thing the things that are important when two people are sharing a common living space they never had rows or anything its just that kates a bit bossy as well as nosy likes things just so and shes got a bee in her bonnet about smoking i wont even go to the house its her prerogative of course but even so youd think people could be a bit accommodating once in a while wouldnt you i suppose so said annie what about boyfriends what about them any problems there melanie pushed her hair back i think kate got sort of put off men she had a scare a while back thought she was pregnant so jenn told me anyway i know nothing about her love life or lack of it and jennifer annie remembered what kate nesbit had told her about jennifers exboyfriend victor and she wanted to find out what melanie knew about him kate paused seemed to come to a decision then went on jenns the serious type when it comes to love she said last year just before we went on holiday she split up with someone shed been seeing for three years and it devastated her i could have told her it would happen but you cant do that can you i mean jenn was pushing him toward commitment living together maybe marriage babies and it was obvious in the end that shed scare him off is that what happened yes melanie laughed the holiday was supposed to be a cure get him out of her system get ratarsed and shag lots of goodlooking blokes is that how it worked out no does it ever jenn read a lot of books and i practiced my italian on the waiters who were all over fifty there wasnt one decentlooking bloke in the whole place most evenings we spent commiserating with one another over a couple of bottles of cheap sicilian wine and most mornings we woke up with splitting headaches oh and jenn got sunburn on the second day all in all id say it was a bit of a farce and afterward she got over him and he her not quite said melanie with a frown jenn told me that hed pestered her once or twice said hed made a big mistake and asked her to give him another chance that sort of thing and he kept trying to phone her at work or at home both when you say pestered her do you mean stalked her threatened her what she just said he pestered her can you remember his name and address not his address no but ive got it written down somewhere remind me before you go i do remember he lives out chalk farm way his name is victor parsons was jennifer involved with anyone else after victor i think so very recently past few weeks yes couple of months at the most she was moving very cautiously anyway i got the impression that she liked him a lot do you know his name sorry she didnt say i mean she didnt really say very much about it at all she was being very cagey its just that ive known her for so long you get to sort recognize the signs if you know what i mean do you think he might be married married good god i hope not i mean jenn wouldnt go with a married man not knowingly i told you she was serious about love believed in meeting mr right and settling down together forever she wasnt casual about that sort of thing annie wondered if kate nesbits suspicions were at all justified or were simply the result of jennifers natural reticence when it came to affairs of the heart do you know where they met at work i should think she hardly goes anywhere else except with me look i know this is probably a bit of cliché annie said but we do have to ask is there anyone you can think of who might have wanted to harm jennifer has anyone at all ever made any threats against her melanie didnt hesitate no she said her eyes filling with tears again jenn was a good soul one of the truly good people you dont know of any enemies she might have had she didnt make enemies if you ask me this was one of those random attacks you hear about on the news maybe a serial killer someone who didnt know her like that other girl in the spring what about at work was everything all right there youd have to ask them but she never said anything to me about any problems she liked her job she started to cry again im sorry i just cant get my head around it annie could think of no more questions anyway she consoled melanie as best she could and suggested she call a friend to come and stay melanie didnt want to said shed be fine by herself and despite the tears annie sensed that she was probably tougher than kate nesbit besides her parents still lived in shrewsbury so they could hardly get down to london quickly annie left her card with her mobile number telling melanie she could ring at any time for any reason and walked back to the tube wondering why someone so sensitive serious and special as jennifer clewes could have ended up a murder victim when banks woke on sunday morning to the sound of birdsong his head was pounding his mouth was dry and he had the distinct memory of something very odd having happened during the night he stumbled to the bathroom drank two glasses of water and took three aspirin tablets then returned to the entertainment room where he had slept on the sofa he picked up roys mobile and found that the image was still there and that it made no more sense in the light of day than it had during the middle of the night he found the incoming call on the call list it was listed only as unknown banks examined the photo more closely the foreground was out of focus the figure blurred behind the slumped figure was what looked like a wall and banks thought he could see the fuzzy outlines of letters written on it there were no actual words he could read but an expert might be able to glean something from it was the man in the chair roy he could be banks supposed the features werent clear but the hair looked about right if it was roy was this some sort of oblique way of informing banks that someone had taken had kidnapped his brother would a ransom demand come soon the man in the photo could still be anyone though banks decided in the end perhaps roy himself had sent the photo it could be a message of some kind or a warning on the other hand it had been sent to roys mobile so was it intended for roy or did someone know that banks had the phone the latter thought didnt do much to quell bankss fears for his brother if someone already knew he was staying at roys house and had roys mobile then he had better keep his eyes open and his wits about him banks put the mobile aside and went back to the bathroom where he removed his rumpled clothes and climbed into roys luxury power shower turning it on full the jets of hot water pummeled his body back into some semblance of humanity as he dried himself on a thick soft towel banks realized that he had left his overnight bag in the boot of his car which was parked outside he didnt want to dash out and fetch it right now so he brushed his teeth with roys electric toothbrush which almost ripped his gums to shreds and borrowed a clean shortsleeved shirt and socks from his brothers wardrobe he had to wear his own jeans because roys were too long for him and too big around the waist after he had found roys stash of coffee in one of the kitchen cupboards and made himself a decent pot banks took it with him upstairs and returned to the entertainment room and the mobile the phone call and digital image should be traceable banks knew given the polices technical resources you could also learn an awful lot from a mobile phones sim card unfortunately he didnt have the resources at the moment how important was it he wondered banks still couldnt let go of the idea that his brother might have been involved in something illegal and that that was why hed vanished things had threatened to catch up with him and hed had to run away fast and hide out if that was the case and banks brought in the local police then he risked getting roy into serious trouble if something terrible came out drugs or pornography for example and roy went to jail it could kill their parents on the other hand there wasnt much more he could do alone except work on the leads he already had the names from roys call list and mobile phone book and from the files corinne had printed for him he knew what his duty was what he would advise anyone else in his position to do but still he hesitated at least he had the laptop computer now so he could spend a bit more time on the cd and usb drive and there was one person he could turn to for help first he went into roys office there was another telephone message he noticed it must have come in while he was taking his shower again it was from annie cabbot and she simply asked roy to ring her as soon as possible banks had forgotten all about last nights message he still wasnt sure that he wanted annie involved she would definitely want him to make roys disappearance an official police matter but he was curious enough to dial her mobile number and find out what she was after he got no signal making a mental note to try again later he picked up the telephone and rang corinne just to make sure he breathed a sigh of relief when she said she was fine she sounded sleepy he apologized for waking her said hed be in touch and rang off finally he dialed a number he had committed to memory as requested he left a message and fifteen minutes later the phone rang he snatched up the handset banks here whats so urgent you have to disturb a hardworking copper on his only day off asked detective superintendent richard dirty dick burgess i need to see you said banks urgently detective chief inspector alan banks weighed heavily on superintendent gristhorpes mind and not only because if banks were around gristhorpe might be able to spend a bit more time on his drystone wall rather than having to drive into western area headquarters so early on a sunday morning no doubt there would be a crowd of reporters to deal with as the issue of guns always touched a nerve despite having some of the strictest gun control laws in the world enacted in the wake of the dunblane massacre the country seemed to be flooded with cheap illegal guns from ireland and eastern europe as it was he still had a little time in hand so he took his mug of strong tea out to the back garden and rested it on his chair while he studied various stones from the pile to see which one fit best the wall went nowhere and fenced nothing in but for gristhorpe it had become almost as necessary as breathing he would never finish it how could you finish something that went nowhere but if he ever did he would pick it apart and start again wallbuilding was almost a lost art in the modern dales and while gristhorpe had no pretensions to being an expert of doing the work professionally it was both his homage and his therapy as he weighed his options gristhorpe was pleasantly aware of the sun on his face and the light breeze that ruffled through his unruly thatch of hair delicate as a womans fingers he thought of his wife mary and her featherlight touch and realized it was over twelve years now since the cancer had taken her he still missed her as he would miss a part of himself and not a day went by when he didnt think of her remember some detail of her face an expression her gentle voice her sense of humor a certain gesture the air he noticed smelled of wild garlic with a hint of tar from the hot road surface gristhorpe sipped some tea and decided upon a stone the one he chose fit perfectly then he dragged his thoughts back to the matter in hand banks over the years banks had been more than just a junior officer to gristhorpe he could remember his first impressions of an edgy nervous chainsmoking detective on the verge of career burnout and he had wondered if he had made a mistake in approving the transfer but banks had made a journey back to some sort of equilibrium aided in part by the yorkshire countryside he had now adopted as his home in some ways gristhorpe knew that he had been a kind of mentor to the new banks not so much in terms of doing the job but in human terms banks was a complex sort and gristhorpe wondered if he ever would find the peace and harmony he seemed to be looking for after the divorce from sandra which gristhorpe knew still hurt banks deeply and the messy relationship with annie cabbot banks seemed to have found a measure of happiness in his isolated cottage but even that had come to an abrupt and violent end where next gristhorpe hadnt a clue and he didnt think banks had either gristhorpe drank more tea and looked for another stone he wanted to know what bankss connection with the dead woman was before word of it leaked out at the moment it was simply a matter of trying to track banks down through his family but if that didnt work then the next step would have to be an official one and that could harm bankss career it would mean using the media they would have to put his photo in the newspapers request anyone who thought they had seen him to call the police and every copper in the country would be on the lookout for him too it wasnt only that gristhorpe wanted to know why the dead woman had bankss address in her back pocket the wrong address but that annie had said the cottage had been broken into and the builders swore they had locked up as usual after their days work and left no valuable equipment behind gristhorpe finished his tea and put the stone in place too big he chucked it back on the pile and went indoors time to go to work banks had a couple of hours to kill before his meeting with burgess first he called julian harwood and was surprised to get an appointment to meet at starbucks on old brompton road at two oclock that afternoon harwood sounded like the kind of person who thought giving you the time of day was doing you a big favor but the mention that banks was roys brother got his interest after that he had made a written note of the names and numbers in roys call list and mobile phone book just in case in his experience electronic gadgets tended to behave erratically just when you most needed them to do what they were designed for many of the names on the list matched those in the book and he found julian rupert and corinne among them others were businesses mentioned in the files corinne had copied and then there were services such as hairdresser tailor bank manager dentist and doctor none of it told him very much he rang a few of the numbers including ruperts but nobody knew where roy was at least no one admitted to knowing where he was a woman called jenn figured quite prominently in the last thirty calls at least ten of them were to or from her and banks guessed she was corinnes replacement he tried ringing the number but it was unavailable he wondered if there was any other way he could get in touch with her the odds were that if she had nothing to do with roys disappearance she would ring his mobile before too long as banks glanced through the stack of memos and accounts looked at all the company logos and names he felt frustration set in none of them meant anything to him and he didnt have the time or the resources to check them all out he had no access to the police national computer for a start he could be looking at the names of dozens of criminals and not even know it burgess might help but he would only tell banks what he wanted him to know banks spent half an hour having another look around the house and found nothing more of interest then he settled down to examine the jpeg files on the cd he had found yesterday he sat his new laptop computer on the kitchen table brewed himself some coffee and managed to follow the instructions and get the machine going he slipped in the cd and found windows explorer tucked away at the bottom of the accessories menu his computer automatically displayed the jpeg files as thumbnails banks scrolled through these all images of naked women with file names like maya teresa april mia and kimmie or of men and women engaged in sex acts if he rested his cursor on one of them information about file dimension type and size would appear in a little box most of the jpeg images were between and kilobytes in size when he got to the th image however banks noticed that it and the next two were different all three were numbered with the prefix dsc and showed two men sitting together at what looked to be an outdoor café when he let his cursor rest on one of them he found that at kilobytes it was considerably larger than the earlier images and that it was taken on tuesday the eighth of june at pm by a camera identified as e roys nikon was a model according to the details view the other images were all downloaded the next day so it looked as if roy had dragged them in from another folder intrigued banks doubleclicked on the first image of the two men he didnt recognize either of them they were leaning toward each other in earnest conversation both wore white opennecked shirts and light casual trousers one was bulkier with curly graying hair the other younger and thinner with spiky black hair a goatee and a hunted watchful expression on his face as if he was worried about being spied upon the following two images were of the same scene taken in rapid succession banks scrolled to the end of the folder but all he found was more larissas natashas nadias and mitzis on tuesday afternoon then roy had taken three candid photographs of two men in conversation at an outdoor café and on wednesday he had burned them on a cd hidden among hundreds of erotic images he had then placed the cd in the blue lamps jewel case which stood out like a sore thumb in his music collection so who were the men and what if anything did they have to do with roys disappearance banks picked up the laptop and took it upstairs it was time to learn how to use roys printer dc kevin templeton thought hed died and gone to heaven when he reported to gristhorpe that morning and the boss said to take winsome with him and pay mr roger cropley an early visit the credit card companies were not exactly forthcoming when it came to providing information even to the police but the service centers cctv cameras showed a number plate beginning with yf which was the leeds licensing office the driver and vehicle licencing agency offices were closed on sundays so templeton had had to resort to the local telephone directories and electoral rolls as luck would have it the name eventually yielded a north eastvale address which also meant that mr cropley would in all likelihood have taken the same road off the a as jennifer clewes templeton let winsome drive the short distance to cropleys sneaking a surreptitious glance at the taut black fabric stretched over her thighs whenever she changed gear christ they could kill a man he thought with wonder then he realized he was so randy that morning because he hadnt shagged the redheaded clerk last night the way he had intended she had given him a nasty look too when he got to work that morning one of those looks that said youve had your chance mate now on your bike still he knew he could break down her resistance again given the opportunity he was also tired he realized not having slept for more than an hour or so but that he could deal with as the empty sundaymorning streets flashed by he put his head in detective gear and planned out his interview he liked cropley for the killing there were one or two small glitches but nothing he couldnt reason his way past no sexual interference for a start which was a bit of a puzzle and no struggle either then there was bankss address in the victims pocket but templeton was sure cropley had pulled her over and tried it on and something had gone disastrously wrong how was your saturday night he asked winsome she gave him a sideways glance fine and yours you already know about mine spent sampling the delights of motorway cuisine what did you get up to then up to nothing special club social club yeah the potholing club templeton knew that winsome liked to climb down holes in the ground and explore underground caverns he couldnt think of anything more boring or for that matter more terrifying given that he suffered from claustrophobia where dyou hold it he asked gaping gill very funny said winsome actually we met in the cock and bull you should come along sometime was she asking him out the cock and bull no idiot potholing no way said templeton youll not get me down one of those black holes coward she said here we are she pulled up in front of a neat georgian semi an unremarkable house with mullioned windows and beige stonecladding the street was on a low rise and offered a magnificent view out west to lower swainsdale there was a small limestone church with a square norman tower at the end of the street and people were already filing in for the morning service templeton jabbed at the doorbell winsome beside him despite or perhaps because of his lack of sleep templeton felt pepped up excited like the one time he had taken ecstasy at a club winsome seemed cheerful enough in that cool and graceful way she had and if she had noticed him glancing at her thighs in the car she hadnt said anything the man who answered the door didnt look particularly like a pervert as far as templeton could tell except that he was wearing sandals with white socks but he did match the description ali had given him at watford gap about forty with thinning sandy hair slim but with a beer belly sagging over his worn brown corduroy trousers he had a long face with pouchlike cheeks and a rather hangdog expression he reminded templeton a bit of that actor who seemed to be in all the old sitcom repeats on telly with judi dench and penelope keith mr cropley said templeton showing his warrant card were police officers wed like a word if we may cropley looked puzzled the way they all did when the police came calling oh yes of course he said moving aside please come in my wifes just he let the sentence trail and templeton and winsome followed him into a living room that smelled of cinnamon and apples where mrs cropley was putting the finishing touches to a colorful flower arrangement she was taller than her husband and bony with strong almost masculine features she looked a bit severe to templeton and he could well imagine her cracking out the leathers and whip for an evening s and m session the thought made him shudder inside and maybe it drove mr cropley to other things its your husband we want to talk to templeton said smiling first off at any rate mrs cropley stood there for a moment before the penny dropped when it did she gave her husband a look then turned and left the room without a word templeton tried to read significance into that look there was something there no doubt about it one of cropleys dirty little secrets had come back to haunt him and his wife knew what it was was letting him know that she knew and he was on his own we were just going to get ready for church said cropley im afraid the vicar will have to manage without you this morning said templeton whats it about i think you know first of all were you driving up the m and the a late friday evening yes why what make of car do you drive a honda color dark green did you stop at the watford gap services yes look i while you were there did you notice a young woman alone there were a lot of people there i templeton caught winsome flashing him a glance she knew cropley was evading the question the first sign of guilt ill ask you again templeton went on did you see a young woman there in the café alone nice figure hennaed hair shed be hard to miss i cant remember templeton made a show of consulting his notebook thing is he went on the bloke behind the counter remembers you sitting opposite the girl and the petrol station attendant remembers you filling up at the same time this young woman was there thats how we found out your name from the credit card slip so we know you were there do you remember seeing a young woman at the garage she was driving a light blue peugeot think about it take your time why what do you remember her perhaps said cropley vaguely but i cant say i was paying much attention thats not what i heard then you heard wrong come off it said templeton you were leering at her werent you the attendant said you looked as if you wanted to stick your nozzle in her tank you fancied her didnt you wanted a piece he was aware of winsome looking askance at him but sometimes a direct shock to the system worked better than any amount of gentle questioning cropley reddened thats not how it happened at all not how what happened nothing nothing happened the situation thats all i might have noticed her but i wasnt leering as you put it im a married man a godfearing man that doesnt always stop people besides since when has leering been against the law so you were leering at her dont put words into my mouth what were you doing on the road so late coming home thats not a crime either is it i work in london i usually spend the week there a commuter then what do you do computers software development are you usually that late coming home it varies as a rule i try to get away by midafternoon on a friday to beat the traffic or early evening at the latest what was different about last friday there was a meeting we had a deadline to meet on an important project and if i called your company theyd verify this of course why would i lie for all i know said templeton you drive up and down the motorway looking for young girls to rape and kill thats ridiculous is it do you read the papers watch the news i try to keep abreast of current affairs oh you do do you well i dont suppose youve been following the story about the young woman murdered on the road from the a to eastvale have you the same road you took you were following her werent you waiting for your opportunity a dark country lane you cut her off what happened next wasnt she your type after all did she struggle why did you shoot her cropley got to his feet this is absurd i dont even own a gun im going to call my solicitor wheres the gun roger did you throw it away i told you i dont own a gun templeton looked around the room we can get a search warrant make a mess then get one itll be better if you tell us all about it said winsome in a soothing voice we know these things happen people lose control please sit down again sir nothing of the sort happened said cropley straightening his tie and glaring at templeton he sat down slowly come on mr cropley said winsome get it off your chest there were two of them werent there two what two girls claire potter and jennifer clewes what were you doing on the twentythird of april i cant remember that far back try said templeton it was a friday youd be on your way back from london get away late that day too did you how do you expect me to remember one friday out of all the rest always stop at watford gap services do you like the food there or do you stop at other places newport pagnell leicester forest trowell i stop when i feel the need what need its a long drive i usually take a break when i feel like it just the one use the toilets have a cup of tea maybe a sausage roll a chocolate biscuit and look at the girls theres no crime in looking so you admit you do look youre doing it again i simply said theres no crime in looking dont twist my words were you at trowell services on the twentythird of april i dont remember i dont think so i usually stop before then but you have been there on occasion on occasion yes and maybe you were there on the twentythird of april ive told you i doubt it very much i dont recall being there at all so far this year very convenient it happens to be the truth templeton could feel his frustration level rising cropley was a cool one and he seemed to have mastered the art of not giving anything away why would he need to do that unless he did have a secret look roger said winsome we know you did it the rest is just a matter of time we can do it the easy way like this in the comfort of your own home or we can take you down to the station its your choice and believe me every choice you make now will come back to haunt you down the line what would you do cropley said to her if you were innocent and someone was trying to say youd done something terrible what would you do id tell the truth well i am telling the bloody truth but a fat lot of good its doing me isnt it watch your language templeton cut in theres a lady present im sure shes heard worse than that and you a godfearing man i didnt say i was a saint or a pushover right lets get back to that shall we your unsaintly acts we might not be able to prove you killed claire potter but weve got a damn good chance of proving you killed jennifer clewes then you dont need anything from me do you dont you understand winsome said it would make things easier for you later on if you told us now and what would it do for me knock a year off my sentence two years three years if i survived that long thats good roger templeton said youre talking about doing time now jail shows youre moving in the right direction what it might mean is the difference in the quality of care once youre inside see people like you are on about the same level as child molesters as far as the general prison population is concerned and the court has some discretion as to whether youre to be isolated or not thats bollocks said cropley there are strict prison guidelines and it doesnt matter a damn whether i confess or not besides youre both missing the point completely read my lips i didnt do it i have never not once in my life raped or killed anyone is that clear enough for you templeton glanced at winsome so be it he said like i told you well be able to make out a good case from evidence and witness statements circumstantial it means nothing people have been convicted on a lot less cropley said nothing what time did you start out on friday about half ten what time did you get home about five templeton paused there was something wrong here come off it it doesnt take that long to drive from london to eastvale even with a stop or two unless you couldnt go straight home after youd killed the girl what did you do drive around until you calmed down felt able to face your wife as a matter of fact my car broke down pull the other one its true i had a breakdown just a short distance past nottingham thats very convenient it wasnt convenient at all i had to wait over a bloody hour for the aa to come they said it was a busy night the aa thats right im a member want to see my card templeton felt his forehead getting hot he didnt like the direction this conversation was taking can you prove this about the breakdown he asked of course i can ask the aa theyll verify what happened i was stuck on the hard shoulder from about one oclock till half past two wait a minute what was the problem fan belt thats put a spoke in your wheels hasnt it you never told me what time this girl was killed it was while i was waiting for the aa wasnt it cropley smirked templeton suppressed a sudden urge to break cropleys nose he felt himself running out of steam if cropley had been stuck on the m until well after two oclock he could hardly have killed jennifer clewes your mobile phone records will bear this out should do will that be all not quite said templeton loath to let the bastard gloat for too long who left the garage first you or jennifer clewes she did and you followed her no i was just behind her but another car cut in front of me came right out of the shadows i overtook them both shortly after and i never saw her again she must have passed me later when i was stuck by the roadside but i didnt notice what about this other car why didnt you tell us about it before because you were too busy trying to accuse me of rape and murder you never asked well im asking now what make was it a mondeo dark color maybe navy blue how many people in it two one in the front one in the back like a taxi yes but it wasnt a taxi i mean it didnt look like one there was no light on top for a start chauffeured car then maybe look i hate to tell you how to do your job especially as youve been doing it so well but why dont you ask me something useful like do i remember the number i was getting to that templeton said do you as a matter of fact i do well some of it anyway i suppose i noticed because he pulled out a bit sharply and i had to brake what was it la templeton couldnt remember offhand what driver and vehicle licencing agency office and local memory tag the first two letters represented but he knew that meant the car had been registered between september and february the rest he could look up it wasnt much to go on but it was better than nothing what did the occupants look like i didnt get a good look said cropley but i think they were both men i really didnt think anything of it at the time except that i had to brake rather sharply try to remember copley thought for a moment the one in the back turned and looked at me after they pulled out i suppose i tooted the horn at them just instinct and well as i said i didnt get a good look it was dark and his face was in shadow but i think he had dark hair tied back in a ponytail and i doubt it was a friendly glance he gave me i remember just feeling rather glad they didnt stop and beat me up you hear so much about road rage these days what you get for going around tooting your horn said templeton they cut me off popular girl ms clewes mused templeton first youve got your eye on her then another couple of blokes come cutting in and spoil all your fun how did that make you feel what the hell are you talking about cropley said can you hear yourself speak you sound like a cheap television psychologist look you already know i didnt do it and ive had just about enough of this so why dont you both sod off and check with the aa templeton reddened and winsome gave him a sign that they should leave before he did something he might regret he paused a moment locking eyes with cropley then did as she suggested nice one kev she said when they got outside you handled that really well he could tell she was still laughing at him when she got in the drivers seat and the anger prickled at his skin from the inside like hot needles chapter seven the pub burgess chose was flanked by a halal butcher and an indian takeaway on a narrow street between liverpool street station and spitalfields market banks took the tube and checked constantly to see if he was being followed he was pretty sure that he wasnt after receiving the image on the mobile he didnt feel like taking any chances though it was lunchtime and most pubs in the area were offering the traditional roast beef and yorkshire pudding at this place the choice was between nachos with sour cream and spicy chicken wings with bbq dip banks didnt fancy either so he stuck with a pint of pride and a packet of cheeseandonion crisps while burgess attacked the nachos and washed them down with cheap lager there wasnt exactly any sawdust on the floor but looking at the state of the place banks thought perhaps there ought to be most of the lunchtime drinkers were older bangladeshis indians and pakistanis clearly not devoutly muslim a group of them was watching a cricket game on the television essex playing pakistan commenting loudly now and then on a particularly good offspinner or square cut burgess looked much the same as he had when banks last saw him in january except today he was informally dressed in jeans and a hawaiian shirt that dazzled banks but the shaved head and slight paunch were still there and the cynical worldweary look had returned to his eyes all that was new was his tan after many rises and falls in fortune burgess had landed on his feet after when the service required men who got things done no questions asked banks wasnt sure what outfit he worked for now but he assumed it was something to do with special branch nice place you picked said banks its anonymous burgess said everyone here just minds their own business besides most of the buggers can barely understand english outside the window the sky had darkened and a few splashes of rain ran down the grimy glass burgess looked at banks closely you look like a worried man care to tell your uncle dicky whats wrong banks looked around saw that no one was paying them any attention then he brought up the image on the mobile and slid it over the table burgess picked it up examined it closely and raised his eyebrows it could be anyone he said handing it back to banks some drunk asleep at a party i know that but what if its not who do you think it is it might be my brother roy how do you know his name burgess paused it was a long time ago when about five or six years last century at any rate no reason to bother you with it at the time so what brought brother roy under scrutiny arms dealing banks swallowed what you heard me arms dealing dont look so surprised your brother helped broker a deal between a uk arms manufacturer and some rich arab sheikh greased the wheels handled the baksheesh attended galas at the consulate and so on roy did that roy would do anything to make a bit of extra cash he has an extraordinary range of contacts and connections and the bugger of it is that he doesnt even know who half of them really are naive was never a description id have used to describe roy said banks maybe not burgess argued but he took too many people at face value maybe he didnt want to dig any deeper maybe it was safer that way and easier on his conscience pocket the money and turn your back banks had to admit that sounded like the roy he knew more likely than naïveté was lack of imagination when they were kids banks remembered they had had to share a bedroom for a few days for some reason banks was ten roy about five banks had tried to torment his younger brother by telling him gruesome ghost stories at bedtime about headless corpses and misshapen ogres hoping to scare him well into the night but roy had fallen asleep during bankss gory version of dracula and it was banks who was left unable to sleep flinching at every gust of wind and creak in the woodwork victim of his own imagination perhaps roy had taken his colleagues and their claims at face value perhaps he hadnt wanted to dig any deeper or perhaps he just lacked the imagination to extrapolate on the bare facts banks reached for a silk cut didnt think youd last long said burgess lighting one of his own tom thumb cigars and offering the flame to banks who took it its only temporary banks said of course another pint why not burgess went to the bar and banks watched the cricket game while he was gone nothing exciting happened a second pint of pride on the table before him he asked burgess exactly what he knew about roy youve got to understand burgess said that your brother did nothing illegal in the strict sense people manufacture the damn things and people sell them back then you could sell anything to anyone anywhere missiles land mines submarines tanks jet fighters you name it the problem is that they had a habit of ending up in the hands of the wrong people despite all the red tape sometimes they got used on the very people who sold them in the first place so where did these particular shipments go they were destined for a friendly country in the middle east but they ended up in the hands of a terrorist splinter group and roys part he had no idea obviously he couldnt see the big picture didnt want to no more than the arms manufacturers did they didnt care all they wanted was a nice fat profit what happened it was the bloke who recruited roy for the job an old crony of his called gareth lambert who we had our eyes on hes history now left the country banks didnt recognize the name from roys call list or phone book he could have missed it as there were so many or lambert could be one of the unknown numbers on the other hand if as burgess said gareth lambert was history there was no reason for roy to have his phone number and roy he asked one of our lads had a friendly word in his shelllike and after that not even a blip on our radar said burgess so whatever this means if it means anything at all its got nothing to do with us all of this was over and done with a long time ago thats comforting to know said banks why dont you tell me what happened banks told him from the strange phone call to the arrival of the digital photograph in the middle of the night burgess puffed on his cigar as he listened eyes narrowed to slits when banks had finished he let the silence hang for a while someone scored a six and the cricket watchers cheered could be a prank kids burgess said finally ive thought of that could be someone trying to scare you off i mean if youre supposed to think its your brother and hes been hurt in some way ive managed to work that out for myself too youre not scared of course i bloody am but i want to know whats happened to roy what do you expect me to do give up and go home burgess laughed you i should cocoa what about kidnapping have you considered that a prelude to a ransom demand yes said banks but ive received no demand so far so what are you going to do now i thought you might be able to help how the mobile banks said a forensic examination might give us all sorts to go on it might even tell us where the image was sent from maybe even where it was taken im not exactly up on the technology but i know the computer experts can get a lot out of these things true enough said burgess what with dna computers the internet mobiles and cctv theres hardly any need for the humble detective anymore were dinosaurs banksy or fast going that way a sobering thought can you help sorry said burgess but this is a lot different from looking up a name or accessing a database my department doesnt actually have a great deal of contact with the technical support people were closer to the intelligence services information gathering it would look bloody odd if i suddenly turned up at the lab and dropped this on their desk without any explanation theyd be all over me like a dirty shirt sorry banksy but no can do my advice is take it to the local cop shop let them deal with it banks stared at the phone burgesss response was what he had half expected but even so he felt disappointed lost what the hell was he supposed to do now he couldnt go to the local police it wasnt only that he was worried roy might be involved in something criminal but there was no way he would be given any part in an official investigation into the disappearance of his own brother and he didnt think he could bear standing on the sidelines with his hands in his pockets whistling okay he said and youre sure youve got absolutely no idea why any of this is happening swear on my mothers grave your brother fell off our map many years ago and weve had no reason to put him back on since youve been watching him not recently we kept an eye on him for a while like i said hes got some interesting contacts but as for roy himself we soon lost interest its not guns or terrorism believe me id know and youd tell me if it was burgess smiled maybe banks took out the envelope hed brought and slipped out one of the digital photos for burgess to examine do you know who these people are he asked burgess picked up the photo and examined it closely well bugger me he said it cant be where did you get this banks told him when was it taken according to the computer details it was taken on tuesday the eighth of june at threefifteen pm but thats last tuesday who is it gareth lambert you said he was history thats what i thought but look burgess placed the photo in front of banks and pointed to the grayhaired man hes put on a bit of weight and his hairs turned gray but its him all right is he bent definitely what was his line importexport at least it used to be fancy word for smuggling if you ask me knows the balkan route like the back of his hand smuggling what you name it burgess ran his hand over his shaved head look you might as well know in his time gareth lambert was a very nasty piece of work indeed i dont mean tough but nasty sly maybe hes mellowed with old age though i doubt it what did he do it wasnt always so much what he did as who he knew he rubbed shoulders with some of the nastiest bastards in europe smuggled arms drugs people anything he had connections with the military down in the balkans kosovo bosnia knew all the generals he smuggled medical supplies morphine antibiotics sometimes diluted bit of a harry lime when you come to think about it and almost as elusive likes to keep on the move one step ahead hes a slippery bastard if hes back you can be certain hes up to his eyeballs in something dodgy and if your brother roy well that didnt make banks feel any easier about the situation at all whos that with him i dont know i dont recognize him lambert and his crew arent really my problem anymore can i hang on to this ive still got a few contacts where it counts and ill make a few inquiries therell be quite a lot of oldtimers around the yard interested to know gareth lamberts back in business if they dont know already of course said banks ive got copies and the mobile hang on to it for the moment you might need it if that picture was intended for you then more messages might follow i suppose youre right said banks pocketing the mobile maybe annie would be able to hook him up with a computer expert to enhance the image that way he wouldnt have to relinquish the phone right said burgess id better be off now banks wondered if hed done the right thing in telling all and handing over the photo of the two men to burgess now that hed made roys disappearance semiofficial there could be no turning back whatever happened he had already gone too far to avoid some sort of disciplinary proceedings by not reporting the first phone call and by living in roys house and accessing his computer data he thought he could rely on burgesss discretion but there was a limit to everything at least this way he could continue his own investigation he had already made a list of names and numbers almost a hundred and he still couldnt remember seeing any gareth lambert he would have to check again of course but if lambert was back in the picture maybe there was a reason why neither he nor roy wanted any records of their communications look he said to burgess i appreciate your help but if roys in the clear and theres nothing really to link him with any serious criminal business you want me to keep your brother out of it if you can no guarantees said burgess gareth lambert turning up like this out of the blue changes everything but i promise ill do my best youll keep me informed id like to know where to find this lambert for a start like i said ill do my best ill keep my ear to the ground id ask you to bugger off back to yorkshire and stay out of the way if i thought it would do any good but at least try to avoid getting under my feet ill think about it banks said he gave burgess roys telephone numbers and glanced toward the window its almost stopped raining id better go too burgess gave him a stern look be careful banksy he said remember i know you and this conversation never took place banks walked out his car was still parked near corinnes flat so he made his way to liverpool street where he could catch the tube back to earls court and pick up his car before meeting julian harwood while he was on the concourse of the mainline station he wandered over to look at the kindertransport memorial a sculpture to commemorate the rescue mission that helped over ten thousand children escape nazi persecution in europe during and it consisted of a glass case shaped like a large suitcase which held a selection of objects the children had brought with them and standing beside it a bronze sculpture of a young girl through the rainbeaded glass among other things banks could see school exercise books pages filled with mannered german writing letters articles of clothing dogeared family photographs a pair of old boots with clipon ice skates a hand puppet of a kitten a book of piano music a battered suitcase and three coat hangers on one was written für das kind on the second fürs liebe kind and on the third dem braven kinde it made banks think of mahlers beautiful kindertotenlieder songs for the deaths of children though these children hadnt died they had been saved he wondered if roy had the mahler in his collection he hadnt noticed it looking at the childrens personal belongings arrayed like this before him banks thought of all the mementos he had lost forever when his cottage burned down the family photographs and videos wedding holidays kids growing up letters keepsakes the poems he had written as a teenager old diaries and notebooks school report cards the records of a life but he couldnt feel selfpity in the face of this memorial he hadnt lost nearly as much as these children whod lost their homeland and in many cases their whole families perhaps they had gained something too though they had at least escaped the concentration camps been taken in by good caring families and had grown up to live their lives in relative freedom banks looked at the bronze statue of the girl in her skirt and jacket the raindrops looked like tears flowing down her face he turned away and headed for the underground annie was glad di brooke had suggested a quick lunch together in her hotel that afternoon she had heard nothing from roy banks and she was beginning to wonder if the two brothers had made up their differences and run away together just to make her job difficult brooke was in his sunday best redfaced collar too tight around his neck looking like a farmer just come from church annie in jeans and a black vneck jumper felt underdressed neither was terribly hungry so they ordered coffee and cheeseandpickle sandwiches which came cut into quarters neatly arranged in baskets well dave said annie i must say you cut a dashing figure brooke blushed the suit ive got a christening to go to this afternoon he sat down and pulled at his collar finally undoing the button there thats better plenty of time to choke myself to death in church later annie laughed i dont have a lot to report brooke said but i had a couple of lads ask around the victims neighborhood ive also had a word with the uniform who walks the beat there pc latham what does he say annie asked quiet sort of area no trouble lately what about the inquiries your lads made a bit more interesting a bloke down the street was looking for a parking spot about ten oclock on friday night seems he usually managed to park right outside his house but this time he couldnt because someone was already there said it had happened before a couple of evenings that same week he was a bit miffed but there was nothing he could do after all it was a free spot anyway he remembered there were two men in the car one in the front and one in the back he thought they might be leaving so he hung back for a couple of minutes but they ignored him what happened he found another spot nearby and that was that does he remember anything else about the car only that it was dark blue no number plate the car was parked he couldnt see the front or back of course anything else when he went out to walk the dog at eleven it was gone could he describe the men not very well only that the one in the back had something around his neck like a thick gold chain he said they looked a bit thuggish at least their appearance worried him enough that he didnt approach them and ask if they were going to move interesting said annie ive just been on the phone with my sio and one of our dcs has got a similar description from a man called roger cropley apparently this cropley saw jennifer clewes at the watford gap service station at about half past twelve friday night and a car like the one you just described with one man in the front and one in the back cut in front of him and went after her then it sounds as if someone was waiting for her outside her flat it does indeed said annie if its the same car ive thought there were two of them right from the start one who could get out of the car quickly and do the shooting the other a driver annie consulted her notebook have you ever heard of a woman called carmen petri brooke frowned cant say as i have why its just a name one of jennifer clewess friends mentioned one of the late girls she called her jennifer was worried about her about something she said late girls yes why do you know what that means havent a clue said brooke given the context a familyplanning center annie had come up with a couple of possibilities either late girls were late with their periods which was sort of selfevident when you were dealing with pregnancy or they were late in their pregnancies beyond the time when terminations could be performed which according to the law was the twentyfourth week ill check our files for you see if weve any record of this carmen but the name doesnt ring a bell no reason why it should but thanks anyway and dave check missing persons and recent deaths too if you can if someone had been performing late terminations and something had gone wrong annie thought then jennifer clewes might have stumbled across something very nasty indeed i havent seen roy in over a month said julian harwood so i dont see how i can help you you never know said banks its good of you to spare me the time nonsense roys a good friend has been for years even if we dont see enough of one another these days anything i can do im only too willing harwood didnt seem out to impress as far as banks could tell he didnt need to he was a powerful wealthy businessman used to getting his own way corinnes impression had been different but then perhaps harwood behaved differently around women many men do also she was roys girlfriend an extremely attractive young woman and he might have felt the need to compete to impress her the sun was out again and they were sitting outside at starbucks drinking grande lattes before meeting harwood banks had shown a copy of the digital photo to malcolm farrow roys neighbor across the street farrow had said that the bulky man with the gray curly hair might just have been the one roy left with at ninethirty on friday but he couldnt be absolutely certain banks could smell chinese food from somewhere nearby but he couldnt see a chinese restaurant the street was crowded with shoppers a mix of tourists and locals out for a drink and a stroll two pretty young girls in shorts and tank tops were sitting at the next table talking french and smoking gauloises harwood was younger than banks had expected midforties most likely about roys age and completely bald apart from a couple of thick strips of black above his ears he had a healthy tan and the lean physique of a regular tennis or squash player his clothes were casual but expensive a blue denim shirt open at the collar and khaki chinos with a razor crease only the nike trainers looked at bit out of character but they werent cheap either banks lit a cigarette one of the advantages of sitting outside and said i dont suppose you know where he is what do you mean banks explained about roys phone call and the unlocked house harwoods brow furrowed as he listened and when banks had finished he said roy could be anywhere he travels quite a bit you know have you thought of that yes said banks but his message was urgent and it seems odd that he hasnt told anyone where he was going no one ive spoken with so far has any idea where he might be is he usually that secretive about his movements not usually said harwood it depends i mean if theres some sensitive overseas deal in the offing is that likely im saying its possible thats all anyway youre a business associate you might know if he had any trips scheduled he didnt as far as i know said harwood but im not his personal assistant roy has plenty of irons in the fire that have nothing to do with me do you think he might have done a runner harwood thought for a moment possible i suppose if things got too much for him tax debts that sort of thing but surely hed lock his house and take his mobile maybe he wanted it to look as if it had happened some other way i wouldnt put it past him i dont know said banks im just clutching at straws harwood cleared his throat roy told me youre a policeman he said have you reported this no said banks im conducting my own investigation so far harwood nodded probably wise given roys penchant for how shall i put it sailing a little close to the wind how long have you known him banks asked years we met at university have you been involved in business ventures together ever since then on and off what about arms deals what arms deals roy was involved in one a few years back i was wondering if you knew anything about it as a close friend im afraid thats not my area of expertise harwood said in a tight voice roy would have known better than to come to me about it if indeed he was involved oh he was involved all right what about insider trading what about it its something else my brother was involved in i just wondered if you played a part harwood shrugged there was a time it wasnt uncommon so you did im not admitting that but you knew roy did harwood scraped his chair back and made to get up is this meant to be some sort of interrogation because if it is im going right now i have some questions to ask you said banks does that constitute an interrogation depends on what they are and how you go about it ill be as gentle as i can be if youll be as frank as you can harwood moved his chair back to the table then im here to help he said but lets leave insider trading behind us shall we im not saying it doesnt still go on you only have to read the papers to know that but if roy or i had any involvement we left it behind us along with the nineties you can take my word on that all right said banks from what i can gather roy has been investing in private health care recently and youre a big player in that game it was me who brought him in there are a lot of opportunities im the director and ceo of a chain of private health centers and clinics offering various procedures and levels of care all carried out by highly qualified doctors and nursing staff roys one of our major shareholders what kind of procedures pretty wide range really from hernia operations to terminal cancer care can you think of any reason why anyone would want to harm him anyone connected with our business ventures you mean yes no said harwood it doesnt make sense i can assure you that everything is completely in accordance with the law why do you ask because im really stuck here mr harwood so im just casting around in the dark as far as i can make out roy was last seen leaving his house and getting into a big lightcolored car probably an expensive model with another man as far as i know there were no signs of coercion but its not out of the question if the man was carrying a hidden gun or something later possibly during the night his computer was taken from his house which was left unlocked his mobile phone was lying on the kitchen table there were no signs of a struggle ive considered kidnapping and it might still be a possibility though theres been no ransom demand yet roys a wealthy man harwood stroked his chin not that wealthy i wouldnt have thought its all relative said banks people have been kidnapped for less i should imagine true enough but wouldnt there have been some sort of communication by now when did you say this happened friday night yes its been nearly two days and ive heard nothing so far which leads me to think its something else it just doesnt look like a bunch of thugs thats all more like i dont know organized crime its a possibility said banks but what connection could roy possibly have to organized crime none that i know of said harwood just an idea i was tossing out i mean i dont even know what those people do its not as if its just the mafia anymore is it one reads about russians and yardies and vietnamese gangs people whod cut your throat as soon as look at you who knows banks took a copy of one of roys digital photos out of his briefcase and set it on the table do you know either of these men harwood pointed to lambert and spoke coldly well i know him thats gareth lambert but i cant say i know the other one you know lambert oh yes roy and i have done a bit of business with him in our time not for a while mind you he disappeared from the scene hes back harwood frowned i didnt know that interesting said banks putting the photo away i mean that roy would know but not you gareth lambert and i had a disagreement some years ago said harwood we havent communicated since what about a private business matter i see do you know how i can get in touch with him as far as i know he moved to spain big country you dont have his address no as i said we had a fallingout i no longer have any interest in where mr lambert is or what he does banks would have liked to know more about that fallingout but harwood was a shrewd businessman good at keeping secrets at holding his cards close to his chest did roy ever mention anything that led you to believe he was up to something dodgy no not that he would have told me sometimes in the business world ignorance is bliss is it possible he stumbled across something maybe someone was stealing and he found out about it from one of the centers wherever i have nothing to do with the daytoday running of the health centers or clinics what about roy your brothers a handson sort of investor he likes to know how the businesses operate likes to put faces to names i imagine hes been doing the rounds so its likely he visited the centers i should think so some of them could he have stumbled on some sort of fraud or something we keep a pretty close eye on the figures i think wed know if anyone was bleeding the company what about stuff going missing drugs for example theyre strictly controlled harwood looked at his watch look he said standing up to leave leaning over the table with his palms spread on its surface i have to go now i dont know whether you consider me a suspect in whatever you think is going on but i want you to know that roys a valued friend if i can help you in any way please dont hesitate to get in touch again very well said banks thank you for your time harwood walked off banks finished his cigarette then stubbed it out and set off along old brompton road he turned through the narrow arch into the mews and reached for roys key just as he put it in the lock someone grabbed his arm and a familiar voice said youre nicked chapter eight you look like death warmed over thanks you know you shouldnt go around creeping up on people like that doing your sweeney impersonation you might get hurt you do seem very jumpy maybe ive got good reason to be care to tell me about it banks gave annie a look shed seen before it meant hed get her to play out her hand first and then decide how much to share with her so be it all right annie said how about a drink they were sitting in roys kitchen afternoon sunlight pouring in through the open window banks picked a bottle of château kirwan from the wine rack and annie watched him attack it with an expensive and complicated opener a simple corkscrew would have taken less time she thought after banks poured they sat opposite each other in silence whos going first annie asked how did you find me that doesnt matter the point is that i have found you no said banks the point is why were you looking for me why come all the way down here when im sure youve got more important things to do you really dont know ive got no idea as far as youre concerned im on holiday do you know something i dont lots of things probably no need to be sarcastic annie flushed she hadnt meant to be sarcastic but he was driving her to it she knew she used sarcasm to hide behind when she was feeling vulnerable or confused the way others hide behind smoking or bad jokes she realized it probably wasnt the right time but she didnt think she could go on talking to banks unless she cleared the air he would have to meet her halfway the last time she had tried to reach out to him and heal the rift he had dismissed her she polished off her glass and held it out for a refill dutch courage banks narrowed his eyes and poured im sorry annie said i dont mean to be sarcastic after everything thats happened things just seem to come out wrong banks caught her eye for a moment then gazed past her out of the window there were flowering shrubs outside in the backyard and annie could hear bees buzzing from one to another behind her impulsively she reached across the table and put her hand on his arm what is it alan we cant go on like this you cant go on like this banks didnt flinch when she touched him but he didnt say anything at first just kept staring over her shoulder through the window finally he turned his eyes back to her youre right he said i feel as if ive been a long long way from everything that used to matter but im getting closer again light at the end of the tunnel and all the other clichés yes im glad annie said feeling herself choke up there was so much more to say but she sensed that now was not the time besides there were other things of more immediate concern that they needed to talk about she took another sip of wine definitely not your everyday quaffing plonk banks lit a cigarette i thought youd stopped that annie said i had said banks its only a temporary return i hope so why do you want to see me have you heard about the woman found dead in the car near eastvale ive read about it in the paper banks said but they havent really given out much information her name is jennifer clewes do you know anyone by that name no said banks guess what we found in the back pocket of her jeans ive no idea an address whose address yours bankss jaw dropped what i cant whats her name again jennifer clewes ive never heard of her whats it all about we dont know yet she had your address and directions written on a slip of paper in her back pocket in her own handwriting annie went on the directions were to the damaged cottage it looks as if it has been broken into you can imagine what a flap it created up there finding your name and address on a victims person superintendent gristhorpe decided to sit on it until monday annie could see that banks was thinking furiously trying to make things connect come on alan give she said you know something what is it i dont know anything im telling the truth ive never heard of the girl but you know something i can tell its complicated ive got time annie was feeling a little tipsy from the wine but what the hell she thought in for a penny in for a pound maybe you can start she went on by telling me what youre doing here last i heard you and your brother were hardly on the best of terms hes disappeared banks said what banks told her about roys phone call and the empty unlocked house have you reported this banks said nothing just stared over her shoulder out of the window you havent have you why does everyone keep going on about it so said banks with a sudden flash of anger you know as well as i do how much effort wed put into looking for a missing adult when hes been gone less than fortyeight hours ive probably done more myself than the locals would have who are you trying to convince listen to yourself there are suspicious circumstances and you know it you told me he said it was a matter of life and death might be a matter of life and death fair enough you want to split hairs ill say no more right now but dont forget it might be your brothers life youre playing fast and loose with for christs sake alan you shouldnt even be here thanks for reminding me oh sometimes i just wish youd grow up you might be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel but quite frankly youre still a mess youve done nothing but paperwork for the past few months youve barely spoken to a soul you rarely bother to shave you need a haircut and youre halfpissed most of the time i was in your flat ive seen how you live there was no point going on at him annie knew she just had to let her frustration out from time to time what put you in such a good mood banks said annie just shook her head look i know youre concerned she went on in a softer tone i know youre worried about your brother but youve got to stop being so stubborn for his sake as well as your own youre probably right banks said but look at it from my point of view im worried they might find out a few things about roy our parents would rather not know and i know theres no way theyll let me work on the case if it becomes official besides how can i know the jobs being done properly if i dont do it myself sometimes i wonder how you made dci annie said such skills of delegation banks laughed annie was surprised and it broke the tension are you sure youve never heard of jennifer clewes she went on youve no idea why she should have your address in her pocket theres a jenn in roys mobile call list thats what her friends called her wait here a minute banks disappeared upstairs annie sipped more wine and looked around the kitchen expensive she thought especially for a room that didnt get used much banks soon returned with a bulging folder under his arm sat back down and started flipping through pages do you have her phone number he asked her mobiles missing but i got the number from her flatmate annie read out the number from her notebook it was the same one banks had on roys call list my god said annie so there definitely is a connection between jennifer clewes and your brother roy corinne was right he did have a new girlfriend corinne roys fiancée exfiancée from now on this is official annie said im going to have a word with di brooke about your brothers disappearance he wont be happy suit yourself said banks look annie went on trying to placate him you know youre too personally involved to be assigned to the case either case but that doesnt mean you cant be of some use on whose terms annie managed a thin smile well its not as if anyones going to be keeping tabs on you twentyfour hours a day is it as long as we stay on the same page banks nodded i suppose thats the best i can hope for all i ask is that you share with me any sign of a carmen petri on that list by the way carmen i dont remember one its an unusual name let me have a look banks glanced through the list of names no he said why who is she i dont know said annie the name just turned up in one of my interviews so how do you think it all connects lets review what we know the way it looks is that someone was watching jennifers house in kennington on friday evening said annie maybe other evenings too that week waiting for her we dont know why one witness has already confirmed there was a dark blue car parked near her flat with two men inside around the time she set off one in the front and one in the back and hed seen it there before the same car or at least we think its the same car was seen at the watford gap service station where jennifer stopped to eat and fill up with petrol it cut off another driver pulling in right behind her when she left the only halfdecent description we have is of the man in the back muscular with a ponytail is that the man who killed her we dont know but its the best lead weve got so far stefans working overtime on the scene unfortunately the pursuing car wasnt scratched or anything so weve no paint chips to go on but why would roy send this woman to see me why not come himself i dont know her flatmate said jennifer received a phone call around a quarter to eleven that friday and left right after said it shook her up a bit did your brother sound worried when he heard the doorbell annie asked no said banks ive thought a lot about that and he sounded fine i mean if hed been worried it was someone come to do him harm he wouldnt have answered it would he hed probably have tried to scarper out of the back window besides the bloke across the street said roy just locked his door and got into the car with his visitor as if things were quite normal so what do you think happened ive been trying to piece together the events of that day banks said the way i see it is that roy comes home just before half past nine from where i dont know but something has upset him he puts his mobile on the kitchen table or its already there pours himself a glass of wine and goes up to his office to check phone messages email or whatever he takes the wine with him maybe he sits and mulls things over for a minute or two then he decides that whatever it is hes found out is worth calling his estranged policeman brother about maybe he even senses that hes in danger because of something he knows anyway he phones me and tells me he needs my help while hes on the phone the doorbell rings he answers it and goes off in a car with whoever it is willingly it appears and he forgets his mobile even though hes given me the number id say that means hes more than a little distracted maybe it was roy who rang jennifer later then annie suggested and gave her directions to my cottage and told her to set off right there and then because he couldnt come himself maybe it was but why what happened between half past nine and a quarter to eleven that we dont know annie paused poor lass she said everything ive found out about jennifer tells me she was a decent hardworking caring person perhaps a bit naive and idealistic so what got her killed i wish i knew annie sipped her wine the light changed and she could tell that clouds were gathering the world darkening around them what are you going to do next carry on my own personal covert operation said banks annie smiled what can i say nothing you ill talk to dave brooke as soon as i can and im pretty sure hell want to see you i mean it alan our cases have crossed and im not leaving any loose ends besides given what happened to jennifer clewes roy could be in danger have you thought about that i havent thought about much else said banks mostly ive been thinking that hes done a runner with kidnapping a distant second your connecting him with the murdered girl puts a different complexion on things im glad you see it that way if youd bothered to keep in touch we might have got to this point ages ago how was i to know you were looking for me you know what i mean anyway ive still got a couple of things to do tomorrow jennifer was killed on our patch but her life was down here it makes things awkward so what do you have to do visit jennifers workplace for a start she worked at a familyplanning center in knightsbridge it whats it called banks asked the bergerlennox centre why banks opened the folder again and started turning over sheets of paper some of them covered with his own spidery scrawl finally he pointed to a printed sheet i thought i remembered the name he said its one of the centers roy invested in one of julian harwoods companies are you sure thats where jennifer clewes worked yes perhaps thats where they met then harwood told me that roys a handson sort of investor likes to check out his assets and if jennifer clewes was a goodlooking young woman which she was said annie bingo it doesnt necessarily mean anything maybe not said banks but its another connection one person murdered another disappeared her phone number is in his book my address is in her back pocket and they have this familyplanning center in common i dont know about you but thats way too many coincidences for me maybe ill go with you tomorrow find out for certain someone must remember if roys been there annie paused she wanted to be diplomatic but didnt quite know how to do it in the end she threw caution to the wind you cant she said you know you cant its not your case ive already made it clear im making your brothers disappearance official and im giving you a bit of room to maneuver but you cant just come muscling in you have no official standing in the jennifer clewes investigation whatsoever but what if theres a connection with whats happened to roy look alan youve got no official standing there either im not taking you with me and thats that fine said banks okay i understand dont sulk it doesnt suit you annie stood up she felt a little wobbly but it was nothing she couldnt handle and stick around di brooke will be wanting to take your statement annie heard a light tapping sound on the leaves behind her it quickly grew louder and faster the rain had started again it was early evening and banks was sitting in roys office reading through the files of correspondence corinne had printed out when he heard someone at the door at first he thought it might be roy but why would he be knocking at his own door then he thought it might be di brooke come to interview him and decided it would be best to get it over with even so he looked for some sort of weapon just in case all he could find was a set of golf clubs in the landing cupboard so he grasped one of the irons and answered the door the man who stood there was about bankss age he was wearing a dark suit had a neat side parting in his graying black hair and a serious intelligent look in his eyes he could have been a policeman banks thought except that he was wearing a clerical collar he looked at the golf club and at banks hello he said reaching his hand out tentatively hunts the name ian hunt roy home banks shook his hand it felt damp and cool no he said im his brother alan whats it about hes mentioned you said hunt the policeman but i didnt think never mind banks had a good idea what ian hunt didnt think but he kept quiet he needed all the information he could get and a defensive attitude from the outset wouldnt help matters much he wondered what the hell the vicar was doing calling around at roys house would you like to come in yes yes please if its all right banks propped the golf club by the front door and led the way to the kitchen at the back where he had recently sat with annie and offered hunt a chair hunt made no comment about the club banks didnt want to seem as if he was interrogating the man but he realized he had practically forgotten the simple art of conversation after all his years in the force his job affected the way he saw and dealt with everyone he had even been brusque with corinne why did you want to see roy he asked no real reason hunt said only he didnt turn up at church this morning and thats not like him banks nearly fell off his chair church wonders never cease yes why whats so strange about that nothing said banks who hadnt set foot inside a church since his childhood except for weddings and funerals he and roy hadnt been given a particularly religious upbringing and neither of their parents had been regular churchgoers at school back in those days there were prayers and a hymn every morning of course but apart from a few years of sunday school and a brief stint in the lifeboys and boys brigade that had been it as far as banks was concerned now this normally i wouldnt bother dropping by said hunt but there was a meeting of the restoration fund committee after the service and roy has always been a keen contributor not only financially you understand but also in terms of ideas very creative mind roy cup of tea vicar please and call me ian unless you want me to call you chief inspector ian it is banks put the kettle on tea with the vicar on a sunday afternoon he thought how very genteel this wasnt a world he would ever have suspected roy of inhabiting he found the tea bags next to the coffee and put two in the flowerpatterned teapot if you dont mind me asking said banks as the kettle was coming to a boil when did roy start going to church i dont mind at all said hunt he started attending services on the sixteenth of september i didnt expect you to remember the exact date banks said but how could i forget youd be surprised how many people returned to the church or first started attending around that time banks had to think for a moment before he realized the significance of the date it must have been the first sunday after the attack on the world trade center but why should that affect roy so much he poured boiling water into the pot what drew him there he asked hunt paused you really dont know much about your brother do you no said banks and the more i find out the less i know thats the universal paradox of knowledge maybe so said banks but at the moment im interested in more practical knowledge i dont suppose you have any idea where roy might be hunt blinked i was the one who came here looking for him remember even so hunt looked at banks with curiosity in his eyes i can see youve been trained not to take anything at face value he said no i have no idea where he is why did you come here i told you the meeting its not like roy not to even leave a message when did you last see him last sunday did you talk to him we chatted briefly after the service how did he seem fine quite normal banks got the milk from the fridge giving it a quick sniff to see if it was still all right poured the tea then sat down opposite hunt i dont mean to seem so abrupt he said but im concerned roy left a rather disturbing message on my answering service and when i came down here to see him hed disappeared and the front door was unlocked i can see why you would be concerned said hunt so the two of you chatted often yes said hunt wed often spend an hour or two together usually at the vicarage sometimes over lunch roy lunching at the vicarage was an image banks found very hard to visualize did he open up to you i mean did he i know what you mean hunt shifted in his chair yes id say he opened up about his feelings at least to some extent feelings about what many things im afraid thats a bit too vague for me said banks do you think you could be more specific its not as if you took his confession or anything banks realized that he hadnt ascertained what denomination hunt represented i mean youre not catholic are you church of england but i dont know how much i can help you roy never went into great detail about anything he did i dont suppose he would said banks but did you get any idea why he started attending church on the sixteenth of september other than some vague sense of unease about the way the world was going it wasnt that hunt took a deep breath its my feeling that your brother had lost his moral compass had become so engrossed in the making of money that how he made it no longer mattered to him hes not unusual in that said banks no but its my guess that what happened in new york on the eleventh brought it home to him in no uncertain terms youre not saying he was somehow connected to the attacks are you oh no said hunt no youre missing the point entirely what then didnt he tell you he was there banks had to pause a moment to take this in roy was in new york when the attacks took place ian hunt nodded according to what he told me he had an appointment with a banker in the second tower he was running late and his taxi got caught up in traffic the next thing he knew everyone was coming to a halt and getting out of their cars some of them pointing up roy got out too and he couldnt believe what he was seeing the smoke and flames people jumping out of windows it took him three days to get on a flight home jesus christ said banks sorry he never told me this but youre not close are you no anyway it gave him pause for thought the enormity of it all fate how everything was connected what unimaginable consequences could arise from seemingly unimportant unrelated actions these were all things he wanted to talk about i had no answers but he seemed to find something of what he wanted in the church in prayer holy communion and in our discussions banks remembered what burgess had said about the arms deal roy had found out that a shipment he had brokered had found its way into the wrong hands had roy really been so naive as to think that arms dealing was just a business like any other he probably hadnt given it too much thought banks decided lured by the money and the excitement warned off by special branch he had backed away from that line of work immediately but he had witnessed the attacks on the world trade center and he was stricken by conscience by the fact that guns or missiles he had exported could have been used in something like this roy realized he had crossed a line and he didnt like what he saw on the other side suicide bombers in distant desert places are one thing but being there in new york on the eleventh of september and witnessing what happened must have been devastating it certainly made it impossible for roy to remain willfully ignorant of the kind of things terrorists intended to do to the west given the means and opportunity and unknowingly or not roy had once helped out with the means hence the guilt roy had turned to the church for absolution this was a new perspective on his brother and one that would take banks a little time to get used to it certainly didnt match the roy he remembered from the last time he had seen him just eight months ago but then that had been royathome a careful image he projected for his parents had roy even told their parents what he had seen banks doubted it despite his religion though roy had continued to make money he had hardly given it all to charity and taken a vow of poverty or chastity for that matter clearly guilt only went so far and cut so deep so what had happened to him had he lost his moral compass again the making of money perhaps even more than the money itself was an addiction to some people like gambling heroin or cigarettes banks had given up smoking the previous summer when he found out that an old schoolfriend had died from lung cancer but he had started again after a fire took his home his possessions and almost his life where was the logic in that but such is the nature of addiction has anything in your recent conversations given you any reason to think roy might have got into some sort of dangerous gray area again banks asked no said hunt nothing he didnt mention his business activities we didnt talk about business our conversations were mostly of a philosophical and spiritual nature look i know roys not a natural man of religion and i very much doubt that hes a saint even after what happened but he does have a conscience and sometimes it troubles him hes still a hardnosed businessman the kind of person youd expect to cut a corner or two and not always ask too many questions but id say hes a lot more careful these days hes drawn his own lines hunt paused hes always looked up to you you know you could have fooled me growing up banks had done everything wrong he had stayed out too late got caught shoplifting and smoking got into fights neglected his schoolwork and the final insult he had turned away from business studies and chosen a career of which neither of his parents approved roy on the other hand from five years behind had watched his brothers progress and learned what not to do its true said ian hunt he did look up to you especially when you were children you just never paid him any attention you ignored him he felt neglected rejected as if he always let you down he was my little brother said banks hunt nodded and always in the way banks remembered when he was going out with kay summerville his first serious girlfriend roy was about twelve at the time and whenever their parents went out for a night at the local pub and banks invited kay over to listen to records among other things he would always have to pay roy to stay in his room so maybe roy was always in the way banks thought but he found the means to profit from it anyway banks said i wasnt aware that he looked up to me in any way he certainly never let it show im not saying roy isnt competitive you were good at sports for example he wasnt so he worked hard at what he did best he compensated good banks had been a tolerable fly halfback then fast and slippery at cricket he hadnt been much cop as a batsman but had been a decent midpace bowler roy had been an overweight bespectacled and unattractive child not at all athletic and at school the other kids teased him and called him a swot once the bullying got serious enough that bank stepped in and put an end to it so no one could say he never did anything for roy but he certainly hadnt done enough even now he looks up to you hunt went on that i find even harder to believe said banks wondering what there was to look up to a failed marriage and a thankless job especially when roy had it all the flashy car women falling at his feet the mews house but they were all things banks realized all material possessions even the women to some extent were status symbols look at me with a beautiful young woman on my arm all for show roys three marriages had ended in divorce and not one of them had produced any children he had even broken off his engagement to corinne banks at least had brian and tracy he saw that hunt was standing ready to leave sorry said banks just thinking about what you said thats all right said hunt i should go im just sorry i couldnt be of more practical help if theres anything you need dont hesitate its st judes just down the street thanks oh hang on a minute banks fetched one of the digital photos and showed it to hunt do you recognize either of those men hunt shook his head youve never seen roy with either of them no never they shook hands again and ian hunt left maybe the mistake banks had made in trying to figure roy out was to dismiss his spiritual and emotional sides now he had discovered that roy had become a regular churchgoer it changed things added a dimension he hadnt suspected did it help him figure out what had happened to roy perhaps not but it might affect the way in which he conducted his investigation previously hed been looking for something dodgy that roy had been connected to something he had perhaps run away from now though the field was wide open possibly roy had stumbled over something he shouldnt have or perhaps he had become a threat to people he had once worked closely with and instead of turning a blind eye he had planned on blowing the whistle but on what on whom gaps in the clouds let through bright lances of light and the western sky turned vermilion and violet the crowds queuing for the sunset ride on the london eye shifted restlessly in the downpour and people on westminster bridge watched the huge ferris wheel from under their umbrellas and rain hoods eightyearold michaela toth had been excited all day about the promised ride it was to be the highlight of her first ever weekend in london even better than madame tussauds and the zoo and her mum and dad were letting her stay up late especially even the rain didnt dampen her spirits as she stood in the queue hopping from foot to foot clutching her yellow plastic handbag with the pink flower on it it seemed as if they would never get there edging forward at a snails pace like this michaela could hardly believe that the eye was so much bigger than she had imagined or that it never stopped turning even when you got on and off the thought made her just a little bit scared but nicely so inch by inch they moved forward as soon as the cars emptied they filled up again a squat red tugboat chugged down the river leaving its arrowhead wake in the darkening water it was still light enough to see the men standing on the deck and michaela noticed one of them point in her direction at first she thought he was just pointing at the eye but more men joined him and the tug changed direction heading for the bank michaela tugged on her fathers hand and asked him to take her to the wall to see what the men were pointing toward at first she thought he wasnt going to but then she could tell he got curious too because he asked her mother to keep their place in the queue and said theyd be back in just a moment the tug was getting close to the embankment as they got to the railings beside the eye the people on westminster bridge were pointing their way now too and michaela wondered if theyd seen a dolphin or even a whale though she didnt really believe there were any whales or dolphins living in the river thames maybe one had escaped from an aquarium or maybe someone had fallen in the river and the men on the tugboat were going to rescue him holding her fathers hand michaela strained to see over the embankment wall she was just tall enough to manage it the tide was very low and a pebbly shingle bank stuck out of the water like a whales back just below the wall lying on the shingle bank was the sprawled figure of a man a dark shape he was lying on his stomach and his arms were stretched out in front of him his lower half in the water michaelas father pulled her away quickly what is it daddy she asked frightened whats that man doing there her father didnt answer he simply led her away when they rejoined her mother in the queue her father spoke and michaela heard the words dead body soon others started drifting toward the wall one woman screamed michaela worried she might not get her ride after all if there was a dead body down there perhaps the london eye would even stop turning after the reverend ian hunt had left banks put away the golf club feeling rather foolish locked up the house and went upstairs with the remains of his wine he rang julian harwood who confirmed that he was managing director of the bergerlennox centre but said he had never actually been to the place and had never heard of jennifer clewes banks had no reason to disbelieve him banks felt a sudden urge to listen to some music before bed he found a cd he had never heard before lorraine hunt lieberson singing two bach cantatas roys topoftheline stereo system brought out the rich timbre of the strings and when he closed his eyes banks could imagine himself in a room surrounded by the small ensemble and the voice was sublime almost enough to make you believe in god he thought of penny cartwright singing strange affair different but another wonderful voice banks sipped wine feeling a pleasant buzz he let the music roll over him and thought about annie roy jennifer clewes and the bergerlennox centre he would like to have been invited to go along with annie in the morning but she was right it wasnt his case and he was a bit of a mess when he examined his feelings it was curious how little her comments really hurt at the time they had stung but they had quickly sunk in and he knew they were true he had let things go if he wasnt as bad as the hapless fellow in one of his favorite nick lowe songs he had been getting there perhaps a few months ago before the phil keane business annie would have welcomed his company but now she didnt quite seem to trust him and she was right not to do so the last thing he had on his mind was going back up to yorkshire the cd finished and banks looked for something else to put on roy didnt have the mahler songs but he did have strausss four last songs one of bankss favorite pieces of music so he put that on as it turned out he wasnt far into the second song when he heard the phone ring in roys office putting his glass down he hurried across the landing to answer it the london eye towered over the scene a huge dark semicircle against the moonlit clouds it was closed for the night now but still turning slowly always turning nearby on the stone steps that led down to the hump of shingle bank bared by the tide the socos came and went like ghosts in their protective clothing it was a precise ballet in which every dancer knew his steps despite the occasional shout and chatter or static over police radios there was an odd hush about the scene and no sense of hurry as if the mighty heart of the city were lying still even the media beyond the tapedoff area were strangely quiet arc lamps lit rough slimy stone shingle and greasy water alike and a police video camera recorded everything the rain had stopped and from westminster bridge a few curious onlookers watched over it all silhouettes against the light dying in the west when banks arrived at the tapedoff area burgess was already waiting for him a grim look on his face he had explained to banks over the telephone that when he saw on the news that the body of a white male about roys age had washed up by the london eye his alarm bells had gone off they had found no identification on the body so there was no evidence yet that it was roy and indeed he hoped it wasnt but it might be worth bankss coming along and having a look banks hadnt needed to be asked twice burgess took him by the arm and led him over to a thickset man with a red moonshaped face di brooke lambeth north said burgess meet dci banks north yorkshire major crimes the two men nodded at each other di brooke said banks youll be the chap annie cabbots working with on the jennifer clewes case annie and i go back a long way banks gestured toward the river is he still down there the police surgeons pronounced death but the socos havent finished yet theyll have to move fast though because the tides coming in brooke paused and looked down at his feet look superintendent burgess here told me he thinks theres a possibility it might be your brother down there i hope to god its not said banks but its a possibility yes hes missing sorry to have to put you through this better than not knowing said banks can we go down theres some extra overalls in the socos van and mind your step those old stone stairs are worn and slippery kitted out in protective clothing banks and burgess showed their identifications to the officer guarding the scene ducked under the tape and approached the steps the landing at the bottom didnt quite reach as far as the exposed shingle bank so the socos had already set up a makeshift bridge made of planks it wobbled a little as banks and burgess crossed once banks almost lost his footing and he became suddenly aware of how much he had had to drink that day water lapped gently against the stone wall banks felt a tightness in his chest as he approached the shingle bank and breathing became an effort burgess gave a nod and one of the socos gently turned the body so that the face was visible banks squatted feeling his knees crack and looked into roys dead eyes there was a little hole in his left temple close to the childhood scar banks had accidentally inflicted on roy with a toy sword banks felt himself sway on his haunches and stood up so fast it made him dizzy burgess grabbed his elbow im all right said banks disengaging himself is it him its him banks said and the only thing he could think as he tried to rein in his surging emotions was what the hell am i going to say to my parents lets get back up on shore burgess said banks followed him back over the planks and up the steps brooke and his ds were waiting for confirmation the sooner you identified the body banks knew the sooner you put the machinery of a major investigation in motion he nodded to brooke im sorry brooke said look said banks do you think you could keep it under wraps his identity that is id like to be the one who tells our parents in person but not tonight its too late brooke looked at the crowd on the bridge and the reporters and camera operators behind the crime scene tape we can tell them were still awaiting official identification of the body he said that should hold them off for a while first thing tomorrow said banks just not tonight he prayed he couldnt stand the idea of going over to peterborough right now and waking his parents up and spending the night comforting them in their grief knowing they would probably prefer it were alan rather than roy daylight would make it easier he thought let them have just one more night of peace there would soon be enough dreadful nights to come can you tell annie for me please he asked of course in the morning thanks brooke paused im sure you know i was intending to visit you anyway he said in fact di cabbot and i had a little word about you earlier this evening i thought you might said banks this changes everything of course but ive still got some questions for you brooke went on when youre up to it that is im up to it now said banks right superintendent burgess tells me youve been stopping at your brothers house how about we go there fine said banks fumbling in his jacket pocket for his cigarettes lets go chapter nine the bergerlennox centre opened at nine oclock on monday morning and annie was there on the dot the center took up the first two floors of a fourstory georgian crescent house in knightsbridge which looked like something out of upstairs downstairs still when you paid through the nose for the service annie reflected you didnt expect some prefab concreteand glass block building as soon as she got through the front door the impression of elegant age gave way to one of muted modernity the walls were painted in soft pastel hues and there was a kind of hissing hush about the place that made her ears feel stuffedup as if she were in an airplane it took her a moment to notice the music playing softly in the background something classical and soothing something banks would probably recognize the scent of sandalwood in the air triggered a sudden vision of annies mother jane leaning over her smiling the image shocked her as her mother had died when annie was six and she didnt remember much about her but now she could almost feel the long soft hair tickling her face jane had been something of a hippie and annie remembered that sandalwood incense had often been burning in the artists commune where she had grown up the memory also made her realize how far she had moved away over the past few years from so many of the ideals of her youth and she felt the urge to spend more time on yoga and meditation she hadnt practiced at all since the business with phil keane the blonde behind the polished wood reception desk looked up from her computer monitor and smiled as annie approached a brass plate on her desk said her name was carol prescott behind her in the openplan office space a young woman stood at an open filing cabinet annie showed her warrant card and explained that she was investigating jennifer clewess murder carols public smile dropped and was replaced by an expression of sadness her eyes moistened slightly poor jennifer she said it was in the paper this morning she was really sweet i cant imagine why anyone would want to do something like that to her i dont know what the worlds coming to did you know her well she was my boss we didnt socialize outside the center or anything but she was always ready with a hello and a smile how was her state of mind recently fine said carol though come to think of it she did seem a bit scatterbrained last week any idea why no she just seemed sort of on edge was she happy working here she always seemed to be but i didnt know her well enough for her to confide in me anyway how can you tell if someone is really happy i mean you read in the papers about people killing themselves when their friends think theyve got everything to live for dont you sometimes annie said but jennifer didnt kill herself no i know that im sorry no need to be look i want to speak to a few people here people who knew her but maybe you can give me a bit of background on the place first the phone rang and carol excused herself she adopted her professional voice and made a consultation appointment for a new patient sorry she said when shed hung up of course ill fill you in on what i can how many people work here seven said carol thats including jennifer she was administrative director of the center then theres her assistant lucy behind me there in the office andrea and georgina are our two consultation advisers counselors then theres dr alex lukas the medical director and nurse louise griffiths whats julian harwoods role mr harwood hes managing director of the whole group but we never see him i mean he doesnt really have anything to do with the daytoday running of the center or with the clinics clinics yes we dont carry out terminations here if a client decides thats the route she wants to go we make an appointment at whichever of our clinics is most convenient for her i see said annie so this center wouldnt be a magnet for antiabortion activists hardly said carol weve had one or two small demonstrations you know when theres somethings in the news but nothing violent we offer advice on all aspects of family planning not just abortion how does the system work carol sat back in her chair well she said first they come to me or phone and i explain what our services and charges are and give them some pamphlets to read then i send them to lucy who handles the preliminary paperwork usually at that point louise runs a proper pregnancy test just to make sure we usually tell them to bring a urine sample with them but there are facilities here if they forget anyway then theyll go to the waiting room where they can read through the brochures until andrea or georgina is ready to see them then what its up to them really our counselors will ask a few personal questions and theyll also answer any questions the client has at that point youd be surprised how many are confused by their pregnancies poor things no i wouldnt thought annie she had become pregnant after a rape and while there was no doubt that she was going to have an abortion she could remember the inner turmoil and the guilt she felt and annie thought of herself as a modern forwardthinking woman very few women if any approached termination lightly after that theyll discuss the choices available carol went on give guidance and advice if necessary theyre specially trained then the client sees dr lukas who asks them about their medical history and examines them to confirm the gestation of the pregnancy then nurse griffiths takes a blood sample theres more paperwork consent forms and so on and the doctor will discuss the different methods available and help you decide on the type of procedure most suitable what if the client decides against abortion then andrea or georgina will give her information about adoption agencies and so on shell still see the doctor though to determine her general health and so on do you offer antenatal care no not here at any rate we usually refer you say jennifer was the administrative director what exactly was she responsible for everything to do with the running of the place except the medical side thats an awful lot of work said carol sometimes she had to work late just to keep up that reminds me said annie have you ever heard the term late girls carol frowned late girls no why what does it mean thats what im trying to find out im sorry but its not familiar to me do you remember ever having a client here called carmen petri no youre sure you can ask lucy to check the records but i think i would remember a name like that probably said annie lucy and jennifer were close were they they worked together jennifer was lucys boss too so that always puts a bit of wedge between you doesnt it not that jennifer was one to play the high and mighty who was closest to her carol thought for a moment then said georgina id say theyd talk about the center some of the clients and i think they even went out for a drink a couple of times after work if jennifer didnt have to stay late thanks said annie is georgina in this morning yes shes in her office carol picked up her phone i dont think theres anyone with her right now would you like me to let her know you want to see her thats all right said annie who preferred the element of surprise you can just show me where her office is carols hand faltered clearly this went against standard procedure okay she said putting the phone back its up the stairs second door on the right its got her name on it georgina roberts did you ever have any trouble with a man called victor parsons annie asked hes an exboyfriend of jennifers oh him i remember him all right had to get security to throw him out what was he doing making a fuss upsetting our clients about what he demanded to see jennifer but shed given me instructions not to let him in what happened he went away in the end did this happen more than once the first time he went without too much fuss it was the second time i had to get security twice then did he make any threats not that i heard he just said hed be back when was this couple of weeks ago that recently annie thought yet jennifer and victor had split up over a year ago anyone who could maintain a fixation for that long was definitely worth looking at one more thing said annie have you ever seen anyone by the name of roy banks here at the center carols face brightened then reddened a little mr banks yes of course he and jennifer were you know an item i know shes a bit young for him but he really is quite tasty i dont blame her at all her face fell oh poor mr banks hell be just devastated does he know not yet said annie so he came here quite often quite hed pick jennifer up after work sometimes and wed chat if he had to wait what about oh nothing in particular films the weather just small talk and arsenal were both big arsenal fans was he ever here at the same time as victor parsons no you know he was an investor in the centers yes he mentioned it once but he didnt have any airs or graces is that why he came here the first time when he met jennifer oh no said carol no he was here as a client accompanying a client i should say now it was annies turn to feel surprised accompanying a client yes said carol his daughter she was pregnant long before annie paid her visit to the bergerlennox centre banks was plowing his way through the mondaymorning rushhour traffic on his way to peterborough he felt numb after grappling with the demons of fear and loss most of the night but he also felt apprehensive about what was to come his parents doted on roy something like this could push his fathers heart over the edge but he had to tell them himself he couldnt let the news come from some anonymous copper knocking on the door brooke had gone out of his way to protect the identity of the victim from the media as soon as banks had told his parents he had to ring brooke and tell him it was done the rest would follow he remembered he had also promised to keep corinne and roys neighbor malcolm farrow uptodate but they would have to wait their turn after some relatively gentle questioning very gentle given the circumstances banks had handed over roys mobile the usb drive and the cd to brooke and tried to get some sleep the effects of the wine were fast wearing off leaving him with a throbbing head and sleep had refused to come luckily there wasnt much of the night left by then and the dawn came early in june at six oclock banks was in the shower then it was time to go pick up his car from where he had left it last night near waterloo station pick up a coffee for the road and head for home progress was slower than banks remembered or expected and a journey that should have taken under two hours took almost three every time the news came on the radio no matter what station he tuned into there was the story about the mystery body fished out of the river thames just below the london eye last night in the end banks turned it off when he finally pulled up outside his parents house in peterborough it was close to ten oclock back in london the murder investigation would be following its natural course the technical support unit experts would be going over roys mobile and the socos would be tracking every piece of evidence retrieved from the crime scene dcs would be out on the streets asking questions and brooke would be sifting through it all looking for that promising line of inquiry the front door was painted green banks noticed which was surely different from his last visit the tiny lawn looked a little overgrown and some of the flowers in the bed didnt look in peak condition that wasnt like his mother he knocked and waited his mother answered and was naturally surprised to see him she had lost weight banks noticed and looked tired and drawn with dark crescents under her eyes god only knew what the news of roys murder would do to her he could tell that she knew something was wrong by her ceaseless nervous chatter as she led him into the living room where his father sat in his usual armchair newspaper on his lap look who it is arthur its our alan come to call maybe it was bankss imagination but he thought he sensed just the slightest air of neglect about the place a patina of dust on the tv screen a picture frame out of alignment a teacup and saucer on the floor beside the settee a slight bunching of the rug in front of the fire hello son said arthur banks just happened to be passing did you not exactly said banks perching on the edge of the sofa his mother fussed about heading for the kitchen to put on the kettle for that great english cureall tea banks called her back there would be time and need enough for copious quantities of tea later on his way he had rehearsed what he was going to say over and over how he was going to handle it but now the time had come he couldnt remember what he had decided would be best its about roy he began did you find him ida banks asked in a way banks leaned forward and took his mothers hand this was even harder than he had imagined it might be the words seemed stuck deep inside him and when he spoke they came out as little more than a whisper he wasnt at home and i looked for him all weekend i did my best mum honestly i did but i was too late he felt the tears brim in his eyes and let them course down his cheeks too late what do you mean too late wheres he gone roys dead mum there hed said it im afraid hes gone are you sure ida banks asked maybe hes only joking banks thought hed misheard what he asked wiping his face with the back of his hand ida banks laughed and touched her hair dont you understand she said its a joke our roys a great practical joker isnt he arthur hes playing a joke on us arthur banks said nothing banks noticed he had turned pale and seemed to be clutching the newspaper tightly by its edges it was already ripped dad can i get you anything do you need a pill or something no arthur banks managed nothing im all right go on what happened theres not much more to say banks said turning back to his mother they found him last night in the river swimming in the river ida banks said but surely the waters too dirty to swim in i always told him he had to be careful you can get terrible diseases from dirty water you know he wasnt swimming mother said banks he was dead his mother took a sharp breath dont say that she said you shouldnt say things like that tell him arthur youre only trying to upset me you never did like roy if this is supposed to be some sort of joke then it isnt very funny its not a joke arthur banks stood up with some difficulty and shuffled over to his wife i think wed better have that tea now love he said then our alan can explain it all over a nice cuppa ida banks nodded happy to have a purpose in life yes she said thatll be best ill make some tea when she had gone to the kitchen arthur banks turned to his son theres no mistake then sorry dad his father grunted and glanced toward the kitchen shes not been well shes got to go in for tests and stuff we didnt want to worry you doctors havent figured out whats wrong with her yet but shes not been well shes not eating properly she gets confused arthur banks pointed to his newspaper its that story in the paper isnt it the body pulled out of the thames its on the front page thats our roy isnt it yes said banks weve managed to keep his identity from the media so far but itll have to come out its going to get worse dad our roy was shot we dont know why yet but its a big story reporters will be around dont you worry son ill soon send that lot packing it might not be as easy as you think ill get in touch with the local police if you like banks knew his fathers attitude to the police had suffered it all his life but the need to protect his parents was stronger even than his respect for the old mans opinion whatever you thinks best i just dont know i cant seem to think straight our roy dead its a terrible thing when your children die before you do shot no i can hardly believe it banks felt a sudden chill a premonition of what he would feel like if anything happened to tracy or brian and it gave him a stronger sense of empathy with what his parents were suffering for him it was the loss of a brother perhaps one he never particularly liked and never really knew but family nonetheless and it hurt for his parents it was the loss of their favorite son i know dad he said and im sorry to be the one to have to tell you but i just didnt want you to find out any other way i appreciate that said arthur banks looking at his son it cant have been easy will we have to identify the body its been done what about the funeral ill deal with all that dad dont worry yourself what was he i mean would it have been quick yes said banks he wouldnt have felt a thing except the fear the anticipation he thought but didnt say the paper said he was in the river yes he was spotted on a shingle bank just below the london eye you dont know where he went in not yet the tides and currents are pretty strong especially with the rain weve been having its for the experts to figure out do you know anything about why was he in trouble i think he was said banks roy always sailed a bit close to the wind yes he did banks agreed but somehow this time i dont think thats what it was whys that just a feeling theres been another murder a young woman they might be connected arthur banks rubbed his face not that girl he brought around last year corinne no dad corinnes fine its someone else her names jennifer clewes did roy ever mention her to you no look ill help around here all i can said banks but i might be more use back in london trying to find out what happened thats what i do after all right now though im just worried about you and mum is there someone youd like me to call uncle frank perhaps bloody hell no hed be more a hindrance than a help would frank no you leave it to me ill handle your mother maybe if she wants ill ask mrs green to pop over later thats a good idea im sure at that moment banks and his father heard a cup break on the kitchen floor followed by a long wail of anguish that froze their blood annie mulled over the information shed got from carol prescott as she made her way upstairs to georginas office after a quick word with lucy who had nothing much to say except that jennifer was a good boss and a nice person annie certainly hadnt known that roy banks had a daughter it had been in april carol said and the girl eleven weeks pregnant had opted for an abortion which had cost roy banks about five hundred pounds in all roy had met jennifer then carol remembered them chatting while the daughter went through her meetings with the counselor and doctor since then he had been by a number of times to meet her after work or take her for lunch the name carol gave annie rang a bell corinne banks had mentioned that roy had a girlfriend called corinne either roy banks had passed off his girlfriend as his daughter for reasons of his or her own or the people at the center had simply assumed she was his daughter because of the age difference but wouldnt they have seen her name on the forms still for all they knew she could have been divorced yet kept her married name annie supposed perhaps this was a different corinne when annie asked carol if roy had specifically mentioned the girl being his daughter she couldnt recall and she said she didnt really pay attention to the girls name well annie told herself it probably meant nothing she already knew that roy banks and jennifer clewes were seeing each other no matter how they first met it didnt show roy banks in a particularly good light annie thought chatting up his next girlfriend while bringing in last years model for an abortion but worse things happened he probably got a discount for being an investor too and what had jennifer thought about it by all accounts she was a nice girl decent caring hardworking she had never mentioned the daughter at work roy banks must have a hell of a smooth tongue on him annie thought to explain that one away annie knocked on georginas office door come in called a voice from inside annie entered and found a pleasantly plump woman with dark curly hair and the hint of a double chin sitting behind a desk she looked as if her normal expression was a smile today though it was banished in favor of a frown annie introduced herself and the frown lines deepened i understand the two of you were quite close she said yes georgina agreed id like to think we were friends im simply devastated by whats happened i know that sounds like a cliché but i just cant articulate my feelings any more clearly im very sorry said annie would you like me to get us some coffee georgina suggested its really not that bad no thanks ive had my ration for today georgina stood up would you mind if i its not far i wont be a minute sit down make yourself at home go ahead left alone annie first walked over to the open window which looked out on the hustle and bustle of the street below delivery vans came and went taxis stopped to pick up or drop off fares men and women in business suits dashed across the roads before the lights changed annie sat down the room was painted a soothing shade of blue and it reminded her immediately of bankss old living room at the cottage various framed certificates hung on the walls along with a monet water lilies print there were no family photographs on georginas desk the room was sparsely decorated no filing cabinets bookcases or computer and annie guessed its primary purpose was to put people at ease georgina no doubt had her files and books stored elsewhere moments later georgina reappeared with a mug of milky coffee ive asked carol to hold all the calls so were not disturbed she said though i dont see how i can help you thats what everybody thinks said annie but youd be surprised first of all how long had you known jennifer about two years i was here when she started what was she like in what way whatever comes to mind she was good at her job it was important to her thats why i mention it she was considerate cared about people maybe a bit too much what do you mean well as a counselor you come into touch with a lot of grief a lot of people with problems you learn to sort of separate it out of your normal life distance yourself a little bit i dont think jenn could have done that so easily thats probably why she was in administration did she get friendly with the clients here i wouldnt say friendly but she did take an interest we run a very open office everybody pitches in you know one day some poor girl would bust into tears and jenn would be the first one over to comfort her with a clean hankie and a few kind words that sort of thing but she didnt socialize with clients not that i know of oh i suppose there was that girl she shared the flat with kate but that was different kate wasnt pregnant she just had a pregnancy test and that was that what about roy banks said annie she met him here didnt she when he was bringing his daughter in i wouldnt know about that she never mentioned how they met no jenn didnt like to discuss her private life not in any detail didnt you counsel corinne is that her name no it must have been andrea im afraid shes on holiday at the moment never mind said annie making a note to ask banks about how things had been between roy and corinne how had jennifer been behaving during the past week or so did she seem worried upset depressed she certainly had something on her mind last week but she didnt tell you what it was no i didnt see much of her i was worked off my feet so we didnt get to have our little chats she didnt confide in you about anything that was bothering her no what about victor parsons that waste of space what about him i heard he caused a bit of trouble here at the center yes but hes all bluster i mean hes obnoxious enough but i cant imagine him doing you know what happened between them search me i think jenn wanted to settle down have a family but he wasnt interested to be quite honest from what i could gather hes a bit of a layabout a sponger she was well shut of him do you know if he ever hit her i dont think so at least she never said and i never saw any evidence of it the breakup hit her hard though she didnt say a lot but you could tell she was under a lot of stress poor thing she lost weight let herself go as you do but this was before roy banks oh yes shed bounced back by then even tried one or two dates they didnt lead anywhere but victor parsons turned up again as recently as two weeks ago i understand yes made a terrible scene i was down in reception at the time what did he say he begged her to go back with him said he couldnt live without her georginas lip curled in distaste pathetic little shit did he and roy banks ever bump into one another not that i know of but you think thats what might have been upsetting jennifer this last week victor or roy maybe theyd had a row or something bear in mind though im only guessing it could have been something else entirely you said she had a tendency for getting involved trying to help people yes did she have any particular causes lately i dont think so none that she mentioned to me anyway did she ever mention someone called carmen petri no not to my knowledge what about the late girls do you know what that means im afraid i dont what was the context it was just something jennifer said to a friend to describe this carmen person one of the late girls it still doesnt ring a bell no not at all i mean it could be someone late with her period or late in her pregnancy as you know the law only allows abortions up to the twentyfourth week yes said annie id thought of that apart from roy banks and this victor did jennifer have any other visitors here or any other friends you know about not that i know of do you know anyone who drives a dark mondeo either black or navy blue my father does but i doubt its him youre interested in annie smiled i doubt it no one else no sorry do you think jennifer would have confided in you if there was anything seriously wrong wrong say at the center something going on i cant imagine what you mean but she might have done the things is though if there was anything untoward going on here jenn would have been in the best position to know about it as she practically ran the place singlehanded her and alex lukas at any rate dr lukas alex doesnt stand on ceremony is he in today she its alexandra you might have noticed that the center prefers to employ women its not some sort of positive discrimination thing its just that weve noticed that the kind of clients we get here respond better to dealing with another woman annie understood she had felt the same when she went for her abortion she certainly wouldnt have wanted a man asking her questions or poking about inside her look georgina went on leaning forward so her ample bosom rested on the desk i cant imagine who would want to kill jennifer or why but i think youre barking up the wrong tree if you think it was anything to do with this place she had no enemies here im just trying to cover all the angles thats all a lot of police work is ms roberts covering the angles so you dont look stupid for missing something obvious a bit like counseling how well it seems a bit of a cliché asking people how they get on with their parents how they feel about their father but if it turned out there was an incestuous relationship youd look pretty damn silly for not even probing the area wouldnt you i see what you mean can you think of anything else that might help me im sorry no georgina paused look jenn wasnt raped or anything was she no because i thought that might be something the police were holding back like they do sometimes its important to keep key pieces of information from the public but not that jennifer was shot in the head pure and simple annie noticed georgina flinch at the brutality of the remark but what i cant understand georgina said is why on earth someone would want to kill her like that dont get me wrong im glad for her it was quick its just that i might be able to get my head around some pervert raping her and killing her to gratify his own filthy lust but this it doesnt make sense its almost as if someone actually had a reason for killing her well do our best to make sense of it said annie standing up to leave in the meantime if you can think of anything else at all and i do mean anything something jennifer might have said done not done whatever then please get in touch with me heres my card thank you georgina took the card and looked at it on her way to dr lukass office annies mobile rang she went into the stairwell took it out of her pocket and put it to her ear hello annie its dave here dave brooke what is it dave have you got something for me in a way brooke said brace yourself its not good news go on we found roy bankss body last night pulled him out of the thames near the eye my god that story in the paper this morning that was roy banks yes shot a twentytwo by the looks of it alan he identified the body asked us to sit on the identity until he told his parents he was pretty shaken up i can imagine poor alan said annie is there anything i can do not right now hes gone off to peterborough i just heard from him hes going to stay with his parents for a while i just thought you should know yes thanks dave bloody hell whats going on i wish i knew chapter ten the banks family had been seeing dr grenville down at the local health center for more than twenty years since back when he had his own practice and he was only too willing to pay a house call when banks rang him and told him what had happened a fussily neat man near retirement age with saltandpepper hair and a matching mustache he tuttutted over ida banks before giving her a sedative and issuing a prescription for more which banks rushed down to the chemists to fill he felt like taking one or two himself on his way back but resisted the temptation hed need a clear head over the next few days ida banks lay on the sofa a small lost figure covered with a blanket she was mumbling but she wasnt making much sense and after a while she drifted off banks offered a pill to his father who gave him a look of distaste and declined it had always been his way to face lifes harshness headon without a mask and he wasnt going to change what do we do now he asked banks i mean arent there forms to fill in and such like dont worry dad ill take care of it all down in london do you know if roy left a will will dont know he never said ill talk to his solicitor later hes in roys phone book i have to make a couple of calls right now can i use the phone its important go ahead make as many as you want first banks rang tracys mobile the last thing he wanted was his children finding out about their uncles murder from the television or newspapers dad whats up how are things going fine whats wrong does something have to be wrong for me to ring my own daughter you just sound funny thats all well youre right this time it is bad news im afraid said banks whats happened are you all right im fine said banks its your uncle roy what about him is he in jail tracy well you always seemed to think hed end up there im sorry to have to be the one to tell you but hes dead there was a moments silence at the other end then tracys voice came back on again shaking a little uncle roy dead are you serious an accident no im sorry love but he was killed i dont know how to put it any better killed how there was no point trying to save her from the knowledge banks realized she would soon find out from the newspapers he was shot murdered my god said tracy uncle roy murdered itll be in the papers and on the tv banks said i just wanted you to know first is there anything i can do its under control just dont talk to any reporters if they track you down do grandma and granddad want me to come and stay with them you get on with your studying ill take care of them and ill try to come and see you soon you can do me a small favor though what will you tell your mother dad please look normally i wouldnt bother they werent close or anything and she has her own life now but itll be highprofile maybe the reporters will trace her too i dont want it to come as too much of a shock to her oh all right but this is silly youve got to talk oh never mind im really sorry about uncle roy i know i mean i know we didnt see him often but he always sent really cool presents yes said banks ive got to go now keep in touch i will i love you dad next banks rang brian who didnt answer banks left a message for him to ring as soon as he could then phoned di brooke to thank him for his patience and give him the goahead to release roys identity finally he rang corinne she sounded devastated after her initial stunned silence and he wished he could be there for her but all he could do was murmur useless words of comfort over the telephone as she cried he promised to drop by next time he was in london which he said would probably be soon he didnt have malcolm farrows phone number so that call would have to wait until he went back to roys house then he realized he probably couldnt go back there as the whole place would be sealed off by the police investigating roys murder he hesitated then he called annie cabbot on her mobile she was on the line brooke would have already told her about roy so banks just left a message asking her to give him a ring at peterborough as soon as she could then he went back to his mother and father would you close the upstairs curtains son arthur banks asked your mother would want it that way of course banks remembered how when he was younger if someone in the family died his mother would always close the upstairs curtains up in his old room again banks looked out over the backyards and the deserted alley to find that the council estate the builders had been working on during his last visit was now almost finished most of the houses were as yet unoccupied and some were still without windows but rows of them all the same filled the stretch of waste ground where weeds used to grow over discarded tires and other rubbish this was where he used to play football and cricket as a child where he had his first kiss and first furtive feel of a girls breast as a teenager he tried to remember whether roy too had had such formative experiences there but he didnt know most likely if he had it had all happened after banks had left home when they hardly communicated he did remember one incident when he was about thirteen and roy eight banks saw an older bigger boy of about ten or eleven bullying roy out in the field poor roy was in tears as the bigger boy punched him repeatedly in the stomach and jeered at him for being a weakling banks rushed over to stop it and even though he knew that he was now the bully he couldnt hold himself back from giving the bastard a bloody nose and a split lip it came back to haunt him too he remembered when the boys parents called at his house that night only because roy corroborated his story in every detail did banks get off with a mere admonishment to pick on people his own age in future it could have been much worse so he had stood up for roy and roy had stood up for him what had happened then what had come between them as he usually did on his infrequent visits home banks looked in the wardrobe where the boxes of his adolescence were stored the last couple of times he had been back he had discovered a treasure trove of old records comics diaries books and toys there were even more boxes he hadnt got around to yet and he found himself wondering if any of them were roys the toy box with the padlock was long gone but he did eventually manage to dig out a cardboard box full of things that definitely werent his corgi toys better than dinkys he remembered roy arguing because they had plastic windows and more realistic detail a stamp album full of bright but worthless stamps a portable chess set that folded into a box a scalextric set that banks was never allowed to play with and several of those tiny submarines that came out of a cornflakes packet the kind you stuffed with baking soda to make them submerge and surface there were no diaries or old school reports nothing to flesh out the vague sense of roy that the toys implied but down at the bottom was a junior driver a toy steering wheel banks remembered roy used to stick it on the dashboard on the passenger side of his fathers morris traveller whenever they went anywhere and pretend he was driving even back then roy had been carmad banks held the plastic steering wheel in his hands for a moment then he put it back returned the box to the wardrobe and set about closing the curtains by midmorning the whole of western area headquarters in eastvale knew about the murder of bankss brother gristhorpe went into conference with assistant chief mclaughlin and a hush fell over the major crimes squad room even the telephone conversations seemed to take place in whispers if it wasnt exactly one of their own who had fallen in the line of duty it was still too damn close for comfort did you ever meet him winsome asked jim hatchley who had known banks the longest of all of them no said hatchley i got the idea he was a bit of a black sheep alan didnt have much to do with him still said winsome its family she thought of her own younger brother wayne a schoolteacher in birmingham and how rarely she saw him she would ring him tonight she resolved aye it is that lass said hatchley winsome chewed on her lower lip and got back to the telephone she had had a bit of luck tracking down the mondeo first through the driver and vehicle licencing agency wimbledon office and then through the police national computer database of stolen cars a car matching the description with a registration number plate had been stolen from a cheap longstay parking facility near heathrow airport shortly before jennifer clewess murder when the cars owner who had been on a business trip to rome since thursday arrived back on sunday evening and found his car missing he had immediately informed the local police winsome had rung heathrow police who would be the first to know if the car turned up and asked them to let her know as soon as possible if all the leads in this case led to london as they seemed to be doing so far it could be a while before di cabbot got back to yorkshire winsome envied her a nice little shopping trip down oxford street or regent street wouldnt go amiss right now not that winsome was a clothes junkie but she liked to look fashionable and she liked to look good even if it meant creeps like kev templeton ogling her she did it for herself not for anyone else winsome was just about ready to head down to the canteen for lunch when her phone rang dc jackman the unfamiliar voice inquired thats me pc owen here heathrow yes we just got a report in about a stolen vehicle a dark blue mondeo i understand you were inquiring about it thats right said winsome pencil in her hand any news its not good im afraid go ahead the long version or the short one the short first it turned up in the early hours of sunday morning on the a just outside of basildon wheres that essex excellent said winsome can we get a soco team over there hold on a minute said owen i havent finished yet i said it had turned up but what i didnt get a chance to tell you was it was involved in an accident accident yes the driver lost control and wrapped it around a telegraph pole by all accounts he was going way too fast do you have him in custody hes in the mortuary damn said winsome any identification on him oh we know who he was all right his names wesley hughes the bugger of it is he was only fifteen jesus christ whispered winsome just a kid but what happened to our two men the descriptions we have put them at way over fifteen im afraid i dont know anything about that we did get one lucky break mind you there was a passenger and he was uninjured well he got a few cuts and bruises but the docs checked him out and hes basically okay a little shaken though as you can imagine how old is he sixteen have the local police questioned him i dont know its out of my hands now if i were you id give them a ring ive got the number sergeant singh is handling it traffic he gave winsome the number she thanked him and hung up next she rang sergeant singh of the essex police at basildon divisional headquarters he answered immediately ah yes ive been expecting your call he said just hold on a minute winsome heard some muffled words then singh came back on the line sorry about that it gets a bit noisy in here thats all right what have you got a real mess is what are we sure its the right mondeo singh gave her the number it matched what shed got from the driver and vehicle licencing agency and the pnc pc owen gave me the basics winsome said have you talked to the surviving boy yet just it took forever to track down his parents and even when we found them they seemed more interested in opening another bottle of cheap wine than coming down to the station no wonder the kids run wild anyway hes a cocky young bastard name of daryl gooch but the crash took some of the wind out of his sails and di sefton took the rest whats his story according to him he and his mate wesley hughes saw the car in tower hamlets off mile end road when they were coming home from a party at about half past three on sunday morning tower hamlets yeah the east end i know where it is im just surprised and confused thats all i thought the car had been stolen from heathrow on friday by two men in their early forties who drove it up to yorkshire to commit a murder in the early hours of saturday morning now i find it was stolen from tower hamlets in the early hours of sunday morning by two teenage joyriders none of this makes any sense well singh went on i wouldnt know about that but this is how daryl gooch says it happened young daryl said the drivers door was open the key was in the ignition and there was no one around so him and his mate thought theyd have a little ride in the country pity his friend wasnt a better driver witnesses say he was doing close to a hundred when he lost control as far as i can gather from daryl they were still pissed and stoned from the party do you believe him i dont know said singh but theres not much advantage to him lying at this point is there with some kids its habitual said winsome i suppose so anyway both kids are from tower hamlets so theyd have had no reason to be out at heathrow theyre not exactly your jetsetting types any idea exactly when the car was stolen from the car park there not really said winsome sometime between thursday and friday evening i suppose sorry i cant be any more help said singh ring me if you have any more questions thanks said winsome i will she hung up and nibbled on the end of her pencil as she thought things out assuming it was the same mondeo that had been spotted near jennifer clewess flat on friday night and the one roger cropley had seen at watford gap then after killing jennifer and breaking into bankss cottage the two men had probably driven back to london through the night kept the car out of sight for a day then dumped it in a decidedly dodgy neighborhood where it was likely to disappear very quickly indeed and hoofed it back home wherever that might be it didnt tell her much about them except that they werent scared of visiting dangerous neighborhoods at night it was a good move to steal a car from a longstay because the odds were good it hadnt yet been reported stolen if it had there was always a chance that it might be picked up by a camera on the automatic number plate recognition system that reads and checks them against the database of stolen vehicles but that hadnt happened the cars owner didnt report it stolen until sunday evening by which time it was wrapped around a telegraph pole outside basildon well winsome thought even if there wasnt much chance of finding trace evidence in the mondeo now at least they could check the tires and there was always a chance that someone in tower hamlets had seen the men who dumped the car there time to get on the phone again dr lukass office boasted the same calming decor as the rest of the bergerlennox centre the seats were padded and comfortable colorful still lifes hung on the aquamarine walls and there were no surgical instruments in sight not even a hypodermic still annie realized dr lukas didnt perform abortions at least not here so there was hardly any need for such things there was however an examination room and annie imagined that behind the door would be the table the instruments the stirrups its tragic about jennifer said dr lukas before annie could start with her questions she was so young and vital the doctor had a slight accent which annie couldnt place eastern european at any rate yes annie agreed were the two of you very close not really we worked together thats all our jobs are very different of course but we obviously had to meet regularly to ensure the smooth running of the center but you didnt know her socially dr lukas managed a weak smile i dont have much of a social life she said but no we didnt meet socially only at work annie looked around the room its a nice place she said nice center altogether it cant be cheap to maintain i suppose it must be doing rather well as far as i know said dr lukas the finances were jennifers domain i stick to what i know best everyone tells me that jennifer wasnt her usual self the week before her murder they say she was anxious edgy worried did you notice this we had one of our regular meetings last wednesday dr lukas said and come to think of it she did seem a little on edge but youve no idea why i assumed it was man trouble but as i said i know nothing about her private life why did you assume man trouble then the doctor smiled she was a slight thin figure around forty with short dark hair sprinkled with gray hollow cheeks beneath the prominent bones and a tired look about her eyes her body language seemed tense too tightly strung i shouldnt jump to conclusions i know she said but she was a very attractive woman and i have seen her leave here with a man on a number of occasions that would be roy banks yes we know about him annie said but we dont think thats what was bothering her the doctor spread her hands on the table palms up then i cant help you she said what about her previous boyfriend victor parsons have you ever met him not that i know of apparently hes turned up at the center and created a fuss once or twice im very isolated up here dr lukas said i probably wouldnt have noticed when jennifer met her present boyfriend here he was accompanying a young woman everyone assumed to be his daughter her name is corinne and i dont believe she is his daughter did you examine her when would this be about two months ago april dr lukas turned to the laptop on her desk and pressed a few keys corinne welland i assume thats the one annie said i dont know her last name its the only corinne i had then it must be her then yes i did said dr lukas but i had no idea whether she was this mans daughter or not i never met him and she never said anything about him it was just a straightforward consultation what happened to her she had her termination and i assume she got on with her life have you ever heard of carmen petri no said dr lukas just a little too quickly for annies liking do you know what late girls are girls who are late with their periods girls who are dead i have no idea annie hadnt thought of that one and she knew that she should have done dead girls was carmen dead is that why she was one of the late girls if so how many others were there what about girls who are pregnant and too late to have an abortion then there would be no abortion for one thing its illegal and for another its dangerous except if the mother or the fetus is in danger exactly in that case surgery may be performed but it is not strictly speaking an abortion it is a surgical procedure performed in order to save a life or lives emergency surgery yes i understand the distinction said annie has the center ever been involved in such surgery not to my knowledge and you as medical director should know well you could check with the individual clinics where the terminations are actually carried out but i very much doubt it were essentially a familyplanning center though we offer a broader range of services than many other such organizations anyone requiring a termination after twentyfour weeks would automatically be referred to a hospital it becomes a medical problem not a matter of individual choice i see said annie she wasnt going to get much farther with this if the center was a party to illegal abortions dr lukas certainly wasnt going to admit it but annie wasnt entirely convinced by her saying that she had never heard of carmen or by her evasion of the lategirls issue perhaps she would come back to dr lukas again later she thought as she stood up and made her polite farewell after shed seen victor parsons at any rate but the next time she would make sure they didnt meet in the sterile domain of the bergerlennox centre where dr lukas was clearly used to being in control dc kev templeton soon got fed up sitting around talking on the telephone he was a man of action he liked to rattle a few doors and feel a few collars now it was monday and the world was on the move again he was in his element with gristhorpes approval he had set up a meeting with a ds susan browne who was still working the claire potter case they had agreed on a late lunch at a pub just off the m about halfway between eastvale and derby and templeton pulled into the car park at half past two thinking if this susan browne was a bit of all right he might even get his leg over before the day was done he walked through the dim cavernous bar where a few regulars sat quietly smoking and watching cricket on the tv and went out of the back door into the garden templeton didnt know if he looked like a detective or not in his jeans tshirt and trainers raybans covering his eyes he scanned the tables for a likelylooking woman there was only one and when he approached her and she stood up to shake hands and introduce herself templetons heart sank she was short and a bit thick around the middle not his type at all he liked the keira knightley type coltish girls longlegged and limber still she had nice eyes he thought and her manner seemed pleasant enough she also had a thin gold band on the ring finger of her left hand a glass of fizzy water sat on the white table in front of her beside the menu one of those colorful laminated types you usually find in chain pubs which were the only sort of pubs where you were likely to get lunch at half past two on a monday afternoon lets get the ordering out of the way first shall we she said sliding the menu over to him ive already decided templeton scanned the colorful images of burgers curries and fish and chips and decided that all he felt like was a prawn sandwich susan said she wanted a cheeseburger and chips he almost warned her against it given her waistline but decided that probably wasnt the most diplomatic way of starting off the meeting he ordered at the bar bought himself a coke and went back to the garden their table was in the shade of a large copper beech and a light breeze came and went ruffling susans tight blond curls and susurrating through the leaves at the other end of the garden a few children played on the swings and roundabout while their parents sat at nearby tables enjoying the sunshine templeton put his raybans on the table and gave ds browne the full benefit of his heartmelting brown eyes youre from western area headquarters then she asked yeah said templeton eastvale you know it used to work there hows dci banks still around i suppose templeton grinned we havent got rid of all the dinosaurs yet as i remember he got results and he was a pretty good boss yeah well when were you there a few years back i left just after i passed my sergeants boards did a year in uniform in avon and somerset then transferred to cid in derbyshire how is alan banks doing i heard about the fire sent him a card and all all right i suppose said templeton realizing he had to be a bit more circumspect about what he said now that susan browne had shown her true colors actually hes probably not doing so well right at the moment they just pulled his brothers body out of the thames last night jesus said susan thats terrible look give him my condolences when you see him will you sure what happened looks as if he was killed shot did you know him no but thats still terrible news poor alan do tell him im sorry my name was susan gay back then hell remember brownes my married name there was something in her tone that stopped templeton from making the obvious comment imagine going through life with a name like gay he thought no wonder she changed it when she got married and give my regards to superintendent gristhorpe and jim hatchley if theyre still around oh theyre still around right susan waved a wasp away from the rim of her glass down to business then claire potter said templeton like anyone for it weve got no suspects at all except yes well can you imagine how many times he must have done practice runs how many times he must have followed someone only for her to get home before he could strike for something like this to work out you need so many things to go right a woman turning off on to a dark country road late at night nobody around an unlocked drivers door anyway we checked around and it seems that a couple of months earlier the twentieth of february to be exact a woman turning off the m north of sheffield was attacked in a similar way only she had her doors locked paula chandler what happened she managed to start up and drive off he didnt pursue her description nothing useful it was dark and she was scared she didnt really get a look at his face because she was desperately trying to get the car started again while he was tugging at her door he was wearing a dark suit she said and he had a wedding ring on she saw his hand go to the door handle no gloves no she said she could see the ring clearly prints nothing but blurs make of car she couldnt say only that it was dark in color blue or green and compact maybe japanese roger cropley drove a dark green honda templeton remembered with a little shiver of excitement and he wore a wedding ring not a lot of use is it he said very frustrating and there are others equally vague one girl thought a car was following her another reported someone giving her a funny look at a service station that sort of thing we followed them all up but got nowhere but you still think its the same man yes like i said hed have to practice and hed need to get lucky and paula chandler had stopped at newport pagnell services you think thats where he trawls for his victims the motorway cafés yes it makes sense find a woman alone follow her and see if she turns off on a quiet stretch of road late at night both attacks we know about happened late on a friday and both happened after the victim had stopped at a service station tell me about claire potter her car was found in a ditch and the socos found evidence that shed been driven off the road tire tracks nothing we could use where did the assault take place there was a wooded area nearby and nobody reported seeing the cars no either nobody passed them or someone just didnt want to get involved it wasnt till the next morning when a chap driving a local delivery van got curious and reported the car in the ditch when our blokes did a quick search of the area they found her dc browne paused and sipped some water i was there it was bad one of the worst what did he do to her templeton noticed that dc browne didnt look him in the eye as she talked everything clothes ripped off rape both vaginal and anal he also used some sort of sharp object for penetration we found a bloody stick nearby then he stabbed her and she bled to death fifteen stab wounds breast abdomen pubic area ive never seen such anger dna no either he used a condom or he didnt ejaculate did the lab find any traces of lubricant no i take it they examined the earth around her of course no seminal fluid no dna hed also subdued her with chloroform so she couldnt struggle or scratch no hair or skin then no he was very careful this one and it looks as if he cleaned up after himself they usually miss something not this time there was a stream nearby he even washed the body and laid it out properly her torn clothes were found beside her hed covered her face with her own underwear for christs sake the knife ordinary sheath knife the kind you can buy just about anywhere claire was last seen at trowell services right right she stopped for a coffee and a penguin biscuit the woman behind the counter at the café remembered her but nobody was taking any undue interest thats the way it seems and she didnt need petrol the tank was more than half full so she didnt stop at the pumps any marks on the car paint scrapings broken headlights that sort of thing no it was untouched whoever did it must have just pulled in front of her and she swerved into the ditch to avoid a collision their meals arrived and the days warmth had made them both thirsty so templeton went and got another fizzy water for susan and another coke for himself this case youre working on susan said when he got back already halfway through her cheeseburger do you seriously think theres any connection i dont know its a strange one look this might seem like an odd question but do you think theres any chance that there were two of them killed claire potter it wasnt a scenario we considered seriously i mean usually these things the degree of rage the location of the wounds it all indicates a sexual predator and they usually act alone what about fred and rose west i said usually weve considered other possibilities but were pretty sure it was just one man it must have happened quickly like yours did only claire wasnt shot she suffered much more and for much longer susan sipped some fizzy water its hard to say whether the differences outnumber the similarities she said probably if you look at it realistically they do i mean even if you can account for the difference between weapons our killer went for overkill showed a remarkable degree of anger your killer just coldly shot the victim and drove away it sounds more like an execution than a botched sex crime to me youre probably right said templeton but we had to follow up on it dont these sorts of killers usually strike more than once though sexual predators yes sometimes i mean you cant really predict but its doubtful hell be satisfied for long weve had the profilers in and run some pretty sharp computer programs and they all seem to indicate a strong likelihood of his striking again after all its been nearly two months since claire potter she paused theres something that never made it to the papers whats that he took a souvenir what a nipple the left one to be precise jesus christ said templeton he looked at his prawn sandwich and felt sick he sipped some coke sorry said susan just thought we should get it all out in the open i dont suppose that happened with jennifer clewes did it no said templeton susan had finished her meal she pushed her plate aside is there anything else you want to tell me templeton thought of sundays interview we did have a bloke looked likely for jennifer clewes that is oh yes chap by the name of cropley roger cropley apparently he was paying her quite a bit of attention in the motorway café and at the petrol pumps and he followed her back onto the motorway trouble is hes got an alibi does it hold up watertight he was on the hard shoulder with a broken fan belt called the aa they confirm the time he couldnt possibly have killed jennifer clewes pity but it doesnt mean he didnt want to does it thing is templeton went on hes a funny sort of chap thought it was all a bit of a game when we questioned him then got really stroppy seems he works in london and commutes every week every friday as a matter of fact and he usually stops for a break probably wears a dark suit drives a dark green honda married wears a ring like i said hes on the m most fridays not always that late he told us but sometimes i was just thinking you know well it wouldnt do any harm to have another little chat with him would it susan said and if your suspicions continue perhaps i could come up and have a word too i trust your sio would okay it i should think so its not a lot to go on i admit said templeton but there was something about him a hunch call it that if you like i happen to believe that hunches are made up of hundreds of little observations were not directly aware of body language tone of voice little things they all add up to a hunch maybe youre right said susan smiling in my case they usually call it womens intuition she looked at her watch nice gold band templeton noticed her husband must have a bob or two probably not a policeman then id better be off she said thanks for the tip youll keep me posted about cropley absolutely said templeton and do give my best to everyone at the station and my condolences to alan banks of course templeton watched her walk away her legs werent bad at all if only she could trim down that waistline a bit she might be worth a crack husband or no he swatted a fly away from his halfeaten prawn sandwich and it buzzed him a few times before zigzagging off into the trees time to head back to eastvale he thought and see if anything new had turned up chapter eleven late monday afternoon the rain came down again out of nowhere splashing against the windscreen of dave brookes citroën as he drove annie through the rushhour traffic to tower hamlets not exactly the kind of place youd find in a tourists guide to london they were in bow and the house they wanted stood in a row of rundown terraced houses that had survived both bombing and slum clearance across the street lay a couple of acres of tarmacked waste ground with weeds growing through the cracks surrounded by a sixfoot wiremesh fence with barbed wire on the top who was protecting it and from what annie had no idea she guessed it was earmarked for development on the other side of the waste ground through the slanting rain stood more grimy houses slate roofs dark and beyond them tower blocks rose bleak as monoliths against an irongray sky pretty isnt it said di brooke as if reading her mind annie laughed if you like that sort of thing its a piece of history said brooke enjoy it while you can in a year or so itll probably be all new tower blocks or an entertainment complex you sound as if youd be sorry to see it go maybe i would here we are he pulled up at the curb and they looked at number fortysix the front door annie thought could definitely use another coat of paint to cover the cracks and gouges time and perhaps wouldbe burglars had inflicted alf seaton a retired ships carpenter had not only seen wesley hughes and daryl gooch drive away in the mondeo but he had also seen it arrive in the early hours of sunday morning and this was what interested annie and brooke annie was beginning to wonder if she would ever get home again the way things were going she had hoped to be off that afternoon after her visit to the bergerlennox centre when brooke called all roads seemed to lead to london alf seaton was expecting them and annie noticed the edge of the lace curtain twitch just a little when their car pulled up before they reached the door it opened and a plump grayhaired man with a broken nose beckoned them in out of the rain miserable day isnt it he said in an unmistakable cockney accent well annie thought he was in the right area probably even within the sound of bow bells come to think of it make yourselves comfy ill put the kettle on got some chocolate digestives too if youre interested annie looked around the small living room while alf seaton busied himself in the kitchen there was an oldfashioned look and feel to the place she thought visible in the ornate pipe rack the dark wood bureau and the low bookcase under the window filled mostly with nautical tales she noticed alexander kent douglas reeman patrick obrian some old hornblower editions on the wall above the fireplace was a romantic seascape depicting lord nelsons fleet engaging the french in rough waters cannons blazing the armchairs were old but still firm and there wasnt a speck of dust in sight when seaton came back in with the tea and biscuits annie complimented him on the house i do my best he said just because youre poor doesnt mean you have to be slovenly does it thats what my mother always used to say are you married fran died a couple of years ago cancer im sorry no reason for you to be love life goes on he looked around the room we had nearly fifty happy years me and fran moved here in our first home only one as it turned out course i was just a young lad then still wet behind the ears and things have changed a lot not all for the best either im sure not said annie still you wont be wanting to hear an old mans reminiscences will you he said winking at annie youll be wanting to know what it was i saw thats why were here mr seaton said brooke alf please alf was a name you didnt hear much these days annie thought and if you did you could guarantee it belonged to someone of mr seatons generation alf then im not sure i can tell you anything i didnt already tell the uniformed bloke lets start with what you were doing doing i was sitting here in this very armchair reading i dont sleep very well so ive taken to getting up making myself a cup of tea and settling down for a good read beats lying there thinking about all your problems the way you do at that time of night yes it does said annie so what was it that happened first did you see or hear the car heard it first i mean we do get a bit of traffic down here throughout the night but not that much its not a main road or even the quickest way to one and as you can see it doesnt have a great deal of natural charm anyway at three on a sunday morning it does tend to be quiet apart from the odd group of kids stumbling home from a party do you remember the exact time annie asked alf seaton glanced at the solid ancient clock on the mantelpiece ten past three he said i remember looking anyway first i heard it then i saw the lights it parked just across the street there then another car pulled up behind it and you saw the driver of the first car yes quite clearly theres a streetlight and my eyesights still pretty good for distances what can you tell us about him annie asked glancing at brooke who nodded indicating that she should carry on asking the questions alf seemed comfortable talking with her i was a bit nervous i suppose said seaton i mean theres been quite a lot of crime in the neighborhood and when youre old and frail in your health like i am you do worry a bit dont you twenty years ago id have given anyone a good run for his money armed or no but these days i understand said annie but you did get a look didnt you i wasnt that scared i like to know whats going on in my street anyway i didnt want to draw attention to myself so i turned the light off im glad i did because i saw him look over at the house for a moment and pause as if he was trying to decide whether there was anyone watching him he seemed to look right at me but he must have decided there wasnt what did he look like he was a big fellow hardlooking as if he lifted weights he was wearing a darkcolored track suit the sort with a white stripe down the arm and the outside leg his hair was a bit long tied in a ponytail at the back like a right poofter black it was and shiny as if hed sloshed axle grease on it and he had a heavy gold chain around his neck it sounded like a better description of the man whom roger cropley had seen in the back of the mondeo at watford gap and whom the neighbor had noticed on jennifers street around the time she set off for bankss cottage what happened next annie asked thats when i saw him get in the other car can you remember anything more about the second car no except it was lighter than the first one maybe cream or silver something like that there wasnt really enough light to show up the color properly everything was a sort of monochrome but it was a bit more i dont really know cars but it looked maybe more expensive more flashy did you notice any logos ornaments that sort of thing sorry no its okay youre doing fine i dont suppose you got the number did you no did you get a good look at the driver just a glimpse when the door opened and the inside light came on for a second it was further back out of the range of the street lamp can you describe him all i could really see was that he had short fair hair really short cropped then the door shut the light went off and they drove away what direction south toward the river not long after that i heard the kids talking and the car door slam i just caught a glimpse of them then they were gone i know i should have called the police right there and then maybe then that poor boy wouldnt have died but i didnt know what was going on and it doesnt pay to get too involved unless you really have to its not your fault said annie even so i feel badly mr seaton alf di brooke cut in do you think you would be able to work with a police artist on a sketch of the man you got a good look at i think so said seaton i mean ive got a fairly clear picture of him in my mind its just a matter of getting it down thats what the artists for with a bit of luck we might be able to get him here by tomorrow morning would that be all right im not going anywhere good ill make the arrangements is there anything else you can tell us seaton thought for a moment then said no i dont think so it all happened very quickly and as i said i didnt know what was going on why would a man abandon a nice car like that in a neighborhood like this unless he wanted it to be stolen exactly said annie banks fetched fish and chips from the chinese chippie over the road for lunch but his father just picked at them he didnt even complain the way he usually did that they tasted of chop suey his only notion of chinese food after a cup of tea banks was seriously thinking of heading back to london but he sensed that he should stay not that his father asked him or ever would but it seemed the thing to do the family should be together at least for now he felt restless though cooped up so he drove into town and wandered aimlessly around cathedral square and the queensgate centre while he was there he remembered that he had left his mobile back in gratly and he had given roys to brooke if he was planning on heading back to london which he was he might need one he went into the first electronics shop he saw and bought a cheap payasyougo mobile and a tenpound card once hed got the battery charged back at his parents house it would be ready to use it was a cloudy afternoon holding the threat of rain a group of buskers was playing jigs and reels in the square a small crowd gathered around them a steady stream of tourists entered the cathedral precints when banks found himself wandering by the rivergate centre flats he thought of michelle hart who used to live there on viersen platz on the opposite side of the river was charters bar an old iron barge moored near town bridge and banks remembered the blues music hed heard issuing from it on weekends he had stayed with michelle banks stared into the murky water and wondered if he should have tried harder with michelle he had let her slip away far too easily but what could he do her career was important to her and when the opportunity in bristol came up he could hardly plead with her not to go besides there had been problems with the relationship well before the move so many that banks had often thought the new job was at least partly an attempt to put more distance between them he walked back to his car and just sat there for a while with the windows open smoking how bloody ironic it was he thought that he had only come to know his brother after his disappearance if roy had died two three years ago banks would have grieved of course but he wouldnt have felt the loss in such a personal way now though it actually hurt squeezed at his heart now there was someone to miss not just a distant memory it wasnt so much that he had revised his opinion of roy as that he had put it in a larger context roy was a rogue no doubt about it he had about as much sense of business ethics as a flea and he was a bastard to women that hed made a fortune driven a porsche and had women falling all over him was only a testament to one of those grim truths of life that the bastards thrive maybe they get their just desserts in the afterlife maybe they come back as cockroaches but in this life they thrive roys crisis of conscience after witnessing the horror of his turning to the church had probably sharpened what moral instinct he had to some degree had he stumbled across something in that last week that offended his sense of right and wrong had he gone through a struggle of conscience before ringing his policeman brother or had it been business much as usual throughout his life roy had probably stolen cheated and lied without giving a damn for the consequences or a moment to worry over those whom he had hurt in the process had he changed that much banks wouldnt find out in peterborough he knew that so tomorrow he would have to head back to london and start digging again banks thought it might be a good idea to let a few people especially his children know he had a new mobile number so he turned on the engine plugged the phone in the car charger and rang to leave messages to his great surprise brian actually answered in person dad nice to hear from you were on a break sorry i didnt get back to you sooner but we were in the studio i was going to ring tonight its okay said banks ive been out a lot hows it going good slowly but good and hows dublin great tried the guinness yet a pint or two look what is it dad why did you want to talk to me nothings wrong is it im afraid it is said banks thinking here we go again then taking a deep breath and plunging in your uncle roys been killed itll be all over the news in a while so i wanted you to know uncle roy no i mean i never really knew him but he always sent cards and stuff i cant believe it why what happened did he have some sort of accident im trying to find out what happened said banks but no it wasnt an accident he was shot jesus christ look im sorry brian really i cant think of an easier way to break the news anyway theres nothing you can do ive told tracy and shes going to tell your mother just get on with your recording you sure yes and be prepared for reporters whens the funeral we dont know yet youll let me know how it goes keep me informed ill let you know said banks ill be back in london in a day or so probably staying at roys house if the police have finished with it do you want the address and phone number there sure might as well shot jesus banks gave him roys address thanks dad brian said and im really sorry take care said banks then he broke the connection banks sat there for a moment longer thinking hed probably gone and ruined his sons big recording session then he stubbed out his cigarette and set off back to his parents house victor parsons shared a flat with two other young men in chalk farm when annie called around teatime he was sitting in the living room reading a film magazine annies first impression was of a niceenoughlooking bloke with a bland and unassuming personality quite a contrast to the chic successful and dynamic roy banks parsons clearly hadnt shaved for a couple of days and it looked as if hed been wearing the same tshirt and jeans for much longer there was a snaillike lethargy about him that hinted at lack of ambition yet annie had to remind herself he had turned up at jennifer clewess place of work and caused a scene quite frankly he didnt look as if he had it in him annie didnt like to make snap judgments but all she had seen and heard of jennifer admittedly only after her death indicated that she outclassed victor by far had she had such low selfesteem then had she been so insecure that she had really seen something of value in him still annie thought there was no accounting for taste and no explanation for many of the strange couplings in life the room itself seemed clean and tidy enough which pleased and surprised annie knowing she had been about to visit a bachelor pad she had mentally girded herself for dirty laundry over chair backs and posters of kelly brook and jordan in lacy black lingerie plastered to the walls as it turned out the only poster in view was for kill bill volume i i suppose its about jenn victor said without offering annie a seat let alone a cup of tea or coffee as he was slouching on the sofa she took an armchair and sat victor looked across at her i suppose that bitch melanie scotts been talking among others said annie youre not exactly popular among jennifers friends and acquaintances i dont care what people think about me they dont really know me anyway theyre just a bunch of superficial losers oh its like that is it poor harddoneby misunderstood genius takes on the world he gave her a look of scorn what do you know you wouldnt understand youre right said annie so why dont i ask the questions and you answer them i find this sort of thing works best that way whatever good im glad weve got that sorted now lets get down to business where were you last friday night here doing what watching tv what were you watching coronation street east enders lenny henry have i got news for you then jools holland and a late film it was a horror film called session nine any good it had its moments thats pretty impressive victor remembering all that ive just got a good memory thats all and its pretty much the same every friday different film of course anyone else with you gavin was out till about one oclock but ravi was here most of the time you can ask him thanks i will look im gutted you know by whats happened i loved her so i hear can be a nasty thing unrequited love she loved me too she just didnt realize it she wouldve if if given time annie sighed victor it sounds to me as if somewhere along the line you lost touch with reality jennifer wasnt in love with you shed moved on found someone else you dont know her what do you do do what do you mean your job work im an actor working these days resting its true though ive had roles ive even done tv only adverts and one nonspeaking part but its a start earn much money not a lot no if annie held out any hopes that it was victor who hired someone to kill jennifer they were soon dashed he obviously couldnt afford it why did you pester her she asked you went to her place of work and caused a scene why did you do that if you loved her im not proud of that i was pissed id been drinking with ravi at lunchtime and im not used to it the booze went to my head thats all and i got overexcited i was sorry about it afterward i even rang her to apologize but she wouldnt talk to me did you talk at all since you split up no i couldnt get near her at work and she always hung up the phone if i tried her at home or the other girl did kate nesbit is that her name i dont know but you knew where she lived where shed moved to yeah i made it my business to find out have you any idea if anything or anyone was bothering her over the past while no like i said she shut me out of her life completely did you ever hang around outside her house i walked by once in a while yes i thought i might bump into her once in a while well not every day but regular like and did you see her no never when were you last there couple of weeks ago did you notice anyone else hanging around no of course he wouldnt annie thought he wouldnt even notice if godzilla stomped on the house next door all he had eyes for was jennifer what about her place of work she worked late sometimes i used to wait across the street just to see her did you ever approach her when she left no i didnt have the bottle id just watch her i told you it was only because i was pissed that i made a scene when was the last time last week monday and did you see her leave yeah but she was with someone who it wasnt anyone i knew just some girl by the looks of her a young girl yeah probably one of the rich pregnant teenagers they deal with there only this one didnt look particularly rich what time was this about eight oclock wasnt the center closed by then yeah they close at five i think everyone else had gone home but jenn worked late a lot can you describe the girl long dark hair bit skinny but a nice figure apart from the bump she was just wearing ordinary clothes you know a flowery dress sandals i didnt get a really good look at her face i take it by the bump you mean her pregnancy was showing yes where did they go nowhere why not a bloke got out of a car parked in front had a word in her ear and she got in the car with him who jennifer or the girl the girl what did jennifer do walked toward the tube station did you follow her no i just went for a drink what did the man look like like he lifted weights you know big broad shoulders no neck and he had a ponytail and the car didnt notice dark or light light i think maybe silver was there anyone else in it i didnt see did he force the girl into the car parsons frowned no but it was like he was in charge and he was saying thats enough time to go she didnt resist no okay said annie were you outside jennifers house or place of work last friday no i already told you i stayed in i do most nights had victor parsons killed jennifer or had anything to do with her death annie doubted it stalkers could turn violent true but more often than not they didnt most of the time they were sad pathetic pillocks like victor or like peeping toms irritating and upsetting but ultimately harmless tell me something she asked just out of interest why did you split up with jennifer it was all a misunderstanding thats it you see i thought we wanted different things you know jenn wanted marriage family all that and i wanted to pursue my acting career but i was wrong so you chucked her no it wasnt like that all i said was that we should give one another a bit more space and get clear about what we wanted thats all and i did i decided i wanted her no matter what that id even give up my career she meant that much to me generous of you no doubt annie guessed as soon as jennifer had got over the immediate shock of the breakup and got pissed with melanie scott a few times in sicily she had probably realized just how lucky she was to get out of the relationship there was nothing more to be gained talking to victor parsons annie decided she would get someone else to check his alibi with his flatmate and cross him off her list it was only early evening but it had been a long day and annie felt tired felt like simply going back to her hotel ordering room service and vegging out in front of the tv she had rung peterborough earlier in the afternoon but banks was out maybe she would try ringing again later what am i going to do now victor asked as annie opened the door what am i going to do maybe you should get out of the house a bit more often and try to get an audition annie suggested and left how is she banks asked when he got back from town no different said his father i told you she wasnt well even before all this its only made her worse anyway shes still in bed doesnt seem to want to get up ill go up and see her in a while ive decided to stay over tonight youve no need to said his father not for our sake we can manage id like to one thing banks knew that his father might not have thought of was that roys identity would now be public knowledge and there was a good chance that the phone would be ringing off the hook he wanted to be there to field the calls for them suit yourself your rooms always here you know that i know said banks i still cant believe our roys dead murdered me neither i wish there was something i could do you cant bring him back no any signs of reporters while i was out no thank the lord for small mercies then look dad i dont suppose roy ever talked to you about his business interests did he what he was up to that sort of thing me you must be joking he knew id have about as much understanding of business as i have about rocket science and that you might not approve of how he made his money im not a bloody communist all ive ever asked for is a fair share for the workingman whats so wrong about that nothing said banks who didnt want to get into that old argument again not here not now besides he agreed his father had been given a raw deal made redundant from his job as a sheetmetal worker during the thatcher years he had seen the riot police taunting the striking coal miners and as a result he had come to see the police as the right hand of the oppressor banks knew that could happen had done in some countries and there was a certain feeling not entirely unjustified that it had happened during the thatcher years but most of bankss attempts to explain to his father that he simply put in a long days work trying to catch criminals fell on deaf ears anyway said his father roy was always generous to us the implied barb wasnt lost on banks but he managed to bite his tongue before asking his father whether it mattered where the money came from so he never mentioned any names not as i remember the bergerlennox centre gareth lambert julian harwood never heard of them what about his girlfriends only that young lass he brought over last year for the anniversary corinne yes ive talked to her he never mentioned anyone called jennifer clewes that girl that got shot up in yorkshire you mentioned her earlier no im certain he never mentioned her to us arthur banks sagged back in his favorite armchair the television was turned off which was unusual and there was no sign of a newspaper even though banks had been absent only a short while he noticed more signs of neglect and his father was clearly as much in the dark about roys activities as he was he picked up two empty cups from the floor beside the armchair fancy a cup of tea if you like said his father what about dinner doesnt matter as long as its not from that place over the road banks put the kettle on and found the tea bags never an easy task as his mother seemed to keep moving them around like beans in a shell game this time they were in a jar in the pantry marked cocoa while the kettle boiled he washed the few dishes that had been used and stacked them in the rack to dry he found some bread tomatoes cheese and boiled ham and made some sandwiches they would have to do for dinner any more idea when the funeral will be his father asked when banks brought in the tea and sandwiches i cant say said banks it depends when they release the body what do they want to hang on to it for sometimes if someones arrested and charged the defense can ask for a second independent postmortem i dont think thats likely in this case but its not my decision believe me dad ill stay on top of it i dont want you and mum worrying about the details dont we have to register the death you cant do that until the coroners released the body ill take care of it all when the time comes what else are we going to do except sit around and mope just try to get through it day by day itll take time his father sat forward but thats just it we havent got time banks felt a shiver at the back of his neck what do you mean has your heart been giving you more problems my hearts fine a touch of angina thats all its not me its your mother what about her banks recalled his mothers tired and listless appearance when he first arrived before he had even told her about roy and again he took in the air of neglect about the house is it something to do with these tests shes been having they think shes got cancer said arthur banks thats why they want her in the hospital to do some more tests when they say they cant fit her in until next week banks felt the need for a cigarette but he didnt give in to it not there and then he wished he could afford private insurance for his parents then they wouldnt have to wait christ he said it never rains but it pours you can say that again what does the doctor think you know doctors wont commit themselves without the test results anyway its her colon theyre worried about i can tell you what i think though the lifes slowly going out of her ive been watching it drain away for weeks but even if it is cancer there are treatments especially colon cancer as far as i know the cure rates pretty good depends how far its spread doesnt it how soon they catch it look dad said banks theres no point getting pessimistic youve got enough on your plate with our roy see her through this that has to be your priority right now well deal with the other thing when we know more about it youre right but its just so bloody hard all the time thinking i might lose her now roy banks could see that his father was close to tears and he remembered that he had never seen him cry his mother yes but not his father he wanted to spare him the embarrassment knowing he was a proud man so he went upstairs to see his mother she was lying in bed with the sheets pulled up to her neck but her eyes were open roy she said when he first entered the room is it really you no mum said banks its me alan he could swear he saw the disappointment register in her face oh she said wheres our roy banks sat at the edge of the bed and grasped her hand it felt dry and thin hes gone mum our roys gone oh yes she said i remember now in the water she closed her eyes and seemed to drift off banks leaned forward and kissed her quickly on the cheek then said good night and went back downstairs shes in and out he told his father arthur banks had pulled himself together yes he said its probably those tablets the doctor gave her he looked at banks you said before you wished there was something you could do and there is you know ive been thinking while you were up with your mother whats that dad youre supposed to be a detective arent you you can do your job and go back to london and catch the bastard that killed our roy banks sat down picked up his mug of tea and reached for a sandwich yes he said youre right and thats exactly what i intend to do first thing tomorrow chapter twelve late on tuesday morning after breakfast and a brief meeting with brooke to review their progress so far annie went back to her room packed her meager belongings and checked out of the hotel she was looking forward to getting home digging out some clean clothes and sleeping in her own bed again if only for one night she knew she would have to come back especially as she planned on visiting dr lukas at home in the near future for the meantime though brooke was leading the roy banks investigation and annie needed to show her face to the troops back up in eastvale talk to stefan nowak and gristhorpe and see how winsome and kev templeton were getting on she wondered what banks was up to as she waited for a taxi she hadnt tried to ring him again the previous evening deciding it was probably best to leave him and his parents in peace from what she could remember banks telling her they had doted on roy and even though he and roy hadnt been close she knew he must be distraught though she wasnt unduly worried about him he had been depressed lately and something like this could push him over the edge she would like to talk to him anyway to see him if only to reassure herself and offer her condolences a taxi pulled up and annie got in kings cross please she told the driver right you are madam they had hardly got over lambeth bridge when her mobile rang annie its dave brooke here dave what is it thought you might be interested ive just got the pathologists report on roy banks can you talk its okay said annie im in a taxi on my way to the station the driver was listening to an interview on bbc london chuckling to himself and there was a plexiglas window between the front and the back fair enough bottom line is the shot to the head killed him outright its a twentytwocaliber bullet just like the one that killed jennifer clewes anything on time of death hed been in the water about forty hours had to have been to get in the state he was and end up on that patch of shingle so the tide experts tell me so it cant have been the same killers no they couldnt possibly have got back from yorkshire in time brooke paused dci banks isnt going to like hearing this but it also appears that his brother was tortured before he was shot tortured yes theres evidence of serious bruising to the body and cigarette burns on the arms and soles of the feet some of the fingernails have been pulled out too jesus said annie someone wanted something from him or wanted to know how much he knew or had given away either way youre right alan wont like that at all the press theyre not going to find out are you sure not from us were keeping this to ourselves all the press will be told is that he was shot that will be enough for them i can see the guncrime editorials right now true enough said annie theyre already having a field day with the jennifer clewes shooting anything else just a couple of things said brooke remember the digital photo that came through on roy bankss mobile yes alan mentioned it to me as we suspected it came from a stolen phone technical support didnt have much trouble enhancing the image theyve got all sorts of fancy software that can filter and stretch and make predictions based on pixel statistics the upshot is though that it doesnt tell us a hell of a lot we still cant be absolutely certain whether the man in the chair is roy banks they did manage to get something from the wall in the background what it looks as if there were two rows of letters or words stenciled on the rough brick the first ends in ngs and the second in ife weve no idea how long the lines were or how many words were getting a list of all abandoned factories in the greater london area and the experts are working on identifying some of the rusted machines it might help figure out what sort of a factory it was if the tide experts can come up with a general idea of where roy banks might have been dropped in the river we should be able to put it all together and pinpoint where the murder took place that sounds promising said annie any leads on who might have wanted roy banks dead weve turned up a couple of iffy names from his business correspondence oliver drummond and william gilmore ever heard of them no said annie well theyre definitely in our bad books the first ones been involved in a couple of frauds and we think the seconds been running a chop shop highend mostly jags and beemers for rich russians and arabs never managed to track it down though and gilmore always seems to turn out squeakyclean weve managed to get him on a few minor charges which is why hes on our books but nothing big what about the men in the photograph dci banks gave you brooke paused gareth lambert he said hes got no form the other one we dont know doesnt it seem important though roy banks did think it necessary to take and then hide the photo maybe blackmail was involved give us time annie brooke snapped you know damn well how it is with manpower and budgets and half the bloody teams on holiday right now well get there eventually okay dave hold your horses i was only trying to be helpful im sorry i know only were stretched to the limit i understand best of luck then and thanks for bringing me uptodate ill see whats happening up north and probably be back in a day or so keep in touch absolutely oh by the way our artists finished with seaton now the impression doesnt look bad want a copy thanks it might be useful ill get it faxed to you the traffic slowed to a crawl as the taxi got closer to the chaotic and seemingly endless construction of the channel tunnel rail link around kings cross annie didnt have a lot of time and worried she might miss her train but the driver found a gap in the traffic and pulled up at the side with fifteen minutes to spare annie paid him picked up a couple of magazines for the journey at wh smiths then checked the platform number on the board and headed out to the train the station was bustling with people and it smelled of warm engines diesel oil and smoke annie found her coach and seat popped her small bag on the rack and sat down to make herself comfortable about three minutes before the train was due to set off a decidedly nervous announcement came over the pa system would all passengers calmly leave the train and exit the station everyone sat there for a moment stunned wondering if theyd heard correctly then it came again not sounding calm at all would all passengers calmly leave the train and exit the station that was enough everyone grabbed their bags dashed for the door and ran down the platform to the street banks had hoped to be back in london by late morning early afternoon at the latest but it wasnt to be for a start he slept in lying there in his old bed he hadnt been able to get to sleep for thinking about roy and worrying about his parents and only after the light began to grow and the birds started singing did he finally doze off until ninethirty even then he was the first one up if that had been the only problem he could probably still have made fairly good time but after he had made a pot of tea made sure his new mobile was fully charged and walked across the road for a copy of the independent his mother was up and fussing whether the fact of roys death had really sunk in yet banks couldnt tell but she seemed unnaturally calm alert and in command your fathers having a liein she said hes tired thats okay said banks you could have rested awhile longer yourself i rested quite enough yesterday thank you now and then she launched into the most extraordinary litany of things to do the upshot of which was that banks spent a good part of the day driving her around to the various relatives who lived close enough to visit the ones in ely stamford and huntingdon at any rate many had already phoned the previous evening after hearing about roy on the news but banks had taken care of the telephone including the reporters and made sure neither his mother nor his father was disturbed now ida banks told each one calmly that roy had died and she didnt know when the funeral would be but they should be on the lookout for a notice in the paper bankss father was up when they got back from the first visit just sitting in his armchair staring into space he said he was okay but banks worried about him too he seemed to have no energy no will banks had already seen a piece about the murder in the independent which referred to roy as the wealthy entrepreneur brother of north yorkshire policeman alan banks who almost lost his life in a fire earlier this year uncle frank told him it had been on the television too and there had been a picture of banks and some old footage of his cottage after the fire banks was glad he hadnt seen it god only knew what stories the tabloids were telling were they implying a link between the fire and roys murder by the time he saw his mother settled back at home and had fed her another of dr grenvilles pills it was midafternoon mrs green a neighbor came over to sit with them for a while and banks was finally able to say his goodbyes and set off back to london before he left he rang burgess gave him his new mobile number and arranged to meet at a pub in soho around five oclock it was time to pick up the threads of his investigation again lacking cds the best he could do was turn on the car radio classic fm was playing beethovens moonlight sonata and radio three had tippetts concerto for double string orchestra banks chose the tippett because he didnt know it as well as he did the beethoven on the motorway somewhere around stevenage banks noticed that a red vectra had been following him for some time he slowed down the vectra slowed he speeded up the vectra kept pace it was the middle of a warm summer afternoon on a busy road but still banks felt the chill of fear he played cat and mouse with the vectra for a while longer then it shot past him he couldnt get a really good look but he could tell there were two people in the car one in the front and one in the back the one in the back had a ponytail and when the car was passing bankss renault he turned sideways and smiled miming a shooting gun with his left hand thumb signifying the hammer then he tilted his hand up and blew over the tops of his first two fingers smiling it was a splitsecond vignette then they were streaking ahead banks tried to keep up with them but it was no good the driver was skillful and managed to weave in and out of the lanes of traffic until they had left banks far behind not before he had memorized the number though as he approached welwyn garden city where it started to rain again banks wondered what the hell all that had been about then he realized with a sudden chill that they must have followed him from peterborough they were letting him know that they knew where his parents lived you again said roger cropley when kev templeton turned up at his front door again youve got a bloody nerve what the hell do you want just a few more questions said templeton im by myself this time as a matter of fact im very surprised to see you here i thought youd be down in london it was your wife i was planning on talking to im off sick said cropley summer cold what do you want to talk to eileen about oh this and that but now that youre here too lets have a party shall we templeton edged his way into the hall eileen cropley was standing at the bottom of the stairs ah mrs cropley good afternoon i dont believe we had a proper chance to get acquainted on my last visit thats because you were so rude if i remember correctly roger what does this man want what have you been up to i havent been up to anything its all right dear cropley sighed youd better come through he said dont mind if i do the living room still smelled of lavender but the flowers had wilted and shed a few petals i might have been a little hasty last time said templeton when both mr and mrs cropley had sat down they sat on the sofa templeton noticed one at each end like bookends mrs cropley was definitely frosty cropley himself seemed resigned i hadnt got all my ducks in a row you can say that again said cropley but thats water under the bridge isnt it no hard feelings cropley regarded him suspiciously anyway templeton went on im glad i found both of you in gives me a chance to make up for bad first impressions weve talked to the aa mr cropley and they verify that you were indeed at the time in question stuck on the hard shoulder of the m just south of the derby turnoff as i told you indeed and i apologize for any disbelief i might have shown at the time we tend to get quite wrapped up in our search for justice and sometimes we trample on peoples finer feelings so what do you want this time well weve got a bit more information than we had before and it looks as if these two men you saw in the dark mondeo followed jennifer clewes that was the victims name off the a on the road to eastvale where they ran her into a drystone wall and shot her they then returned to wherever they came from and the following night they dumped the mondeo in the east end of london where it was immediately stolen and later involved in a serious accident now weve got some tire tracks the car made in a private lane in gratly and some fingerprints that might possibly belong to one of the men our forensic scientists are checking the mondeo for fingerprints to compare but as you can imagine after a crash like that well this is all very interesting said cropley but i still dont see how my wife or i can help hear the man out roger said mrs cropley who seemed interested despite herself thank you mrs cropley anyway we got a description of the man who dropped off the car in london and a colleague down there has just faxed me an artists impression i was wondering if youd have a look at it and see if you can identify him i told you said cropley i didnt get a good look im not very good at describing people most of us arent said templeton thats why looking at a picture helps he lifted his briefcase may i of course said cropley templeton showed him the sketch cropley stared at it for a while then he said it could be him only could be as i said i didnt get a good look but he did turn to look at you when the driver pulled right out in front didnt he you told me that yes but it was dark the petrol station was well lit im still not certain i mean i wouldnt want to swear to it in court is that what you want not yet we just want to find him well it definitely looks like him the hair the general shape of the head but it was too dark to make out his features i understand that was he wellbuilt he did have rather broad shoulders now i come to think of it and not much of a neck and he seemed tall high in the seat fine said templeton putting the drawing away many thanks youre welcome said cropley but you said you came to talk to my wife she wouldnt have been able to identify this man as she wasnt with me just seizing the opportunity mr cropley saved me a trip to london this has templeton took out his notebook so what did you want to ask me mrs cropley said templeton scratched the side of his nose thats another matter entirely mrs cropley at least we think it is on the twentythird of april this year a young woman named claire potter was raped and stabbed just off the m north of chesterfield she was last seen at the trowell services a short time earlier you mentioned this the last time you were here said roger cropley it meant nothing to me then and it means nothing now templeton ignored him and faced mrs cropley weve now got quite a bit more information about that crime he said and believe me whoever did it must have picked up quite a bit of blood i was just wondering if you had ever noticed anything about your husbands clothing around that time you know unusual stains that sort of thing devilishly hard to get rid of blood you do the washing around here dont you i cant believe youre asking me this said mrs cropley the sheer nerve of it well ive never been faulted for my lack of nerve said templeton nothing ventured nothing gained thats my motto so if theres anything youd like to get off your chest i saw nothing out of the ordinary well the clothes might have been beyond salvation i suppose said templeton have any of your husbands clothes gone missing over the past few months no still templeton mused aloud the killer washed the victims body so the odds are he managed to deal with his own clothes very fastidious he was are you a fastidious man mr cropley i like to think so said cropley but it doesnt make me a killer and i resent these accusations of course you do its only natural but i have to ask id be a pretty useless detective if i didnt wouldnt i quite frankly i dont care what kind of bloody detective you are said cropley one thing i do know is that youre a very offensive person and id appreciate it if youd leave my house immediately just one more question please then ill be out of your hair eileen cropley glared at him how often has your husband been unusually late home from work on a friday say after midnight i dont know surely you ought to be able to remember something like that dont you wait up for him no i usually take a sleeping pill at eleven oclock and go to bed im fast asleep before midnight so he usually gets back after eleven then can we say she looked at her husband i suppose so templeton turned to roger cropley nearly done now sir i remember the last time i was here with dc jackman that you distinctly told me you usually try to get away by midafternoon to beat the rushhour traffic if i can i dont always succeed how often in the last four months i dont know i dont keep track i think id remember said templeton im not you no youre right about that templeton put his notebook back in his inside pocket well ill be off now thanks for your time no need to see me out i know the way templeton walked toward the door but just before he opened it he turned to face cropley again one more thing he took out his notebook again frowned and consulted it the twentieth of february were you on your way home late that friday do you remember did you stop at newport pagnell i dont remember only a young girl called paula chandler was driven off the road and an attempt was made at assaulting her it failed her car doors were locked theres a chance she might be able to identify her assailant am i under arrest cropley said of course not said templeton im only then i want you to leave now or im calling my solicitor said cropley getting to his feet and striding toward templeton go on get out for a moment templeton thought cropley was going to hit him but he merely grabbed his shoulder and steered him toward the front door templeton didnt resist when the door slammed behind him he stood for a few moments enjoying the fresh wet smell of the lateafternoon air it had stopped raining but the sky was still overcast and the streets were glistening to the west the low hills were faint gray outlines against a darker gray background he could hear the sound of flowing water nearby probably a beck and a bird was singing in one of the trees all in all he thought it had been a much more successful interview than the previous one as he got in his car templeton noticed a few flakes of cropleys dandruff on his sleeve jacket and moved to brush it off then he had a better idea if roger cropley was their man he thought he was damned if ds susan browne was going to get all the glory annie stood in the rain among the massed crowds held back by barricades at the far side of euston road the entire area had been blocked to traffic and all the station exits sealed the underground shut down people had swarmed out of the nearby offices shops and cafés to stand at a safe distance and see what was going on and their presence only served to swell the crowds annie began to feel uncomfortably penned in across the road police in protective clothing moved about like shadows inside the station itself the words that were on most peoples lips were terrorists bomb threat a fact of life in london annie had asked one of the officers on crowd control how long it would be before the trains started running but he didnt know could be a couple of hours could be longer was all he would say annie saw her trip home quickly slipping away there was no point going if she didnt get back until evening she made her way through the crowds narrowly avoiding a poke in the eye from one of the many raised umbrellas she didnt care where she was walking as long as she was getting away from the people eventually when she got off euston road and took her bearings she found herself winding her way via the back streets toward bloomsbury when she got to russell square she remembered the small hotel she and banks had stayed at a few years ago when their relationship had been just beginning and seemed full of possibility she couldnt stay there by herself it would be far too depressing she would go back to her faceless modern efficient chain hotel they would be sure to have a room available perhaps even the same one she had just vacated though they all looked so much the same that it didnt matter if she found herself stuck in london for another night so be it she took out her mobile and rang brooke he had already faxed the artists impression up to eastvalè but said hed be more than happy to fax it to her hotel right away annie then rang the hotel made a reservation and told them she was expecting a fax they said they would take care of everything in the evening she would go and visit dr lukas at her home but before that annie knew she couldnt spend another day and night in london without some new clothes so she headed for oxford street a bit of retail therapy would help dispel the gloom that seemed to have descended on her with the rain the pub was on frith street and at five oclock it was already crowded burgess was there ahead of banks sitting on a wooden stool at a small table in the far corner and he gestured to banks holding up an empty pint glass banks bought himself an orange juice and burgess a pint of lager not drinking burgess said when banks made his way back from the bar with the drinks not right at the moment tell me said banks why do you always want to meet me in pubs i dont believe ive ever seen your office im not even entirely convinced that you have one theyd never let you in besides if they did theyd probably have to kill you best this way easier all round are you ashamed of me or something burgess laughed then turned serious how are you doing not bad its i dont know roy and i werent close or anything but it still feels like a piece of mes died its family burgess said i suppose so thats what everyone says i feel as if ive only just started getting to know him and hes been snatched from me i had a sister die a few years back burgess went on she lived in south africa durban hadnt seen her in years not since we were kids she was murdered during a robbery shot i felt the same way though and i just couldnt stop thinking about her for ages what it must have been like when she knew she was going to die still it was quick roy too nothing like a bullet for that so what are you up to banks told him about the men who followed him on the motorway the shooting gesture through the window what have you done about it i almost turned back but thats probably what they wanted me to do i called the locals in peterborough and asked them to keep an eye open they said theyd post surveillance on the council estate anything i can do can you still run down a number plate nothing could be easier banks gave him the vectras number you realize its probably stolen dont you burgess said attention to detail said banks sometimes they make little mistakes true enough ever heard of the bergerlennox centre whats that when its at home a private familyplanning center they deal with the whole lot abortions adoption whatever you want no said burgess i cant say ive heard of them but then i wouldnt have any need for such a place would i i suppose not but roy was an investor and jennifer clewes worked there in administration sounds interesting but i still dont know anything about it what are you going to do next i want to find out who killed roy and why why doesnt that surprise me the caped crusader rides again arent you mixing your metaphors probably i dont suppose its any use telling you to leave it to the locals no thought not what is it you want from me youve already told me a bit about roys checkered past the arms thing yes that was years ago i told you as far as we know your brothers been clean for the past while forget about it so why is he dead some of the nicest people end up dead burgess lit a tom thumb cigar and added to the general fug any idea who the bloke in the photo sitting at a café with lambert is yet nope im working on it though its still doing the rounds believe me i want to know as much as you do trouble is this time of year a lot of blokes are on holiday and quite a few have retired since back then anyway be patient remember its not the local nick youre dealing with here i promise youll be among the first to know tell me more about gareth lambert i told you he was a business associate of your brothers and an allround nasty piece of work charming enough on the surface like i said harry lime i take it you have seen the third man its one of my favorite films look according to julian harwood lamberts been living in spain my my you have been a busy boy havent you why come back i suppose he got bored with paella he also got married to some beautiful spanish actress centerfold material englands quite sexy these days or didnt you know madonna gwyneth paltrow liv tyler and all the rest they all want to live here anyway hes back and apparently hes in the travel business legit i didnt say that but theres no evidence to the contrary like i said lamberts elusive hes got no form never once been arrested not in this country at any rate not yet always manages to keep one step ahead sure you wont have a real drink no thanks i need to keep my head clear for what for roy okay burgess went up the bar and bought himself another pint banks noticed that the pub was filling up even more with the afterwork crowd there had been a blackboard outside advertising handpulled real ale so perhaps that was what brought them in most of the newcomers had to stand and the crush at the bar was getting to be three deep some people took advantage of the break in the rain and stood outside drinking but from what banks could see through the open door the sky was darkening again and theyd all be dashing back inside soon burgess came back and squeezed through the bodies to his stool without spilling a drop are there any other leads on roys murder he asked i dont know said banks ill have a word with annie cabbot later and see if i find out whats going on with di brookes investigation still screwing the lovely di cabbot are you or have you moved on to pastures new banks ignored him burgess was always looking for buttons to push usually he succeeded but not this time tell me banks said honestly do you think roy could have got involved in something crooked with lambert again anythings possible but what im telling you is that i we have no knowledge of it if they were into something together its a smooth operation youre dealing with pros here at least lamberts a pro and youd know if there was something maybe if it was big enough and nasty enough we spend a lot of time just watching and thinking but were not omniscient we dont know everything just most things besides its not my problem anymore and lambert hasnt been back here very long only a couple of months if my sources are right which they usually are so if there is anything its either new or its something international and he was working it from spain too let me ask around ive still got a few contacts theres a bloke from interpol dieter ganz i know is interested if i can get in touch with him ill see what i can do i want to know where lambert lives i was wondering when youd get around to asking me that id have got around to it a lot sooner if i hadnt had my parents to cope with are you going to tell me cant see why not burgess gave him an address in chelsea youd only find out some other way hes got a place out in the country somewhere too where he keeps his wife but this flats his piedàterre when hes in town he still travels a fair bit and he runs his business out of an office above a drycleaning shop on edgeware road the marble arch end but watch him banks hes slippery remember harry lime banks finished his orange juice tell me something he said you always put up a show of resistance but in the end you usually tell me what i want to know why entertainment value said burgess besides i like you i like to watch you work it interests me i see you getting more and more like i used to be you want something you go after it and bugger the consequences bugger the law if necessary used to be burgess sipped some beer ive mellowed banksy grown up bollocks its true anyway lets just say that di brookes interests and mine dont always coincide brookes a plodder i know the type no imagination no breadth of vision hes only interested in shortterm results another tick on his report card for his next promotion and you im more interested in the big picture the longterm view and i like to know whats going on informations my stockintrade these days after all i dont get out on the street much miss it burgess looked away sometimes he laughed and raised his glass now bugger off and good luck with lambert it had started raining again and banks had to fight against the influx of people trying to get back inside he found a sheltered doorway and dialed annies number on his mobile she answered on the fourth ring annie its me alan where are you ive been wanting to speak to you ever since i heard im really sorry about what happened to your brother thanks i appreciate it im back in london where are you as a matter of fact annie said im in selfridges at the moment in one of the changing rooms you might not have heard but theyve closed kings cross bomb threat anyway it means im stuck here for another night i need something to wear im just about to head back to the hotel look alan we have to talk again a lots happened i know but itll have to wait couple of quick questions have brookes blokes talked to gareth lambert yet i dont think so said annie last time i talked to him dave didnt seem all that interested theyre concentrating on a couple of local lowlifes called oliver drummond and william gilmore their names came up in your brothers business correspondence and phone records banks remembered the names but they didnt mean anything to him then annie told him about her visit to alf seatons that morning the description of the man with the ponytail and what had become of the mondeo banks knew immediately that it was one of the men who had followed him from peterborough the one who had made the gesture another thing you might as well know annie said it looks as if your brothers girlfriend had an abortion arranged through the bergerlennox centre thats when he met jennifer clewes jesus said banks thatll be corinne youre talking about are there any others probably said banks but i think she was the most recent model the one before jennifer thanks for telling me can we meet up we really should talk about all this maybe tomorrow said banks breakfast ive still got a couple of people to talk to tonight how about i give you a bell when im finished banks rang off before she could protest the rain was really pelting down now and all banks had for protection was his light raincoat he stood in the doorway of the closed shoe shop looking at the people drifting back and forth between the curtains of rain then stepped out and headed as fast as he could for tottenham court road tube station chapter thirteen how did you get my address dr alex lukas asked annie as she stood under her umbrella on the front step of the belsize park house shortly after seven oclock that evening im not in the telephone directory we have our sources said annie who had taken a peek at the personnel records when she made a quick and otherwise fruitless search of jennifer clewess office at the bergerlennox can i come in what do you want its not a police state yet is it not the last time i checked said annie with a smile but it is raining fast dr lukas took the chain off the door and stepped back annie folded up her umbrella took off her raincoat and hung it on the coat stand she followed dr lukas down the thick carpet into a cozy and comfortable living room the curtains were still open and rain streaked across the windowpanes the radio was playing quietly an orchestral concert of some sort dr lukas excused herself for a moment and went upstairs while she waited annie looked around the room what looked to annie like original works of art hung on the wall mostly abstract expressionist and cubist pieces and various knickknacks and framed photographs stood on most available surfaces the crowded darkwood bookcase boasted a colorful array of spines none of them medical there were novels mostly tolstoy and dostoyevsky poetry by mandelstam akhnatova yevtushenko tsvetayeva and a few biographies shostakovich gorbachev pasternak annie could see by the lettering that some of the books were in russian taking into account the matryoshka doll on the mantelpiece and remembering the hint of an accent it didnt take much to surmise that dr lukas hailed from russia or somewhere in the former soviet republic beside the doll stood a blackandwhite photograph of a family group in a wooded area parents and three children annie walked over to have a closer look at it they were all wearing overcoats and no one was smiling they had that hard pinched look you get when there isnt enough food on the table or coal on the fire beside it stood another photo of what annie took to be the parents more recent and in color this time they were smiling into the camera standing beside a large lake in the sunshine on holiday said dr lukas behind her im sorry i didnt mean to be nosy said annie is that your parents yes it was taken two years ago so you come from russia ukraine a city called lviv in the west not far from the polish border do you know it sorry said annie whose geography was terrible it doesnt matter annie gestured to the photograph again do they still live there dr lukas paused before answering with a tentative yes how long have you been here thirteen years i was twentyfive when the soviet union broke up i was lucky i got into medical school in edinburgh id had some training in lviv of course but this country didnt recognize my qualifications do you know how many foreigntrained doctors there are over here driving minicabs and working in restaurants and hotels no said annie its a shame a terrible waste said dr lukas with a hint of tragic fatalism in her voice you dont have a very strong accent annie said i worked hard to get rid of it foreign accents dont work in your favor here but all this is beside the point what have you come to see me about dr lukas was perching uncomfortably at the edge of an armchair annie noticed body hunched forward and tense hands clasped in her lap she was wearing faded jeans and a mans white casual shirt no makeup she looked tired and drawn as she had in her office youre right said annie its not a social call she paused and searched for the right way to begin look in a murder investigation people sometimes hide things mask the truth not because theyre guilty but because theyve maybe committed some minor crime and theyre afraid well uncover it and prosecute them do you understand im listening when that happens it makes a difficult job even harder we dont know whats important and what isnt so how can we know where to focus our line of inquiry all jobs have their difficulties said dr lukas mine included i dont see what point there is in you telling me how hard yours is i thought if you understood then youd see reason and tell me the truth pardon i think you heard me but im not sure i heard you correctly are you suggesting i lied im saying that you might be hiding something because you think it reflects badly on you i dont think youre lying so much as youre obscuring the truth now it may or may not be important or it may not seem important to you but id like to know what it is and i think youd like to tell me what makes you think that you get to know people in this job i think youre a decent person and i think youre under a tremendous amount of pressure now that could simply be a matter of your work or it could be due to personal problems which are nothing at all to do with this investigation but the feeling i get is that theres something else and that it is connected i see dr lukas stood up and walked to the cocktail cabinet i think i need a drink she said and took out a tumbler and a bottle of southern comfort what about you nothing thanks said annie as you wish she poured herself a large measure and sat down again this time she relaxed a little more into the armchair and the strain that etched the lines on her forehead and around her eyes and mouth eased the concert ended and annie heard the radio audience applaud before the announcers voice cut in dr lukas switched it off took a sip of southern comfort and regarded annie closely with her serious brown eyes annie got the sense that she was trying to come to some sort of decision and realized that she might well end up with a partial truth if anything as was so often the case the clock ticked and rain tapped against the window still dr lukas thought and sipped finally when annie could almost bear it no longer she said youre right about what about people withholding the truth do you think it doesnt happen in my profession too people lie to me all the time how much they drink whether they smoke what drugs they take how often they exercise as if by lying theyd make themselves healthy but i havent done anything wrong sometimes people use a different standard to measure themselves by said annie you might not think you have done anything morally or ethically wrong but you might have broken the law or vice versa dr lukas managed a flicker of a smile a fine distinction im not after getting you struck off im happy to hear it but i do want the truth what are late girls dr lukas sipped some more southern comfort before answering then she ran a finger around the rim of her glass its really very simple she said they are girls who come late to the center in what sense late in their pregnancies no there you are quite wrong well ive hardly been steered in the right direction this isnt supposed to be a guessing game now i am telling you there have been no surgical procedures performed on girls beyond the twentyfourweek legal limit okay said annie so what is it all about girl who come late to the center after regular hours in the evening when youre working late i have a lot of paperwork you wouldnt believe it even a doctor but i do so why do these girls come after hours why do you think they want to bypass the system for some reason and you help them to do it these girls are prostitutes for the most part and many of them are illegal immigrants or asylum seekers they cant go through the national health and they cant afford our fees probono work then you could say that what exactly do you do for them i handle the forms the papers necessary to secure an abortion if thats what they want if another doctors signature is needed i get that too from someone at one of the clinics they dont ask me too many questions its very easy and it harms no one do you perform the abortions no they are done elsewhere at one of the clinics what do you do then i examine them make sure they are in good general health theres venereal disease to worry about and aids of course some girls have drug and alcohol problems many of the fetuses would be born with severe handicaps if they lived do you supply drugs dr lukas looked directly at annie no she said i understand why they might want to take drugs the life they are living but i wont supply them they seem to have no problem getting drugs elsewhere though so if we were to check the drugs at the center against records they would match if they dont its not me whos been taking them but yes i think they would besides we have no need for the kind of drugs youre talking about at the center how often does this happen not very often maybe once sometimes twice a month why do these girls come to you how do they know about you many of them are from eastern europe dr lukas said with a shrug im known in the community that sounded a bit vague annie thought eastern europe covered a large area but she let it go now dr lukas was on a roll it was better to get as much as possible out of her rather than belabor one point what about jennifer clewes did she know about this yes when did she find out shes known for a month or two i didnt realize she worked late sometimes too i thought i was alone there youve seen how isolated my office is the girls usually buzz the front door and i let them in myself this time jennifer got there first she didnt say anything but later she asked me what was going on what did you tell her what im telling you and what was her reaction she became interested dr lukas swirled the remains of her drink in her glass jennifer was a truly decent human being she said when i explained to her about the girls and the situation they were in nowhere to turn to for help she understood it didnt disturb her upset her no she was a bit uncomfortable about it at first but but what well she was the administrator she helped to protect me paperwork got lost that sort of thing i told her it would be best if she didnt tell anyone that not everyone would understand we think she must have told her boyfriend dr lukas shrugged that was for her judgment alone so jennifer became involved in it with you yes we were both trying to help unfortunate girls its not that this happened often you understand it wasnt a regular thing these girls would not have been able to come if theyd had to pay and remember they couldnt just walk into the nearest nhs clinic what do you think would happen to them do you think there are no longer backstreet abortionists using rusty coat hangers so what went wrong nothing went wrong jennifer clewes is dead i know nothing about that ive told you what i was keeping from you who the late girls are and how and why i helped them ive told you jennifers part in all this there is nothing more once in a while a girl who needed help would come to me and i provided it thats all there is to it did anyone else know georgina for example no at first it was only me then jennifer she was the only other person who ever stayed late somehow it didnt all add up annie thought there were too many pieces missing and the ones she had didnt fit together properly what about carmen petri was she one of the late girls what was so special about her dr lukas seemed to tense up again the lines on her forehead deepening her posture stiffening i dont know the name she was one of the late girls wasnt she what happened to her i told you ive never heard of her did something go wrong is that it ive told you i dont know anyone called carmen annie took out the sketch that brookes police artist had coaxed from alf seaton do you recognize this man she asked no said dr lukas annie couldnt be certain that she was telling the truth about a week ago jennifer was seen leaving this building with a young girl the person who saw them said that the girl looked pregnant they were talking then a man who looked very much like this one came over and the girl went away with him in a car do you know what that was about annie could have sworn that dr lukas turned a shade paler no she said i told you jennifer sometimes worked late too saw the girls sometimes she talked to them she was a very caring person and its a tragedy what happened to her it is said annie standing up to leave and im going to find out what was behind it with or without your help please you dont know dont know what dr lukas paused rubbing her hands together please im telling you the truth i think youre telling me part of the truth annie said and im going to leave you to think over your position when youve made your mind up you can call me at this number annie scribbled her mobile number on the back of her card and left it on the coffee table ill show myself out well you cant win them all banks thought after a wasted trip to chelsea one of the problems with paying surprise visits was that sometimes the object of your visit wasnt at home and such was the case with gareth lambert that wet tuesday evening though banks had even hung around in a shop doorway over the street for about an hour waiting burgess had said that lambert was elusive the humidity and damp clothing made the crowded underground carriage smell like a wet dog and banks was glad to get off at green park for the piccadilly line the second carriage was half empty and he passed the short trip reading the adverts and trying to suss out the language of the newspaper that the person opposite him was reading the letters were roman but it definitely wasnt anything he recognized sometimes the depths of his own ignorance appalled him when he got to corinnes flat he was soaked and she gave him a towel for his hair made him take off his raincoat and his jacket and hung them up in the bathroom under an electric fire to dry them out his trousers were stuck to his thighs and shins and he thought of asking her to dry those too but she might get the wrong idea besides it would be rather undignified carrying out an interview albeit a friendly one sitting around in his underpants warm drink tea if youve got any no milk or sugar for me i think i can manage that despite or perhaps because of the rain it was a close muggy evening sweat filmed corinnes upper lip and forehead and she looked as if she hadnt been sleeping well her hair was tangled and her eyes had dark circles under them so roy had the power to make a woman feel this way no matter what hed done to her what the hell was it about him sandra wouldnt give banks the time of day and even annie couldnt get away quick enough if he talked about anything other than the case at hand banks also thought of penny cartwright again and her revulsion at the idea of dinner with him she would probably have jumped at the chance if roy had asked her im sorry i havent been able to get here sooner banks said when he had a warm cup of tea in his hand you can imagine what its been like have you seen your parents how are they your mother was very nice to me not that your father wasnt but you know what i mean banks remembered that last october much to his surprise his mother had taken corinne into the kitchen to help her prepare the anniversary spread and in no time they had been chatting away to each other like old friends thinking of his parents he also remembered the message that the thug in the red vectra had given him we know where your parents live how did they know from roy when it came right down to it though it wasnt that difficult to find out such things most likely they had followed banks to peterborough the day before and he hadnt spotted them he would ring his father before it got too late and make sure everything was all right there he would also ring the peterborough police again to make sure they had someone watching the house at all times if this man with the ponytail had killed jennifer clewes as annie seemed to think he had then he and his friends didnt make idle threats banks wished he could arrange for his parents to go away for a while but they would never agree to it not at a time like this theyre coping banks said finally my mother took it rather hard as you can imagine dads trying to be a rock but the strains beginning to show i hope they get through it do you think i should give them a ring it wouldnt do any harm banks said maybe in a couple of days he sipped some tea a pleasant scented earl grey then leaned forward and set the cup and saucer down on the low table look corinne this probably isnt anything to do with what happened to roy but in a murder investigation you have to follow up all the loose ends i understand a couple of months ago in april you went with roy to the bergerlennox centre corinne looked away thats right it was a private matter im not here to judge you either of you whose idea was it was what to go to the bergerlennox oh roys hed invested in it hed also visited the center before checked it out he said it was a good place so roy had probably already met or at least seen jennifer clewes on a previous visit and was it they treated me well enough the woman on reception thought you were roys daughter well i used my own name i wasnt trying to pretend or anything theres plenty of reasons these days for a girl having a different name from her father i suppose so so you went through with the procedure now she looked directly at him yes i had an abortion okay i assume youre sure it was roys baby yes of course what do you think i am why didnt you want to keep it i i didnt feel ready what about roy hed already made it clear he wasnt interested he wasnt much interested in me either he thinks i didnt see him chatting up that redhead in the reception area but i did jennifer clewes corinne put her hand to her mouth oh my god is that who it was the girl who got shot ive read about her in the papers what happened thats where he met her the center perhaps you can see now why im asking all these questions there are too many connections and similarities here but im missing something i dont think i can help you i mean i saw him talking to her but hes always like that flirting with girls and i knew there was someone i just didnt put two and two together story of my life no reason you should so you and roy were splitting up when you found out you were pregnant it happened at the worst possible time she gave a harsh laugh like these things always do and you discussed it and you both agreed abortion was the way to go yes look its nothing to do with what happened it cant be it was a private matter youre not trying to say i killed him because i had an abortion and he found a new girlfriend are you of course not said banks though the thought had crossed his mind rejection and jealousy coupled with the emotional trauma of abortion could be a lethal mix she hadnt done it herself banks knew but maybe she had enough money to hire someone and maybe she even knew how to find someone to hire after all she was an accountant to the entertainment world and that was full of villains or celebrities who liked to rub shoulders with them but banks had dismissed the idea as quickly as it had come into his head wronged lovers usually go for a more direct method as any cop who has responded to a domestic will tell you roy was chatting up his new girlfriend while you were in the doctors office banks said how does that make you feel tears brimmed in her eyes how do you think it makes me feel she said he always was a bastard i knew that but i loved him and this time there was no stopping her the dam burst and the flood was unloosed banks went over and sat beside corinne on the sofa putting his arms around her she didnt resist she just melted against him buried her head in his already wet shoulder and let it all pour out banks held her and stroked her hair after a few minutes the tears subsided and she gently extricated herself from his arms banks went back to the armchair and picked up his tea it was lukewarm now but it was something to hide behind in the awkward moments that follow an emotional outburst the cup rattled against the saucer as he picked it up corinne went and fetched some tissues im sorry about that she said its the first time i was just bottling it all up it feels better im glad said banks and im sorry if i sounded abrupt or rude it must be very frustrating for you corinne said and i know you and roy werent very close but you must i mean he was you brother after all this might sound an odd question said banks but did roy ever tell you hed witnessed the attacks on the world trade center yes said corinne i didnt know him back then of course but he told me it devastated him he had nightmares for months i could only imagine what it must have been like did he ever talk to you about religion about spiritual matters not really no i mean i knew he went to church on sundays and he said he liked his local vicar but it didnt really interfere with our life youre not interested in spiritual matters yourself spiritual matters as far as i can understand them yes but not in organized religion look at the misery and bloodshed its caused throughout history still causes did the two of you ever argue about this yes but we always reached an impasse the way you do when you talk about such things he said that was just an excuse and that it was mankind who caused the bloodshed and misery and i said his must be a pretty rotten god if he was so allpowerful and he let it all happen anyway we learned to stay away from the subject in the end i mean where do you go from there where indeed wondered banks who had been involved in one or two similar arguments himself over the years he didnt push religion on me or on anyone else for that matter if thats what youre getting at it was a very private thing with him and he obviously didnt use it to try to talk me out of having an abortion i just wondered how big a role it played in his life thats all like i said he went to church on sunday and had a philosophical chat with the vicar every now and then okay fair enough did he ever mention someone called gareth lambert an old friend yes i remember him mentioning the name did you ever meet him she pulled out a tissue and blew her nose it looked raw when shed finished no she said but i heard his name do you remember the context roy was just talking about an old friend of his who was back in the country they hadnt seen each other in a long time when was this a couple of months ago around the time of the abortion he said he was going to meet him for a drink at some club or other they belonged to on the strand talk about old times and see if there were any business opportunities he was always on the lookout for a new angle im afraid i suspected something else i asked him who he was going out with and thats what he told me i didnt believe him though did roy go for that drink yes do you remember the name of the club sorry no well it its any consolation he was probably telling the truth did he say anything about it afterward no not really he was vague as usual and a little tipsy he just said that hed had an interesting time he seemed excited about more business possibilities did he say what no she said he was very vague something dodgy then banks thought not arms in all likelihood but something crooked if lambert was involved he had nothing more to ask corinne but thought he would stay for a while anyway just to keep her company talk about roy it was after nine oclock it had been a long day and he was feeling pleasantly tired he could ring his parents and the peterborough police then ring annie and ask her to meet him in the morning if that was okay with her as if she were reading his mind corinne said look ive got a nice bottle of white wine in the fridge ive got red if you want it too i dont want to drink by myself i dont want to be alone just now would you care to keep me company for a while longer i mean if there isnt anywhere you have to go where are you staying banks realized that he had completely forgotten about finding somewhere to stay he had driven to london without making any arrangements and the incident on the motorway had pushed all such practical thoughts from his mind there was always roys he still had a key but there was a chance the police hadnt finished there yet dont know he said i thought id just check into a hotel she looked away and reddened a little you can stay here if you like i mean theres a spare room all made up and everything the idea made banks nervous he knew the offer was entirely innocent the poor girl was alone and devastated by the murder of her lover and banks would no more think of letting anything sexual happen between them than he would with his own sister if he had one then again she was a very attractive young woman and he was just a man after all what if she cried out in the night what if banks went to comfort her and she was naked under the sheet what would they do then what really made up his mind though was that right at the moment he was so weary he could hardly lift himself out of the armchair let alone hit the wet streets looking for a cheap hotel so he said thanks thats very good of you thatll be great and i prefer red if thats okay chapter fourteen annie woke early on wednesday morning and when she opened her curtains she was happy to see that the sun was shining again and the sky was robinsegg blue she managed twenty minutes of meditation and a short yoga session ten salutes to the sun cobra locust and peacock then she dressed in her new white cotton slacks red shortsleeve top and light denim jacket and went down to the restaurant for breakfast with banks her wavy brown hair still damp from the shower the meditation and yoga hadnt made her feel as calm as she had hoped and she couldnt help feeling anxious and tense about meeting banks again especially after the way he had phoned and so casually put her off late the previous evening their last meeting had gone well enough but nothing had been resolved and annie still felt as if she were bursting with questions and insecurities the stories in the morning paper upset her too brought back too many bad memories because the reporter was trying to link bankss fire with his brothers murder they had also raked up all the stuff about phil keane and his hapless policewoman girlfriend where they had got it all from in the first place she didnt know but theres always a leak somewhere banks didnt look in too bad a shape annie thought when she saw him already sitting at a clothcovered table drinking coffee in fact he looked a lot more like his old self than he had in ages all he really needed now was a decent haircut and a few more good nights sleep to get rid of the bags under his eyes and maybe some fresh clothes the pallor had all but gone and there was a certain edgines back in his body language instead of that infuriating languor there was also a brightness in his dark blue eyes that she hadnt seen in a long time perhaps she thought his brothers death had made him realize how lucky he was or more likely it had just given him something he cared about a sense of purpose for there was no denying that he was on the case officially or not she sat down opposite him and noticed that he smelled just a little of original old spice it was a smell she liked something she remembered from their intimate time together it had taken her a while to throw out the antiperspirant stick he had left in her bathroom cabinet but she had done so eventually along with the razor shaving cream and toothbrush so what were you up to last night that you couldnt meet up with me then annie asked social duties said banks pull the other one i went see corinne he said how is she shes suffering plenty said banks i dont know about you he went on but whenever im having breakfast in a hotel it has to be the bacon and eggs dont know why id never have that at home its because you dont have to cook it yourself and wash the dishes after said annie and because i never have time to sit around and eat it how are things going not so bad considering said banks my dads just worn down by the whole thing but my mothers acting strange strange how as if its just another family event like the anniversary party shes already talking about sandwiches for the funeral tea might not be a bad idea said annie the postmortems over given cause of death i shouldnt imagine theyll be holding on to the body for too long im really sorry about your brother alan i know dave brooke will do his best hes a good copper a waitress came over and banks ordered the full english annie ordered a cheeseandmushroom omelette and felt a twinge of guilt her first morning shed had only a continental and the next two days muesli but if you didnt treat yourself once in a while what was the point anyway banks asked how are things progressing up north annie ran her hand over her hair ive only been in touch over the phone but they seem to be moving along nicely mostly its forensics on the tire tracks and fingerprints we found at your cottage and on the door of jennifers car weve also got people asking around you know did anyone see anything that sort of thing but we dont expect much to come from that it was late and in a remote place anyway winsomes on the case and i know i can trust her what about templeton and rickerd theyre on it too you know as well as i do dc rickerds a born office manager and kev might be a bit of an arsehole but hes got good instincts hes off on a bit of a tangent and its not a bad idea to give him some space anyway its in good hands im hoping to get back up there today if only for a flying visit to bring everything up to speed the telephone has its limitations indeed it does what about you annie asked what have you been up to me apart from keeping my parents company and corinne nothing much really said banks i doubt that ive discovered anything youd be interested in hearing try me what is it you usually say to witnesses or suspects let me be the judge of that touché said banks okay ive found out that gareth lambert is back from selfimposed exile in spain and that one evening a couple of months ago he had drinks with roy that mean anything to you no theyre old pals banks said known one another for years no doubt they were mixed up in all sorts of criminal enterprises before the arms deal put the wind up them up roy at least lambert were not so sure about anyway its a bit too much of a coincidence for my liking two old crooks reunited and one of them dead i suppose you got all this from burgess didnt you that mans a walking disaster area dirty dick has his good points but i dont know why you should think i got any of it from him i cant imagine where else thats all the waitress delivered their breakfasts banks asked for more coffee annie for tea anyway banks said when the waitress had gone di brookes got everything i found the mobile the cd and usb drive even the digital photos id printed from the cd everything annies eyes narrowed but you kept copies its not illegal i didnt withhold or tamper with anything goddammit alan you broke into a murder victims house you went through his stuff you used his mobile phone you found and copied personal information dont tell me you havent tampered banks rested his knife and fork at the sides of his plate in the first place i didnt know he was a murder victim at the time he was simply missing and had been gone for less than twentyfour hours what would we have done if a call like that came in if hed been a child or a teenager then perhaps we might just have set the wheels in motion but a healthy man in his late forties come on annie you know as well as i do what would happen nothing and he was my brother family i think that gave me a right to enter his home what is it that really upsets you its that you keep going off all on your own like some kind of maverick she said you dont tell anyone whats going on you think youre the only one who can work it all out you think you can handle everything on your own but you cant for gods sake alan you nearly got killed when one of the nearby diners looked over annie realized shed let her voice get too loud the thing was it had come out spontaneously she hadnt known what she was going to say when banks asked her what her problem was because she hadnt really known perhaps the stories in the newspaper had stirred it all up but now she did know it went back to phil keane and the way banks had suspected him but said nothing gone and tried to build his own case against phil on the quiet when she thought about it though she realized that it went even farther back than the phil keane case banks had been just the same when he went off looking for chief constable riddles wayward daughter emily and hed held back so much information from annie during that case that her hands had been tied at one point she had even suspected him of being sexually involved with the girls mother if not the girl herself that was what happened when you held things back the truth got warped and twisted in peoples minds lacking the facts they made up stories based on fancy like the stories in the tabloids now shed said it though she felt embarrassed and she sneaked a look at banks as she took a bite of her omelette he was eating his breakfast again quite placidly the waitress came with more coffee and tea annie thanked her listen to us said banks bickering over breakfast like an old married couple were not bickering said annie it takes two to bicker arent you going to respond what can i say im glad you got it off your chest simple as that is it banks looked at her directly his eyes clear and bright its a start if were going to go on working together we have to get one or two things sorted on whose terms thats not the point im not going to change my ways nor are you then maybe we shouldnt go on working together up to you not entirely what do you want i want to carry on working with you believe it or not i like you and i think youre damn good at your job annie felt absurdly pleased at the compliment but she hoped it didnt show in her face but youre still going to leave me in the dark half the time i dont deliberately hide things from you if i had told you all my suspicions about phil keane as soon as i had them and god knows i tried to hint youd have thrown me out on my ear accused me of being jealous which you did anyway and never talked to me again all i had to go on was a feeling at first some sense that all wasnt what it seemed with him but i might not have had to run into a burning house and drag you out so its that is it no its not even that when you come right down to it annie paused if you really want to know its the way you treated me afterward what do you mean nothing but annie had gone too far now to hold back she put her knife and fork down come on annie said banks lets clear the air see if we cant come up with a chance of working this out thats a change of tune this was more difficult than annie thought it would be especially given the context the ersatz hotel restaurant with its trees and potted plants waitresses carrying trays the businessmen in their pinstriped suits planning their days some of them already on their mobiles and pdas its just that you seemed to brush me off she said push me aside as if my feelings didnt matter god knows i felt bad enough about making the mistake i did over phil i mean can you imagine sharing your bed with a fucking serial killer she shook her head but you id have expected i dont know support comfort maybe you went to corinne last night didnt you but you werent there for me i know we have our history and it hasnt always been easy but you should have been there for me and you werent i was hurting as much as you if not more there shed said it said more than enough christ he was staying silent an awfully long time say something say something at last banks spoke youre right he said and if it means anything im sorry why did you do it why did you abandon me was it her who michelle or whatever her name is banks looked surprised no it wasnt michelle its just that michelle didnt have anything to do with what happened seeing her didnt make me think about it she took me away from it distracted me it was thinking about it that was doing my head in i couldnt remember a thing between answering the door and waking up in the hospital still cant all i know is what youve told me and the smell of whiskey still gives me panic attacks christ for a while for weeks i didnt even want to get out of bed in the morning let alone have a serious hearttoheart about what happened whats the point its like these interminable daytime chat programs people talking on and on about their bloody feelings and problems and it gets them nowhere its just talk talk talk blather blather blather some people think that might be better than keeping it bottled up inside banks ran his hand over his hair look annie i feel like im crawling out of a deep trough by all rights roys murder should have pushed me back in but it hasnt cut me a little slack here maybe youre fueled by anger maybe i am but at least im fueled annie looked at him for a while over her tea and let his words sink in maybe he was right maybe it was time to put it all behind them and move on and maybe part of doing that was allowing banks some leeway in the investigation of his brothers murder after all it wasnt as if she could stop him okay lets imagine you were investigating the case she said hypothetically of course what would your next move be whats the official line of inquiry basically theyre working their way through roys mobile phone book and his business contacts listed on that smart drive you handed over oliver drummond and william gilmore the names i mentioned last night are di brookes priorities because their names are on his computer chop shop and fraud do they sound like enterprises your brother might have been interested in probably said banks though id say fraud was the more likely of the two i cant see roy in the stolencar racket has brooke got anywhere with either of them so far i dont know said annie i havent talked to him yet this morning he should be going after lambert banks said he knows as much as i do that roy had taken a photo of lambert and an unidentified man and hidden it away shortly before he disappeared that ought to set off a few alarm bells dont you think im sure dave has his reasons does lambert have a record no and is his name in the mobile call list or address book no there you are then drummond and gilmore both have form and they appear in the call list even so said banks what have you been up to ive been pursuing leads of my own in the jennifer clewes murder theyre linked roy and jennifer were lovers i know that but they cant both have been killed by the man with the ponytail the timings way off which is why dave thinks its worth looking elsewhere for roys killer and like i said both drummond and gilmore have criminal records brooke also has a man trying to find anyone who knows about roys movements on the day he disappeared apparently the mobile isnt much use there as he only used it once that day to call his hairdresser i know that said banks of course you do you got to the mobile first theyve also enhanced the photo you received brookes not convinced yet that the man is roy but id say it seems likely anyway they think it might lead them to the spot where it happened banks nodded any idea who roy went off with yet annie asked im not sure but i think it might have been gareth lambert roys known him for years id still like to know who that other man in the photo is any leads nothing yet but im working on it he smiled obviously i dont have the manpower to follow up every name in roys life the way you and di brooke do so i plan to go straight to lambert when i can find the slippery bastard it still surprises me that brooke hasnt been there already ive told you why that is annie said and his teams overstretched anyway she paused look i shouldnt be telling you this but there was something going on at the bergerlennox centre dr lukas told me she was helping young eastern european prostitutes who got pregnant mostly illegal immigrants she said to get free abortions on the quiet she called them late girls jennifer clewes found out about it but instead of blowing the whistle she helped bury some of the paperwork i dont think thats everything dr lukas knows but its a start and dont even think of going to see her shes on the edge and a visit from a stranger would alienate her completely dont worry said banks im not altogether stupid ill leave her to you you dont believe her story most of it annie said i think she might be willing to tell me more but shell only do it in her own time on her own terms how long has this been going on about a year how much money is involved the center charges between four hundred and a thousand pounds for consultation termination and postoperative care depending on how advanced the pregnancy is so it could add up to quite a tidy sum over time yes but not worth killing over i suppose not said banks did roy know about it jennifer knew and ill bet she told roy the problem is that dr lukas says jennifer had known about it for a couple of months but it was only in the last few days that people noticed any difference in her behavior so perhaps she found out something else banks suggested something we dont know how did the girls find dr lukas thats what seems a bit vague about it all shes from ukraine she said shes known in the community its possible i suppose some of these communities are very closeknit word gets around but you dont think so i think shes holding something back and i think shes scared im not surprised said banks two people have been murdered i think there might be three oh jennifer mentioned a girl called carmen petri one of the late girls to her close friend melanie scott shortly before she was killed her exboyfriend victor parsons was sort of stalking jennifer ironically enough its the first time a stalkers actually been any practical use to us he saw jennifer come out of the center last monday evening with a young girl who looked pregnant a man immediately came out of the shadows and the girl went off with him in a car and you think that girl was this carmen yes and i think shes dead too the man she went off with was a musclebound lump with a ponytail the one i told you about before and he sounds remarkably like the man we think shot jennifer clewes and broke into your cottage and followed me back here from peterborough said banks annies eyes widened what banks told her what happened on the motorway the previous day and what measures he had taken to protect his parents did you get the number annie asked what do you take me for give it to me ill trace it its already being done burgess banks said nothing annie sighed give it to me anyway banks did as she asked i take it you havent told dave brooke about this yet i told you i rang the peterborough police its their manor i checked with them again this morning and nothing out of the ordinary happened during the night fine said annie ill tell him myself ponytail might well have killed jennifer and tried to scare me off but we know he cant have killed roy so theres someone else involved well if ponytail is the muscle and prostitution is the business id say theres a pimp somewhere at the top of it all wouldnt you possibly annie agreed lambert maybe banks stood up anyway we wont find out the answer by sitting around here however pleasant it is thanks for breakfast annie and for clearing the air where are you going banks smiled well if i told you that youd really be in trouble wouldnt you annie put her hand on bankss arm i know i cant stop you she said but promise me a few things go on keep in touch let me know what you find out okay you too stay away from dr lukas shell come around in her own time youll only freak her out no problem and be careful alan this isnt a game believe me i know that banks bent forward kissed her lightly on the cheek and left annie watched him go then she hurried back up to her room to pack this morning after checking in with brooke she was going back to eastvale come hell or high water you wouldnt believe it it was like a bloody threering circus here the last couple of days said malcolm farrow as he settled in his armchair with a stiff gin and tonic in his hand banks had declined the offer of gin as it was only ten oclock in the morning but he accepted the tonic water gratefully farrow had looked puzzled but poured it anyway as you can see things have settled down a bit now banks looked out of farrows window at roys house the detectives must have finished their search and removed everything they thought pertinent to their investigation because the place was unguarded they would have gone through roys stuff for any evidence related to the crime and also for information about his lifestyle his habits and his associates that might give them a lead to follow banks knew what they would find because he had already made a thorough search himself and handed over everything to brooke now the formalities were done with the house would be turned over to roys next of kin his parents i can imagine what it was like said banks look im sorry i didnt ring you straightaway but i had to go take care of my parents and i didnt have your number handy thats all right i was really shocked to hear the news its been all over the papers and the television weve had reporters around theyve gone now the police seem to have moved on theres nothing left for them here said banks anyway its nice of you to remember me and drop by no problem did the police want to talk to you the police oh yes they were all over the street what did you tell them just what i told you its all i know what about the reporters his face reddened sent them packing bunch of scavengers have you thought any more about that photo i showed you asked banks slipping the envelope out of his briefcase farrow looked at it again through his reading glasses which were clipped tightly to his bulbous purpleveined nose look im not going to have to say anything in court am i this is just between you and me said banks as farrow squinted at the photos banks sipped some tonic water the fizziness made him burp and he could still taste the bacon and eggs hed eaten for breakfast well said farrow it certainly could be him the more i look the more i see the resemblance as i said my eyesights not so good on detail but there are streetlights and the mans size and the gray hair look about right he passed the photo back to banks a bit vague i know but its the best i can do i appreciate that who is he anyway hes surely not the one who i dont think so said banks if it really is him hes an old business partner of roys someone roy would probably open the door to and accompany for a drink or whatever which was the way it seemed to have happened someone he trusted banks thanked farrow for his help made his excuses and left there were no signs of activity around roys house on wednesday morning not even a police seal across the door banks used his key to open the door and walked inside the only sound he could hear was the humming of the refrigerator there was a deep silence at the core of the house the silence of roys absence and it felt heavier now than it had when banks first arrived first he checked the kitchen the laptop computer he had left on the table there was missing and he assumed the police had taken it there was nothing he could do about that right now but he would have to let brooke know that he wanted it back when they had finished with it next he went up to look at roys office whoever had searched the house had made a neat and tidy job of it nothing looked out of place banks went into the entertainment room and flopped on the sofa he thought about the cd he had found roy must have known that he was involved in something dodgy by wednesday when he buried the photos of lambert and friend among the pornographic images and perhaps he knew that the something dodgy whether it was prostitution or illegal immigrants or something else was fast reaching critical mass did roy know that his life was in danger banks doubted it if roy was used to skirting the edges of the law and mixing with bad company as he seemed to be then he was probably cocky enough to think there was nothing he couldnt handle but something had changed all that and it had happened between wednesday and friday evening or even a couple of days earlier if jennifer clewess behavior was anything to go by what had roys movements been during those crucial days where had he been whom had he talked to if banks could get the answers to those questions he thought then he might be able to answer the riddle of roys death and jennifers he thought about what annie had told him over breakfast the doctor helping out prostitutes had jennifer clewes told roy most likely she had what had his reaction been had it anything to do with their deaths but banks failed to see how helping out a few unfortunate illegal immigrants could lead to murder unless of course the people who brought them in were involved and were beginning to feel threatened by something banks also hadnt forgotten that burgess had told him gareth lambert was a smuggler with a large network of underworld connections burgess had also said that lambert knew the balkan route like the back of his hand and now annie was telling banks about eastern european prostitutes using the bergerlennox centre at least a vague picture was beginning to form in his mind but he still didnt know roys place in it or why he had been killed banks thought back on his chat with corinne the previous evening he had found out a lot about his brother through talking to her roy loved the goon show and monty python he did a hilarious ministry of silly walks impersonation and quite a decent version of the four yorkshiremen sketch new york was still his favorite city italy his favorite country he had recently taken up digital photography and all the photos on his walls were his he played golf and tennis regularly he supported arsenal typical banks thought who lumped arsenal in the same category as manchester united the best teams money could buy his favorite color was purple his favorite food was wild mushroom risotto his favorite wine amarone he loved opera and often took corinne to covent garden though she admitted that she never quite got opera and they both enjoyed going to see hollywood musicals and old foreign films with subtitles bergman visconti renoir fellini roy gave money to beggars in the street but complained when he thought he was being overcharged in shops and restaurants he could be moody and corinne had to confess that she never quite knew what was going on in his mind but she loved him as she told banks when her tears flowed for the second time after the third glass of wine no matter that she hadnt known where she stood with him for weeks no matter that he had left her largely alone to deal with the trauma of her abortion she had still hoped somehow that he would tire of his new conquest and come back to her there was only one family photograph in roys entertainment room and banks walked over to look at it it was taken on the promenade at blackpool he remembered in august and you could see the blackpool tower in the background there they stood all four of them parents on the inside and flanking them roy freckled then his hair a lot fairer than it was when he got older and banks at fourteen looking moody and what he supposed passed for cool back then in his black drainpipe trousers and poloneck beatles jumper he hadnt really looked at the photo closely before but when he did he realized that it must have been taken by graham marshall who had accompanied the banks family on that holiday only a month or so before he disappeared during his sundaymorning paper round this was the holiday when banks had fallen for the beautiful linda who worked behind the counter at the local coffee bar she was far too old for him but he had fallen nonetheless then he and graham had picked up a couple of girls at the pleasure beach tina and sharon and taken them under the pier for a bit of hankypanky he didnt remember having the photograph taken but that was no surprise he hardly remembered roys being on that holiday either what fourteenyearold would waste his time hanging around with his nineyearold brother graham marshall was dead another murder victim and now roy banks looked at his father in an old gray vnecked pullover shirtsleeves rolled up cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth hair swept back with brylcreem then he looked at his mother hardly a dolly bird but surprisingly young and pretty with a fullbodied perm and a summer dress showing off her trim waist smiling into the camera what would they find when they explored her insides next week banks wondered would she survive and his father after all this trauma banks was beginning to feel as if everyone he came into contact with was cursed that all his companions became hostages to death like the wraiths that haunted strange affair then he told himself to stop being so maudlin he had solved graham marshalls murder over thirtyfive years after it had been committed his mother would survive the operation and his fathers heart would go on beating for a long time yet roy was dead and banks would find out who killed him and that was that as banks was getting ready to head out to try gareth lambert again his mobile rang alan its annie thought you were on your way home so did i but somethings come up banks gripped the phone tighter what technical support have worked out where the digital photo on your brothers mobile was taken how on earth did they manage that from the list of abandoned factories annie said there were some letters visible on a wall in the background ngs and ife one of the factories listed was midgeleys castings and one of the older detectives on the team remembered he used to pass by the place on his way to school and they had a sign that read midgeleys castings cast for life the place shut down in and nobodys done anything with it since where is it by the river down battersea way im sorry to be so brutal alan but the tide experts also agree that its very likely the area where your brothers body was dumped in the river so its looking more and more as if it was roy in foreground of the picture were heading out there now want to come you know i do what does brooke have to say hes okay with it meet us there fine annie gave him an address and directions and banks hurried out to his car ds browne speaking this is dc templeton from eastvale how are things down your way fine thanks anything new maybe said templeton fingering the plastic bag on the desk in front of him i went to talk to roger cropleys wife and found him at home says hes got a summer cold but i didnt notice any sniffles anyway i think i rattled him a bit more he seemed a bit nervous when i told him that paula chandler the woman who got away thought she might be able to recognize her attacker but thats not true susan said cropley doesnt know that and i think his wife might know a bit more than shes letting on too anyway ive got an idea did your socos do a thorough traceevidence search of the victims car im sure they did said susan but there was no evidence that the killer was ever in the car he clearly dragged her out and into the bushes but hed have to lean in to apply the chloroform true what are you getting at youve still got all the collected samples i assume hair skin of course and the car that too look whats going on can you check if they found any dandruff on the seat back dandruff yes ill check said susan what do you have in mind ive been on the web and it all sounds a bit complicated but as far as i can gather you can get dna from dandruff i mean it is just skin isnt it it wont do us much good said susan unless we have a sample for comparison er well as a matter of fact we might have what do you mean ive got a sample of cropleys dandruff can i send it down to you i trust you didnt ask mr cropley for this templeton laughed no believe me he gave it quite freely though thats not the point susan said im sure you know as well as i do that you have to get the suspects written permission even for a nonintimate sample unless youve detained him for a serious offense and the super gives permission to take one i know my pace regulations said templeton what im saying is that this could confirm my suspicions if you knew it was him if we knew it was him then it would make a difference and we could start to build a real case he doesnt have to know about the previous sample nobody does except you and me right now weve got no real grounds to arrest him and demand a sample but if the sample he gave me matches any of the dandruff found in the car then wed know where to look and you can be damn sure wed come up with something to arrest him for after that well then wed get an official sample of course what if its not him then hes off the hook but thered be records paperwork relating to the first test these things are expensive i know that but so what it neednt come out surely you must know someone at the lab with a bit of discretion how is anybody going to know a good defense lawyer would use it as ammunition against our case only if he found out besides it wouldnt matter by that point wed have officially matching dna which wed have no trouble getting admitted all by the book you cant argue with that christ ill even pay for the test myself if thats your problem thats not the problem and i doubt you could afford it anyway the point is that if it does turn out to be cropley the real evidence could be thrown out because of what youre asking its iffy no i dont like this at all templetion sighed he hadnt realized what a stickler ds browne was look he said do you want this guy or not maybe itll rule him out i dont know but we should at least keep an eye on him if im right and the dna would prove that one way or another hes done it before and hell do it again what do you think wouldnt you like to know templeton felt himself tense during the silence that followed finally susan browne said send it down ill talk to my sio see what i can do im not promising anything though great said templeton its already on the way banks felt more trepidation than he could ever have imagined as he walked with brooke and annie over the weeds and stony ground toward the dirty brick factory its ugly facade covered in dayglo graffiti was he now going to see the exact spot where his brother had been shot and killed little roy whom hed saved from a bully and scarred with a toy sword he gritted his teeth and felt his neck and arm muscles tense up the doors looked forbidding but they were easily opened and the three were soon crossing the vast factory floor footsteps echoing there was something about abandoned factories with the gaping holes in their roofs rusted old machines drums pallets and weeds growing through cracks in the walls and floor that always disturbed banks he thought it had something to do with a dream that had scared him when he was young but he couldnt remember the details he also thought it had something to do with the ballbearing factory across the road from his parents house though it had been in operation during his time there and he had no unpleasant experiences associated with it there had always been derelict houses workshops and factories though and he had explored most of them with his friends tracking down imaginary monsters whatever the reason places like that still gave him the shivers and this one was no exception you do take me to the nicest places dave said annie this is almost as cheerful as that street in bow at least its not raining today brooke said a rat scuttled out from under a rusted sheet of metal and practically ran over annies feet on its way out she pulled a face but made no sound sunlight lanced through missing sections of roof illuminating the dust motes the three of them kicked up as they walked the large windows behind their protective grilles were all broken and shattered glass was strewn all over the floor sparkling in the rays of light here and there were oily puddles and damp patches from the previous nights rain at the center of the factory floor almost hidden by rusty machines banks saw a wooden chair on the floor beside it lay snakelike lengths of cord better stand back said brooke as they approached it the socos will be here soon and they wont appreciate it if we trample all over their scene banks stood and looked he thought he could see spots of blood on the cord and splatters on the ground near the chair for a moment he pictured roy tied there felt his terror as he knew he was going to die in this filthy place then his policemans instinct kicked in and he tried to interpret what he was seeing roy was shot in the head with a twentytwo like jennifer clewes right he said thats right said brooke and there was no exit wound no so where did all the blood come from banks noticed brooke exchange a glance with annie come on said banks im not a fool the pathologist found some evidence that he was beaten brooke admitted so they tortured him the bastards brooke stared down at his shoes it looks that way but we dont know for certain that your brother was even here yet you cant really tell who it is from the photograph and just who else do you think it would be banks said anyway now youve got all the blood samples you could possibly need to make a match i suppose we have said brooke but why torture him banks asked we dont know annie said obviously to make him tell them something or to find out how much he knew about something or how much hed already told i dont think it would have taken long to get roy to talk banks said the image of the boy bullying roy flashed though his mind roy crying and holding his stomach in pain bankss intervention but this time he hadnt been able to come to the rescue he hadnt been there for him and this time roy had been killed banks could only hope that his parents never found out about the torture he didnt blame annie and brooke for trying to keep it from him hed probably have done the same if it were one of their relatives but now he had the job of protecting his own mother and father from the truth they didnt bother tidying up after themselves said annie pointing to a single shell casing on the floor close to the chair probably thought no one would ever find the place said brooke some kids would have found it eventually banks said kids love places like this pigeons flew in and out through the holes in the roof and walls perching on the rafters and ruffling their feathers their white droppings speckled sections of floor and even the chair itself despite its partial openness to the elements the factory smelled of small dead animals and stale grease ill see if i can get some uniforms to canvass the neighborhood brooke said who knows someone might have noticed unusual activity around the place the wind made a mournful sound as it blew through the broken windows harmonizing strangely with the cooing pigeons banks gave a little shiver despite the warmth of the day hed seen all he wanted the godforsaken place where roy had spent his last few hours being tortured then shot no matter how long he lived he knew he would never get the image out of his mind for now though he had other things to do he told brooke and annie he was leaving and neither asked him where he was going as he was getting in his car the technical support van turned into the factory yard they would scrutinize the place where roy had died scrape blood search for fingerprints fibers hair skin any traces that the murderers had left behind with any luck they would turn up enough to secure a conviction should the police ever find a viable suspect banks left them to it chapter fifteen after dropping his car off outside roys he didnt fancy spending the day driving in london traffic trying to find parking spots and the tube was much faster banks tried lamberts travel operation on edgeware road but was told that mr lambert was unavailable next he went back to the chelsea flat not far from sloane square and found gareth lambert just on his way out of the front door going somewhere gareth he said who the fuck are you lambert tried to push past him banks stood his ground my names banks detective chief inspector alan banks youre roys brother lambert stood back and eyed banks up and down well fuck a duck the old killjoy himself can we go back inside im busy ive got to get to the office it wont take long banks stared lambert down finally lambert shrugged and led banks upstairs to a firstfloor flat the interior was functional enough but lacked the personal touch as if lamberts real life lay elsewhere the man himself looked just the same as he did in roys photo bearish a bit overweight with a red complexion part sun part hypertension banks guessed and a thick head of curly gray hair he was dressed in iceblue jeans and an oversized baggy white shirt burgess had made a comparison with harry lime but as far as banks could remember lime was suave and charming on the surface more like phil keane lambert was rougher around the edges and clearly didnt seem to rely on charm to get by they sat down opposite each other like a pair of chess players and lambert regarded banks with a vaguely amused look in his eyes so youre roys big brother the detective thats right i understand the two of you go back a long way indeed we do i met roy just after hed graduated from university we were a bit wet behind the ears back then as i remember it all the kids were wearing torn tshirts and safety pins in their ears listening to the sex pistols and the clash and there we were in our business suits sitting in some square hotel bar planning our next venture which was probably marketing torn jeans and safety pins to the kids he laughed they were good days i was very sorry to hear about what happened to roy by the way were you of course look i really am a busy man if youre just going to sit there and because you really dont seem to be grieving very deeply for someone youd know for so long how do you know how much im grieving fair enough did your ventures together involve arms dealing lamberts eyes narrowed why bring that up he said its ancient history yes we were involved in what we thought was a perfectly legitimate weapons sale but we were hoodwinked and the shipment was misdirected well that was enough for me what do they say once bitten twice shy so you stuck with less risky ventures after that i wouldnt say any of our ventures were without risk but lets just say the risk was of a more monetary kind not the sort of risk where you could end up in jail if you werent careful or dead quite insider trading can carry a hefty penalty hah everybody was doing it still are have you never had a hot tip from the horses mouth and made a few bob on it no said banks so if i said right now such and such a company is making an important merger next week and their share prices will double you can honestly say you wouldnt run right out and buy as many shares as you could get your hands on banks had to think about that one it sounded easy and perhaps just a little bit naughty put that way hardly criminal but he didnt understand the stock market and that was why he didnt play it besides he never felt that he had the money to spare for such gambles i might splurge on a couple he said in the end lambert clapped his hands there you are he said i thought so it sounded as if he were welcoming banks to a club he had no desire to join ive also heard rumors that you have been involved in smuggling banks said thats interesting where did you hear these are they true of course not the word has such negative connotations dont you think smuggling its so emotive i regard what ive done more as a matter of practical geography i move things from one place to another with great efficiency i might add im glad youve got no time for false modesty what things just things arms drugs people i hear you know the balkan route lambert raised an eyebrow you do have your ears to the ground dont you roy never told me how sharp you are the balkan route well i might have known it once but these days those borders change faster than you can draw them and youd better stop accusing me of breaking the law right now or ill have my solicitor on you roys brother or no ive never been convicted of anything in my life so youve been lucky still lots of opportunities for entrepreneurs in the balkans though or the exsoviet states much too dangerous im afraid im too old for all that im semiretired i have a wife i happen to love very much and a travel agency to run when did you last see roy friday night banks tried not to let his excitement show what time about half past twelve or one oclock in the morning why are you sure it was friday night of course i am lambert was playing with him banks sensed he could see it in the mans restless teasing eyes lambert knew that the neighbor had seen him getting into his car with roy and that banks had no doubt talked to the neighbor and got his description but that was at half past nine what were they doing until half past twelve or one oclock lambert picked up a box of cigars from the table and offered one to banks cuban no thanks suit yourself lambert fiddled with a cutter and matches and finally got the thing lit he looked at banks through the smoke you seem surprised that i said i saw roy on friday evening whys that i think you know why said banks indulge me because thats when he went missing he hasnt been seen alive since half past nine on friday i can most sincerely assure you that he has by me and countless other members of the albion club the albion club on the strand its a rather exclusive club membership by invitation only banks remembered that corinne had told him roy went to a club on the strand with lambert a few weeks ago what goes on there lambert laughed nothing illegal if thats what youre thinking the club has a gaming license it also has a topclass restaurant and an exceedingly comfortable bar roy and i are both members have been for years even when i was living abroad id drop by if i happened to be in the city he puffed on his cigar eyes narrowed to calculating slits as if daring banks to challenge him lets backtrack then said banks of course what time did you first see roy on friday night about half past nine said lambert i dropped by his place and picked him up was this a regular arrangement i wouldnt say regular but wed done it before yes roy prefers to leave the car when he goes out drinking and i hardly touch the stuff these days so i dont mind driving its not far out of my way and youd arranged to pick him up and take him to the albion club on friday yes the cigar had gone out lambert lit it again banks got the impression that it was more of a prop than anything else what happened when you got there lambert shrugged the usual we went into the bar and got a couple of stiff brandies and chatted for a while no i tell a lie i had a brandy my only drink of the night and roy had wine the club does a decent house claret who did you talk to a few of the other members names look these are important people influential people they wont take too kindly to being harassed by the police nor to knowing it was me who set you on them maybe you havent quite grasped the seriousness of this banks said a man has been murdered my brother your friend you were one of the last people to see him alive we need to trace his movements and activities on the evening he disappeared this puts me in a difficult position i dont bloody care what position it puts you in i want names banks locked eyes with him eventually lambert reeled off a string of names and banks wrote them down he didnt recognize any of them how did roy seem banks asked was he depressed worried on edge he seemed fine to me did he confide in you about any problems or anything no what did he talk about business golf cricket wine women you know the usual man talk did he mention me lambert gave a tight little smile im afraid he didnt no banks found that hard to believe given that roy had just phoned him out of the blue with an urgent problem a matter of life and death but he let it go for the time being did roy ever mention a girl called carmen petri it was over in a second but it was definitely there the shock the slight hesitation before answering a refusal to look banks in the eye no lambert said have you ever heard the name before theres an actress carmen electra but i doubt that its her youre thinking of no said banks theres also an opera called carmen but its not her either casually he slipped a copy of the photograph he had printed from roys cd out of his briefcase and set it on the low table whos the other man sitting with you in this photo he asked lambert peered closely at the photograph then looked at banks sideways where did you get this he gestured at the photo with his cigar roy took it lambert sat back in his chair how strange he never told me i assume you do know who the man youre sitting with is of course i do its max max broda hes a business colleague i cant imagine why roy would want to take a photo of us together what business would that be travel max puts tours together recruits guides works out itineraries hotels suggests destinations of interest where mostly around the adriatic and mediterranean including the balkan countries some yes if and when theyre safe to visit id like to talk to him said banks lambert scrutinized the end of his cigar and took another puff before answering im afraid that will be rather difficult he said hes gone home wheres that prague do you have an address are you thinking of going there its a beautiful city i know someone who can fix you up with the best guided tour maybe said banks i would like his address though i might have it somewhere lambert scrolled through the files on his pda and finally spelled out an address for banks who copied it down what time did you leave the club he asked roy left sometime between half past twelve and one oclock you werent still together at that time no we werent joined at the hip you know roy likes to play the roulette tables i prefer poker myself did he leave alone as far as i know where did he go ive no idea what time did you leave about three i was knackered by then not to mention broke where did you go back here not home to your wife lambert leaned forward face thrust forward and stabbed the air with his cigar you leave her out of this very understanding is she i told you leave her out of it lambert relit his cigar and his tone softened look he said running his free hand through his curly gray hair i was tired i came back here i dont know what you suspect me of but roy was a good friend and a colleague of many years standing i didnt kill him why would i what possible motive could i have are you sure he didnt say where he was going no i assumed he was going home was he drunk lambert tipped his head to one side and thought for a moment hed had a few he said mostly wine but he wasnt staggering or slurring his speech not fit to drive id say but fit enough to get a taxi is that what he did ive no idea what happened once he got outside and you didnt see him again no okay said banks standing to leave i suppose we could always ask around the taxi drivers one thing said lambert as he walked banks to the door you already know about the arms deal years back you mentioned it earlier yes i think he wanted to get involved in that sort of thing again at least it might be a direction worth looking in i mean roy had been making a few noises you know sounding me out asking about old contacts and such on friday yes in the club and i told him id lost touch which is true the world has changed mr banks in case you havent noticed and i warned him off how did he respond lambert clapped a hand on bankss shoulder as they stood near the door you know roy he said or maybe you dont anyway once hes on the trail of something hes not easily deterred he persisted got a bit pissed off with me as a matter of fact thought i was holding out on him depriving him of a business opportunity so you ended the evening on a sour note hed have got over it if he hadnt been killed yes why did you fall out with julian harwood by the way lambert looked surprised you know about that yes it was years ago storm in a teacup harwood insisted id cheated him out of some money in a land sale that i knew the new motorway was going to run right by it and did you lambert did his best to look innocent and outraged but it came out like a poor parody me of course not i wouldnt do a thing like that of course not banks echoed is there anything more you can tell me im afraid not except what lambert stood by the door and scratched his temple dont take this amiss he said just a piece of friendly advice roys dead i cant change that i dont know anything about it and i certainly dont know who did it but dont you think you should think twice take heed of what youre getting into and perhaps be a bit more careful lest you disturb a nest of vipers is that a warning mr lambert take it as you will lambert looked at his watch now im afraid i really must head for the office ive got business to take care of annie hardly had time to call at her cottage in harkside and water the wilting potted plants before heading to eastvale for the threeoclock team meeting it was another beautiful dales day a little cooler than it had been with one or two fluffy white clouds scudding across the pale blue sky but she didnt have time to pause and enjoy any of it sometimes she wondered what the point of living in the country was given her job and the hours she put in they were all waiting in the boardroom gristhorpe hatchley winsome rickerd templeton and stefan nowak crime scene coordinator the long table was so highly polished you could see your reflection in it and a whiteboard hung on the wall at one end of the room surrounded by corkboards where stefan had pinned the crime scene photographs they made quite a contrast to the paintings of the wool barons on the other walls after annie had brought everyone up to speed on the bergerlennox centre roy banks carmen petri and their possible connection with jennifer clewess murder gristhorpe handed the floor over to stefan nowak stefan stood by the boards and the photographs and cleared his throat not for the first time annie wondered what sort of life stefan led outside of work he was one of the most charming and elegant men she had ever known and his life was a complete mystery to her first of all said stefan we have fingerprints from dci bankss door that dont match the builders we have tire tracks from his drive and here he paused dramatically and lifted up a plastic bag we also have a cigarette end found near the beck on dci bankss property fortunately before the rain came from this we have been able to get the saliva necessary for dna what about the tire tracks annie asked theyre michelins of a type consistent with tires often used on a mondeo said stefan ive sent the necessary information to essex for comparison with whats left of the mondeo that crashed outside basildon im still awaiting results so gristhorpe said youve got prints tire tracks and dna from dci bankss cottage and if and when we find a suspect these will tie him to the murder of jennifer clewes and roy banks well said stefan theyll tie him to dci bankss cottage exactly said gristhorpe and no crime was committed there thats not strictly true sir said annie someone definitely broke in gristhorpe gave her a withering look and shook his head not enough is there anything else weve got jennifer clewess mobile records from the network winsome said not that they tell us a great deal as far as i can gather the calls are all to and from friends and family what about the last call annie asked the one kate nesbit remembered on friday evening yes i was coming to that said winsome jennifer received a phone call at ten fortythree pm on friday the eleventh of june duration three minutes the problem is that its an unknown number ive got the mobile company working on it but theyre not offering a lot of hope thanks for trying said annie gristhorpe looked at his watch ive got to go he said ive got acc mclaughlin and the press breathing down my neck i appreciate your progress so far but its not enough we need results and we need them fast annie youd better get back down to london tomorrow and keep pushing the bergerlennox connection the rest of you keep at it up here winsome get back to the mobile company and see if they can come up with a number for us get them to crosscheck with jennifers outgoing calls thats it for now when gristhorpe left the room everyone breathed a sigh of relief hes in a bit of a grumpy mood this morning isnt he said stefan to annie as they all filed out a few moments later i think hes had the chief constable as well as acc mclaughlin on his case said annie and its my guess that however enlightened he thinks he is he still doesnt like being given a bollocking by a woman stefan smiled ouch he said maam can i have a word it was dc templeton of course kev said annie waving goodbye to stefan lets grab a coffee in the canteen templeton pulled a face with all due respect maam i know said annie it tastes like cats piss youre right well go to the golden grill they threaded their way through the crowd of tourists on market street and were lucky to find a free table the sole waitress was rushed off her feet but she managed to bring them each a cup of coffee quickly enough what is it kev annie asked its this roger cropley business templeton said i havent bothered you with it much so far because well youve been down south and youve had lots of other things on your plate i mean it might be a bit tangential but i really think were on to something here what the claire potter murder i dont know said annie seems like a bit of a coincidence doesnt it thats what i thought at first said templeton warming to the subject but if you really think about it if cropley has been preying on young women alone on the motorway on friday nights then the only coincidence is that he was at the watford gap services at the same time as jennifer clewes and thats exactly the kind of coincidence hed always be hoping for he trolls those places watford gap leicester forest newport pagnell trowell claire potter and jennifer clewes were exactly what he was looking for i see your point said annie but i mean its a coincidence that this time he picked on a girl who was already singled out by someone else to die okay but strange things happen sometimes it still doesnt mean cropleys harmless you dont need to tell me that kev said annie there was another woman too paula chandler someone drove her off the road late on a friday night in february and tried to open her car door only it was locked and she managed to get away did she get a good look at him just his hand annie thought for a moment it still doesnt mean cropleys the killer maybe theres a way we can find out go on templeton leaned forward the excitement clear i met with ds browne from derby he went on and she agrees its worth a shot ive talked with cropley and his wife again since then and im still convinced theres something there anyway he went on to tell annie about the dandruff i must say annie commented when hed finished thats very clever of you kev i didnt know they could get dna from dandruff they can said templeton i checked it out with stefan and ds browne confirmed it when she phoned to tell me she put a rush on it they can also process dna pretty quickly these days when theyve a mind to leaving aside the problem of its being inadmissible annie went on what do you expect to happen next it doesnt need to be admissible templeton explained as he had done to ds browne we just need some concrete evidence that weve got the right guy then we can pull out all the stops and nail him the right way we get legitimate dna samples we interview him again we get him to account for every minute of every friday night hes ever spent on the motorway we get his coworkers and his employers to tell us what they know about him and his movements we interview people at all the motorway garages and cafés again all the latenight lorry drivers someone has to have seen something templeton was looking at her with such keenness in his eyes that annie felt it would be churlish to disappoint him despite her misgivings and if derby cid was involved too at least he couldnt go too far off the rails templeton was beginning to show all the signs of becoming a bit like banks annie thought and two of them she didnt need but he had at least talked to her told her about his thoughts which was more than banks did most of the time okay she said finally but i want you to work directly with derby cid on this if you talk to cropley i want this ds browne or someone else from derby with you i dont want you going off on your own with this kev understood templeton nodded still looking like the dog whod got the bone yes maam dont worry itll be a solid case by the book annie smiled dont make promises you cant keep she said but when it comes to it i do expect a case that cps will be willing to take to court thats a tall order annie laughed the crown prosecution service was notoriously reluctant to take on anything they didnt feel gave them a hundred percent chance of getting a conviction do your best she said lets get back to the office they finished their coffees paid and set off back across market street annie had no sooner got inside the station doorway than her mobile rang she gestured for templeton to go on ahead of her detective inspector cabbot a familiar voice asked yes dr lukas id like to talk to you go ahead not on the telephone can we meet well thought annie there went her evening at home relaxing in the tub with a good book it had better be worth it im up north she said glancing at her watch its twenty to four now depending on the trains i should be able to get down there by about eight that will be fine at the house then no dr lukas named a french restaurant in covent garden i will wait for you there she said and hung up after his talk with gareth lambert banks took the tube to charing cross and headed for the albion club it didnt open until late evening and the doors were locked he tried knocking a few times then he rattled them but no one answered a few passersby gave him disapproving glances as if he were an alcoholic desperate for a drink in the end he gave the door a hard kick then walked to trafalgar square and wandered among the hordes of tourists for a while trying to rid himself of the sense of frustration and anxiety that had been building up in him ever since he had seen roys body laid out on the shingle bank it was midafternoon and banks felt hungry despite the full english breakfast at annies hotel that morning he found an americanstyle burger joint near the top of old compton street just across from a bodypiercing studio and ordered a cheeseburger and a coke as he sat eating and watching the world go by outside he thought about his talk with gareth lambert the theatrics with the cigar the joke about carmen electra the reference to roys being interested in arms deals again the garbled warning as he was leaving none of these things had been necessary but lambert hadnt been able to resist innocence arrogance it wasnt always easy to tell them apart but there was something else that left him feeling very unsatisfied indeed banks perhaps more than anybody felt that roy might have been less than legal in his business dealings over the years and as corinne had pointed out banks had always been ready to think the worst of his brother it wasnt something he was proud of but he thought he was right after the talk with the reverend ian hunt though not to mention after looking a bit deeper into roys life he had come to believe that roy really had learned a lesson from the foolhardy arms deal he had been involved in once what he had seen in new york on the eleventh of september had shaken him to the core and had brought home to him the stark reality of terrorism it was no longer a busful of strangers in basra or tel aviv on a television screen but people just like him going about their daily routine some of whom he knew dying right in front of his eyes banks was starting to think that perhaps gareth lambert had overplayed his hand he didnt believe that roy wanted to get into arms dealing again and had been asking lambert about old contacts unless he intended to seek retribution which was unlikely at this late stage in the game if roy had any old scores he wanted to settle he would have done so years ago in the white heat of his rage after but he hadnt which made banks think that lambert was lying and there was only one clear explanation of that to put banks off the scent divert him from the real business more and more he was beginning to believe that that had something to do with the goingson at the bergerlennox centre with jennifer clewes and roy with dr lukas with the mysterious carmen petri and the late girls but how lambert himself fit in banks still didnt know so what was the missing piece he doubted that lambert would give it up he was far too shrewd for that he had enjoyed toying with banks telling him he had seen roy on friday when he already knew from the newspapers that was the day roy disappeared but he had done that because he knew banks had got a description from malcolm farrow and because he thought there was nothing in his actions that night to incriminate him no doubt it was true that roy had left the albion club between half past twelve and one oclock and that roy hadnt left till three banks would go back to the club and check later that evening he finished his burger and took the tube back to south kensington with a view to nosing around roys files again to see if there was anything there relating to the albion club or any of the members names lambert had given him perhaps he could phone some of them and see if they would verify lamberts story he also wanted to get in touch with his parents and the peterborough police again and make sure everything was all right all was still quiet inside roys house banks locked the door behind him slipped the keys in his pocket and headed for the kitchen when he got there he was surprised to see a man sitting at the kitchen table he was even more surprised when the man turned and pointed a gun at him chapter sixteen sit down slowly the man said and keep your hands in sight banks did as he was told who are you the man asked i might well ask the same i asked first and ive got the gun my names alan banks do you have any identification banks put his hand slowly in his inside pocket and brought out his warrant card he shoved it across the table to the man who examined it carefully then pushed it back and slipped his gun inside a shoulder holster hidden by his jacket what the fuck was all that about said banks feeling a rush of anger as the adrenaline surged back i had to be sure said the man dieter ganz interpol he offered his own card which banks studied then stuck out his hand banks didnt feel like shaking it he felt more like thumping him ganz shrugged im sorry he went on detective superintendent burgess told me you might be here but i had to make certain he didnt have much of an accent but it was there if you listened in his speech patterns and careful diction how did you get in it wasnt difficult said ganz glancing toward the back window banks saw that a circle of glass about the size of a mans fist had been cut out of it just below the catch well i dont know about you said banks but after that little scare i could do with a drink no thank you said ganz nothing for me suit yourself banks opened a bottle of roys côte de nuits and poured himself a generous glass his hand was still shaking so burgess sent you did he ganz nodded he told me where you would be im sorry it took so long but he had a little difficulty finding me ive been out of the country it seems that we have interests in common first of all youd better tell me what yours are at the moment my interest is in people smuggling more specifically the smuggling of young women for the purposes of sexual exploitation ganz looked undercover banks thought he was young early thirties at most his blond hair was a bit too long and greasy and he clearly hadnt shaved for four or five days the linen jacket he wore over his shirt was creased and stained and his jeans needed a wash and what interests do we have in common banks asked ganz took a piece of paper from his side pocket and unfolded it on the table it was a copy of the photo banks had given to burgess youve been asking questions about who this man with gareth lambert is he said lambert told me his name is max broda that is correct said ganz max broda hes an albanian traveling on an israeli passport why would he do that ganz smiled showing a missing front tooth no troublesome visas to worry about whats his business gareth lambert had told banks that max worked in the travel business organizing tours and cruises but somehow or other banks didnt think ganz would be here if that were the case brodas a trader said ganz do you know what that is a trader in what have you ever heard of the arizona market no i know it sounds american but its actually in bosnia between sarajevo and zagreb its like those old markets you see in movies you know the casbah so romantic with its stalls of colorful goods and its narrow winding streets during the day many people go there to buy pirated cds and dvds and knockoff rolexes and chanel perfume but at night it becomes a market of a different kind at night you can buy stolen cars guns drugs and young women they are sold there like sheep and cattle are sold at your country shows sometimes they are auctioned off made to parade naked holding numbers while the traders touch them and caress them before they make their bids look in their mouths like you would if you were buying a horse when theyve been bought many of them end up working in clubs and brothels in bosnia servicing the international peacekeeping forces but many are also smuggled into other countries to work in peep shows and massage parlors i suppose thats where lambert comes in banks said the balkan route thats one way ganz agreed serbia croatia albania macedonia bosniaherzegovina montenegro and kosovo but there are others and they are always changing they cross wherever the border is unguarded many women from russia ukraine and romania are smuggled through the eastern route through poland to germany or through hungary from serbia to italy many smugglers prefer to use albanian seaports and ship the women over on rubber dinghies not all of them make it but however they get here once they are inside the eu they can be moved around more freely so lambert and broda are in business together yes ganzs eyes hardened broda buys the women and lambert arranges to get them into the country he doesnt do it himself of course that would be too risky but he knows the weak spots and who can be bribed we think they have been in business for some time lambert was based in spain before but things got a bit too hot for him there so now hes over here and the travel business is a perfect cover for the trips he has to make so gareth lambert and max broda have been conspiring to smuggle young girls into england for the purpose of prostitution for some years now yes but not just england thats why it is difficult to pin them down we are trying to build up dossiers on similar operations in paris berlin and rome its a widespread problem he paused i have seen these women mr banks talked to them to call them women is not strictly accurate in the first place they are no more than girls some as young as fourteen or fifteen they are lured from their homes by promises of jobs overseas as nannies and models maids and waitresses sometimes they are smuggled out and sold straightaway sometimes they are taken to breaking houses in belgrade there they are forced to live in filthy conditions they are humiliated beaten starved denied even the most basic human decencies raped repeatedly drugged made to be compliant when their spirits are broken they are taken to the markets and sold to the highest bidder after that even if they are smuggled to rome tel aviv paris or london they are forced to live in terrible conditions and service ten twenty even thirty men a night if they dont play the game and pretend they are enjoying what is done to them they are beaten and threatened they are told that if they try to escape they will be hunted down and killed along with their families back home ive heard something of this said banks shaken by the images ganz was offering up but not the extent he shook his head most people do not know ganz said many prefer not to know people like to think that girls who end up as prostitutes deserve no less that they chose what they do but many didnt you can buy a young girl for as little as a thousand pounds and make over a hundred thousand pounds a year from her once she is worn out you buy a new one it makes good business sense does it not i cant believe my brother was involved in this he wasnt as far as i know said ganz from what superintendent burgess has told me it is my guess that your brother and his girlfriend found out what was going on through the bergerlennox centre and through dr lukas yes whats her part in all this she is trying to help the girls who get pregnant that is all she asks no questions they are lucky they have someone like her otherwise but whats her connection that we do not know for sure this investigation here is very new most of the work we have been doing has been in bosnia romania and serbia was carmen one of the girls she was trying to help carmen petri ganz frowned im sorry i do not know the name are you certain yes petri you say something like that it sounds romanian but you havent heard of her no okay said banks go on anyway ganz continued no matter what dr lukas does or does not know theres a pimp involved somewhere and lambert and broda supply him with girls smuggled from eastern europe he probably keeps them in more than one house depending on how many girls he owns perhaps there is even more than one pimp i do not know we have been waiting for broda or lambert to lead us there but they havent not yet we were worried they might be on to us lamberts moving between the flat and the travel office and he spends most weekends playing the local squire in his country manor wheres that banks asked a village called quainton near buckingham thats where he leads his exemplary life anyway where there are pimps and smugglers you will usually find organized crime too and that is always dangerous the russian mafia most likely banks told him what he had heard from annie about the two men suspected of killing jennifer and perhaps roy ganz nodded slowly sounds like their style so what next we think these recent murders might bring things to a boil someone might make a mistake are you here to warn me off ganz laughed warn you off superintendent burgess told me you would probably say something like that oh what else did he tell you that it would do no good some people we can warn off easily but not you he said youre nobodys man hes right ganz waved his hand in a dismissive gesture no i dont want to warn you off i want to use you in a way i cant use the police who are investigating the case i want you to keep on doing right what youre doing i just want you to know that youre involved in stirring up a wasps nest go on im not saying that youre not in danger they may have killed you if you had been at the address your brother gave his girlfriend but i think with all the trouble caused by the two murders they have already committed they would think twice right now about killing a policeman when you came down here they no doubt kept an eye on you just for forms sake but they had other things to occupy them and they knew your brother hadnt had time to tell you anything or you wouldnt have been floundering around in the dark the way you were they also tortured him before they killed him and he told them you knew nothing he also told them where you lived and they rang the men in the car fortunately your brother gave them the wrong address they sent the digital image on the mobile too perhaps they didnt know you had it but they knew your brother didnt thats just their style a sick joke max broda himself most likely if you hadnt got it whoever had the phone at the time would have even the police it didnt matter to them it couldnt be traced it was stolen and they threw it away as soon as they had used it after that they let you know that they know where your parents live that is also very much their style and dont worry your parents are safe it wasnt something we could leave for the locals to deal with alone you have men there too one armed anyway now that you have actually been to see gareth lambert and probably got him worried things might be a bit different im not sure you know ive seen lambert superintendent burgess said hed told you where to find him i didnt think you would just sit around and not act on that information what did you think i didnt believe him didnt trust him in that you were right from now on well try to watch your back as best we can but for obvious reasons i can hardly show my hand it is a shame you english police are unarmed im not too sure about that said banks thinking that there werent many times in his career when he had felt the need for a gun though now might be one of them and by the way do you have a license for that one youre carrying ganz laughed i have your governments permission if thats what you mean do you want one im sure i can get one for you id probably shoot myself in the foot said banks but thanks for the offer i almost forgot ganz said mr burgess told me to tell you he checked the number and the red vectra was stolen from a multistory car park in putney does that mean anything to you yes thank you said banks it meant the car that had followed him from his parentss house was stolen as he had expected what are you going to do now banks looked at his watch im going to have another glass of wine and think over what youve said later when it was open banks planned to visit the albion club on the strand and see if he could find out more about roys final hours but he didnt see any reason for telling dieter ganz that if interpol were keeping an eye on him theyd find out soon enough anyway susan browne arrived in eastvale from derby at four oclock just after annie had left for the station bearing the positive fruits of the very discreet dna comparison and more she told templeton on their way to roger cropleys house that di gifford had made inquiries at cropleys software firm in london and found that he regularly left late on fridays and that he had left late on friday the twentythird of april as there had been an office party that evening to celebrate a lucrative new contract cropley was clearly not thrilled to see the two detectives on his doorstop late that afternoon he tried to shut the door but templeton got a foot in its better if you let us in he said otherwise ill stay here while ds browne goes for a search warrant cropley relaxed the pressure on the door and they entered following him into the living room i dont know why you wont leave me alone he said ive told you time after time i know nothing about any murders you mean youve lied time after time said templeton by the way this is ds browne shes come all the way from derby just to talk to you say hello cropley said nothing just stared at susan browne she sat down and smoothed her skirt mr cropley she said ill come right to the point when dc templeton here first came to me with his suspicions i was skeptical now ive had time to think about things and make a few inquiries im not too certain what inquiries susan slipped a folder out of her briefcase and opened it according to my information you left your office in holborn at about eight oclock on friday the twentythird of april this year how do you know that is it true i dont remember how can you expect me to remember that far back its true according to our evidence that would put you at trowell services around the same time as claire potter look this is absurd its nothing but circumstantial on two other occasions you left late susan went on reading two other women were either followed or assaulted shortly after leaving the m i havent assaulted anyone what were going to do mr cropley susan went on is take you down to the police station for further questioning there you will be fingerprinted and photographed and a sample of your dna will be taken once we have the door opened and mrs copley walked in whats going on roger she demanded theyre harassing me again copley said his wife looked at susan and templeton then back at her husband an expression of scorn on her face maybe you deserve it she said do you know something mrs cropley templeton asked thats between me and my husband mrs cropley said a woman has been murdered susan said raped and stabbed mrs cropley folded her arms susan and templeton looked at each other and susan turned back to cropley who had gone ashen once we have the photographs well be showing them to every worker in every café and petrol station on the motorway once we have your dna well compare it with traces found at the scene of claire potters murder you might have thought you were thorough mr cropley but theres always something in your case its dandruff dandruff yes didnt you know we can get dna from dandruff if you even left one flake at the scene well have it in the evidence room and well be testing it cropley looked stunned anything to say susan went on cropley just shook his head right susan stood up roger cropley youre under arrest for suspicion of the murder of claire potter you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything you do say may be given in evidence as cropley walked out head hung between browne and templeton his wife turned her back and stood in the center of the room rigid as a statue arms still folded annie was half an hour late as she made her way through the crowded pavements of covent garden to the restaurant dr lukas had mentioned on tavistock street she had just missed the and as the was a slow train she had to catch the which arrived on time at on the train she rang dr lukas at the center but was told the doctor wasnt there that day she left a message which she couldnt be sure dr lukas had received and then she had phoned the restaurant to leave a message there too she also rang her usual hotel to book a room for the night the desk clerk recognized her name and voice and got so chatty it was embarrassing well annie thought as she dashed into the crowded restaurant dr lukas had said she would be waiting and there were worse places to wait she spotted the doctor at a corner table and made her way over it was small restaurant with intimate lighting and white linen tablecloths a blackboard on the wall listed specials and wine suggestions there was music playing but it was so faint annie couldnt make out what it was it sounded french though did you get my message she asked sitting down and catching her breath dr lukas nodded its all right she said tapping the paperback she was reading i have my book i was prepared to wait they know me here they are very understanding annie browsed the menu which was decidedly traditional and decided on ratatouille dr lukas had already settled on bouillabaisse once theyd got their orders in the doctor poured annie a glass of chablis and topped up her own im sorry i made you come all this way she said but i couldnt possibly tell you over the telephone its all right said annie i had to come back anyway youre going to tell me everything everything i know why not tell me before because the situation has changed and things have gone too far the waiter appeared with a basket of bread and annie broke off a chunk and buttered it she hadnt eaten on the train and realized she was starving im listening its very difficult for me dr lukas began its not something im proud of helping the girls not that so much if i hadnt done it who would is it about carmen petri only partly to understand what i have to say you have to know where i come from lviv is a very old city a very beautiful city in many ways with many fine ancient buildings and churches my mother was a seamstress until arthritis made her fingers of no more use my father was a mining engineer my parents remember when jews were rounded up and killed by the germans in the war you hear about the massacre at babi yar near kiev but there were many smaller massacres elsewhere including lviv my parents were lucky they were children then and they hid and were not found when i lived there ukraine was still part of the soviet union i grew up in a modern part of the city ugly stalinist blocks we were poor and illfed but there was a strong sense of community and sometimes you could even believe in the ideals behind the reality of the revolution when ukraine became an independent state in august things were chaotic for a while nobody knew what was going to happen that was when i left annie listened interested in dr lukass story but curious as to where it was leading before long their food was served and dr lukas poured more wine as if reading annies mind she smiled and said you might be wondering where all this is going but please indulge me she talked more about her childhood the state school unsanitary living conditions her ambition to become a doctor and here i am she said ambition fulfilled you must be very proud dr lukas frowned proud yes most days then about a year ago a man came to see me at my home i remembered him from school from the building in lviv where his family lived close to mine he said he had heard i was a successful doctor here through his parents who had read an article about me in the local newspaper its true many people left ukraine but their stories continue to be of interest to those who have not experienced the world outside what did he want when he was at school he was a bully when he got older he and his gang terrorized the building we lived in extorting money burgling apartments selling blackmarket goods nobody was safe from him then suddenly he was gone you can imagine how relieved we all were but he turned up here in london yes he told me he traveled all around europe learning the ways of the free world the free economy and his training in lviv served him well hes the man who sends the late girls to you isnt he dr lukas said nothing for a moment she had turned pale as she was talking annie noticed and her bouillabaisse sat mostly uneaten in front of her finally she whispered yes thats what he is now a pimp when he first came to see me it was because one of his girls had problems with her periods that made her unreliable then he realized what a good idea it would be for me to be their unofficial doctor so to speak and that was the start of it all and this has been going on for a year yes and how many girls have you seen during that time maybe fifteen sixteen all pregnant most some had sexually transmitted infections one had a bad rash in her pubic area one girl was bleeding from her anus whatever it was he brought them to me at the center after it was closed for the day i would get a phone call telling me to stay late why did you help him annie thought she knew the answer to the question as she was asking it but she needed to hear it from dr lukas a noisy party across the room broke into gales of laughter dr lukas looked over at them then she turned to face annie her expression somber he told me he would kill my parents back in lviv if i didnt do as he said or if i told anyone i know he can do it he still has contacts there whats changed my parents are no longer in lviv they have left for america to live with my brother in san francisco i was waiting to hear the confirmation that they have arrived they telephoned me today what about you i dont care about me said dr lukas besides hes not going to hurt me im far too useful to him alive if its any consolation annie said hell be in jail dr lukas laughed yes she said running his empire from a cell and on the outside someone will replace him another monster the world has no shortage of monsters she shook her head but its gone far enough poor jennifer that man roy banks was his name what about carmen petri dr lukas gave annie a curious look that was the beginning of the end really carmen what do you mean until carmen i could turn a blind eye could even believe that what i was doing was good and that the girls had better lives as prostitutes here than they would in their wartorn villages and towns back home i didnt know the truth like everyone i thought they chose to do what they did that there must be something wrong with them to start with something bad about them i was naive how did carmen change this the girls wouldnt talk i asked them about their lives but they refused to tell me anything they were too scared carmen she was a bit more confident more intelligent i dont know perhaps it was even jennifer the way she was kind to her whatever the reason carmen did let something slip what was that she told me that one of the new girls had been locked in a small room and beaten because she refused to perform some vile sex act she also told me that the girl had been on her way home from school in a small village in bosnia when two men abducted her by knifepoint and forced her into prostitution she was fifteen that was the first time i realized that these girls didnt start out one step from prostitution in the first place that there was nothing bad about them they were normal girls like you and me and they were forced to do what they do like me they fear for their families back home those who have families these poor girls he has them smuggled from bosnia moldavia romania and kosovo many are orphans because of the wars when they have to leave the orphanages at sixteen they often have no money and nowhere to go his men are waiting for them on the doorstep the girls are terrified of him they wont talk about what happens but ive seen bruises cuts sometimes i didnt ask questions and i am not proud of that but i saw then carmen she spoke out when was this a week ago last monday what happened to her nothing as far as i know shes not dead i dont think so i cant see why she would be but if they thought she told you and jennifer what was really going on i dont think they knew what she told us and shes too valuable to them but they must have found out something annie said jennifer and roy banks are dead when jennifer told roy he must have started digging asking questions he had contact with people who well lets just say he knew criminals perhaps i am wrong then i dont know all i know about carmen is what she told me she got pregnant so he sent her to me i suppose the only unusual thing is that carmen has decided to have the baby shes a devout catholic and she refused to have a termination thats permitted in some circumstances said dr lukas it would depend on the loss of income carmen is one of the special girls blessed with good looks and a fine figure she is also a very intelligent girl and she speaks english very well she was never a street prostitute more what you would term a call girl so how is he going to make for his loss of income i can only guess said dr lukas there are some men who like to have sex with pregnant women and are willing to pay extra for it that way she would have fewer customers but make as much or more money annies stomach turned she could understand why dr lukas wasnt eating shed lost her appetite as well and the baby adoption she spoke about the way they were taking care of her and feeding her well for a mr garrett who i assume is paying good money for carmens baby will you tell me the pimps name his real name is hadeon mazuryk he calls himself harry his nickname is happy harry because he looks eternally sad he is not of course its just a freak of physiognomy do you know where he keeps the girls dr lukas nodded theres a house near kings cross i went there once an emergency you must be careful though why he has a gun ive seen it banks had raided roys wardrobe again for suitable attire he didnt think he would get far in the albion club wearing jeans and a casual shirt trousers were a problem roys didnt fit him and he had brought only one pair of trousers which didnt match any of roys jackets in the end he just had to hope the place was poorly lit so that black and navy blue didnt look too bad together the man on the door looking rather like a cross between a butler and a bouncer asked him for his membership banks flashed his warrant card police i hope theres no trouble sir he said none at all said banks just a few questions and ill be out of your hair questions yes were you on duty here last friday yes sir do you remember roy banks arriving with gareth lambert such a tragedy about mr banks the perfect gentleman who could do such a thing who indeed but did you see them arrive yes it would have been about ten oclock and were you here when they left they didnt leave together mr banks left first at about twelvethirty and mr lambert stayed much later perhaps three oclock something like that so lambert was telling the truth about that much at least did they leave alone yes sir do you know where mr banks went after he left mr banks didnt say he just bade me good night as usual you didnt call a minicab for him there are always plenty of taxis on the strand and theres a taxi rank at charing cross right said banks okay to go inside please try not to upset the members i only want to talk to the staff very well banks was surprised when he got inside the club the door opened into a spacious lowceilinged bar and where he had been expecting dark wainscoting chandeliers and waiters in burgundy bumfreezers he found tubular fittings halogen lighting and waitresses in pinstripe suits with trousers rather than skirts fanshaped splashes of color from wellhidden lights decorated the walls in shades of blue pink green red and orange the chrome tables were high with matching leathertopped stools this definitely wasnt one of those old gentlemens clubs where the right sort of people stay over when they are down in the city for the weekend it was primarily an upmarket casino with bar and restaurant facilities the sort of place where you might have found james bond fifty years ago now it played host to a hip young crowd of stockbrokers investment bankers and the occasional old smuggler like gareth lambert as it turned out the dress code was also a lot more relaxed than banks had expected he had never been to a club before and he still thought in terms of lord peter wimsey and bertie wooster and he was surprised to see that not everyone was wearing a tie or a suit business casual was in the place wasnt very busy but a few people sat around drinking and chatting and a group of japanese businessmen had the one large table by the far wall where they were entertaining some expensivelooking women most of the people in the place seemed to be in their thirties which made roy and lambert slightly older than the average member nobody paid banks any undue attention there was no music banks took one of the stools at the bar and ordered a bottle of stella the price was every bit as outrageous as he had expected the bartender was a woman in her late twenties by the look of her about the same age as corinne and jennifer she had very fine short hair dyed pink and blond she smiled at banks when she took his order she had a nice smile dimples too banks showed her his card do you work here every night he asked most nights she said scrutinizing the card more closely than the doorman had yorkshire what brings you down here cases can take you all over the place banks said people move around a lot more than they used to you can say that again actually im making a few inquiries about roy banks i understand he was a member poor mr banks she said he was a real sweetheart you knew him not really knew i mean not outside of work but we talked here occasionally you tend to do that in this job he always had time for the bar staff not like some of our more stuckup members did he sit at the bar and tell you his troubles she laughed oh no that only happens in films whats your name by the way maria pleased to meet you maria what relation are you what do you mean your names banks too i saw it on that card are you his brother yes banks said you must be gutted i am but im also trying to find out what happened did you talk to him last friday yes he and mr lambert were sitting at that table just over there she pointed to a discreet corner table mr banks always made a point of coming over and saying hello and asking me how i was doing and he always made sure he left a decent tip did he have anything to say that night a waitress appeared asking for drinks maria excused herself for a moment and filled the order with graceful efficiency what was it you wanted to know she asked when she came back just if roy had said anything out of the ordinary to you no nothing not that that i remember did he seem upset or annoyed not at first a bit preoccupied maybe later after hed been talking to mr lambert for a while he seemed to be getting uncomfortable if you know what i mean i dont know how to describe it but you could sort of feel the tension even from over here others noticed i wouldnt say that ive always been very sensitive to the vibes people give off and these were bad yes i think so were they arguing no they never raised their voices or anything like that it was just a sort of tense negotiation lambert had told banks that roy had been pressing him for contacts in the arms business but banks didnt believe that what happened next after he used the telephone mr banks went through to the casino and i didnt see him again mr lambert he sat by himself for a while then he went into the casino too you say roy used the telephone yes where is it theres a public telephone in the corridor by the toilets she said down there she pointed directly across the room banks turned and saw the phone on the wall from where lambert had been sitting he couldnt possibly have seen roy make the call not a lot of people use it because everyones got a mobile these days havent they but he must have forgotten his or the battery was dead or something banks thought of the mobile sitting on roys kitchen table was it a long phone call no just two or three minutes how long had he been here when he made it not long maybe half an hour or so a bit longer that must have been the call he made to jennifer banks thought sending her up to yorkshire and how did he seem after that like i said he went into the casino he didnt say goodbye though and thats not like him did mr lambert make any phone calls not that i saw could he have done oh yes i mean he went to the toilet he could have used his mobile there if he had one with him but i didnt see him make any calls thats all i meant thanks very much maria said banks youve been a great help i have banks made sure to leave her a decent tip and wandered out onto the strand he glanced about him to see if there was anyone watching for him but if there was he didnt notice according to the doorman and maria roy had left the club around half past twelve there were plenty of taxis passing by banks could see so what had roy done got in a taxi or had someone offered him a lift it couldnt have been lambert because he was still in the casino so who chapter seventeen the sun was up by the time the operation had been approved by the brass in so the metropolitan force firearms unit at scotland yard and the team had been assembled and briefed annie and brooke gathered with the specialist firearms officers outside the house near kings cross in the narrow streets around wharfdale road the house was part of a terrace and the so team leader had acquired a set of plans young girls had been seen by neighbors coming and going sometimes with men at all hours there were eight officers in the team all wearing protective headgear and body armor and carrying glock handguns and heckler and koch mp carbines each man had been briefed on what section of the house he was to secure three more men watched the back of the house it was an eerie sight annie thought and there was something slightly unreal about it one or two onlookers had gathered at the street corners held back by the uniformed officers stationed there it was a humid morning and a light mist hung in the air there was little traffic in the immediate area but annie could hear horns and engines in the distance another day in the big city was beginning in a way annie wished that banks had been granted permission to attend she would have liked him by her side but these operations were strictly regulated and there was no way they were letting roy bankss brother be a part of it she had talked to him on the phone late the previous evening and he had told her about his visit to the albion club in exchange annie had told him what dr lukas had told her about the late girls and carmen petri on the prearranged signal the so team battered down the front door and stormed into the house annie and brooke unarmed had instructions to wait outside until the place was secured then they would be allowed in to question any witnesses or suspects brooke was unusually quiet annie felt herself tense up as she heard sounds from inside the house shouts commands a womans scream something thudding on the floor but there were no shots and she took that as a good sign she had no idea how long it took but eventually the team leader emerged and told them the house was secured there had been one guard armed with a baseball bat and three other men none of them armed the rest of the occupants were young women they had best take a look for themselves he told them shaking his head in disbelief annie and brooke went inside it was a shabby place in poor repair with old wallpaper stained and peeling off in places no stair carpet and only dirty linoleum on the ground floor the smells of stale sex and cigarette smoke permeated the air little light got in through the windows so the officers had turned on all the lights they could find mostly bare bulbs and they hardly flattered the scene just gave it an extra harsh edge the seven girls were all in a small room upstairs probably more lived there annie guessed but they would be out working the streets around kings cross no matter what the time of day business never stopped the area had had a bad reputation for years and annie remembered how the girls were once called maggies children because they came down on the trains from the north when all the jobs disappeared up there these days they might be known as putins children iliescus or terzics the so officers searched the place as annie and brooke went over to the girls the sparsely furnished room smelled of sweat and cheap perfume and the girls were all dressed in skimpy clothing tight hot pants micro skirts thighhighs seethrough tops and their faces were garish with lipstick and eye makeup some of them looked high none looked much older than fifteen beyond the fear in their expressions annie could see only resignation and despair this was truly the generation of lost girls dr lukas had described she thought christ she wanted to take them home and scrub the makeup off and feed them a decent meal most of them were skinny and some had sores on their lips several of them were smoking and that added to the cloying atmosphere of the room other rooms in the house were equipped with beds and washbasins but this seemed to be a general sitting room the four men the so team had found had all been handcuffed and bundled out into the van the girls had been checked for weapons as a matter of routine then left alone a guard on the door maam one of the team stood at the door and beckoned to annie i think you should see this he led annie to a room no bigger than a cupboard inside was a young girl naked but for the thin sheet another officer was wrapping around her she was painfully thin and blood crusted the cleft between her nose and upper lip she was alive but her eyes looked dead the only other thing in the room was a bucket its stench abominable get an ambulance annie said she helped the girl to her feet keeping the sheet wrapped around her and slowly took her back to the others one of the girls ran forward and took the newcomer in her arms mumbling endearments and helped her sit in an armchair perching on the arm beside her can you speak english annie asked the girl nodded a little what happened to her shes new the girl told her in heavily accented english still stroking her friends hair she would not do what they tell her so they lock her up and beat her she has not eaten for three days brooke was trying to talk to the other girls but it didnt appear they spoke english whatever the reason they all seemed afraid of him and no one would say a word most of them wouldnt even look at him annie thought she understood why she took him aside look dave she said seeing his crestfallen expression its not your fault but they dont know youre a decent man they dont know any decent blokes it might be best if you went down and questioned the men pale brooke nodded youll be okay ill manage said annie she touched him gently on the shoulder and he left what will happen to us asked the girl on the chair arm who seemed to have taken charge she had dark hair down to her shoulders thin arms and a pale complexion it was a good question and annie wasnt sure she knew the answer the object of the raid had been to take happy harry mazuryk and with any luck find carmen petri annie didnt know if harry had been one of the four men arrested though from what she had seen in passing none of them matched his description youll all be taken good care of she said whats your name veronika right veronika id like to ask you a few questions i cant tell you anything he will kill me no he wont said annie well put him in jail you dont understand he wasnt here only his stupid guard those other men are here for she made an obscene gesture with her hips where is hadeon mazuryk she flinched at the sound of his name i dont know okay said annie what about carmen do you know carmen petri she looked around at the frightened girls is she here they all shook their heads one started crying annie turned back to veronika do you know carmen veronika nodded where is she she is not here carmen is one of the special girls what do you mean she is very beautiful she speaks very good english she does not have to go out to the street men come to her pay more this was what annie had heard from dr lukas still she wondered whether carmen had been killed do you know where she is veronika i really need to talk to her veronika turned to the girl in the sheet and stroked her hair again then she looked back at annie her face stern there is another house she said i have talked to carmen she has told me she is there banks didnt regret too much being barred from the kings cross raid he had been on such operations before and generally found the paramilitary elements quite tedious he did however want to know the results which was why he was sitting anxiously at the kitchen table early with his morning coffee and newspaper mobile beside him at the ready he was still puzzling over what had happened between roy and lambert at the albion club that friday and the best he could come up with was that lambert had proposed something roy didnt approve of and became worried hed give the game away their friendship went back to university days and they had got up to all sorts of things together they had been out of touch for a long time though and lambert probably didnt know that roy had redrawn his moral lines if lambert wanted roy to come in on importing abducted teenage girls for the sex trade as annie suggested was happening then roy would probably have balked at that banks thought if he had been ignorant of the true way in which the girls were forced into prostitution as dr lukas had told annie she was then he would have found out via jennifer who had talked with carmen petri and learned something of the truth on the monday of the week she died the timing was important here roy might have been on the verge of getting involved when he found out the truth after carmen told jennifer and lambert spent the next few days trying to convince him it was okay then something else must have tipped the balance something roy found out on the day he disappeared banks guessed that when roy left the bar for the casino lambert went into the toilet and phoned someone maybe max broda and told him the situation was critical after that broda took control and had a car ready to pick roy up outside the club and take him to the abandoned factory in battersea ponytail and his crony must also have been working for broda and they had been assigned to watch jennifer and keep an eye on her movements banks could imagine the mobile conversations back and forth between the mondeo following jennifer and the factory where roy had been taken culminating in the order to kill her perhaps roy had also intended to head up to bankss cottage when he realized things had gone too far but he hadnt had the chance theyd got to him first as banks thought about it all a number of things came together in his mind the way it sometimes happened when he felt most lost annie had told him that dr lukas had said the baby was going to be adopted by a mr garrett he remembered dieter ganz saying gareth with his slight accent yesterday and imagined that the men carmen petri had heard saying it also had accents as she no doubt did herself in ganzs case it had come out sounding like garrett and that was exactly what dr lukas had said that the men were taking good care of carmen and her baby for mr garrett was that it then the new thing that roy had discovered was lambert himself adopting carmens baby buying it and was that why it was so important for him to stop roy from blowing the whistle there was one way to find out one person he could ask banks went up to roys office where he thought he had seen an atlas he pulled it down and found that quainton was in buckinghamshire not too far from aylesbury it was a nice day for a drive in the country he thought and it would be interesting to meet the elusive mrs lambert he grabbed his jacket and his mobile and set off for the car the second house was about a mile away in islington but lightyears away in comfort it was a detached house with a small garden the curtains all shut tight against the morning light if the so team leader hadnt verified that it belonged to mr hadeon mazuryk annie would have thought it the home of a perfectly normal family with a couple of kids a dog and a people carrier the team had had to move fast before mazuryk found out about the kings cross raid and the so team had reassembled in the van for a quick briefing the layout of the house was similar to many others in the area including the house one of the men lived in and between them the officers were able to sketch out a likely floor plan then they quietly evacuated the houses on either side and sealed off the street at both ends annie sat across the street in the car with di brooke who had got nowhere talking to the men at kings cross and watched she could hear faint music from one of the downstairs rooms a bass line of some pop song she didnt recognize then she heard a man cough and someone laugh youre very quiet dave she said turning to brooke who was staring down the street i was warned off he said without looking at her what i was warned off annie now he looked her in eye and she could see his selfdisgust orders from the top gareth lamberts part of an international investigation if the police swarmed over him all the major players would disappear into the woodwork for years thats what i was told if i valued my promotion well i think you can fill in the rest oliver drummond and william gilmore seemed likely leads im sorry dave annie said feeling embarrassed for him you were only following orders he gave her an ironic glance isnt that what the germans said this is different what else could you do brooke shrugged i dont know i just dont like the feeling thats all i doubt theyd warn off your pal banks so easily annie smiled dci banks is a law unto himself she said partly because he doesnt feel he has anything to lose its not necessarily a position to envy she gestured to the so officers in the street anyway for better or for worse were getting some action now brooke nodded its gone too far even the brass couldnt justify leaving vulnerable underage girls in captivity like that for one night longer than they had to besides we still dont know if or how lambert is connected maybe its something completely different whatever it is well find out soon said annie theyre going in half the men went around the back and the rest prepared to enter through the front door annie held her breath as one of them slammed the battering ram and the wood splintered then they were in she heard similar sounds from the back this time in addition to the shouting and screaming annie heard shots so did the neighbors farther down the street who soon appeared at windows and in doorways only to be kept at bay by the uniformed officers deployed on crowd duties after an agonizing period of silence the team leader stepped out and waved annie and brooke inside everybody all right annie asked we are he said eddie took one on the chest but the body armor worked fine hes feeling a bit sore thats all look were waiting for the ambulance and for the brass to get here you know what its like whenever shots are fired forms in triplicate questions you feel more like a criminal than a copper annie and brooke followed the grumbling team leader into the front room four men had been sitting around playing cards at a folding table two of them were handcuffed and two of them were slumped against the wall with holes in their chests covered in dark bibs of blood blood had also sprayed on the walls and carpeting annie felt a bit sick she hadnt seen many gunshot victims before and hadnt been prepared for the smell of the exploded ammunition mingled with that of fresh blood in the room one of the dead men resembled the description she had heard of hadeon happy harry mazuryk and the other one had a bodybuilders physique long greasy hair tied back in a ponytail and a thick gold chain around his neck one of the bullets must have severed the chain because it snaked in one long piece down his bloody chest annie didnt recognize the other two men both were looking sullen handcuffed and guarded by so officers with their heckler and kochs at the ready one of the men might have been the driver of the mondeo but all the descriptions she had of him were vague the more she looked at the other one the more he seemed familiar the spiky hair goatee beard then she remembered the photograph banks had shown her the one his brother apparently took just days before he died this was the man who had been sitting with gareth lambert at an outdoor café now there was a connection whatever it meant an ambulance arrived and men filled the room annie and brooke followed one of the officers upstairs there were three bedrooms all of them occupied by beautiful young girls who were more than a little unnerved by the shooting so officers dealt with the other two and brooke hung back as annie entered the room and walked over to the pregnant girl who was lying on the bed looking frightened carmen she said carmen petri the girl nodded seeming surprised that annie knew her name she looked a little older than the girls in the kings cross house perhaps as old as nineteen or twenty and she wore much less makeup it was difficult to tell what her figure had been like because she was about six months pregnant but she had a beautiful face full lips with a bardot pout a perfectly proportioned nose flawless complexion apart from a beauty spot by the side of her mouth and deep dark blue eyes damp with tears annie couldnt read her expression and guessed that carmen was a girl who had become adept at hiding her feelings and thoughts for the purposes of selfpreservation what happened carmen asked ill explain it all later annie said im happy to meet you at last im annie cabot will you answer some questions wheres hadeon dead good and artyom whos he big man ponytail hes dead too that is also good she said shifting on the bed slightly annie could see an expression of discomfort cross her features as she moved probably the baby kicking what happened to you annie asked how did you get here is a long story she said and a long time ago i was taken from street when i was a young girl how young sixteen by who she shrugged a man where a village near craiova in romania you will not have heard of it you went to see dr lukas at the bergerlennox centre yes she was good to me carmen reached for a cigarette she wanted me to stop smoking but i tell her a girl must have one vice i dont drink and i dont take drugs her english was remarkably good annie thought and she could see what veronika meant about her being beautiful there was a sophistication about her beyond her years and carmen had the kind of class you dont usually associate with people in her profession annie wondered how on earth she could stand the life without some form of escape but what did she know and what could she presume to know about someone who had been through what carmen had been through do you remember jennifer clewes yes she works with dr lukas shes dead too carmen someone killed her carmen looked alarmed why we dont know we think it might have to do with something you told her jennifer and her boyfriend seemed to know something about what was going on here did you say anything to her when you were talking last week carmen looked down at her swollen belly the doctor think we do this because we want to she said i tell her she does not know how bad things are that none of us are here because we want i tell jennifer too some stories of what happen to girls i should not have said that but i think i was feeling brave because they were treating me well different from the others when did you tell her this last time i go to clinic not long monday i think did artyom know youd been talking he took me back in the car and told hadeon they could not hurt me to make me tell them anything i knew that but i think i know said annie they threatened to harm your parents back home didnt they yes carmen whispered so you told them yes annie nodded that house in kings cross she said weve just come from there those girls were treated terribly ive never seen anything like it i have been there hadeon always tells me i have been very lucky for me men pay hundreds of pounds a night for those girls they must have many men to make such money hadeon makes his girls work very hard he tells me if i am not good he will send me there too i am happy he is dead do you think he would have people killed who found out what he was doing carmen nodded harry once killed a girl with his bare hands for refusing to have sex with him did artyom work for him yes and boris with the cropped blond hair that is boris the driver annie thought there was another man downstairs annie described him do you know who he is all i know is that his name is max and that he brings new girls for harry he is not always here i have never talked to him annie imagined that when mazuryk knew carmen had talked he or max had brought lambert in to handle damage control and that was what had been going on all week mazuryk had also sent artyom and the driver to keep an eye on jennifer watch where she went perhaps lambert had talked to roy and managed to assure mazuryk that no one would be ringing the police but negotiations were tense then something else happened something that changed it all do you know a man called lambert annie asked lambert no said carmen annie gestured toward her stomach whats going to happen to you im going to have my baby it makes them take good care of me i get food and they leave me alone i get bored sometimes the only times i can go out is to see dr lukas and then artyom usually takes me but it is much better than before do you know who the father is carmen gave her a scornful look and what about the baby dr lukas told me it was going to be adopted yes they want to sell the baby to a rich man she will go to a good family and have a good life that is why they treat me well to keep the baby healthy harry always jokes when he sees me how he must keep me healthy for mr garrett a sudden anxiety came into her voice but harry is dead what is going to happen me now i dont know said annie i really dont know banks remembered something on his way out and opened the door to roys garage the porsche still stood there gleaming and immaculate he opened the drivers door and sat down reaching into the side pocket for the aa road atlas it was still open to the same page as it had been before and this time banks spotted quainton on the top right well he thought it was hardly conclusive but a bit of a coincidence nonetheless perhaps quainton had been roys port of call before he got home rang banks and went off to the albion club with lambert what had he found out there that had disturbed him so banks took the aa atlas locked up the car garage and house behind him and headed for the m and quainton as far as he could gather after a number of diversionary maneuvers there was no one on his tail he had his mobile on the seat beside him and just beyond berkhamsted annie rang and told him about the raids the deaths of hadeon mazuryk and artyom and about her interview with carmen petri it put a few things in perspective and persuaded banks that he was certainly heading in the right direction an hour and a half after leaving london he was there quainton stood at the bottom of a hill a straggling sort of place scattered around a village green banks parked there near the george and dragon he paused a moment and glanced at the brick windmill at the top of the hill then went into the pub he hadnt got an address from dieter ganz just the village name but he guessed the place was small enough that they would probably know lambert and his spanish wife at the local pub it looked like a good place to eat blackboards offered steak and stilton pie french country chicken and thai red curry maybe hed come back after talking to lambert and his wife the barman knew the lamberts and told him they lived in a big house on the denham road and he couldnt miss it banks thanked him and set off he found the house easily enough on the outskirts of the village it looked the sort of place that had had a few additions over the years gables an extra wing a garage so it was hard to tell in what period the original building had been erected banks pulled into the gravel drive parked out front and went to ring the doorbell in no time at all a young woman answered smiled at him and asked what he wanted banks didnt want to alarm her so he showed her his warrant card but told her that he was roy bankss brother the woman made a sympathetic face poor mr banks she said please come in gareth is still in london at the moment but you are welcome to a cup of tea i know you english love your tea i am mercedes lambert she held out her hand and banks shook it lightly her accent matched her sultry mediterranean looks and banks could indeed believe that she had been a spanish actress and pinup girl she still had a fine figure shown to advantage in the shorts and sleeveless green top she was wearing her olive skin stretched taut over an exquisite bone structure and her long chestnut hair fell in waves over her shoulders when they got inside she led banks to a large living room big enough to hold a grand piano along with a damask threepiece suite every inch the english country lady she called the maid and asked her to bring tea banks should have known she wouldnt be taking care of a place as big as this by herself he wondered if she was bored being stuck out in the country and whether she often stayed at the chelsea flat with her husband she looked a good few years younger than lambert but not as young as corinne or jennifer banks pegged her at midtolate thirties i understand you were an actress in spain he said sitting in a chair with carved wooden arms she blushed not very good i was in what do you call them films where monsters come after me and i scream a lot horror films yes horror films she shrugged i do not miss it ill bet you dont thought banks glancing around the room french windows opened on a patio beyond the piano and banks could see sunlight shimmering on the blue surface of a swimming pool like a hockney painting did you know roy well he asked no she said i met him only once last week when he came here but gareth told me what happened it is terrible she pronounced the name garrett too when did you meet him banks asked i think it was last friday she smiled but sometimes the days all seem the same here what did he want at that moment the maid came in with the tea and set the tray down on the table between banks and mercedes lambert after she had added milk and poured she left as soundlessly as she had entered banks didnt usually take milk but it didnt bother him mercedes frowned i dont really know why he came she said he wanted to talk to me about a girl called carmen and her baby but i said i didnt know her carmen sounds very spanish i know but you also find it in other countries what did he say next he told me this carmen was pregnant and he understood that she was selling her baby to me for adoption mercedes frowned he said gareth told him this was so are you adopting carmens baby mrs lambert no of course not thats what your brother asked me i didnt understand why he would think such a thing are you sure yes as i told your brother then a very strange thing happened what little nina cried and i showed her to him and told him all about her and mr banks said he was sorry hed made a mistake and he left very quickly im sorry said banks i dont understand whos little nina and then he heard it himself a baby crying upstairs mercedes lambert smiled a few moments later a nanny brought the baby down it couldnt have been more than three months old and mercedes held the tiny bundle tears in her eyes she is sick she explained to banks this is what i told your brother there is a problem with her heart it is what do you say con con congenital yes congenital and if she does not get a new one very soon she will die then her expression brightened but gareth says we are high on the list he has arranged with a clinic in switzerland the best in the world he says to be ready at a moments notice so maybe my nina will be lucky yes are you sure you have no intention of adopting another baby banks asked feeling his blood start to turn cold mercedes smiled no of course not nina will have her new heart and she will become strong i know it do you think so banks looked at mercedes lambert saw the desperate hope in her face and he looked at the pale face buried in the blankets yes he said yes maybe she will the train ride did annie good and when she got back to eastvale around lunchtime she didnt feel quite so depressed as she had after the raids before leaving for the station she had tried to console brooke over what he perceived to be a lack of backbone in giving in to orders from above but in the long run she knew it was something he would have to live with and get over by himself for reasons of their own the powers that be maybe through burgess had hampered the official police investigation and encouraged banks to go stirring things up by himself no doubt in the hope of luring more players out into the open rather than causing them to disappear and no one had given a damn whether banks got killed in the process when annie got to the station gristhorpe stefan winsome and rickerd were all in the squad room and there was an air of celebration around the place it seemed appropriate after all jennifer clewess killer was dead along with his boss and the accomplices were in custody case solved i hear youve been in the wars gristhorpe said looking up as she entered annie sat at her desk and automatically turned on the computer more like doing battlefield triage she said anyway di brooke and the so guys have got it all under control now my jobs done down there congratulations said gristhorpe anything new stefan annie asked i was just telling the superintendent here that we got a quick match on the fingerprints found on dci bankss door artyom charkov he doesnt have a record but the prints match the body in the mortuary in london the one who was shot this morning in the second raid and they also match the partial we found on the door of jennifer clewess car london say they found a gun on charkov too a twentytwo its being checked out thats what got him shot said annie opening fire on an armed police officer well id have used something with a bit more stopping power than a twentytwo its just as well for the officer concerned that he didnt anyway its all a bit academic now hes dead isnt it said annie stefan looked disappointed oh stefan im sorry i didnt mean to belittle your efforts theres always the other one boris the driver essex technical support got his print from the crashed mondeo said stefan suppressing a smile from inside the glove box excellent things have been happening then hows alan asked gristhorpe hes doing okay as far as i know sir said annie i think hell be heading back to peterborough later today to spend a bit more time with his parents and help organize the funeral at least hell be able to tell them some sort of justice has been done the door opened behind annie and she saw gristhorpe get to his feet a big grin on his face well if it isnt susan gay he said advancing toward the slightly stocky woman with the tight blond curls who stood in the doorway kev templeton beaming beside her come on in lass join the party weve got him susan said cropley hes down in the custody suite under arrest for the murder of claire potter all by the book weve taken a dna swab and its on its way to derby were also getting three dcs to do the motorway service stations with his photo but the dna itself will be enough templeton was beaming too annie noticed congratulations kev she said good one templeton grinned thank you maam right then said gristhorpe seeing as weve got two reasons to celebrate whos going for the beer banks worked most of it out on his drive back from quainton but he still needed some answers he tracked gareth lambert down at the travel agency on edgeware road leaving his renault parked outside lambert seemed surprised and more than a bit put out at being manhandled into the street as his staff looked on openmouthed but he went without putting up a struggle banks opened the passenger door and shoved him in buckle up he said where are we going ive got something to show you banks made his way through the traffic down the side of hyde park to chelsea bridge then across the river and along to the old midgeleys castings factory if lambert realized where they were going or recognized the place when they arrived he didnt show it banks pulled up on the weedcracked concrete in front of the door and got out he opened lamberts door and practically dragged him out lambert was heavier but he was in poor shape and bankss wiry strength was enough to propel him toward the factory door what the hells going on lambert protested theres no need to roughhandle me this way roys brother or no ill bloody report you banks pushed lambert through the door and into the factory birds took off through the holes in the roof the police had finished with the scene and the chair and ropes were gone but there were still bloodstains visible on the floor roys bloodstains the lab had confirmed it banks stopped and shoved lambert down on a pile of broken pallets and rusty twisted scrap metal lambert groaned as something sharp stuck into his back ill have your fucking job for this he yelled redfaced struggling to get up banks put a foot on his chest and pushed him back stay there he said and listen to me this is where they brought roy you can still see his bloodstains here banks pointed look at that gareth thats my brothers blood thats nothing to do with me said lambert sitting up and rubbing his back ive never seen this place before you dont know what youre talking about youre rambling he tried to get to his feet but banks pushed him down again thats a good one said banks let me be perfectly clear about it gareth after you and roy had your little talk in the albion club you rang hadeon mazuryk or max broda on your mobile from the clubs toilet and asked for help im sure your mobile records will bear this out you needed to get roy out of the way mazuryk came himself or sent someone else and they got him in a car outside the club and brought him here they tortured him you know gareth to find out how much he knew what my address was and what i knew maybe they even got our parents address out of him because theyve made threats in that direction too he was tied up on a chair just over there bleeding knowing he was probably going to die at the end of it all banks felt close to tears of rage as he talked and it was all he could do to hold himself back from thrashing lambert he found an iron bar on the floor picked it up and slapped it against his palm lambert cringed i told you he said its nothing to do with me why would i do that the girl and your brother were a danger to mazuryk not to me but youre connected with mazuryk you arranged to get the girls to him after max broda bought them at markets in the balkans youll never find any evidence of anything like that it doesnt matter said banks because that wasnt what it was really all about at first i thought it was about the girls you and max broda conspired to smuggle in for mazuryk girls who had been lured by false job offers or abducted from the street you wanted roy in it with you didnt you just like old times and youd been talking about it for a while a couple of months roy didnt know the whole story at first and he might even have shown a flicker of interest if there was enough money in it for him lord knows church or no my brother was no saint then carmen petri let slip to roys girlfriend that these girls were not willing participants jennifer told roy and that changed things for him id guess at that point he wanted nothing to do with it i imagine he gave you a chance though for old times sake i think on the tuesday the day after carmen told jennifer roy had lunch with you and max broda and you both tried to convince him everything was aboveboard but he wasnt convinced thats when he took the photograph of the two of you he left the café first didnt he lambert said nothing maybe he wouldnt have turned you in to the police banks went on no matter how much what you were doing sickened him i doubt that my brother had a very healthy regard for the boys in blue given his track record but there was his girlfriend to consider too wasnt there and she was even more outraged being a woman roy must have told you at lunch on tuesday that hed persuaded her to keep quiet for the time being not to contact the police and that you neednt harm her but mazuryk set artyom and boris to watch her just in case to see where she went and who came to see her if she had rung the police they wouldnt be content with just some anonymous voice over the phone theyd want to visit her or have her visit their station thats what artyom and boris were looking out for then when things came to a head that friday night in the albion club and roy told jennifer to drive up to see me they followed her and killed her on a quiet country road this is ridiculous said lambert a condescending smirk on his face if only you could hear yourself you cant prove any of this when i get out of here im going to banks kicked him hard in the stomach lambert groaned and rolled over clutching his midsection and retching bastard he hissed banks swung the iron bar and hit him on the shoulder lambert screamed but it wasnt even about the girls was it banks went on that was just the start of it oh im sure you tried to convince roy how they had a better life here away from their wartorn countries away from the poverty and disease and death maybe he even wanted to believe it then in a final bid to enlist his sympathy you told him that you were adopting carmen petris baby yourself you probably gave him some sob story about how your wife couldnt bear children and desperately wanted a family you told him youd give the child a much better life than it could have hoped for in romania or as the child of a prostitute in london that was supposed to be the clincher how benevolent of you hed hardly stand in the way of his old mate adopting a child privately would he it might not be strictly legal but people do it all the time dont they how can it be that much of a crime to give a child hope and even roy had to see that any child you adopted had far more advantages than most financial advantages that is so what lambert argued so what if i was adopting her child its true the kid would have a much better life with us any fool can see that maybe so said banks but that wasnt the real intention was it what do you mean i know why roy had to die said banks what are you talking about lamberts voice was scarcely more than a whisper because of where he went earlier that day before you came to call on him he found out the truth i dont understand its where ive just been quainton lambert said nothing he seemed to shrink into himself roy went to see your wife to ask her about the adoption banks went on theyd never met before if it was true he would probably have agreed to keep quiet about it all and keep jennifer quiet too but roy found out what i found out that you and your wife have a baby girl called nina and she needs a new heart and the only heart that can help a baby in need of a transplant is the heart of another baby you know what the chances are of getting your hands on one by normal routes so when you found out one of mazuryks girls was pregnant not just any girl mind you but carmen intelligent healthy and clean you struck a deal youd pay mazuryk for the privilege of adopting carmens baby that way he wouldnt be out of pocket when she couldnt work during her pregnancy but you werent adopting the baby were you you were buying the babys heart i dont know if mazuryk was in on it with you but one way or another as soon as that baby was born it was going to be on its way to switzerland were you going to kill it yourself or have you paid a crooked doctor to do that for you dont be absurd this is pure fantasy is it my guess is that you had someone lined up a crooked doctor from your balkan days probably you wouldnt have the stomach to do it yourself and then theres the swiss clinic all ready to go at a moments notice no questions asked got it all organized havent you lambert squirmed like a toad on his bed of broken wood and twisted metal at some point he had cut his lip and the blood welled up as he spoke look youre obviously off your rocker banks let me go and well say no more about this he made to get up again but banks kicked him down and swung the bar dangerously close to his head stay where you are dont you realize its over do you think that even your wife will want to know you after what you had planned she doesnt know said lambert if youve i havent not yet tell me the truth gareth how could you be sure you had a match who did the tests what tests lambert paused and rubbed his shoulder come on gareth humor me tell me all about it lambert was quiet for several moments then he spoke the blood groups matched he said thats the best you can hope for with babies and even the blood group doesnt matter if theyre newborn do you think i havent researched it the heart only survives six hours outside the body so you do the transplant first and ask questions later a chance it was all i asked for though banks had pieced it all together after seeing mercedes and nina he could still hardly believe it now that he was actually hearing it that this man had coldbloodedly bought a baby and planned to use its heart to save his daughters life do you have even the slightest idea what youre saying he said look said lambert what chance did it have with a mother like that huh tell me look at her a common prostitute a slut this way at least the baby could serve some purpose in being born these people give birth in fields and think nothing of it you havent seen them banks you havent been there i have i know them ive lived with them theyre animals their filthy children wander the streets and beg and steal and grow up to be criminals and prostitutes just like their parents the orphanages are full of abandoned children and none of them has a chance my child will have a chance she can make a difference in life achieve something contribute something banks shook his head in disgust i wondered where roy drew the line he said and now i know hed turn a blind eye to most things for the sake of money and an old friendship to the girls to the illegal adoption but not to this not to the murder of an innocent baby for its heart what did you do on friday at the albion club offer him money to keep quiet or try to convince him you were morally right wed been talking all week about the girls the adoption seeing mercedes and finding out well that was the last straw for him why not tell the police straightaway why did he bother to meet with you he wasnt going to tell the police he was going to tell you what but i am the police said banks lambert shook his head you dont understand youre his big brother he expected you to handle it banks felt stunned he hadnt realized roy had been calling on him as much if not more as a brother than as a policeman the brother who defended him from bullies it made a difference roy always shied away from the police and he would expect banks to sort the situation without letting it become official banks didnt know if he could have done that even if they hadnt killed roy and jennifer even if hed wanted to things had probably gone too far already so what happened at the club banks asked he said hed give me an hour to think about it for friendships sake hed be in the casino if i wanted to talk he also told me that he already had someone on her way to see you but he could ring her mobile and bring her back if i agreed to drop my plans what did you say after the hour was up nothing you could have lied told him youd drop the plans he would still have known do you think hed have let it go not kept checking i suppose not said banks so you sent him to his death i had to what else could i do i couldnt abandon nina and mercedes he was going to ruin everything mazuryks business my ninas life mercedes life everything dont you understand i couldnt give in to him without a new heart my daughter will die blood dribbled over lamberts lower lip and bubbled as he spoke banks felt like hitting him again but he knew if he started he might never stop so you had roy killed not me mazuryk did mazuryk know what you planned to do with carmens baby are you crazy nobody knew except me and the doctor i was paying and the doctor owed me i helped him out of a jam once you cant prove anything you know ill deny it all ill tell them you beat me up and made me admit to things i havent done look at me im all bruised and bleeding not nearly enough said banks you made a call to mazuryk from the albion club about roy being a loose cannon and mazuryk came himself or sent broda to pick up roy outside and bring him here i told him roy was threatening to tell everything all mazuryk cared about was the girls the profits they made for him so mazuryk protected his interests and you protected yours what else could i do what would you do if it was your daughter banks didnt want to think about that one why did they go back and take roys computer who did that there couldnt be anything on it about the baby because hed only just got back from seeing mercedes when you arrived mazuryks men not artyom and boris others not very bright we thought he might have information on it about me about mazuryks operation the girls we had talked a lot that week i really thought he was interested at one time i told him things roy used his computer a lot and they hadnt taken the mobile because they hadnt been in the kitchen hadnt even known it was there banks guessed not that it mattered roy and lambert had been careful not to use mobiles in their communications they knew how wide open and incriminating such phone use could be that was why most criminals used stolen ones and banks doubted that roy had ever been in direct telephone contact with mazuryk or broda later of course broda had used the mobile to send his calling card his sick joke what changed things in the first place if that stupid whore hadnt told roys girlfriend that some girls had been abducted and badly treated i dont think any of this would have happened said lambert and your brother and me would have been partners i spent that week trying to convince roy it was still the right thing to do but he didnt like the idea that the girls were working against their will thats when i told him about the adoption i thought he would see what a good thing it was and did he he wasnt convinced obviously but it softened him a bit until he went to see mercedes roy a pimp or procurer banks found it hard to imagine he would probably have described himself as an investor in an escort agency or perhaps as a travel consultant at least his spiritual and moral conversion hadnt cut into his desire to make a profit from just about anything short of illegal body parts and to threaten my parents whose idea what that mazuryks when the digital photo they sent didnt scare you off they had to try stronger measures they could have killed you but i told them the last thing they needed right then was a dead policeman hot on the heels of his brother i told them that banks i saved your life these people are not always reasonable but i have spent time with them i can talk to them they followed you home and back and showed themselves on the road to frighten you off i dont frighten that easily and jennifer clewes they were already worried about her at first she was happy enough to help dr lukas take care of the girls but she got too friendly and mazuryk was worried someone might actually let something slip about how they really came to be there they thought carmen was getting too cocky because she didnt have to turn tricks anymore and when artyom saw them talking together carmen and jennifer clewes he got suspicious and told mazuryk they made carmen tell them what she had said without hurting her physically you understand they couldnt risk harming the baby dont tell me they threatened to harm her parents back home possibly but artyom and boris had been keeping an eye on roys girl for a few days then when she took off like that at the same time i told mazuryk that roy was out of control look i wasnt there i dont know for sure how it happened but it wasnt me but you know what happened you set it in motion max told me after it was done they found out where she was going roy told mazuryk when they were beating him and he phoned artyom in the car as soon as she got to a quiet spot on the road they killed her artyom was going to kill you too just in case but you werent there hes not very bright its a pity he didnt said banks because now mazuryk is dead artyom is dead and the rest are going to jail and you what about me i cant decide whether to kill you or turn you in and it was true banks had never in his life felt like killing someone as much as he felt like killing gareth lambert at that moment if hed had a gun he might have done it he hefted the iron bar heavy in his hand and smacked it against his palm again that would do it one swift blow crush his skull like an eggshell lambert was looking at him fear in his eyes no he said holding his hands out to protect his face dont dont kill me it wasnt just revenge for roy but also because he had never come across anyone so loathsome hed even contemplate doing what lambert was doing let alone defend it and justify it he could not have imagined such a thing if he hadnt gone to see mercedes lambert as roy had and heard poor nina cry mercedes lambert obviously knew nothing about her husbands unholy scheme the disgust banks felt churned the bile in his stomach and he could bear to look at lambert no longer what are you going to do are you going to hurt me lambert whined banks hurled the iron bar it clanged into the tangled metal about two inches above lamberts head then banks walked away bent over and vomited on the floor when he had finished he took a few deep breaths hands on his knees wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and took out his mobile one evening a few days later banks crossed the old packhorse bridge at the western end of helmthorpe high street and turned right on the riverside path it was a walk he had often enjoyed before flat and easy between the trees and water no hills to climb and hed end up back in helmthorpe where there were three pubs to choose from as he walked he thought about the events of the past month how it had all started that night he saw penny cartwright in the dog and gun singing strange affair he thought about roy jennifer clewes carmen petri dieter ganz and the rest and gareth lambert now it was just about over artyom and mazuryk were dead gareth lambert was in custody along with boris and max broda and the odds were good that they would get very long sentences bankss actions had forced his hand but dieter ganz seemed to think his team had enough evidence to convict them on charges of trafficking in underage girls across international borders for the purposes of prostitution unfortunately raids on similar houses in paris berlin and rome had netted only minor players as word of what had happened in london spread fast in the balkans guides drivers kidnappers and traders had scattered they would be back though dieter had told banks and he would be waiting for them whether lambert would be tied to the conspiracy to kill roy banks and jennifer clewes was another matter lamberts more sinister intentions couldnt be proved and as he had said only he and the doctor knew what they intended to do with carmens baby and neither was talking banks had received a reprimand for his treatment of lambert at the abandoned factory which would also tend to discredit anything he claimed lambert had told him still there was a good chance that max broda would implicate him in the conspiracy rather than take the fall alone and lamberts mobile phone records for that friday the eleventh of june at the albion club showed a call to mazuryks number at about eleven oclock as for the rest banks wasnt quite sure how things would turn out mazuryks girls would eventually be processed and sent home but who was going to repair their lives heal their broken spirits perhaps some would recover in time and move on but others would drift back into the only life they knew carmen petri annie had told banks was to be reunited with her parents in romania where contrary to what gareth lambert thought there was a good chance that her baby might end up with a decent crack at life carmen had been abducted from the street three years ago and in all that time her parents hadnt given up hoping she was still alive of all of them perhaps mercedes lambert had come out of it worst of all and banks felt deeply for her not only was her husband probably going to jail for a long time but in all likelihood short of a miracle her baby nina was going to die soon the police were investigating bankss accusation and had questioned her about it so now she also had to live with the knowledge of what her husband had been about to do banks could only imagine how knowledge like that might tear a mother apart and haunt her dreams forever what might have been the nameless faceless issue of a romanian prostitute she had never met measured against the life of her daughter his mind turned to other thoughts he had just got back from roys funeral in peterborough needless to say it had been a sad and tearful affair but at least he had spent some time with brian and tracy who had come in for the occasion and it had given his parents some sense of that closure they valued so much banks never really got it for him there was no closure the good news was that his mother had managed to get speedy results on the medical tests her colon cancer was operable and her chances of making a full recovery were excellent she also seemed to be coping a bit better with the loss of her son though banks knew she would never fully recover from it never be her old self again brilliant green dragonflies hovered above the waters surface and clouds of gnats and midges gathered above the path the sun had almost set and the water was dark blue the sky streaked with blood orange banks could hear the calls of night birds from the trees and the sounds of small animals scuffling in the undergrowth across the river he could see the backs of the shops and houses on helmthorpe high street people were sitting outside in the beer garden of the dog and gun and he could hear muffled conversations and music from the jukebox it should have been deliuss summer night on the river he thought breathing in the perfumed air but it wasnt even strange affair it was elvis costellos watching the detectives banks paused to light a cigarette and saw a figure walking toward him from the other direction he couldnt make out any more than a dark shape but when it got closer he saw it was penny cartwright he stood aside to let her pass the overhanging leaves brushed the back of his neck and made him shiver it felt as if a spider had slipped under his collar and was making its way down his back as she passed banks nodded politely and said hello making to hurry along but her voice came from behind him wait a minute banks turned yes got a light as banks flicked his lighter she leaned in toward him cigarette in her mouth and her eyes were on his as she inhaled thanks she said fancy meeting you here yes fancy good night then dont go i mean wait a sec okay she sounded nervous and edgy banks wondered what was wrong they stood and faced each other on the narrow path an owl hooted deep in the woods elvis continued to watch the detectives it was almost dark now only a few streaks of purple and crimson in the sky like some great gods robes i was sorry to read about your brother she said thank you penny pointed to the beer garden do you remember that night she said all those years ago banks remembered he had sat in the garden with his wife sandra and penny and her boyfriend jack barker explaining the harry steadman murder it had been a warm summer evening just like tonight hows jack he asked penny smiled she wasnt a woman who smiled easily and it was worthwhile when she did im sure jacks doing fine she said i havent seen him in ages he went off to live in los angeles does a bit of tv writing you even see his name on the screen sometimes i thought you two were we were but it was a long time ago things change you ought to know that i suppose so said banks kath behind the bar told me about the fire about what happened to your cottage after she saw us talking im really sorry water under the bridge said banks besides im having it restored still anyway she went on not looking at him i was rude that night and im sorry there ive said it why did you react the way you did it wasnt deliberate if thats what you mean what then penny paused and stared into the river you really dont know do you all those years ago she said finally the way i felt it was like some sort of violation i know you saved my life and i should thank you for that but you treated me like a criminal you actually believed that i killed my best friend at one point that was probably true banks thought it was just a part of his job and he had never stopped to think how it might have made penny feel everyone gets tainted by a murder investigation roy had wanted his big brother banks remembered not a policeman but where does the one end and the other begin and there you were she went on asking me out to dinner casual as anything as if none of it had ever happened people arent always what they seem he said when the police come around asking questions people lie everyones got something to hide so you suspect everyone more or less anyone who might have motive means and opportunity like me like you but i cared about harry steadman thats what you told us i could have been lying as i remember it that case was full of lies penny took one last drag on her cigarette and flicked the stub into the river oops she said i shouldnt have done that the river police will be after me dont worry said banks ill put in a good word for you she favored him with another flicker of a smile id better be going she said edging away its getting late all right she started along the path paused and halfturned to face him good night then mr policeman and im sorry i reacted so badly i just wanted to tell you why good night said banks he felt a tightness in his chest but it was now or never look he went on calling after her maybe im being insensitive again and im sorry i got off on the wrong foot but is it at all within the bounds of possibility you know what i asked you about the other night maybe the possibility of us of you and me you know having dinner sometime she turned briefly i dont think so she said shaking her head slowly you still dont get it do you and she walked off into the shadows acknowledgments i would like to thank the following people for the time and care they have put into helping this book into its final shape sarah turner maria rejt and nicholas blake at
