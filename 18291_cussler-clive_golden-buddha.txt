winston spenser crooked art dealer who attempts to steal the golden buddha michael talbot san francisco art dealer who works for friday prelude march the flowers surrounding the summer palace of norbulingka were closed but ready to bloom the parklike setting of the complex was beautiful high stone walls surrounded it within the walls were trees and lush gardens and in the center was a smaller yellow wall through which only the dalai lama his advisors and a few select monks passed here were tranquil pools the home of the dalai lama and a temple for prayer it was a sea of order and substance centered in a country in chaos not far away perched on the side of a hill was the imposing winter palace of potala the massive structure seemed to step down the hillside potala contained over one thousand rooms was populated by hundreds of monks and dated from centuries before there was an imposing orderliness to the building stone steps led from the mid levels of the sevenstory palace in an orderly zigzag downward and then stopped at a gigantic block stone wall that formed the base of the behemoth the precisely laid stones rose nearly eighty feet into the air at the base was a flat stretch of land where tens of thousands of tibetans were assembled the people as well as another large group at norbulingka had come to protect their spiritual leader unlike the hated chinese who occupied their country the peasants carried not rifles but knives and bows instead of artillery they had only flesh bone and spirit they were outgunned but to protect their leader they would have gladly laid down their lives their sacrifice would require but one word from the dalai lama inside the yellow wall the dalai lama was praying at the shrine to mahakala his personal protector the chinese had offered to take him to their headquarters for his protection but he knew that was not their true motive it was the chinese from whom he needed protection and the letter the dalai lama had just received from ngabo ngawang jigme the governor of chamdo held a truer picture after a discussion with general tan the chinese military officer in command of the region jigme was certain the chinese were planning to begin shelling the crowds to disperse them once that happened the loss of life would be horrific raising from his knees the dalai lama walked over to a table and rang a bell almost instantly the door opened and the head of the kusun depon the dalai lamas personal bodyguards appeared through the open door he could see several sing gha warriors the monastic policemen lent a terrifying presence each was over six feet tall wore a fearsome mustache and was dressed in a black padded suit that made them appear even larger and more invincible several dogkhyi the fierce tibetan mastiff guard dogs stood on their haunches at attention please summon the oracle the dalai lama said quietly from his house in lhasa langston overholt iii was monitoring the deteriorating conditions he stood alongside the radio operator as the man adjusted the dial situation critical over the radio operator turned the dial to reduce the static believe red rooster will enter the henhouse over the operator watched the gauges carefully need immediate positive support over again a lag as the operator adjusted the dial i recommend eagles and camels over the man stood mute as the radio warbled and the green gauges returned to a series of wavelike motions the words were out in the ether now the rest was out of their control overholt wanted airplanesand he wanted them now the oracle dorje drakden was deep in a trance the setting sun came through the small window high on the wall of the temple and cast a path of light that ended at an incense holder the wisps of smoke danced on the beam of light and a strange almost cinnamon smell filled the air the dalai lama sat crosslegged on a pillow against a wall a few feet from drakden who was hunched over knees down with his forehead on the wood floor suddenly in a deep voice the oracle spoke leave tonight go then still with his eyes closed still in a trance he rose walked over to a table and stopped exactly one foot away then he reached down picked up a quill pen dipped it in ink and drew a detailed map on a sheet of paper before collapsing to the ground the dalai lama rushed to the oracles side lifted his head and patted his cheek slowly the man began to awaken after sliding a pillow under his head the dalai lama rose and poured a cup of water from an earthenware pitcher carrying the cup back to the oracle he placed it under his lips sip dorje he said quietly slowly the older man recovered and pulled himself to a seated position as soon as the dalai lama was sure the oracle was on the mend he walked over to the table and stared at the ink drawing it was a detailed map showing his escape route from lhasa to the indian border overholt had been born into his career at least one overholt had served in every war the united states had fought since the revolutionary war his grandfather had been a spy in the civil war his father during world war i and langston the third had served in the oss in world war ii before switching to the cia when itd been formed in overholt was now thirtythree with a fifteenyear history of espionage in all that time overholt had never seen a situation quite this ominous this was not a king or a queen in peril not a pontiff or dictator this was the head of a religion a man who was a godking a deity a leader that traced his lineage back to ad if something did not happen quickly the communist scourge would soon be taking him prisoner then the human chess match would be over in mandalay burma overholts message was received and forwarded to saigon where it was transferred to manila then over a secure underwater cable to long beach california then on to washington dc as the situation in tibet continued to deteriorate the cia started to assemble a force in burma the group was not large enough to defeat the chinese just large enough to slow them down until more heavily armed ground troops could be brought to bear disguised as a front company named himalayan air services the armada consisted of fourteen cs ten that could drop supplies and four that had just been converted to firstgeneration gunships this force was augmented with six f fighters and a lone freshofftheassemblyline boeing b heavy bomber alan dulles sat in the oval office puffing on his pipe and pointing out the situation to president eisenhower then the cia director sat back and let the president think for a moment several minutes passed in silence mr president he said at last the cia took the liberty of arranging a firststrike force in burma if you say the word theyll be airborne in an hour since his election in eisenhower had faced the mccarthy hearings the first advisors into vietnam and a heart attack hed had to order ten thousand troops to little rock arkansas to enforce integration witness the soviets take the lead in space and have his vice president stoned by hostile crowds in latin america now cuba had a communist leader only ninety miles from us soil he was weary no alan he said quietly after a pause i learned as a general that you have to know how to pick your fights we need to stay clear of this tibet situation right now dulles rose and shook eisenhowers hand ill notify my men he said in overholts command post in lhasa the ashtray on the table near the radio was filled with the stubs of unfiltered cigarettes hours passed with only the confirmation that the radio transmission had been received every half hour tibetan messengers delivered intelligence visual reconnaissance reported that the crowds outside the palaces near lhasa were growing minute by minute but the messengers were unable to take an accurate count tibetans continued to stream down from the mountains armed with sticks rocks and knives the milling mass would be cannon fodder for the wellarmed chinese so far the chinese had taken no action but the reports mentioned troop buildups on the roads leading into the fabled city overholt had seen this same scenario unfold five years ago in guatemala when a crowd supporting the anticommunist rebels under carlos armas had suddenly sparked chaos had ensued forces under president jacobo arbenz had begun to fire into the crowd to restore order and before dawn broke the hospitals and morgues had been filled to capacity overholt had organized the demonstration and the knowledge clouded his mind like a shroud just then the radio crackled top hat negative over overholts heart skipped a beat the planes he sought were not coming papa bear will okay sweeping the path if critically necessary during extraction advise on departure and subsequent travel over eisenhower said not to attack lhasa overholt thought but dulles has agreed to cover the escape out of tibet on his own if it came to that if he worked things right overholt thought he wouldnt need to put his bosss ass on the line sir the radio operator asked overholt was jarred from his thoughts theyre expecting a reply the operator said quietly overholt reached for the microphone acknowledged and agreed overholt said and thank papa bear for the gesture well call from the road closing office over the radio operator stared up at overholt guess thats that break it all down overholt said quietly well be leaving soon inside the yellow wall preparations for the dalai lamas escape into exile were moving at a blistering pace overholt was cleared past the guards and waited to be seen five minutes later the dalai lama wearing his blackframed prescription glasses and yellow robes entered the office in the administration room the spiritual leader of tibet looked weary but resigned i can tell by your face he said quietly no help is coming im sorry your holiness overholt replied i did all that i could yes langston i am certain you did however the situation is as it is the dalai lama noted so i have decided to go into exile i cannot risk the chance of my people being slaughtered overholt had arrived expecting to use all his powers of persuasion to convince the dalai lama to fleeinstead he found the decision had already been made he should have expected as muchover the years he had grown to know the dalai lama and he had never seen anything that made him doubt the leaders commitment to his people my men and i would like to accompany you overholt offered we have detailed maps radios and some supplies wed be glad to have you come along the dalai lama said we leave shortly the dalai lama turned to leave i wish i could have done more overholt said things are as they are the dalai lama said at the door for now however you should assemble your men and meet us at the river high above norbulingka the sky was dotted with a trillion stars the moon only days away from being full lit the ground with a yellow diffused glow a stillness a quiet the night birds that normally warbled their haunting songs were silent the domesticated animals inside the compoundmusk deer mountain goats camels a single aged tiger and the peacocks that ran loosebarely stirred a light wind from high in the himalayas brought the scent of pine forests and change from high on a hillside outside lhasa came the chilling scream of a snow leopard the dalai lama scanned the grounds then closed his eyes and visualized returning he was dressed in trousers instead of robes a black wool coat instead of a cloak a rifle on a sling rode on his left shoulder and an ancient ceremonial thangka an embroidered silk tapestry was rolled up and hung over his right i am ready he said to his chikyah kenpo or chief of staff have you packed the icon it is safely crated and guarded like you the men will protect it at all costs as they should the dalai lama said softly the two men walked toward and through the gate on the yellow wall the chikyah kenpo was holding a large jeweled curved sword sliding it into a leather scabbard on his belt he turned to his master stay close then followed by a cadre of kusun depon they passed through the outer gate and slipped into the crowd the procession quickly made its way along a worn dirt path pairs of kusun depon stepped to the rear and waited to see if anyone followed after seeing no one they moved forward to the next pair of guards who remained until the coast was clear hopscotching their way along the path the guards made sure the rear was covered to the front pairs of warriors assessed any danger ahead finding it clear they continued their progression a handcart containing the icon followed the procession pulled by a large monk hands firmly on the poles the monk raced along like a rickshaw driver late for an appointment everyone was trotting and the sound made by their feet was like muffled clapping the sound of water came with the smell of wet moss it was a tributary of the kyichu river after the party made their way across a series of steppingstones they continued quickly ahead along the far bank of the kyichu river overholt stared at the radium dial on his watch then shuffled his feet several dozen kusun depon who had been dispatched hours earlier were tending to the horses and mules that would speed the escape they stared at the blondhaired american with neither malice nor fear only resignation several large ferryboats had brought them all across the water and now the boats were tied up again on the far shore awaiting the arrival of the dalai lama overholt caught a quick flash of light from the far bank signaling it was safe to cross in the moonlight he could see the boats quickly being loaded then minutes later heard the sound of the oars slapping the water the lead boat slid onto the pebbled beach and the dalai lama climbed over the side langston he said did you leave the capital undetected yes your holiness all your men with you overholt pointed to the seven men that made up his command they stood off to the side with several footlockers of equipment reaching the opposite shore the chikyah kenpo climbed from the boat and assembled the lead troops onto horses long spears draped with silk banners were placed in the troops hands earlier their steeds had been covered with ceremonial blankets and adornments then like the honk of a goose on his way south a sound of a muted trumpet filled the air it was time to leave overholt and his men were helped onto horses and lined up following the dalai lama by the time the sun rose the next morning they were miles from lhasa two days into the journey across the sixteenthousandfoot chela pass and over the tsangpo river the group stopped for the night at the monastery at rame messengers racing on horseback caught up with the party and brought news that the chinese had shelled norbulingka and machinegunned the helpless crowd thousands had been killed the news cast a pall over the dalai lama overholt had reported their progress by radio and felt relieved there had been no need to call for help the route had been expertly chosen to avoid any conflict with the chinese he and his men were exhausted but the hardy nepalese pushed on without pause the town of lhuntse dzong was behind them as was the village of jhora karpo pass the border with india was less than a days ride and then it began to snow a blizzard with howling winds and low clouds hunkered down over mangmang the last tibetan town before the indian border the dalai lama already exhausted by the journey and stressed by the knowledge that many of his countrymen lay dead and dying took ill his last night in his country was torment to ease his journey he was placed on the back of an animal called a dzomo which was a cross between a yak and a horse as the dzomo climbed the side of karpo pass the dalai lama paused to glance at his beloved tibetan soil one last time overholt pulled closer on his horse he waited until the dalai lama glanced his way my country never forgets he said and someday we will bring you back home the dalai lama nodded then patted the dzomos neck and steered it into exile to the rear of the column the monk pulling the cart containing the priceless artifact braced his legs as he crested the pass and started down the grade the sixhundredpound weight so heavy on the climb up the pass now wanted to run free he dug in his heels the present day eight in the evening from out of the south like a dark insect crawling over a wrinkled blue tablecloth a tired old cargo ship pushed her way through the caribbean swells toward the entrance of santiago harbor on the isle of cuba the exhaust from her single funnel drifted in a blue haze under an easterly breeze as the sun settled below the western horizon and became a ponderous orange ball magnified by the earths atmosphere she was one of the last tramp steamers a cargo ship that traveled the sea anonymously to the exotic and farflung ports of the world there were few left in operation they did not follow a regular shipping route their schedules depended on the demands of their cargo and its owners so their destinations changed from port to port they coasted in unloaded their freight and sailed away like wraiths in the night two miles from shore a small boat slapped over the rolling sea approached the ship and swung around on a parallel course the pilot closed on the ruststreaked hull as a boarding ladder was thrown down from an open hatch the pilot a man in his fifties with brown skin and thick gray hair stared up at the ancient ship her black paint was faded and badly needed to be chipped away and repainted streams of rust flowed from every opening in the hull the huge anchor pulled tightly in its hawsehole was completely covered by corrosion the pilot read the letters barely discernible on the upper bow the weary old freighter was named oregon jesus morales shook his head in amazement it was a miracle the ship hadnt been scrapped twenty years ago he mused she looked more like a derelict than a cargo carrier still in service he wondered if the party bureaucrats in the ministry of transportation had any idea of the condition of the ship they had contracted to bring in a cargo of chemical fertilizer for the sugar and tobacco fields he could not believe the ship had passed maritime insurance inspection as the ship slowed almost to a dead stop morales stood at the railing and the pilot boats bumpers squeezed against the freighters hull timing the crest of a wave as it lifted the boat morales leaped agilely from the wet deck onto the boarding ladder and climbed to the hatch it was a function he performed as often as ten times a day a pair of crewmen were waiting beside the hatch and helped him up on the deck the two were both burlylooking individuals and they did not bother to smile in greeting one simply pointed toward the ladder leading to the bridge then they turned and left morales standing alone on the deck watching them walk away morales hoped that hed never have to meet them in a dark alley he paused before climbing the ladder and took a few moments to study the upper works of the ship from his long experience and knowledge of ships he judged her length at feet with a foot beam probably a gross tonnage around five derricks two behind the funnel and superstructure and three on the forward deck stood waiting to unload her cargo he counted six holds with twelve hatches in her prime she would have been classed as an express cargo liner he guessed that she had been built and launched in the early s the flag on her stern was iranian not a registry morales had seen very often if the oregon looked shabby from the waterline she looked downright squalid from her main deck rust covered every piece of deck machinery from winches to chains but the hardware at least appeared to be in usable condition by comparison the derricks looked as if they hadnt been operated in years to add further insult battered drums tools and what could only be described as junked equipment were scattered around the decks in all his years as a harbor pilot morales had never seen a ship in such filthy condition he climbed the ladder steps leading to the bridge past bulkheads with flaking paint and portholes whose lenses were cracked and yellowed then he paused before finally swinging the door open the interior of the vessel was as bad if not worse the wheelhouse was dirty with the scars of cigarette burns on the counters and on what had once been a polished teak deck dead flies littered the windowsills the smell assaulted his nose and then there was the captain morales was greeted by a great slob of a man with an immense stomach that sagged over his belt line the face was scarred and the nose so badly broken it slanted toward the left cheek the thick black hair was plastered back with some kind of greasy cream and his beard was scruffy and stringy the captain was a cacophony of colors his eyes were red and his teeth yellowbrown while his arms were covered with blue tattoos a grimy yachtsmans cap sat perched on the back of his head and he wore dingy coveralls the tropical heat and the humidity on the nonairconditioned bridge made it obvious to morales that the man had not bathed for at least a month any dog worth his salt would have tried to bury the man he extended a sweaty hand to morales and spoke in english glad to see you im captain jed smith jesus morales pilot for the harbor office of santiago morales felt uncomfortable smith spoke english with an american accentnot what hed expected on a ship of iranian registry smith handed him a packet of papers heres our registration and cargo manifest morales merely cast a brief glance at the documents officials on the docks would study them more closely his only concern was that the ship had permission to enter the port he handed back the packet and said shall we proceed smith waved a hand toward a wooden helm that somehow seemed terribly oldfashioned for a ship built in the sixties shes all yours señor morales what dock do you want us to moor at there are no docks available until thursday you will have to anchor in the middle of the harbor until then thats four days from now we have a schedule to meet we cant sit around for four days waiting to unload our cargo morales shrugged i have no control over the harbormaster besides the docks are full with ships unloading new farm machinery and automobiles now that the embargo has been lifted these have priority over your cargo smith threw up his hands all right i guess its not the first time we had to twiddle our thumbs waiting to unload he gave a broad rottentoothed grin i guess me and my crew will just have to come ashore and make friends with your cuban women the thought made moraless skin crawl without further conversation he stepped over to the helm as smith called the engine room and ordered half speed the pilot felt the engines vibrations through the deck as the tired old ship began to make way again and he aimed her bow toward the narrow entrance of santiago harbor which was bordered by high bluffs that rose from the sea from offshore the channel that led inside to the bellowsshaped harbor was invisible until a ship was nearly on top of it rising two hundred feet atop the cliffs on the right stood the old colonial fortress known as morro castle morales noticed that smith and the members of his mangy crew standing on the bridge seemed interested in the defenses that had been dug into the hillside when fidel castro had thought the united states was going to attack cuba they studied the gun and missile emplacements through expensive binoculars morales smiled to himself let them look all they wantedmost of the defenses were deserted only two small fortresses maintained a small company of soldiers to man the missile emplacements in the unlikely event an unwelcome vessel tried to enter the harbor morales threaded his way through the buoys and steered the oregon deftly around the twists and turns of the channel which soon opened into the broad ballshaped harbor surrounded by the city of santiago the wheel felt strange to him though the odd feeling was barely perceptible but there nonetheless whenever he turned the wheel there seemed to be a short lag before the rudder responded he made a quick but very slight turn to starboard before bringing the wheel back to port it was definitely there almost like an echo a twosecond delay he did not sense sluggishness from the steering machinery but rather a pause it had to come from another origin yet when the response came it was quick and firm but why the hesitation your helm has an off feel to it yeah smith grunted its been that way for a few days next port we enter with a shipyard ill have the spindles on the rudder looked at it still made no sense to morales but the ship was entering the open part of the bay off the city now and he pushed the mystery from his mind he called the harbor officials over the ships radio and kept them informed of his progress and was given orders for the anchorage morales pointed out the buoys to smith that marked the mooring area and ordered the ship brought to slow speed he then swung the stern around until the bow was facing the incoming tide before ordering all stop the oregon slowed to a halt in an open area between a canadian container ship and a libyan oil tanker you may drop your anchor he said to smith who acknowledged with a nod as he held a loudspeaker in front of his face let go anchor he shouted at his crew the command was answered a few seconds later by the rattling clatter of the chain links against the hawsehole followed by a great splash as the anchor plunged into the water the bow of the ship became hazy from the cloud of dust and rust that burst from the chain locker morales released his grip on the worn spokes of the wheel and turned to smith you will of course pay the pilots fee when you turn over your documents to the harbor officials why wait snorted smith he reached into a pocket of his coveralls and produced a wad of crinkled american hundreddollar bills he counted out fifteen bills then hesitated looked into moraless shocked expression and said oh what the heck suppose we make it an even two thousand dollars without the least indecision morales took the bills and slipped them into his wallet you are most generous captain smith i will notify the officials that the pilots fee was paid in full smith signed the required affidavits and logged the mooring he put a massive arm around the cubans shoulder now about them girls wheres a good place in santiago to meet them the cabarets on the waterfront are where youll find both cheap entertainment and drinks ill tell my crew goodbye captain morales did not extend his hand he already felt unclean just by being on board the ship he could not bring himself to grip the greasy hand of the obnoxious captain moraless easygoing cuban warmth had been cooled by the surroundings and he didnt want to waste another second on board the oregon leaving the wheelhouse he dropped down the ladder to the deck and descended to the waiting pilot boat still stunned at experiencing the filthiest ship he had ever piloted into the harbor which is just what the owners of the oregon wanted him to think if morales had examined the ship more closely he might have realized it was all a façade the oregon rode low in the water because of specially fitted ballast tanks which when filled with water lowered the hull to make it look as though it were loaded with cargo even the engine tremors were mechanically staged the ships engines were whispersilent and vibrationless and the coating of rust throughout the ship it was artistically applied paint satisfied that the pilot and his boat had pulled away from the oregon captain smith stepped over to a handrail mounted on the deck that did not seem to serve any particular purpose he gripped it and pressed a button on the underside the square section of the deck on which smith was standing suddenly began descending until it stopped in a vast brightly lit room filled with computers automated controls and several large consoles containing communications and weaponsfiring systems the deck in the command center was richly carpeted the walls were paneled in exotic woods and the furniture looked as if it had come straight from a designers showroom this room was the real heart of the oregon the six peoplefour men and two womenneatly dressed in shorts flowered shirts and white blouses were busy manning the various systems one woman was scanning an array of tv monitors that covered every section of santiago bay while a man zoomed a camera on the pilot boat as it turned and headed into the main channel no one bothered to give the fat captain half a glance only a man dressed in khaki shorts and a green golf shirt approached him all go well with the pilot asked max hanley the ships corporate president who directed all operational systems including the ships engines the pilot noticed the delay in the helm hanley grinned if only hed known he was steering a dead wheel well have to make some adjustments though you speak to him in spanish smith smiled my best yankee english why let him know i speak his language that way i could tell if he played any tricks over the radio with the harbor officials as we anchored smith pulled back a sleeve of his grimy coveralls and checked a timex watch with a badly scratched lens thirty minutes until dark the equipment in the moon pool is all ready and the landing crew standing by i just have time to get rid of these smelly clothes and get decent said cabrillo heading toward his cabin down a hallway hung with paintings by modern artists the crew cabins were concealed inside two of the cargo holds and were as plush as rooms in a fivestar hotel there was no separation between officers and crew on the oregon all were educated people highly trained in their respective fieldselite men and women who had served in the armed forces the ship was owned by its staff who were stockholders there were no ranks cabrillo was chairman hanley president the others held various other titles they were all mercenaries here to make a profitthough that did not necessarily rule out good works at the same timehired by countries or large companies to perform clandestine services around the world very often at great risk the man who left the cabin twenty minutes later did not look like the man whod entered the greasy hairpiece scruffy beard and grimy coveralls were gone as was the foul smell so was the timex now replaced with a stainlesssteel concord chronograph in addition the man had dropped at least a hundred pounds juan rodriguez cabrillo had transformed himself from the grimy sea dog smith to his true self again a tall man in his forties ruggedly handsome he stared through pixie blue eyes his blond hair was trimmed in a crew cut and a western cowboystyle mustache sprouted from his upper lip he hurried down the corridor to a far door and entered a control room perched high inside a vast cavern in the hull amidships the threedeckhigh moon pool as it was called was where all the oregons underwater equipment was storeddiving gear submersibles manned and unmanned and an array of underwater electronic sensors a pair of stateoftheart contemporary underwater craft byus submarinesa sixtyfivefoot nomad and a thirtytwofoot discovery hung in cradles the doors on the bottom of the hull slid open and water flooded in until it was level with the outer waterline the remarkable ship was not what she appeared from her exterior the outer decks and hull were disguised to make her look like a rust bucket the wheelhouse and the unused officers and crews quarters below were also kept in a slovenly condition to avoid suspicion from visiting port officials or harbor pilots cabrillo entered the underwater operations room and stood before a large table showing threedimensional holographic images of every street in the city of santiago linda ross the oregons security and surveillance analyst was standing at the table lecturing a group of people dressed in cuban military fatigue uniforms linda had been a lieutenant commander in the navy when cabrillo had sweettalked her into resigning and joining the oregon in the navy she had been an intelligence officer on board an aegis guidedmissile cruiser before spending four years in washington in the navys intelligence department linda glanced sideways at cabrillo as he stood quietly without interrupting she was an attractive woman not a head turner but most men still considered her pretty she kept her fivefooteightinch pound body in firm shape with exercise but rarely spent extra time on makeup or hairstyle she was one smart lady softspoken and greatly admired by the entire oregon crew the five men and one woman standing around the detailed d image of the city listened intently as linda ran through the lastminute instructions using a small metal rod with a light on the end to point out their objective the fortress of santa ursula it was built during the spanishamerican war and after the turn of the twentieth century it was used as a warehouse until castro and his revolutionaries took over the country then it was turned into a prison what is the exact distance from our landing to the prison asked eddie seng the oregons master of subterfuge and director of shore operations two hundred yards less than a mile answered linda seng folded his arms and looked thoughtful well be able to fool the locals with our uniforms going in but if we have to fight our way back a mile to the docks while herding eighteen prisoners i cant guarantee well make it certainly not in the condition those poor people are going to be in said julia huxley the oregons medical officer she was going along on the raid to care for the prisoners a short woman large bosomed with a body suited for wrestling julia was the congeniality lady of the ship shed served as a chief medical officer for four years at the san diego naval base and was well respected by them all our agents in the city have arranged for a truck to be stolen twenty minutes before you leave the prison its used for hauling food supplies to the hotels the truck and a driver will be parked one block from the workers maintenance shack situated on the wharf above your landing dock hell drive you to the prison wait and return you to the dock from there hell ditch the truck and ride home on his bicycle does he have a name is there a password linda smiled slightly the password is dos seng looked skeptical two thats it yes hell reply with uno one its that simple well at least its concise linda paused to flick a series of switches on a small remote control the images of the city dissolved into a d interior diorama of santa ursula prison without its roof revealing the inner rooms and cells and their connecting passageways our sources tell us there are only ten guards in the whole prison six on the day shift two in the evening and two from midnight until six in the morning you should have no problem overpowering the two on the station theyll think youre a military unit come to transport the prisoners to another secure facility youre scheduled to gain entry at ten oclock subdue the two onduty guards and release the prisoners then return to the submarine and make the ship by eleven oclock any later and you jeopardize our escape out of the harbor how so asked one of sengs team members were told the harbor defense systems are run through an operational test every night at twelve weve got to be well on our way to sea before then why not wait and go in after midnight when most of the town is asleep asked a member of the landing force at ten oclock the local citizens will still be stirring around youll cause less suspicion if you dont sneak around the streets before dawn she replied also the other eight guards are usually out on the town in the local bars until early morning youre sure about that asked seng linda nodded their movements have been watched and clocked for two weeks by our agents in the city unless murphys law rears its ugly head said cabrillo the release of the prisoners and the escape should go smoothly the tough part comes when youre all on board and we have to sail out of the harbor the minute castros harbor security forces see us pull up the anchor and turn down the channel for the open sea theyll know something is wrong and all hell will break loose linda looked at cabrillo we have the weaponry to knock them out true cabrillo acknowledged but we cannot fire the first shot if they strike the oregon first however well have no choice but to protect ourselves none of us has been told said seng who exactly are we breaking out of jail they must be important or we wouldnt have contracted for the job cabrillo looked at him we wanted to keep it under wraps until we got here theyre cuban doctors journalists and businessmen who opposed castros government all highly respected men and women castro knows they are dangerous if they are free if they reach the cuban community in miami they can use it as a base to instigate a revolutionary movement is it a good contract ten million dollars if we deliver them to us soil seng and the others around the holographic display smiled that should add a tidy little amount to everyones nest egg he said doing good for profit cabrillo said with a wide grin thats our motto at precisely seng and his small force boarded the nomad along with the two crewmen who would pilot the sub and guard it during the operation the sub looked more like a luxury surface yacht than a submersible capable of running at high speeds on the surface with its diesel engines it was battery powered beneath the waves with a speed of twelve knots underwater the nomad could dive to a thousand feet the interior was designed to hold twelve people comfortably but cabrillo had had her configured to carry three times that number tightly packed together for missions such as this one the entry door was closed and sealed and the craft secured by a large sling was lifted by a crane into the center of the moon pool the operator looked into the control room and was given the descent signal by cabrillo then slowly the large craft was lowered into the black water as soon as she settled divers removed the sling and were carried upward to the surrounding balcony by the crane radio check said seng do you read me like youre in the same room linda ross assured him are we clear no ship movement and only three fishing boats are heading out to sea at thirty feet you should stay well below their keels and props keep the coffee on said seng bon voyage quipped cabrillo thats easy for you to say seng came back a few moments later the lights inside the nomad blinked out and it vanished into the dark water of the harbor the pilots of the sub relied on their global positioning system to set them on an exact course for the section of the city docks that was their destination detecting the pilings by their laser monitoring system they were able to slip between the stern and bow of two container ships unloading cargo and maneuvered their way amid the giant pilings once under the wharves and out of sight from anyone above they surfaced and closed the remaining gap using a laser nightpenetrating camera that magnified the city lights filtering beneath the pilings floating maintenance dock dead ahead announced the chief pilot there was no hard check of weapons or survival gear though they all carried concealed handguns they wanted to look like a small security unit moving through town without any menacing designs on the citizens their only inspection was to make sure their uniforms looked neat and presentable the combat members of the team had all been members of the special forces they were under strict orders not to commit mayhem unless it was absolutely necessary in order to save lives seng himself had served on a marine recon team and had never lost a man no sooner had the nomad gently bumped against the floating dock than seng followed closely by his team exited the sub and headed up the stairs to a little house that sheltered the dock and maintenance workers tools and small equipment the door was easily unlocked from the inside and seng with only a brief look to see if anyone was standing nearby silently motioned everyone to follow him the lights of the cranes and the ships they were unloading lit up the dock like daylight but luckily the exit door was opposite and the team formed in the shadows then in a column of twos and marching in cadence seng led them to the end of the dock and around the warehouse his watch said exactly twentyfour minutes to arrive at the front gate of the prison they found the truck nine minutes later parked under a dim dock light beside the warehouse seng recognized it as a ford delivery van that looked like it had passed the twomillionmile mark years ago in the gloom he could make out lettering in a fancy red script on the side of the fourteenfoot cargo body it read gonzales food purveyors in spanish the driver was visible only by the glow of his cigarette seng walked up to the open window hand on his ruger p caliber automatic with suppressor and said quietly dos the driver of the truck exhaled a cloud of nonfiltered cigarette smoke into the cab and replied uno pile in the back seng ordered his team ill ride in front he opened the passenger door and slid onto the seat there was no conversation as the driver crunched the wornout transmission into gear and drove off the dock into the city streets every other light on the boulevard running along the bay was dark either because the bulbs had burned out and had never been replaced or to conserve energy after a few blocks the driver turned onto a main street and headed up a slight grade toward san juan hill cubas second largest city santiago was in oriente province and had been the islands capital in the seventeenth century surrounded by hills with coffee and sugarcane plantations the city was a maze of narrow streets with small plazas and buildings of spanish colonial architecture bearing hanging balconies seng remained silent concentrating on scanning the side streets and studying the numbers on his portable gps to make certain the driver was heading in the right direction the streets were mostly empty of traffic except for fiftyyearold cars parked along the curbs and the sidewalks were filled with people simply out for an after dinner stroll or sitting in bars that reverberated with loud strains of the cuban beat many of the stores and apartments above had paint that was faded and chipped while others were coated in vivid pastel colors the gutters and sidewalks were clean but the windows looked like they had rarely seen a cleaner and a squeegee for the most part the people looked happy there was much laughter and occasional singing no one gave the truck a second look as it passed slowly through the main downtown section of the city seng spotted a few men in uniform but they seemed more interested in talking with women than watching for a foreign intrusion the driver lit up another foulsmelling cigarette seng had never smoked and he leaned further against his door and turned his face through the open window lifting his nose in disgust ten minutes later the truck reached the front gate of the fortress prison the driver pulled past and stopped fifty yards down the road i will wait here he said in almost perfect english they were the first words he had spoken since the dock seng read him like a book educator or doctor i teach history at the university thank you dont be long the truck will look suspicious if it sits here past midnight we should be out before then seng assured him seng climbed out of the truck cab and peered up and down the street cautiously it was empty he rapped softly on the cargo doors they opened and his team dropped out and joined him on the bricksurfaced street together they marched as a unit up to the front gate and pulled the bell cord a ringing could be heard in the guards office behind the gate in a few minutes a guard came wandering out rubbing his eyes and temples he had obviously been asleep on duty he was about to tell the intruders to go away when he recognized sengs uniform and insignia as a colonels and he feverishly opened the gate stood back and saluted sir what brings you to the fortress this time of night colonel antonio yarayo i was sent by the ministry of state security with this team to interrogate one of the prisoners a new investigation has turned up a suspected united states spy operation we believe they have information which could prove useful pardon me sir but i must ask you for the proper papers as a good soldier sergeant said seng officiously well you should he handed the guard an envelope why arent there more guards on duty there is one other who watches the prisoners cells hmm well i see no reason to stand out here all night take me to your office quarters the guard immediately ushered them into a barren office that contained only a desk and two chairs a photo of castro taken when he was a young man hung alone on one wall who is the officer in command here asked seng captain juan lopez where is he he has a girlfriend with a house in the city he will be back at nine oclock tomorrow how very convenient seng said as if bored what is your name lieutenant gabriel sanchez sir and the name of the other guard on duty in the cells sergeant ignez macco please check the documents so we can get on with it the guard sat down at the desk and pulled some paper out of the envelope seng moved behind and removed a small gun from his pocket as sanchez stared blankly at a pair of comic books he looked up colonel i dont under that was as far as he got before seng shot a tiny dart filled with a tranquilizer into the nape of his neck sanchez looked at seng oddly before slumping unconscious over the table seng threw a roll of duct tape to one of his team every move was so well rehearsed that he did not have to give orders two men took the tape bound the unconscious guard searched his pocketsfinding an unusual round keyand then stuffed him in a closet another man went to work carefully rendering the security alarms and communications equipment inoperable as they rushed through the passageways and tunnels and down stone steps to the cells below seng knew where he was within a foot thanks to the holographic image of the fortress that he had committed to memory there was no desperate hurry but they could not afford to throw away time he could see now why only a few men guarded the entire facility the walls were massively thick and there was only one entrance in and out of the dungeon cells far below street level the only way a prisoner could escape was the way the team from the oregon had comefrom the outside a string of lightbulbs lit the passageway the ceiling was very high but the space between the walls was very narrow the steps finally ended at an enormous steel door with the thickness of a bank vault a tv camera stared ominously at seng and his men this was the tricky part he thought as he inserted the oddlooking key into the steel lock seng prayed that the key would do the job without a code being demanded his fear was confirmed when he turned the key and a buzzer could be heard from the other side of the door a minute later a voice called through a nearby loudspeaker who goes there colonel antonio yarayo state security with an interrogation team to question the traitors there was a pause seng didnt wait for a reply open up i have the authority and necessary documents lieutenant sanchez would have accompanied us but he said he was not allowed to leave the front gate unguarded sergeant ignez macco is it seng held up the envelope if you have any questions i have your service record in my hands but sir the voice of macco pleaded if the door is opened before eight oclock in the morning alarms will go off in the state security office at fort canovar i ordered lieutenant sanchez to turn off the dungeon alarm seng bluffed but sir he cannot do that the door is on a separate system that is wired to the security commandants office in the city it cannot be opened until eight oclock in the morning it was one more obstacle to overcome but not totally unexpected seng was betting that the security officers would think the alarms were malfunctioning and call the fort to check it out before sending a squad of security police macco fell for it a few seconds later the big steel lock clacked and the bolts that extended from the door into the framework could be heard withdrawing from their slots then the massive door swung open silently and smoothly sergeant macco stood at attention and snapped a salute seng wasted no more time on niceties he aimed the tranquilizer gun at maccos throat and squeezed the tiny trigger the guards eyes rolled back in his head and he dropped to the stone floor like a sack of sand the dungeon was not a stateoftheart prison the rusting iron cell doors had been hung in the late nineteenth century and still required the large antique key chained to maccos belt seng ripped the key and its ring from the guards belt and began opening the first doors as soon as the door was swung ajar julia huxley rushed into the cell to check the condition of its inhabitant sengs team helped by assisting the shocked prisoners who feared the worst into the dungeons passageway five are in no condition to walk up the stairs and onto the street said julia theyll have to be carried out on stretchers then well haul them on our backs replied seng we dont have enough bodies to carry five stretchers these poor devils think were going to execute them said a tall ruggedly built team member with red hair in a buzz cut we havent got time to explain snapped seng he knew that the security officials downtown were wondering why the dungeon alarm in santa ursula had been triggered at this time of night they were certain to call and find the phones down how soon they would send a squad of men to check was anybodys guess julia you round up those who can move on their own two feet the rest of you men carry the ones too weak to walk they moved off almost having to drag the poor suffering cubans out of the dungeon and up the stairs every team member with a cuban over one shoulder their free arms braced around other prisoners who could barely manage the steps julia brought up the rear supporting two women and whispering encouraging words whose meanings could only come through in her soothing toneshe knew only enough spanish to order a margarita climbing the winding stone steps was a torturous exertion for the weakened prisoners but there could be no turning back any capture now meant certain execution they struggled up the steps chests rising and falling lungs gasping for air hearts pounding men and women who had long ago given up hope now saw an opportunity to live normal lives again thanks to these crazy people who were risking death to rescue them seng could not afford the time to sympathize with their plight or look into their gaunt faces any thoughts of compassion were fleeting sympathy could come once they reached the safety of the oregon he concentrated on pushing them all toward the main gate keeping his mind cold and logical at last the front of the column reached the guards office at the gate seng stepped cautiously out onto the brick street there was no whisper of sound or any sign of vehicles or people the truck was right where theyd left it the team carrying those too weak to walk were huffing and puffing now and soaked in sweat from the tropical humidity warily seng studied the darkened street and buildings through his laser night binoculars the area was clear satisfied he hustled everyone through the gate and shoved them roughly in the direction of the truck he rushed back into the office and checked the guard he was still unconscious he also spotted a red light on a console beside the desk the alarm had indeed been activated when theyd opened the dungeon door the phone began to ring and he picked it up and snapped in spanish uno momento then he set the receiver down and dashed out the door the rescue team and the freed prisoners were crammed into the cargo bed of the truck like japanese workers during rush hour the driver shifted the weary old transmission into gear with a brief metallic grind and the truck leaped forward the streets were as before the auto traffic thin while cubans were enjoying a balmy evening outside on their balconies sitting at chairs and tables on the sidewalks or drinking in the cantinas dancing and singing seng cocked his ear out the window and listened for any sound of alarms or sirens there came only the strains of music in the night air the harshest sound came from the trucks muffler which seemed to be coming loose from the engine header pipe the rattle of the exhaust soon drowned out the city noise he saw cubans glance at the truck and then turn away loose exhaust pipes and rustedout mufflers were common on the old cars that traveled the streets of santiago the citys inhabitants had more entertaining thoughts on their minds the truck driver drove maddeningly slow but seng knew better than to push him a truck casually taking its time through town would arouse no suspicion after what seemed an hour but was only fifteen minutes the driver pulled up alongside a warehouse dock and stopped a quick look up and down the deserted dock and seng began goading everyone toward the maintenance shed the fiveminute journey to the shed was uneventful their luck still held the only activity was centered on the two cargo ships unloading their big containers though still apprehensive seng finally began to relax he motioned them through the door of the maintenance shed and down the wooden stairs in the darkness he saw the vague shape of the nomad subs pilot standing on the floating dock and helping the cubans on board the other pilot was down below packing them tightly inside the narrow confines of the nomads main cabin when seng and julia huxley the last to board climbed onto the subs upper deck the pilot quickly cast off the mooring lines looked up briefly and said you made good time get to the ship as fast as this craft can take us seng replied we couldnt help setting off an alarm im surprised cuban security forces arent already breathing down our neck if they havent tracked you here said the pilot confidently as he closed and sealed the hatch theyll never guess where you came from at least not until the oregons found missing from her assigned anchorage in seconds the sub was dropping beneath the surface of the dark water fifteen minutes later it surfaced inside the moon pool of the oregon divers attached the hook and cable of the big overhead crane and the nomad was lifted delicately until it was even with the second deck and moored to the balcony huxleys medical team was waiting along with several members of the ships crew to help the cubans to the oregons wellequipped hospital the time was three minutes past eleven a thin man his hair white before his time recognized cabrillo as an officer and walked unsteadily up to him sir my name is juan tural can you tell me who you people are and why you rescued my friends and me from santa ursula we are a corporation and we were contracted to do this job who hired you friends of yours in the united states answered cabrillo thats all that i can say then you had no idealistic purpose no political cause cabrillo smiled slightly we always have a purpose tural sighed i had hoped that salvation when it came would come from another quarter your people did not have the means to do it its that simple that is why they came to us its a great pity your only motivation was money it wasnt money is simply the vehicle said cabrillo it allows our corporation to pick its fights and to fund our charity projects its a liberty none of us had when we were employed by our respective governments he glanced at his chronograph now if youll excuse me were not out of the woods just yet then he turned and left tural staring after him as he walked away eleven seventeen if they were going to make a run for it now was the time thought cabrillo the alarm had long been answered at the prison and by now patrols were certainly roaming the city and the countryside in search of the escaped prisoners and their rescuers their only link was the truck driver but he could not provide any information to the cuban security forces even if he was captured and tortured his original contact had made no mention of the oregon as far as the driver knew the rescue team had come from a landing party on another part of the island cabrillo lifted a phone and called down to the corporations president in the engine room max hanley answered almost immediately juan have the ballast tanks been pumped dry tanks are dry and the hull is raised for speed the tide is about to turn and will swing us around wed better leave while our bow is still aimed toward the main channel as soon as the anchor comes free ill set the engines very slow no sense in alerting any observers on the shore to a sudden departure at the first alarm or when we reach the main channel whichever comes first ill enter the program for full speed well need every ounce of power your engines can give you think you can get us through a narrow channel in the dead of night at full speed without a pilot the ships computer system read every inch of the channel and the buoy markers on the way in our escape course is plotted and programmed into the automatic pilot well leave it to otis to take us out otis was the crews name for the ships automated control systems it could steer the oregon within inches of the intended route computerized automated controls or not it wont be an easy matter to race through a tight channel at sixty knots we can do it cabrillo punched off and hit another code mark give me a status on our defense systems mark murphy the oregons weapons specialist replied in his west texas drawl if any of them cuban missile launchers so much as hiccups well take them out you can expect aircraft once were in the open sea nuthin we caint handle he turned to linda ross linda all systems are online she replied calmly cabrillo set the phone in its cradle and relaxed lighting up a thin cuban cigar he looked around at the ships crew standing in the control center they were all staring at him waiting expectantly well he said slowly before taking a deep breath i guess we might as well go he gave a voice command to the computer the winch was set in motion and the anchor slowly quietlythrough teflon sleeves the team had inserted inside the hawsehole which deadened the clank of the chainrose from the bottom of the harbor another command and the oregon began to inch slowly ahead down in the engine room max hanley studied the gauges and instruments on the huge console his four big magnetohydrodynamics engines were a revolutionary design for maritime transport they intensified and compounded the electricity found in saline seawater before running it through a magnetic core tube kept at absolute zero by liquid helium the electrical current that was produced created an extremely high energy force that pumped the water through thrusters in the stern for propulsion not only were the oregons engines capable of pushing the big cargo ship at incredible speeds but it required no fuel except the seawater that passed through its magnetic core the source of the propulsion was inexhaustible another advantage was that the ship did not require huge fuel tanks which enabled the space to be utilized for other purposes there were only four other ships in the world with magnetohydrodynamics enginesthree cruise ships and one oil tanker those who had installed the engines in the oregon had been sworn to secrecy hanley took proprietary care of the hightech engines they were reliable and rarely caused problems he labored over them as if they were an extension of his own soul he kept them finely tuned and in a constant state of readiness for extreme and extended operation he watched now as they automatically engaged and began pushing the ship into the channel that led to the sea above in the command center armored panels slid noiselessly apart revealing a large window on the forward bulkhead the murmur among the men and women gazing intently at the lights of the city was quiet as though the men manning the cuban defense systems could hear their words cabrillo spotted another ship leaving the harbor ahead of them what ship is that he asked one of the team pulled up the list of ship arrivals and departures on his computer monitor shes a chinese registered cargo vessel carrying sugar to hangchou he reported shes leaving port nearly an hour ahead of her scheduled departure time name asked cabrillo in english the red dawn the shipping line is owned by the chinese army turn out all the outer lights and increase speed until we are close astern of the vessel ahead he commanded the computer well use her as a decoy to lead us out the outer deck and navigation lights blinked out leaving the ship in darkness as she narrowed the gap between the two vessels the lights inside the command center dimmed to a bluegreen glow by the time the red dawn entered the ships channel and passed the first of the string of marker buoys the darkened oregon was trailing only fifty yards off her stern cabrillo kept his ship just far enough back so that the chinese vessels deck lights would not cast their beams on his bow it was a long shot but he was betting the silhouette of his ship would be mistaken for the shadow of the red dawn cabrillo glanced at a large twentyfourhour clock on the wall above the window just as the long minute hand clicked onto only twentyone minutes to go before the cubans defense systems test following the red dawn is slowing us down said linda were losing precious time cabrillo nodded youre right we cant wait any longer shes served her purpose he leaned over and spoke into the computers voice receiver go to full speed and pass the ship ahead like a small powerboat with big engines and a heavy hand on the throttles the oregon dug her stern into the forbidding water and lifted her bows clear of the waves as her thrusters erupted in a cloud of froth creating a vast crater in her wake she leaped down the channel and swept past the chinese cargo ship less than twenty feet away as if she were stopped dead in the water the chinese sailors could be seen staring in stunned disbelief faster and faster with each passing second she raced through the night speed was the oregons crowning achievement the thoroughbred heart of the vessel forty knots then fifty by the time she passed morro castle at the entrance to santiago she was making nearly sixtytwo knots no ship in the world that size could match her speed the beacon lights mounted high on the bluffs were soon little more than blinking specks on a black horizon the alarm spread quickly onshore that a ship was making an unauthorized departurebut the radar and fire control operators did not unleash their shoretosurface missiles their officers could not believe that such a large ship was moving at such an incredible rate of speed they assumed their radar systems were malfunctioning and they were reluctant to unleash missiles that they did not think could lock on to such an inconceivable target not until the oregon was twenty miles out to sea did a general in cuban security put two and two together and deduce that the sudden departure of the ship and the escape of the santa ursula prisoners were somehow tied together he ordered missiles fired at the fleeing ship but by the time the word filtered down through the sluggish command the oregon was out of acceptable range he then ordered jets from the cuban air force to intercept and sink the mystery ship before it reached the protection of a united states coast guard cutter it could not possibly escape he thought as he sat back lit a cigar and contentedly puffed a cloud of blue smoke toward the ceiling seventy miles away two geriatric migs were sent aloft and set a course toward the oregon as directed by cuban radar cabrillo didnt need to study a chart to see that sailing around the tip of cuba from santiago through the windward passage and then northwest to miami was little more than a suicide run for nearly six hundred miles the oregon would be less than fifty miles from the cuban coast a voyage in a shooting gallery his safest option was to set a course southwest around the southern tip of haiti and then almost due west to puerto rico which was a territory under the us flag there he could unload his passengers where they would be safe and cared for at proper medical facilities before being flown to florida two unidentified aircraft closing announced linda i have them murphy announced hunched over a console with enhanced radar screens and an array of knobs and switches can you identify asked linda computer reads them as a pair of migs how far out cabrillo probed sixty miles and closing murphy answered poor beggars dont know what theyre in for cabrillo turned to his communications expert hali kasim try and raise them in spanish warn them we have surfacetoair missiles on board and will knock them out of the sky if they show any sign of hostility kasim didnt have to speak spanish to deliver the warning he merely ordered the computer to translate his message over his radio which was tuned to twenty different frequencies after a couple of minutes he shook his head they are receiving but not responding they think were bluffing said linda keep trying then to murphy whats the range of their missiles according to specs theyre carrying shortrange rockets with a range of ten miles cabrillo looked solemn if they dont break off within thirty miles take them out better yet launch one of ours then manually guide it for a close flyby murphy made the necessary calculations and pressed a red button missile on its way an audible swoosh swept the command center as a rocket lifted from an opening in the foredeck and swept into the sky they all watched on the monitors as it raced to the northwest and soon disappeared four minutes to flyby said murphy every eye turned to the big clock above the window no one spoke all waiting in anticipation time dragged as the second hand on the clock seemed to take forever to make a sweep finally murphy spoke mechanically missile passed two hundred yards over and between the hostiles did they get the message asked cabrillo a slight tone of apprehension in his voice there was a long pause and then theyre turning for home murphy reported happily two cubans who are very lucky men indeed also smart enough to recognize a nowin situation indeed linda said with a broad smile no blood on our hands this day cabrillo said with an obvious sigh of relief he leaned over in his chair and spoke to the computer slow to cruise speed the clandestine operation was almost complete the contract fulfilled the oregon and her crew of executives did not consider themselves lucky their achievement had come from a combination of special skills expertise intelligence and precise planning now except for a technician to watch over the command center and the navigation systems everyone could relax some headed for their staterooms for welldeserved sleep while others congregated in the ships dining room to snack and wind down cabrillo retired to his teakpaneled cabin and removed a packet from a safe under the carpet mounted in the deck it was their next contract he pulled out the contents studied them for nearly an hour and then began planning the initial levels of tactics and strategy two and a half days later the oregon sailed into the port of san juan puerto rico and discharged the cuban exiles before the sun set the remarkable ship and its strange crew of corporate officials were once again at sea on a course toward their next assignment before it was through they would steal a priceless artifact return a divine leader to power and free a nation but when the oregon left port cabrillo was not on board he was winging his way east against a rising sun the burgundy falcon ex left heathrow at just after six in the morning arriving in geneva around half past nine swiss time the jet aircraft cruised at mach with a mile range it cost million winston spenser was its sole occupant after arriving at geneva international airport in cointrin spenser was met by a chauffeured rollsroyce that delivered him to the hotel there he was immediately taken to a suite without having to register once in his room spenser took a few minutes to freshen up standing in front of the bevelededge mirror he stared at his image spensers nose was long and patrician his eyes pale blue and distant and his skin in need of a tan neither his cheeks nor his chin were very defined truth be told his image always appeared to be slightly out of focus as if lacking character his was not the face of a man others would follow it was the face of a highpriced minion when he finished his examination he placed his expensive cologne back in a burberry toiletry bag then left the room to get a midmorning meal the art auction he was in geneva for was due to start soon will mr spenser require anything else the waiter asked spenser stared for a moment at the remains of his meal and said no i think that will be all the waiter nodded removed the plates then took a brush from his apron and whisked up the few crumbs on the table then he silently retreated no bill was presented no money changed hands the cost of the breakfast and the gratuity would appear on the room charge which spenser would never see in the far corner of the dining room michael talbot stared toward spenser talbot an art dealer from san francisco had crossed paths with spenser before three times in the last year the stodgy britisher had outbid talbots clients for spensers own clients seemed to have unlimited resources talbot could only hope today would be different spenser was dressed in a gray suit over a sweater vest a blue polkadot bow tie around his neck his black laceup leather shoes were highly polished as were his fingernails and his neatly styled short hair was flecked with gray as befitted his age which talbot estimated at close to sixty years once when talbot had been in london on business hed tried to visit spensers shop there was no telephone number available the small stone building had had no name outside and aside from an unobtrusive video camera above the buzzer it could have been suspended in time from a hundred years before talbot had pushed the buzzer twice but no one had answered spenser sensed talbot staring his way but only glanced at him out of the corner of his eye of the other seven men spenser had determined had an interest in the artifact hed come to purchase the american would probably bid the highest talbots buyer was a silicon valley software billionaire with a penchant for asian art and argumentation the billionaires belligerency could only help spenser the mans ego might take him beyond his set price but as the competition stiffened he traditionally became angry and dropped out the new rich are so predictable spenser thought he rose to return to his room the auction was not until pm lot thirtyseven the auctioneer said with reverence the golden buddha a large mahogany crate was wheeled onto the podium and the auctioneer reached for the clasp holding the door closed the audience of bidders was small this was a highly secret auction and the invitations had only gone out to the select few who could afford to pay for art masterworks with somewhat shady histories spenser had yet to bid on anything lot twentyone a degas bronze that he knew had been stolen out of a museum twelve years ago had appealed to him but the bidding had gone higher than his south american client had authorized him to pay more and more spenser was weaning himself away from clients on a budget even if the stop price ran into the millions the auction today was the first step in his plan for retirement the auctioneer opened the door to the crate at the same time that spenser pushed a button on the miniaturized satellite telephone in his vest pocket he spoke into the tiny microphone clasped to his lapel please tell your employer they have the object on display he said to an aide thousands of miles away he asks if it is everything youd hoped the aide asked spenser stared at the massive gold statue as a hush fell over the crowd everything and more spenser said quietly a few seconds passed as the aide relayed the information he said at all costs it will be an honor spenser said as he thought back on the history the golden buddha dated from when the rulers of what would later become vietnam commissioned the work to celebrate their victory over the forces of kublai khan five hundred and ninetysix pounds of solid gold mined in laos had been formed into a sixfoot likeness of the enlightened one chunks of jade from siam had formed the eyes while a ring of burmese rubies wound around the neck buddhas potbelly had been outlined in sapphires from thailand and his belly button was a large rounded opal that glowed iridescently the icon had been given as a gift to the first dalai lama in the year for years the golden buddha had remained in a monastery in tibet and then accompanied the dalai lama into exile while being transported with the dalai lama on a trip to the united states for display however it had disappeared from the airport in manila president ferdinand marcos had always been the prime suspect since then the ownership had always remained cloudy until suddenly it had mysteriously reappeared for the auction the sellers identity would remain an enigma while it was almost impossible to place a value on such a rare artifact that was exactly what was about to happen the preauction estimates had conservatively placed the value at between million and million we will start the bidding at fifty million us dollars the auctioneer said a low starting point spenser thought the gold alone was worth twice that it was the history not the beauty that made it a priceless piece of art must be the weak world economic climate spenser concluded we have fifty million the auctioneer said now sixty talbot raised his paddle as the bid hit eighty eighty now ninety the auctioneer said in a monotone spenser glanced across the room at talbot typical american ear on a satellite telephone paddle in his hand as if he were worried the auctioneer would miss his signal ninety now a hundred the auctioneer droned the hundred bid was from a south african dealer spenser knew the dealers patron had made his fortune in diamonds spenser admired the womantheyd shared a glass of sherry more than oncebut he also knew her patrons habits when the value exceeded what he felt he could sell it for later hed drop out the man loved art but he only bought at his price and if he could someday make a profit one hundred ten million came from the rear of the room spenser turned to stare at the bidder the mans age was hard to determine but if spenser had to hazard a guess hed pick the low side of sixty based primarily on the bidders flowing gray hair and beard two things were odd though spenser knew practically everyone in the room at least by sight or reputation but this man was an unknown and he seemed totally unconcerned as if he were bidding on a weekend trip to a spa at a local charity auction instead of tendering a bid in the amount of a small countrys yearly budget the man was obviously qualifiedthe auction company would have made sure of thatbut who was he one hundred twenty from a german pharmaceutical magnate one twenty now one thirty talbot again waving his paddle like a landing semaphore the bidding began to stall at million bid again by the grayhaired man spenser turned again and felt a touch of apprehension the man was staring directly into his eyes then the man winked a chill ran down spensers spine he turned to the side where he could see talbot talking animatedly into his telephone he could sense then that the silicon valley billionaire was flagging tell him spenser whispered in his phone its slowed at one fifty with maybe one more bid still forthcoming he wants to know if youve bid yet no spenser said but they know im here spenser had bought from the auctioneer many times the man had been watching him like a hawk any smile flinch or gesture of his would be taken as a bid he asks that you bid two hundred the aide relayed and blow them out acknowledged spenser said then in almost slow motion he placed two spread apart fingers to his lips the bid is two hundred million the auctioneer said emotionlessly a raise of fifty million when the auctioneer was begging for ten i have two hundred million in the room the auctioneer said quietly anyone in for two hundred ten the room was as silent as a tomb spenser turned to the rear of the room the grayhaired man had vanished two hundred going once the auctioneer said going twice fair warning he paused again sold two hundred million plus buyers premium a stunning buy it is the room which had been silent now rippled with contained applause spenser stayed another half hour to arrange the crating and security to the airport and by five that night he was flying east for delivery for security purposes spenser had chartered a plane that could not be traced to the macau billionaire who was his client the company was full serviceit would both transport him to asia as well as facilitate the delivery of the artifact to its new home by armored car he was almost home free six days after depositing the cubans in san juan the oregon had rounded the cape of good hope inside the control room the seas beyond the bow were projected on a highdefinition fourbyeightfoot screen there was little to see the sun was dipping in the west and the oregon was in an empty part of the indian ocean where few cargo ships steamed twenty minutes ago hali kasim had caught a glimpse of a blue whale triggering the underwater sensors kasim made a record of the mass of the beast then began to scan his data banks for a match shes a new one kasim said franklin lincoln the huge pitchblack man who was sharing duties in the control room stared up from his game of computer solitaire you need to find a different hobby it passes the time kasim noted so does this lincoln said and it barely uses any computer power a buzzer sounded then the ship slowed and went dead in the water from the north a black amphibious plane approached made a pass over the oregon to check the direction of the wind by the flag on the flagstaff then gracefully dropped into the water and taxied alongside the chairman has arrived kasim noted once safely aboard the oregon juan rodriguez cabrillo made his way to his stateroom walking inside he shut the door tossed the bag containing his gray wig and fake beard on the bed then kicked off his shoes and started unbuttoning his shirt as he made his way to the head unlike most ships where the bathroom facilities are almost an afterthought his was large and opulent a sunken copper tub with jets sat against the side of the hull with a brasslined rectangular porthole giving a view of the water outside angled next to the tub was a separate shower decorated with mexican tile along the bulkhead toward the bow was a cabinet containing a copper sink with drawers beneath the floor was dark hardwood with thick cotton throw rugs a recessed toilet was set back in the bulkhead across from the sink and a philippine carved mahogany sitting bench graced one wall cabrillo stared at his image in the mirror above the sink his blond crewcut hair was in need of a trim and he made a mental note to schedule an appointment with the ships barber who also doubled as a masseuse his skin had a light pallor the result of stress he knew and his eyes showed red from the strain he was tired and his joints felt stiff sitting on the mahogany bench he slid off his trousers and stared down at his prosthetic leg the leg was the third he had owned since he had lost it in a naval battle with the chinese destroyer chengdo when the corporation had been covering a numa operation in hong kong but it was a good oneit worked almost as well as the one he had lost rising he walked over and began to draw a bath in the copper tub while the bath filled he shaved at the sink and brushed his teeth then removed the prosthetic limb and climbed into the water as he soaked his thoughts drifted back cabrillo came from a family that had descended from the first explorer to discover california but despite his spanish surname he looked more like a malibu surf rat than a conquistador hed been raised in orange county by an uppermiddleclass family california in the s had seen wild times filled with sex and drugs but cabrillo had never drifted that way by his nature hed been both conservative and patriotic almost a throwback when everyone he knew was growing long hair hed kept his short and well groomed when clothing tastes had run toward torn denim and tshirts his wardrobe had remained neat and presentable but this had not been his own form of protest against the time it was just who he was and even today he was still a bit of a clotheshorse in college hed majored in political science and had been an active member of his universitys rotc program so it was not a surprise when the cia had offered him a job at graduation juan cabrillo was just what they were seeking in new agents he was bright without being bookish stable without being boring and flexible without being outlandish trained in spanish russian and arabic hed proved a master at disguise and stealth inserted into a country he could read the pulse of the people instinctively fearless but controlled within a few short years hed become a valuable asset then came nicaragua teamed with another agent he and his partner had been ordered to stem the growth of the procommunist sandinistas and at first cabrillo had made inroads but within a year the situation had spun out of control it was the oldest story in the worldtoo many chiefs and not enough indians chiefs in washington calling the shots native indians in nicaragua paying the price and when bombs had burst the fallout had blown back in their faces cabrillo had been one of the fall guys and hed taken the hit for his partner now the partner high up the ladder at the cia was repaying the favor the man had been funneling jobs to the corporation almost since their inception but hed yet to offer one with a potential payday this large and all cabrillo and his team needed to do was to accomplish the impossible while cabrillo finished his bath and got dressed kasim and lincoln continued their watch by the time they were relieved at midnight kasim would log one more whale lincoln would have played thirtytwo games of klondike and both men would have read three of the magazines that had been loaded aboard in san juan lincoln tended to aviation periodicals kasim automobile digests quite frankly there was little work for the two menthe oregon ran herself thirty minutes laterclean and dressed in tan slacks a starched white shirt and a bill blass blazerjuan rodriguez cabrillo was sitting at the large mahogany conference table in the corporate meeting room linda ross was across the table sipping a diet coke eddie seng sat next to ross flipping through a stack of papers mark murphy was farther down the table stroking a throwing knife against a leather strap murphy found the action relaxing and he tested the edge against a piece of paper how did the auction go max hanley asked the target brought two hundred million cabrillo said easily wow ross said thats a hefty price at the end of the table in front of a bank of floortoceiling monitors that were currently blank michael halpert turned on a laser pointer then pressed the remote for the monitors he waited for cabrillo who nodded for him to start the job came from washington to our lawyer in vaduz liechtenstein a standard performance contract half now half on delivery five million of the tenmilliondollar fee has already been received it was washed through our bank in vanuatu then transferred to south africa and used to purchase gold bullion as we all agreed it seems murphy said shaving off a sliver of paper with the knife that after all those machinations we should just steal the golden buddha for ourselves it would save us a hell of a lot of time and effort either way we end up with the gold wheres your corporate pride cabrillo said smiling knowing murphy was joking but making the point anyway we have our reputation to consider the first time we screw a client the word would get out then what i havent seen any want ads for mercenary sailors lately you havent been looking in the right newspapers seng said grinning try the manila times or the bulgarian bugle thats the problem with stealing objects out of history books ross noted theyre tough to resell i know a guy in greece murphy said who would buy the mona lisa cabrillo waved his hands all right back to business a map of the world filled the main monitor and halpert pointed to their destination as a crow flies its over ten thousand miles from puerto rico to this location he noted by sea its a lot farther were going to run up the costs just getting there cabrillo said do we have any other jobs lined up in that part of the world after we finish with this nothing yet halpert admitted but im working on it i did however require the lawyer to include a bonus if we deliver the object by a certain date how much and when cabrillo asked the bonus is another million halpert said the date is march thirtyfirst why march thirtyfirst cabrillo asked because thats when they plan to have the leader return to his people ah good all right so we have a total of seven days three of which will be spent traveling that gives us four days to break into a secure building steal a gold artifact that weighs six hundred pounds then transport it nearly twentyfive hundred miles to a mountain country that most people have only heard about in school halpert nodded sounds like fun cabrillo said chuck tiny gunderson was dining on sausage and slabs of cheddar cheese as he steered the citation x and watched the mountains that lay below gunderson carried nearly pounds on his sixfeetfour frame and had played tackle at the university of wisconsin before graduating and getting recruited by the defense intelligence agency gundersons experience with the dia had enhanced his love of flying which hed transferred into his job later in the private sector right now however gunderson was wishing he could have a bottle of beer with his lunch instead he finished a warm bottle of blenheims ginger ale to wash it all down checking the gauges every few minutes he found them all in the green mr citation is happy he said as he patted the automatic control switch and checked his course spenser made his way forward to the cockpit knocked on the door and opened it has your company made arrangements with the armored car to meet us at the airport in macau dont worry gunderson said theyve taken care of everything the port of aomen was bustling sampans and trading barges shared the sealanes with modern cargo ships and a few highperformance pleasure crafts the wind was blowing from land to sea and the smell of wood cooking fires on mainland china mixed with the scent of spices being offloaded twelve miles out in the south china sea and only minutes from landing gunderson received clearance for final approach spenser stared at the golden buddha strapped down on the floor across the aisle at the same instant juan cabrillo was enjoying an espresso after a meal of chateaubriand mixed vegetables a cheese plate and baked alaska for dessert he held a napkin to his mouth as he talked from the head table in the ships dining salon we have a man on the ground in macau he said hell arrange transportation once we have acquired the buddha whats his plan hanley asked hes not sure yet cabrillo admitted but he always comes up with something seng was next to speak ive retrieved detailed maps of the port streets and entire city seng said both the port and the airport are less than a mile from where we believe the golden buddha will be taken thats a good twist of luck linda ross said the entire countrys only seven square miles seng said are we planning to anchor offshore mark murphy asked cabrillo simply nodded then i need gps numbers for the entire country murphy noted just in case another hour would pass as the corporate officers hashed out details om the man said quietly om the man who would benefit the most from the return of the golden buddha had no idea of the maelstrom of activity surrounding him he was meditating in a tranquil rock garden outside a home in beverly hills california now nearing seventy years old he seemed not to age as did ordinary men instead the passage of time had simply molded him into a more complete human being in the chinese forced him to flee his own country for india in hed received the nobel peace prize for his continued work toward the nonviolent freeing of his homeland in a world where a hundredyearold house was considered historic this man was believed to be the fourteenth incarnation of an ancient spiritual leader at this instant the dalai lama was traveling on the winds of his mind back to home winston spenser was tired and irritable he had not had any rest since leaving london and the dreariness of travel and his age were catching up to him once the citation x had rolled to a stop on the far end of the field he waited while the pilot made his way to the door and extended the stairs then he climbed out the armored car was only feet away with the rear doors open to each side of the vehicle was a guard in black uniform with a holstered weapon they looked about as friendly as a lynch mob one of the men approached wheres the object he asked directly in a crate inside the main cabin spenser said the man motioned to his partner who walked over at just that instant gunderson climbed down the stairs who are you one of the guards asked im the pilot back in the cockpit until were finished hey gunderson started to say as the larger of the two men grabbed his arm and shoved him into the cockpit and slammed the door then the two men eased the crate onto a roller ramp to the ground they pushed the crate on the ramp right into the truck two men couldnt lift it once it was inside the truck was pulled forward so they could shut the doors one of the guards was locking the doors when gunderson reappeared you can be sure this will be reported he said to the guard but the guard just smiled slightly and walked forward to climb into the passenger seat ama temple the driver said out the window yes spenser said the guard pointed to a dark green mercedesbenz limousine parked nearby youre supposed to follow us in that rolling up the window the driver placed the armored car in gear and started driving spenser climbed into the limousine and set off in pursuit the armored car and the limousine carrying spenser crossed the macautaipa bridge went around the cloverleaf passed the hotel lisboa and headed up infante d henrique until the name changed and the road became san mo la or the new road on the west end of the island they reached the intersection of rua das lorchas and headed south along the waterfront the waterfront was like a scene from an adventure movie junks and sampans floated on the water while the street along the water was crammed with shops displaying everything from plucked chickens to silver opium pipes tourists stood snapping pictures while buyers and sellers negotiated prices in the singsong staccato of cantonese at the fork with rua do almirante sergio the caravan veered slightly left drove past the bus terminal then entered the grounds of the ama temple the temple was the oldest in macau dating from the fourteenth century and it sat on a densely wooded hill with a view of the water the complex held a total of five shrines linked by winding pebbled paths the smell of incense was in the air as spenser climbed from the limousine and walked to the armored car at just that instant someone lit a coil firecracker to chase away the evil spirits he instinctively ducked staring up at the drivers open window you okay sir the driver asked yes spenser said sheepishly rising again to his full height i need to step inside for a moment if you will just wait here the driver nodded and spenser walked up the path entering the ama temple spenser walked to a rear room he knew the leader of the monks used as an office and knocked on the door the door opened and a shavenheaded man dressed in a yellow robe stood smiling mr spenser he said youve come for your crate yes spenser said the monk rang a bell and two more monks appeared from another room mr spenser is here for the crate i spoke about the head monk told them hell explain what to do a large donation to the temple had ensured that his decoy would remain here until needed a wellplaced lie would solve the rest i have a gilded buddha outside id like to display for a time spenser said smiling at the monk do you have a space to put it certainly the monk said bring it inside twenty minutes later the switch had taken place the golden buddha was now hiding in plain sight thirty minutes and less than a mile away the armored car made its final delivery of the day after the guards were dispatched spenser stood with the macau billionaire staring at the object its more than i could have hoped for the billionaire said but less than you think spenser thought im glad you like it now we celebrate the billionaire said smiling silver platters of delicacies littered the long cherrywood table in the palatial dining room of the mans estate spenser had passed on the monkey meat as well as the sea urchin and settled on poultry in a peanut sauce still the spicy side dishes were wreaking havoc with his travelweary stomach and he just wished the night would end spenser sat at the far end of the table the owner at the head a total of six concubines were seated three to a side in the middle after a dessert of wild berry mousse cigars and cognac the man rose from his seat shall we take a soak winston he said and allow the ladies to do their job the man had no idea he would possess the faux golden buddha for less than a week and winston spenser had no way to know he had less than a fortnight to live langston overholt iv sat in his office in langley virginia his hips rested in a tall leather chair sideways to the desk in his hand was a black racquetball paddle its handle wrapped with white cloth tape stained by sweat slowly and methodically he hit a black rubber ball two feet in the air and then back down to the racquet every fourth hit he flipped the racquet over to change sides the rhythmic action helped him think overholt was thin without being scrawny more lean and sinewy than bony one hundred and sixtyfive pounds graced his sixfootoneinch frame with skin stretched tight over muscles that were long and squared rather than rounded and plump his face was handsome in a rugged way rectangular in shape with hard edges abounding his hair was blond with just a touch of gray starting to appear at the temples and he had it trimmed every two weeks at the cia barbershop inside the compound overholt was a runner hed started the practice as a senior in high school when the craze had swept the country fueled by the jim fixx book the complete runner throughout college and graduate school hed kept up the practice marriage joining the cia divorce and remarriage had not slowed down his obsession running was one of the few things that relieved the stress of his job stress was overholts other constant since joining the cia in fresh out of graduate school hed served under six different directors now for the first time in decades langston overholt iv had a chance to make his fathers promise to the dalai lama a reality while at the same time repaying his old friend juan cabrillo he was wasting no time in moving his plans forward just then his telephone buzzed sir his assistant said its the ddo hed like to meet with you as soon as possible overholt reached for the phone the weather in washington dc was as hot as texas asphalt and as steamy as a bowl of green chili inside the white house the air conditioners were set as high as they would go but they just couldnt drop the temperature below seventyfive degrees the presidents home was aging and there was just so much adaptation you could make to an old building and still retain the historical structure has there ever been an official photograph of the president sitting in the oval office in a tshirt the president joked ill check sir said the aide who had just led the cia director inside thank you john the president said dispatching the man the president reached across the desk and shook the directors hand as the aide closed the door to leave the men alone the president motioned for him to be seated these aides i have are sharp as tacks the president noted as he sat down but short on a sense of humor the kids probably checking with the white house historian as we speak if it was anyone the director said smiling id guess lbj when youre seventeen years old and you know the director of the central intelligence agency the spy game seems pretty cool when you later become president you really have a chance to see what happens time had not diminished his enthusiasmthe president still found the intelligence game fascinating what have you got for me the president asked tibet the director said without preamble the president nodded then adjusted a fan on his desk so that the breeze swept evenly across both men explain the cia director reached into his briefcase and removed some documents then he laid out the plan in beijing president hu jintao was studying documents that showed the true state of the chinese economy the picture was grim the race to modernization had required more and more petroleum and the chinese had yet to locate any significant new reserves inside their borders the situation had not been such a problem a few years earlier when the price of oil had been at twenty year lows but with the recent price spike upward the higher costs were wreaking havoc adding to the problem were the japanese whose thirst for oil had led to a price competition the chinese could not hope to win jintao stared out the window the air was clearer than usual todaya light wind was blowing the smoke from the factories away from central beijingbut the wind was not so strong as to blow away the soot that had landed on the windowsill jintao watched as a sparrow landed on the sill the birds tiny feet made tracks in the powder the bird fluttered around for a few seconds then stopped and peered in the window and looked directly toward jintao how would you cut costs jintao said to the bird and where do we find oil theoregon swept past the paracel islands under a pitchblack night sky the air was liquid with rain that fell in sheets the wind was blowing in gusts without firm direction or purpose for several minutes it would rake the oregon amidships then quickly change to blow bow on or stern first the soggy flags on the stern were pivoting on their staffs as fast as a determined boy scout trying to light a fire with a stick inside the control room franklin lincoln stared at the radar screen the edge of the storm began petering out just before the ship passed the twentydegree latitude line walking over to a computer terminal in the control room he entered commands and waited while the satellite images of the chinese coastline loaded a haze of smog could be seen over hong kong and macau he glanced over at hali kasim who was sharing the night shift kasim was sound asleep his feet up on the control panel his mouth was partially opened kasim could sleep through a hurricane lincoln thought or in this part of the ocean a cyclone at the same time the oregon was steaming east winston spenser awoke startled earlier in the evening he had visited the golden buddha at ama the icon was still in the mahogany crate sitting upright door opened in the room where it had been taken spenser had gone alone simple common sense dictated that as few people as possible know the actual location but hed found the experience unnerving spenser knew the icon was nothing more than a mass of precious metal and stones but for some strange reason the object seemed to have a life force the chunk of gold appeared to glow in the dim room as if illuminated by a light from within the large jade eyes seemed to follow his every move and while its visage might appear benign to someonly that of a potbellied smiling prophetto spenser the image seemed to be mocking him as if he had not known it before earlier in the evening spenser had become certain that what he had done was not a stroke of genius the golden buddha was not some canvas dabbed with paintit was the embodiment of reverence crafted with love and respect and spenser had swiped it like a candy in a drugstore the dalai lama listened to the slow flow of water over the smooth stones while he meditated on the far reaches of his mind was static and he willed the disturbance to clear he could see the ball of light in the center of his skull but the edges were rough and pulsating slowly he smoothed the signals and the ball began to collapse in on itself until only a pinpoint of white light remained then he began to scan his physical shell there was a disturbance and it was growing eighteen minutes later he came back into his shell and rose to his feet eight yards away sitting under a green canvas awning alongside the kidneyshaped pool on the estate in beverly hills was his chikyah kenpo the dalai lama walked over the hollywood actor who was his host smiled and rose to his feet it is time for me to go home the dalai lama said there was no pleading or disagreement from the actor your holiness he said let me call for my jet in the north of tibet on the border between utsang and amdo province the basatongwula shan mountains towered over the plains the peak was a snowcapped sentinel watching over an area where few men trod to the untrained eye the lands around basatongwula shan looked barren and desolate a wasteland best left alone and deserted on the surface this may have been true but underneath hidden for centuries was a secret known only by a few a yak walked slowly along a rocky path on his back was a black mynah bird that remained silent as he hitched a ride slowly at first but growing in intensity a light tremor rippled across the land the yak began to shake in fear causing the bird to take to the air digging his cloven hooves into the soil he stood firm as the land trembled then slowly the disruption passed and the earth stilled the yak resumed his journey within minutes the fur on his legs and lower body was covered with a haze from a mineral that over countless generations had made some men rich and others go mad vice president of operations richard truitt was still awake his body clock had yet to adjust and his night was still macaus day logging on to his computer he checked for messages one had been sent by cabrillo a few hours before like every email he received from the chairman this one was short confirmation received from the home of george all systems go eta hours the cia was still in and the oregon would arrive in less than two days time truitt had a lot of work to complete in a short span calling down to the hotels twenty fourhour room service he ordered a meal of bacon and eggs then he walked into the bathroom to shave shower and pick his disguise juan cabrillo finished the last bite of an omelet filled with applesmoked bacon and gorgonzola cheese then pushed the plate away its a wonder we all dont weigh three hundred pounds he said the jalapeño cheese grits alone were worth waking up for hanley noted i just wish the chef would have consulted with my exwife i might still be married hows the divorce going cabrillo asked pretty good hanley admitted considering my reported income last year was only thirty thousand dollars just be fair cabrillo cautioned i dont want any lawyers snooping around you know i will hanley said as he refilled their coffee cups from a silver thermal carafe on the table im just waiting for jeanie to calm down cabrillo lifted his cup of coffee and then stood up were less than twentyfour hours from port how are things going in the magic shop most of the props are constructed and im starting on the disguises excellent cabrillo said do you have any preferences for your look hanley asked try to keep the facial hair to a minimum cabrillo said it can be muggy in macau hanley rose from the table sahib your wish is my command when the oregon had been refitted by the corporation in the shipyard in odessa two decks had been installed inside the hull giving the interior a total of three levels not including the raised pilothouse the lowest level housed the engines and physical plants along with the moon pool machine shops armory and storage rooms one level above reached by metal stairs or the single heavylift elevator amidships was the deck containing communications weapon systems a variety of shops and offices a large library a computer room and a map room the third level housed the dining room recreation rooms a full gym plus crew cabins and meeting and boardrooms level three was surrounded by a two lane running track for exercise the oregon was a city unto itself hanley walked from the dining room and across the running track then eschewed the elevators for the stairs opening the door he started down the stairway was paneled with mahogany and lit by sconces at the bottom hanley stepped onto a thick carpet in a room with insets in the walls that held plaques and medals awarded by grateful customers and nations to the men and women of the oregon he made his way forward toward the bow until the walls in the hallway turned to glass on the port side behind the glass was what could have passed for a hollywood costume and set shop kevin nixon raised his head and waved hanley opened the door to the shop and entered it was cool inside and the air was scented with the smells of grease vinyl and wax a willie nelson cd was seeping from hidden speakers how long have you been here hanley asked nixon was sitting on a threelegged stool in front of a metalframed woodtopped workbench that had a ring of hand tools around the perimeter in his hands he held an ornamental headdress with silken gold fabric that flowed down his right side to the floor two hours he said i woke up early checked my email and got the preliminary specs did you eat breakfast hanley asked i just grabbed some fruit nixon said i need to drop ten pounds or so nixon was a big man but he carried his weight well if you saw him on the street you would think him stocky but not fat but he was in a constant battle his weight running from pounds to depending on his vigilance last summer when hed taken a few weeks off and hiked the appalachian trail hed gotten down to but his sedentary life aboard ship and the charms of the chefs cooking had caught up to him hanley walked over to the bench and stared at nixons work thats religious garb for a macanese in a good friday parade it is well need a total of six sets hanley said nixon nodded i figured two shaman and four penitents hanley walked over to the wall where several more benches were abutting the bulkhead im going to start on the masks nixon nodded and reached for a remote control for the cd player he punched a button and willie stopped johnny riverss secret agent man began to play kevin hanley said easily you just love to do that dont you theres a man who lives a life of danger nixon sang in a baritone truitt sent a map showing the parade route for good friday cabrillo said we lucked outtraffic in the downtown area will be at a standstill eddie seng reached across the table for one of the folders its surprising that the chinese would have such a large celebration for something that concerns christianity macau was a portuguese possession from until linda ross noted roughly thirty thousand of the population is catholic plus the chinese love festivals mark murphy said theyll form a parade at the drop of a hat truitt said they are going to do the same as last year and put on a massive fireworks display over the city cabrillo said fired from a series of barges in the bay so the cover of night and a waning moon no longer apply franklin lincoln noted lincolns friend hali kasim couldnt resist a real shame frankieyou blend in so well when the sky is dark lincoln turned toward kasim and brushed his nose with his middle finger thats okay kaz the fireworks also make it harder for you lilywhite hugh grant types theres still the question of weight cabrillo said ignoring the exchange the golden buddha weighs six hundred pounds four men on each side could lift that weight without too much strain on their backs julia huxley said i think ill have hanley and nixon fabricate something cabrillo said any suggestions the crew continued planning the operationmacau was just about a days sail away the chairman of the tibet autonomous region legchog raidi zhuren was reading a report on the fighting just across the border in nepal last night government forces had killed nearly three hundred maoist insurgents the ferocity of the attacks on the communist rebels had been increasing since spring after several years of growing rebel activity the nepalese government had begun to feel threatened and finally started to take firm action the united states had sent army green beret advisors to the area to coordinate strikes and almost immediately the body count had begun to grow to prevent the fighting from spilling over across the border into tibet zhuren had needed to call beijing for additional troops to station them on the high mountain passes that led from nepal to tibet president jintao had not been happy about the development in the first place the cost to secure tibet was increasing at a time the president wanted to cut costs in the second place the special forces advisors added a dimension of danger to the mission if a single american soldier was wounded or killed by chinese forces protecting the tibet border jintao was worried the situation might spiral out of control and china would be embroiled in another korea what legchog zhuren did not know was that jintao was starting to consider tibet more of a liability than an asset the timing was criticalif the tibetan people launched a popular uprising right now china might have another tiananmen square on its hands and the world mood was not the same as in with the fall of communism in the soviet union and their increasingly close relations with the united states any heavyhanded action against the tibetan population might be met with force from two fronts american forces could be launched from carriers in the bay of bengal and from bases in occupied afghanistan while russian ground forces could sweep in from the republics of kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan as well as the area of far eastern russia where it bordered northern tibet then there would be a freeforall and for what a small poor mountain country china had illegally occupied the reward didnt equal the risk jintao needed to find faceand he needed it fast winston spenser took his pen to paper to tally his illgotten gains the percent commission on the original million sale of the golden buddha was million this was hardly a small sum in fact it was just over five times spensers income last yearbut it was a drop in the bucket compared to the money he was about to collect for selling it again in the first place against the million commission check he had the cost of the decoy the fabricators in thailand had charged nearly a million for that in the second place the company hed had hired in geneva to transport the golden buddha to macau and provide armoredcar service to ama had charged too much a flat fee of million for their services while spenser had quoted the billionaire a cost of onetenth of that so as not to arouse suspicion bribes now and in the next few days when spenser was planning to transport the original out of macau and into the united states would run him another million or so as a result right at this instant for all practical purposes spenser was broke the art dealer had tapped all his available savings and business lines of credit to fund his nefarious operationif he didnt have the commission check lying before him on the table hed be in trouble if spenser had not been completely certain he had a buyer for the golden buddha he might be worried tearing the slip of paper from the pad he tore the note into tiny pieces tossed the pieces in the toilet and flushed then he poured himself half a glass of scotch to calm his trembling hands it had taken spenser a lifetime to build his reputationand if his crime was known it would be gone in seconds money and gold can make men do strange things threequarters of the way across the globe and sixteen time zones distant it was almost midnight and the silicon valley software billionaire was passing his time making changes to his newest yacht the blueprints for the massive footlong vessel had been created on a computer designed on a computer and refined on a computer each individual piece could be highlighted and changed all the way down to the screws that attached the thirty toilets to the deck right now the billionaire was playing around with the furnishings and upholstery and his ego was running rampant the computer would generate a fullbodied hologram of him to welcome guests to the main deck salon and that had been a cool touch but at this instant he was deciding what font would be best for his initials which were to be sewn into the fabric on all the couches and chairs a few years ago hed bought himself a minor british title that had come complete with a coat of arms so he inserted the script hed selected into the emblem then overlaid that onto the fabric a cameo of my face might look better he thought as he stared at the royal crest then people could sit on my face the idea brought a smile he was still smiling when his philippine houseboy entered the room master he said slowly im sorry to bother you but you have a longdistance telephone call from overseas did they say their name he asked he said he was a friend of the fat golden one the man said put him through the billionaire said smiling at once the time was just before four in the afternoon in macau and while he waited for the software billionaire to come online spenser was fiddling with a voice alteration device that he had placed over his satellite telephone he had placed a new battery in the device and the tiny light was blinking green but still he questioned if the scrambler would work as advertised yo the billionaire said as he came on the line what have you got for me are you still interested in owning the golden buddha a mechanicalsounding voice asked sure the billionaire said at the same time he input commands into the computer hooked to his telephone to counter the effects of the scrambler but not at two hundred million i was thinkingthe mans voice was scrambled but then the computer did its magic and the voice cleareda price of one hundred million a british accent the software billionaire thought talbot had told him a british dealer had made the successful bid for the buddha and maybe he had acquired it for a british collectorbut that made no sense no one would buy something for million only to offer it a few days later for half that the dealer must have pulled the old switcherooor he was offering a fake how do i know what you are offering is real the software billionaire asked do you have someone who can date gold spenser asked i can find someone the billionaire said then ill send you a sliver of metal along with a videotape of me removing it from the bottom of the artifact the gold used in the buddha was mined in i know the history the billionaire said cutting him off how are you going to send the sample ill fedex it this evening spenser said the billionaire reeled off an address then asked if it checks out in what form will you want payment ill accept a wire transfer of american dollars to an account ill specify at the time of the transfer spenser said sounds reasonable the billionaire said ill set it up tonight one more thing though the billionaire added i just hope youre better at stealing than you are at picking electronics your choice in voicealteration equipment is secondrateyour accent is as british as beans on toast and that gives me a pretty good idea of who you are spenser stared at the flashing green light in disgust but said nothing so just remember the billionaire finished if you try and screw mei can be real unpleasant full stop hanley ordered the oregon had crossed the outer edge of the harbor just after am and picked up the pilot several containerized ships leaving port had slowed their progress and the trip to a mooring buoy in the water just off the main portion of the port had required most of the next hour the time was just before noon when the vessel was finally secured cabrillo stood next to hanley at the helm and stared at the city which encircled the harbor the pilot had just left and he watched the stern of the boat retreating you dont think he noticed anything unusual cabrillo asked i think were okay hanley answered the corporations previous ship the oregon i had been involved in a sea battle off hong kong a few years before which had resulted in them sinking the chinese navy vessel chengdo if the chinese officials figured out this was the same crew that had sunk their multimilliondollar destroyer theyd all be hung as spies truitt arranged for us to receive our cover cargo the day after tomorrow cabrillo said scanning the sheet of paper on a clipboard that listed the operational plans youre going to love thisits a load of fireworks bound for cabo san lucas the oregon delivering fireworks hanley said quietly it seems so fitting the executive jet terminal in honolulu was plush without being ostentatious it was cool inside the air conditioning maintaining an even seventy degrees the smokedglass windows gave the lobby a clear view of the runways and langston overholt iv passed the time watching a series of private jets appear in the night sky and then touch down and taxi over to the refueling area near private hangars overholt never saw the passengers of the jets they were either met by limousines or large black suvs on the tarmac then transferred to their locations or they stayed aboard while the jets were refueled and continued on their journies pilots or copilots came and wentstopping for weather briefings to use the restrooms to grab a cup of coffee or a pastry from a pantry to the side of the lobbybut for the most part it was quiet in a midevening lull overholt rose from the couch walked over to the pantry and poured a cup of coffee then was removing a banana from a fruit basket on the table when his telephone vibrated overholt he said quietly sir a voice a few thousand miles away said steadily tracking reports the target on final approach thank you overholt said as he disconnected then he peeled the banana ate it and walked over to the flight desk taking a leather badge cover from the breast pocket of his suit he flipped it open and handed it to the clerk the man quickly scanned the golden eagle then perused the id card showing overholts picture and title yes sir the clerk said i need to talk to the party on the falcon you have inbound for landing the man nodded and reached for a portable radio on his belt ill notify the ramp and call for a golf cart is there anything else you need overholt turned and stared out the window the light mist was turning to rain do you have an umbrella i can borrow the clerk was on the radio calling out to the ramp attendants and nodded at overholts request you can use mine the clerk said reaching under the counter and handing it across the desk overholt slipped his hand in his trouser pocket and removed a money clip then peeled off a fifty the cia would like to buy you dinner tonight he said smiling is this when you say you were never here the clerk said smiling in turn something like that overholt nodded the man pointed to the doors your golf cart is here outside the window the landing lights on the falcon jet reflected off the light rain and the wet surface as it lowered onto the runway with a chirp from the tires a truck with a flashing light bar mounted on the roof raced down an access road in hot pursuit the truck would lead the jet to the spot for refueling then overholt could board and ask the dalai lama if he was ready for the journey macau is a tiny country consisting of three small islands connected by causeways the farthest north is macau which houses the government buildings the middle island taipa has a manmade extension for the airport and runways and is connected to the main body of the island with a pair of roads and the farthest south island is coloane to the north and east of the country is the chinese mainland and to the west across the body of water known as zhujiang kou is hong kong formerly a portuguese colony the country had reverted to china in and was administered as a special region similar to hong kong the landmass of macau is a mere square miles or just under a sixth of the size of washington dc the population is estimated at around people the oregon was moored off coloane and nearest to international waters dick cabrillo said as he reached the top of the ladder leading from the shore boat to the pier how goes it mr chairman truitt said i think all is in order bob meadows and pete jones former navy seals and operational specialists along with security and surveillance expert linda ross followed once they were all on the pier truitt motioned to the van let me show you the layout truitt said quietly as they all entered the van truitt steered the van onto the milelong bridge that would take them to taipa it was quiet inside the van the only sound coming from the tires as they periodically crossed over the expansion joints this is taipa truitt said as the van reached the island two bridges lead to macau well take the shorter which is about a mile and a half long as truitt steered the van onto the second bridge cabrillo stared to the west across the water toward the other bridge and hong kong the road was crowded with trucks carrying cargo from the seaports and air terminal but the traffic was moving fast can the authorities seal off the bridges he asked there are no gates per se truitt said but they could easily station large trucks on the approaches and wed be in trouble the highrises on macau were becoming more visible through the windshield were not going to luck out and have the building located along the waterfront linda ross asked sorry linda truitt said glancing in the rearview mirror his home is on the hillside cabrillo was staring ahead at the mass of humanity and buildings as the van covered the final hundred yards over the bridge so if were caught making a run for it his voice trailed off truitt slowed the van and turned onto a crowded side street thats the score boss he said quietly how come we never steal things that are hidden in the middle of nowhere meadows asked because the stuff were paid to do never happens in an isolated area jones said smiling langston overholt had needed more time with the dalai lama to explain his proposal so hed made a quick call to washington then boarded the falcon flying against the sun had made the night last a long timeit was still dark when they stopped in manila to refuel lifting from the tarmac at manila international airport the pilot set a course skirting vietnam then over the southernmost strip of thailand above hat yai once he passed over thailand hed make a sweeping turn north over the andaman sea stop at rangoon for more fuel and then he could make it to punjab where the dalai lama would take a small plane the rest of the way to little lhasa his exile home in northern india once the jet reached cruising altitude overholt continued the conversation your father was a friend of mine the dalai lama said quietly so ive listened carefully to your proposal but you have yet to explain how we make the chinese simply hand back my country you know i cannot agree to this if there will be bloodshed the president feels if we enlist the russians help the threat of war might make the chinese back down their economy is in a pinch right nowthe cost to occupy your country is starting to mount so you believe the financial motive is sufficient the dalai lama asked it might help if you offered them the golden buddha overholt said saving his silver bullet for the last the dalai lama smiled like your father you are a fine man langston but in this case your information is faulty the golden buddha was stolen when i went into exile the governmentinexile no longer has it to offer the sun was finally appearing over the horizon and it illuminated the wings on the falcon jet in a golden glow to the rear of the plane a steward was preparing a light breakfast of juice and muffins the time had come for overholt to show his hand the united states has a plan to liberate the golden buddha he said we should have it in a few days the dalai lamas smile became a grin i must say that is very unexpected news now i can see why you have flown halfway around the world with me overholt smiled and nodded so you think the chinese will accept the icon as payment when combined with the threat of war the dalai lama shook his head no my cia friend i do not the true secret of the golden buddha is insidea secret the chinese would pay dearly for exiting the bridge truitt steered the van through the cloverleaf the thousandroom hotel lisboa and casino was to the right as they drove west on avenida dr mario soares to the right the bank of china soared into the air a pink graniteandglass structure whose top levels allowed the occupants a view across the border into china for anticapitalists they build a nice bank meadows said quietly no one replied they were enamored with the scenery central macau was a strange mishmash of new and old european and asian traditional and modern truitt reached rua da praia grande and turned left from what im told this used to be a beautiful drive truitt said until construction started on the nam van lakes reclamation project the road was clogged with construction trucks cement mixers and piles of materials driving farther the road became avenida da republica and skirted nam van lake thats the governors residence truitt said pointing up the hill im taking us the long way around the tip of the peninsula so you can see the geography the hill north of the governors residence is named penha this one on the end is barra hill our target is between the two on a street named estrada da penha angling left on the road they climbed a rise until the van reached estrada de d joao paulino turning a quick right they drove a few yards and made another sharp right onto estrada da penha which formed a wavy u shape around the top of the hill until it met back up with joao paulino the van passed the bottom of the u and was halfway up the side when truitt slowed thar she blows she was a mansion an old elegant structure worthy of a landed family a tall stone wall encircled the grounds broken only by a wroughtiron gate and the creeping growth of ivy giant perfectly placed trees planted generations past studded the expanse of emerald grass as the van rolled past a croquet field was visible off to the side farther to the right down a cobblestone driveway was a twostory garage building where a handyman was soaping down a mercedesbenz limousine the mansion looked like a wealthy nineteenthcentury shipowner could live there now the only compromise for the times was the series of security cameras atop the stone wall fronting the street there are six cameras strategically located around the grounds the van was approaching the junction with joao paulino and truitt slowed before commenting that would complicate things truitt said as he slowed for the stop sign except for one thing i failed to mention whats that cabrillo asked our target is throwing a huge party truitt said as he steered the van left and were booked as the entertainment truitt took the scenic way back past the temple and along the waterfront well the software billionaire asked pointedly one thousand dollars to the stanford scientist had procured his services a call to the president of the university reminding him of past donations had opened up the full use of the laboratory the date shows thirteenth century but for me to give you a more accurate estimate of the area from which it was mined ill have to melt half of your sample well what are you waiting for its going to take me thirty or fortyfive minutes the scientist said already growing weary of the billionaires rude manner why dont you head to the cafeteria and grab something to drink do they have chai tea the billionaire said no the scientist said wearily but theres a starbucks on the commons that does after giving him directions to the starbucks he waited until the man walked out and closed the door to the laboratory idiot the scientist said then he walked over to a small kiln and slid the metal plate holding the shaving of gold inside after it melted he placed the sample inside a computerpowered sampler that would give a breakdown of the percentages of the other metals present by comparing the ratios with known ores already mined the scientist could determine the general area where the gold had been mined as he waited for the machine to perform its magic the scientist read a skiing magazine twenty minutes later the machine stopped the president of the united states was sitting in an adirondack chair behind the main house at camp david maryland the president of russia sat across from him a wooden table separating the two though not visible billion in foreign aid was on the table how does it sound vlad the president asked you know ive never been a big fan of the chinese the russian president said but the foreign aid is only a bandage my countrys factories need orders for our economy to mend itself the president nodded the biggestticket items in my budget are always the military planes and ships the taiwanese have got a shopping list a mile long what if i could steer some of that business your way the russian president smiled you are a crafty one he said youve managed to give me what my country needs while at the same time pitting us against the chinese who as you well know make an enemy of anyone who befriends taiwan the president rose from the chair and stretched now vlad he said isnt that the nucleus of negotiationto give both sides what they want i think the russian president said rising we may just have a deal good then the president said motioning toward the dining hall what do you say we go see what kind of pie the chef has in the oven the gold was mined somewhere in the area of burma the scientist said when the billionaire returned clutching a paper cup of tea can you be more specific south of the twentydegrees latitude line which means southern vietnam laos thailand or burma i can try to pin it down more but it will take time the billionaire sipped the tea then shook his head back and forth dont bother you said the magic word the billionaire started toward the door while at the same time removing a cellular telephone from his belt bring the car around he said to the driver then he disconnected and reached for the door do you want your gold back the scientist shouted across the laboratory keep it the billionaire shouted ive got a lot more where that came from youre most generous the scientist muttered as he scraped the sample from the nowcool plate and slid it into the envelope with the other carrying the envelope over to his desk he tossed it into the top drawer then he walked to the door shut off the lights and locked the door to the laboratory behind him a few minutes later he was tooling across campus on his moped still shaking his head at the strange encounter inside a storage hold on the lower level of the oregon hanley was standing with kevin nixon staring at a collection of wheeled conveyances for certain we should have a couple of the motorcycles and at least one of the allterrain vehicles prepared hanley said nixon nodded then walked over to one of the motorcycles since the last time it had been used it had been cleaned and oiled all the tools used by the corporation were kept in a constant state of readinessit was one of the easiest ways to ensure success ill go ahead and test run everything nixon said want me to fabricate macau license plates for each sounds good hanley said just standard tags nothing diplomatic nixon stared at the clipboard with the sheet of paper cabrillo had prepared earlier looks like ross wants earpiece communications for the ground operators with a secondary channel to reach the ship make sure the batteries are charged and check everything out hanley said ill break out a repeater we can place on barra hill so were not using local channels better place a beacon up there too nixon said glancing at the clipboard murphy wants a fixed targeting point if he needs to loose a missile murphy hanley said shaking his head hed drive a thumbtack with a sledgehammer nixon turned on an exhaust vent then slid his leg over the motorcycle and poked the kick starter the machine roared to life and settled into an idle shutting it off he moved toward the second motorcycle and repeated the process the hours passed as the pair of men checked then doublechecked the equipment at the same instant closer to the stern mark murphy was in the armory the room had a bench containing reloading equipment and rows of drawers containing ammunition charges timers and fuses along the walls were a series of recessed cases that housed automatic weapons rifles and handguns the room smelled of gunpowder metal and oil parts of a us army m sat atop a piece of cloth on the bench murphy pushed the button on a digital timer then reached for the stock and began to assemble the weapon a minute later he pushed the timer again then raised his hands in the air one minute and four secondshe was slow today walking over to an ammunition drawer he began to remove banana clips and load them with different types of ordnance god i love my job he said aloud the van was entering the bridge leading from macau to taipa the minutemen cabrillo said where did you come up with that name it could be construed as an homage to paul revere and the revolutionary way truitt said laughing wouldnt that be paul revere and the raiders jones said but in fact truitt continued its the name of the band that was already hired wont it be crowded when two bands show up ross asked it would be but the real minutemen a california cover band doing a tour of the far east was detained in bangkok after a twoweek stint in the phuket bars apparently a customs official found a joint in the drummers shaving kit planted cabrillo asked had to truitt noted the minutemen are probably the only band in these parts that are cleanthey met one another in a twelvestep group the boys sound all right meadows said you cant fault someone whos turned his life aroundwe shouldnt let them rot in a thailand prison not to worry the customs official is on our payroll truitt said theres no record of the stop one of our people in california made contact with their management company and explained the situation and we upgraded them to first class for the flight home since the macau gig was the last one on the tour right now the minutemen are convinced they were critically helpful in the war on terrorismas per our standard cover story the van rolled onto taipa and started across the island i just have one question cabrillo said which one of us is the lead singer the dalai lama walked down the steps of the jet in jalandhar in the punjab province of india into an unusually hot day despite his fortyfive years in exile in india he had never learned to adjust to the weather his holiness was a man from the mountains and he missed snow and cold temperatures he sniffed the air for the slightest smell from the glaciers far to the north instead of snow and pine trees his nose was assaulted by fumes from the trucks passing by the airport on the trafficpacked highway he smiled anyway and gave thanks looks like my transportation is here he said to overholt who had joined him on the tarmac a large singleengine cessna caravan was nearby with a pilot doing a walkaround very good your holiness overholt said as soon as i return i will meet with my advisors and the oracle the dalai lama said staring directly into overholts eyes if they agree and you can ensure me no bloodshed then i will agree to the plan we have designed thank you your holiness the dalai lama began to walk toward the cessna then stopped and turned around i will pray for your father and for you he said quietly and pray this all works out overholt simply smiled as the dalai lama turned and walked over to the steps then climbed into the cessna for the rest of his journey as soon as he was seated the dalai lama turned to one of his assistants as soon as we arrive in little lhasa i will need the trunk containing the golden buddha documents brought to my office the assistant scribbled notes on a small pad then i will need to see my doctor he said quietly there is something wrong with my physical shell as ordered your holiness the aide said i shall do the pilot started the engine on the cessna and ran through his checks four minutes later he was rolling toward a runway and a few minutes after that he was airborne overholt stood on the tarmac and watched as the cessna lifted off the ground and made a climbing turn to the right the caravan was just a speck against the backdrop of the white cloud cover before he turned to the pilot of the falcon mind if i catch a ride back to santa monica with you he asked were going that way anyway sir the pilot said might as well tag along overholt had a quality that was often overlooked in successful spies he could sleep anywhere by the time the jet stopped for fuel in taiwan the several hours of sleep had renewed his vigor as the plane was being fueled he walked a distance away and unfolded his portable telephone then dialed a number from memory bouncing off a satellite the signal arrived in the marshall islands in the pacific then was redirected toward the ultimate destination the signal was scrambled and untraceable and there was no way to determine where the receiving party was actually located the voice answered with an extension number juan he said quietly this is langston qué pasa amigo cabrillo said everything still looks good overholt said how is your crew coming were ten by ten cabrillo said good overholt said looks like theres a little side deal here for us to grab cabrillo said i trust theres no problem with that as long as theres no blowback overholt said your companys dealings are none of my concern excellent cabrillo said if it works out as planned there will be no need to bill you for travel expenses moneys not a problem old friend this is coming from the top overholt said but time ismake this happen for me before easter thats why we get the big money langcabrillo laughedbecause were so damn prompt youll have what you need you have my word thats what i love about you overholt said your complete lack of ego ill call you when its done cabrillo said just dont let me read about it overholt disconnected slid the telephone into his pocket then did a series of stretching exercises before climbing back aboard the jet twentyfour hours later he boarded a military transport plane from southern california to andrews air force base in maryland there he was met by the cia car service and transported to headquarters at the mansion on estrada da penha preparations for the party were moving at a blistering pace one truck after another rolled through the gates then parked and unloaded their contents three large yellowandwhitestriped canvas tents were quickly erected on the grounds with portable airconditioning units to make the tents more comfortable they were followed by a pair of large portable fountains with spotlights that would shoot colored streams of water twenty feet into the air red carpets for the guests to walk across sound equipment a baby grand piano for the musician who would play during the cocktail hour parrots doves and peacocks and tables chairs and linens the party planner was a middleaged portuguese woman named iselda whose black hair was kept in a tight bun on the back of her head she was chainsmoking thin brown cigarettes with blue satin tips while she screamed orders to the staff these are not the goblets i ordered she said as a worker carried a case into the tent and began to unpack them i ordered the ones with the gold liptake these back sorry miss iselda the chinese worker said scanning a sheet these are what are on the list take them back take them back she said as she furiously puffed away a peacock wandered into the tent and made a mess on the floor iselda grabbed a straw broom and chased it out onto the grounds where are the laser lights she shouted to no one in particular at exactly that same instant stanley ho host of the party was standing in one of his three home offices this one on the top floor of his house this was his private sanctuary none of the staff or assistants were allowed to enter this most private of spaces the attic room was decorated to hos tastes which ran to early eclectic his desk was from an early sailing ship his television a brandnew plasma screen bookcases lined one wall but they were not filled with the classy tomes ho displayed in areas where guests visited these shelves were filled with pulp spy novels soft porn featuring damsels in distress and cheap paperback westerns a giant wool rug with a stickshaped phoenix design that had been woven by a navajo in arizona graced the wood floor while the walls were dotted with framed posters from past and current popular movies the top of the captains desk was a study in disorderliness stacks of papers a metal car model a cup from disney world holding pens and a dusty brass lamp shared the crowded space ho walked over to a small refrigerator shaped like a bank vault and removed a bottle of water twisting off the cap he took a sip then stared at the golden buddha sitting upright on the floor the door of its case open ho was trying to decide if he should display his latest prize at the party right then his private telephone rang it was the insurance underwriter who wanted to schedule an appointment ho set a time then went back to staring at his treasure as long as we dont lose power kevin nixon said no one should be the wiser did you receive their song list cabrillo asked we got it hanley said handing him the list and programmed the songs into the computer heavy on the sixties and seventies cabrillo noted with a fair amount of guitar riffs unfortunately we cant change the playlist without arousing suspicion hanley said im just worriedif any of the guests happen to be guitar players theyll know were faking it cabrillo said i rigged the guitar with tiny led lights that are only visible with special glasses nixon said smiling theyre colorcoded for the players fingers all he has to do is place his fingers where the light shows and he should be okay nixon handed cabrillo the guitar and a pair of blackframed sunglasses he slid the strap over his neck and nixon plugged the guitar into the power source it goes thumb purple index finger red then down the fingers yellow blue and green nixon said same on the frets hold a second and ill start the computer cabrillo slipped on the glasses and waited once the lights lit up he pushed his fingers on the illuminated strings a crude rendition of the star spangled banner filled the magic shop we wont win any grammys cabrillo said when the lights went dark but it should get us past any casual scrutiny hanley walked over to a bench and removed a clear glass bottle containing a pale blue liquid theres one other thing to consider he said smiling this stuff came straight from the labs at fort dietrich maryland once we slip some of this into the punch bowl this party will be kicking theres no longterm effects right cabrillo asked no hanley said only shortterm it seems that after a few drops of this elixir youll have the time of your life the sample checks out the software billionaire said over the telephone spenser had dispensed with the voicealteration equipment but his words were tinged with a fear that made his uppercrust accent less polished than perplexed then you are interested he said sure the software billionaire said but ive decided that i want to make the transfer myself i have the feeling youre about as trustworthy as a hooker with a crack habit spenser frowned his plan of thievery and deceit was unraveling the costs he had already incurred made a quick sale his only salvationthere was no time to line up another buyer he was in the worst possible place he was a seller who needed to sellwith a buyer who was calling the shots then you need to come here and take delivery spenser said wheres here macau spenser said the software billionaire stared at a calendar on his desk ill be there the evening of good friday ill want cash or bearer bonds then spenser said no more bank transfer fair enough but dont try anything im bringing reinforcements you bring the money spenser said and you get the buddha the billionaire disconnected and spenser sat quietly for a moment he didnt have long to go monicas a guest cabrillo said as he glanced at the sheet of notes for this operation shes a minor member of the danish royal family its all so common crabtree said with a scandinavian accent youll need to fake a speech impediment with that accent hanley said stop by the magic shop and well make you a mouth guard that will add a lisp great crabtree said i get to play a lisping ladyinwaiting it could be worse cabrillo said lindas replacing the chainsmoking portuguese party planner iselda excellent linda ross said laughing i finally quit smoking a few years ago and now the corporation is going to get me hooked again by the way hanley said we think iselda also practices an alternative lifestyle so im a chainsmoking portuguese lesbian party planner ross said at least its not as bad as when i was a german transsexual dominatrix i remember that murphy said you looked like madeline kahn in that mel brooks film i remember you being kind of turned on ross said we were going to use julia but we couldnt for the obvious reason cabrillo noted julia huxley the oregons medical officer grinned i always knew growing up that these big boobs would pay off youd just better perfect your pamela andersonleewhoever look hanley said i get to play a slut huxley said happily girlfriend of one of the band members cabrillo noted same thing huxley said eagerly can max do me some fake tattoos be glad to hanley said we might even fake some piercings if you like and now to the band cabrillo said im playing keyboardsa lot of songs dont feature keyboards so that will give me time to sneak away murphys lead guitar kasim is our drummer and the soul man franklin is on bass oh yeah lincoln said the pulsing beat runs through me and the singer huxley asked that would be mr halpert cabrillo said the entire conference table turned and stared at michael halpert as the head of finance and accounting he didnt exactly seem to fit the job easily the most conservative of the crew the rumor was that he ironed his handkerchiefs the idea of him posing as a rock musician seemed as ludicrous as casting courtney love as the virgin mary unfortunately the lead singer of the minutemen is tall thin and slim and the owner has seen a videotape of the band performing if no one can think of anyone else mikes got to be our man i can do it halpert said quickly are you sure hanley asked there is only so much the magic shop can do for your information i was raised on a commune in colorado halpert said ive forgotten more about the rock lifestyle than most of you ever knew cabrillo was the only one who already knew thathe was the sole officer of the corporation who had access to all employment files man murphy said i thought your baby clothes were a threepiece suit now you know halpert said my family got around jerry jeff walker was my godfather and commander cody taught me how to ride a bicycle man hali kasim said just when you think you know someone lets get back to the project cabrillo said he knew halperts upbringing made him uncomfortablethe day halpert had enlisted in the marines his father had quit speaking to him ten years had passed before theyd talked again and even now the relationship was strained halpert waited for cabrillo to continue right now we have two of our people posing as a landscaping crew they will install parabolic microphones in the trees theyre trimming the microphones record the vibrations on the glass of the house and we should be able to hear everything that is happening inside were having trouble monitoring the telephone lines however linda ross noted normally we can tap into the mainframe but since the chinese took over the telephone system they moved the major systems across the water into hong kong well try and install something at the junction box leading into the house but were not sure how well it will receive so theres a chance we will only be able to hear one side of the telephone calls hanley asked right ross said anyone talking inside will cause vibrations on the glass we can read im not so concerned about that cabrillo said but we do need to be able to cut the lines leading into the housethe burglar alarms work through the telephone lines that we can do ross said but people will still be able to use cell phones the hours passed as the planning continued the party was less than thirty hours away like a whirling dervish the oracle began to shake and parade about the palace of exile in india was much smaller than potala but it served the same purpose home to the dalai lama and his advisors it featured a temple sleeping rooms and a large stonefloored meeting room where the dalai lama was sitting on a throne chair now watching the oracle was dressed in his ceremonial robes topped by one of golden silk its interwoven designs of yellow green blue and red encircling a mirror on the chest surrounded by amethyst and turquoise stones a harness held small flags and banners and the entire outfit weighed nearly eighty pounds as soon as the oracle had been dressed and entered a trance his assistants had placed a heavy metalandleather helmet upon his head and cinched it tight had the aging oracle not been possessed by a spirit outside his own the weight of the helmet and robes would have been too much for him to bear instead once the oracle reached his deep state the weight seemed to be lifted and he hopped about like an astronaut walking on the surface of the moon he exploded in motion arms akimbo he danced like a praying mantis from one side of the room to the other strange guttural sounds radiated from somewhere deep inside his body while his left hand flashed a heavy silverplated sword in a figureeight pattern then he stopped in front of the throne chair and shook his entire body like a dog after a swim once the oracle became motionless the dalai lama spoke is it time to go home he asked the oracle spoke in a voice unlike his own the dalai lama returns but to a smaller tibet the oracle explains the dalai lama said a backflip a flapping of arms a stillness again the north holds the key the oracle said loudly we give the aggressors the land that once held mongols then they will go can we trust the westerners the dalai lama asked the oracle bent his knees and strutted around in a circle when facing the dalai lama again he spoke we will soon have something they want our gift of this will help strengthen the friendship our power is returningour home is near then all at once as if a gust of wind had blown the skeleton from his body the oracle collapsed on the ground in a heap his assistants ran over and untied the helmet then began to remove the sweatsoaked robes they began to bathe the oracle with cool water but it was almost an hour before he opened his eyes again online the corporation technician whispered on board the oregon a radio operator adjusted his receiver the sound of a maid came through his headset he flipped a switch to a recorder then keyed his microphone okay he said were recording climbing down from the tree the technician gathered up the limbs he had trimmed then spent the next few hours working on the bushes when he had finished the job and loaded the rented truck with the debris it was just past lunchtime walking around to the service entrance he handed a bill to the manager of the mansion then he walked back to the truck and drove away back on the oregon the radio operator monitored the conversation in the mansion and made notes on a yellow pad nothing much was happening but that might change at any moment belowdecks in the magic shop the band was rehearsing kevin nixon motioned for them to stop then adjusted the control panel all right he said from the top again murphy started strumming his guitar and the opening bars of the creedence clearwater revival song fortunate son filled the shop the rest of the band added their parts halperts voice was surprisingly good after being washed through the computer it was hard to tell his rendition from the original his moves were good as wellunlike those of most of the band cabrillo on the keyboards came off as liberace on methamphetamines kasim moved like buddy rich in a neck brace lincoln was slightly betterhe kept his eyes closed and strummed the bass guitar and managed to tap his foot in time the problem was that his hands were so large it looked like he was not moving his fingers nixon waited until the song was finished its not bad he admitted but i have some videotapes of live bands and i suggest you men watch them so you can work on your choreography three hours later the band was as ready as they would ever be this was the part of her job iselda loved bestthe lastminute nagging details she reached in her handbag and found a pack of thin brown cheroots unlike most smokers who stuck to a single brand iselda stocked her bag with three or four different kinds she selected her poison depending on many factors the aching in her lungs the rawness of her throat the amount of nicotine needed for the job menthols for that minty fresh buzz thin cigars when she needed a boost long thin brightly tipped tools when she needed to punctuate a conversation by using the burning sticks like a maestros baton she fired up the cheroot and took a drag i specifically requested glacier ice for the cocktails she screamed at the caterer not the round highball cubes you asked for both the caterer said but the glacier ice has yet to arrive youll have it here she asked its in the warehouse iselda the man said patiently we didnt want it to melt iselda stared across the tent to where a worker was adjusting the devices that made clouds of smoke from dry ice we need more smoke than that she shouted then quickly walked across to the row of machines and began to berate the worker after a few minutes of adjustment the man flipped the machine on again clouds of dense cold gas billowed from the machine then began to settle on the floor good good iselda said now make sure we have plenty of dry ice a technician was adjusting the light display and she raced in that direction on board the oregon the technician monitoring conversations in the mansion made a note on the yellow pad then reached for the shipboard communication microphone chairman cabrillo he said i think you need to come up here the limousine slowed outside the gate leading to the runway at the san jose california airport a guard with a holstered weapon stood blocking the way the driver rolled down his window new security regulations he said theres no more driving onto the tarmac the software billionaire had rolled down his window as well this was an unwelcome inconvenience intolerable in fact wait a minute now he shouted from the rear weve driven out to my plane for years not anymore the guard noted do you know who i am the billionaire said pompously no idea the guard admitted but i do know who i amim the guy thats ordering you to turn away from the gate now with nothing else to say the limousine driver backed up and steered toward the terminal then parked in front and waited for his employer to climb out the encounter put his boss in a foul mood and he could hear him muttering as he carried the bags a safe distance behind good god the billionaire said for what i pay for hangar space youd think id get some service as they approached the door leading out to the taxiway a smattering of expensive jets sat awaiting their owners there were a trio of gulfstreams a citation or two a half dozen king airs and a single burgundy behemoth that looked like it belonged to a regional airline the software billionaire was big on appearances if the rich had private jetshe wanted a large one an airplane that screamed success and excess like a dog collar made from diamonds the billionaires choice was a boeing the aircraft was fitted with a singlelane bowling alley a hot tub and a bedroom bigger than many homes it was fitted with a largescreen television advance communications equipment and a chef trained at the cordon bleu the pair of dancers he had ordered from the service were already aboard the entertainment for his flight was a california blonde and a redhead who bore a striking resemblance to a young annmargret the billionaire wanted some way to pass the time on the long flight he burst through the door leading outside without waiting for his driver with the luggage then made his way over to the then he walked up the ramp and inside ladies he shouted front and center thirteen minutes later they were airborne inside the oregon the technician was entering commands in the computer when cabrillo opened the door and walked inside what have you got he said without preamble ho just had a telephone conversation with an insurance adjuster who is coming out to the mansion to inspect the buddha damn cabrillo said reaching for the microphone max you better get up to communications weve got a problem while the technician continued to trace the source of the call cabrillo paced the control room hanley arrived a few minutes later what is it juan ho has an insurance adjuster coming out to inspect the golden buddha when hanley asked four pm the technician hit a button and a printer spit out a sheet heres the location of the call boss he said i have it overlaid on a map of macau we need to come up with a plan cabrillo said posthaste winston spenser was juggling chain saws only his long stint as a customer of the bank had earned him an increase on his business line of credit but the manager had made it clear he wanted the balance paid down in no less than seventytwo hours his credit cards were at their limits and calls had already come into his office in london inquiring about the situation for all intents and purposes spenser was at this instant in dire financial straits as soon as the deal with the billionaire went down he would be as flush as he had ever dreamedright now however he could not afford an airplane ticket home all he had to do tomorrow was remove the buddha transfer it to the airport and receive his illgotten gain then hed charter a jet and fly off into the sunset with his fortune by the time his customer in macau realized hed been duped hed be long gone juan cabrillo sat at the table in his stateroom and studied the folder for the third time in nine minutes the hands of the clock would pass twelve and it would officially be good friday game day there was always a fair amount of luck combined with flexibility when the corporation launched an operation the key was to minimize surprises through rigorous planning and always have a backup plan in place at this the corporation excelled the only problem was the object itself the golden buddha was not a microchip that could be slipped into a pocket or sewn into clothing it was a heavy object the size of a man that required effort to move and stealth to conceal any way you cut the cake the movement of the icon would require men and machines to transport it to a safe place the mere size and weight of the golden buddha made that a condition then there were the players themselves the art dealer ho the people at the party the chinese authorities and now the insurance appraiser any one of them could throw a wrench into the works and the stakes and timing were such that retreating and regrouping was not an option cabrillo hated operations where a clear path of retreat was not available people could be captured injured or killed when the plan was to execute the operation at all costs the last time the corporation had sustained losses was the operation in hong kong where cabrillo had lost his leg and others had been killed since then he had consciously avoided ultrahighrisk assignments the golden buddha assignment had started out fitting the lowerrisk profile but it was becoming more and more dangerous as time passed just pregame jitters cabrillo thought as he closed the folder sometime tonight they would have the buddha and begin the process of transferring it back to the dalai lama a few more days and the corporation would be cashiered out of the loop and sailing away to another part of the globe winston spenser gulped glenmorangie whiskey like it was ginger ale spensers brilliant plan of deceit had hit a speed bump that had ripped off the oil pan and now it was leaking its fluid onto the ground ho had called earlier in the evening and his words had been an ice pick to the brain please come to the party early ho had said id like you to be here when the insurance man examines the buddha one day more and spenser would have been long gone uruguay paraguay one of the south pacific islands anywhere but here the fake buddha was goodhed paid a princely ransom to ensure it could withstand scrutinybut if the insurance inspector was topnotch hed see through the ruse the gold itself would probably pass muster the problem was the precious stones if the inspector was any sort of gemologist hed realize the stones were just too perfect massive rocks of the size that adorned the golden buddha were extremely rare the existing stones that large almost always had flaws only stones produced in a laboratory were lacking inclusions he drained the scotch and walked over to the bed and lay down but the bed was spinning and sleep was hard to come by since his exile from tibet it would be easy to imagine that the dalai lama had lived in a vacuum concerning events inside his country nothing could be further from the truth almost from the time hed stepped across the border an ad hoc system of local intelligence had begun filtering south to his headquarters in little lhasa messages were passed from mouth to mouth by a series of runners who breached the mountain passes far from chinese scrutiny then delivered their messages either in person or through intermediaries with hundreds of thousands of tibetans loyal to the dalai lama the tentacles of the operation reached into every part of the country chinese troop movements were reported intercepted cables sent south overheard telephone conversations disclosed snow tables and water flow from the rivers and other environmental concerns were memorized and transmitted tourists were monitored and casually engaged in conversation to glean more facts about the chinese and their attitudes merchants that sold to the chinese soldiers reported on sales and the troops general demeanor times of alert were noted and sent south as were times when controls over the population were loosened briefings were held for the dalai lama and his advisors and most of the time the exiles in india had a better picture of the conditions in tibet than the hated chinese overlords the troops seem to be buying more trinkets the dalai lama asked yes one of his advisors noted things that are uniquely tibetan when has this ever happened before the dalai lama asked never the advisor admitted and we have reports that the fuel stocks at the bases are low thats what the tibetan workers at the bases report the advisor said excursions by trucks into the countryside are being curtailed and we have not had a report of a tank on exercises in nearly a month its as if the occupation is moving into a stagnant time the dalai lama opened an unmarked folder and scanned the contents this coincides with the reports from the virginia consulting group we have under contract their latest report shows the chinese economy in dire straits the chinese have the largest increase of any country in oil imports while at the same time the value of their investments overseas are decreasing if president jintao doesnt make some muchneeded adjustments his country could be plunged into a fullscale depression we can only hope one of the advisors noted that brings me to our main topic of discussion the dalai lama said quietly if we could take a moment to meditate to clear our minds i will explain the burgundy was a flying sybaritic palace in the sky the software billionaire was dosing himself with a carefully calculated mixture of ecstasy and male impotence pills to pass the time the ecstasy made him loving but the impotence pills offset that by fueling his sexual appetite which was a little aggressive at this instant in a forward part of the jet a flight attendant was making notes on the pad of a personal digital assistant once he was finished he plugged it into the air phone and hit send now all he had to do was wait for a reply the other flight attendant seemed more concerned this was her first flight on the billionaires and she found the debauchery unnerving turning her head away from the rear section of the plane she addressed the blondhaired man you ever worked this gig before first time the man admitted if i didnt need the money the brunette said id make this trip oneway the blondhaired man nodded tell me about yourself he said thirty minutes later the blondhaired man smiled shed fudged what he knew as the truthbut not by much theres an opportunity you might be interested in he said easily just then the buzzer from the rear rang and a voice was heard bring us another two magnums of champagne the billionaire ordered you keep that thought the brunette said ill go water the horses in macau the streets were filled with latenight revelers two men drove slowly along avenue conselheiro ferriera de almeida through the throngs the man in the passenger seat stared at a portable gps mapping unit and gave directions turning at avenida do coronel mesquita they headed northwest along the road until they were at a side street that led to a residential area within a half mile of mainland china find a place to park the navigator ordered pulling to the side of the road under a tree the driver placed the van in park then shut off the engine the navigator pointed to a house set back from the road up the street thats the house shall we the driver asked the navigator climbed out of the van and walked around to the front and waited while the driver reached under the seat removed a leather bag then met him in front of the van you notice almost no one here has a dog the driver said sometimes the navigator said you just get lucky both men were dressed in dark clothing that blended into the night their shoes were rubber soled and their hands covered by dark vinyl surgical gloves they moved with the certain sense of unhurried purpose that comes with competence not arrogance slipping unseen to the front wall surrounding the home they paused for a second at the gate the driver reached into his pocket removed a pick and a second later sprung the lock he opened the gate allowed the navigator to pass inside then closed the gate behind them there was little need to talk both men had memorized the plan walking around to the rear of the house where it was dark they disabled the security system jimmied the lock and then crept silently into the house pausing at the foot of the stairs the driver flipped open a small black plastic box and slipped an earpiece into place pointing the device at the floor above he listened for a moment then he smiled and nodded at his partner placing his hands together he tilted his head and placed his hands alongside his cheek using the universal hand signal for sleep with one finger he pointed to the far end of the floor in the left corner with the other he pointed a distance away to where another bedroom was located on the second floor then he pointed a fist toward the spot on the left side primary target there secondary target there doing a kind of curtsy he spread his hands apart then he unsnapped a pouch clipped to his belt and handed an eightinch leather case to the navigator and smiled taking the case the navigator slowly began to climb the stairs several minutes passed as the driver stood silently on the landing then he heard the voice of his partner i dont know about you the navigator said as he began to walk down the steps but im hungry the driver removed his earpiece stuffed the cord inside then folded the case back together then lets eat the driver said the navigator reached the landing and flicked on a tiny flashlight we cant ask our hosts whats good he said theyre in sleepyville and by the time they wake up the driver said well be long gone the two men made their way to the kitchen but nothing looked good so they walked back to the van drove through town to the casino and ordered a meal of ham and eggs sunrise on good friday march was at am on the decks of the sampans in the inner harbor the chinese traders began to stir along avenida da amizade in front of the hotel lisboa a dozen women dressed in cotton shifts with conical hats lashed around their necks began washing the sidewalk with soapy water splashed from tin buckets dipping straw brooms into the buckets they erased the debris from both the winners and the losers from the night before a few diehards stumbled from inside and squinted at the light from a sun just beginning her day a few small threewheeled motorized rickshaws plied the avenue their drivers stopping for strong black coffee served in small cups then continuing on to deliver packages or people to their destinations at a small restaurant two hundred yards northwest of the casino the owner finished a cigarette then walked inside on the stove in the rear was a pot of caldo verde the portuguese stew of potatoes sausage and locally grown greens he stirred the mixture then set the long wooden spoon onto a counter and started to prepare chickens marinated in coconut milk garlic peppercorns and chilies by rubbing them with rock salt later the poultry would be slid onto skewers and slowcooked on a rotisserie across the water hong kong was hidden by a haze of humidity and smog but the sound of the first highspeed ferry leaving port could be heard the first few jets of the day mainly cargo planes streaked across the blue sky and made ready for landing at the airport a chinese naval vessel left its moorage below ama temple and started out for a patrol while a large luxury yacht with a helicopter perched on her fantail called on the radio for the location of her slip a lone cargo ship decades past her prime started into port to deliver a cargo of bicycles from taiwan on another cargo ship this one appearing old and decrepit a man with a blond crew cut was sitting at the table in his stateroom reading juan cabrillo had been awake for hours he was running every possible scenario through his head a light knock came at the door and cabrillo stood up and walked over and opened the hatch somehow i knew youd be awake hanley said hanley held a tray of plates covered by metal lids steam escaping from under them breakfast he said as he walked inside cabrillo cleared a space on the table and hanley off loaded the contents next he pulled the lid off a dinner sized plate and smiled cabrillo nodded and pointed to a seat hanley slid into the seat and poured two cups of coffee from a thermal carafe then removed the lid from another plate anything unusual happen overnight cabrillo asked no hanley said easily everything is still according to plan cabrillo sipped his coffee theres a lot here that could go wrong he said there always is thats why we get the big money thats why we get the big money hanley agreed so do you know when i lost my virginity the brunette flight attendant asked you seem to know everything else thats too personal the blondhaired man laughed but my failed relationships and credit card bills arent the attendant grinned sorry about the intrusion into your privacy the group i work with has a thing for detail sounds like youre a spy the attendant noted oh heck no the blondhaired man said we just work for them taxfree income enough so i can retire everyones dream the blondhaired man admitted the brunette attendant glanced around the forward cabin she was really nothing more than a glorified waitress on a restaurant in the sky how can i say no she said finally good the blondhaired man said rising where are you going she asked i have to go kill the pilot the blondhaired man said lightly the look on the brunette flight attendants face was priceless just kidding the blondhaired man said i have to pee im qualified in s but i think mr fabulous would think it odd if i disappeared who are you people the attendant muttered as the blondhaired man slipped into the lavatory are you sure this beast will make it to the border and back carl gannon asked gannon was staring at a decrepit old twoandahalfton truck parked under a tree alongside a stone building on a side street in thimbu bhutan sometime in the past the truck had been painted an olive drab color but most of the paint was gone and now it showed mostly a light dusting of hairy rust the twopart windshield was cracked on the passenger side and all six of the tires were worn past any margin of safety the hood which had a strip down the center so the sides could be flipped open to work on the engine was bent and had been welded more than once the running boards were wooden slats the exhaust pipe hung down from the undercarriage and was held in place with rusted wire gannon walked to the rear and stared into the bed some of the planks that formed the floor were cracked and some were missing and the canvas flaps that covered the sides were in roughly the same condition as a world war ii pup tent oh yes sir the bhutanese owner said easily she has a strong heart gannon continued his walk around climbing onto the passenger running board he peeked into the cockpit the long bench seat was worn with portions of the springs underneath visible but the few gauges on the dash were not cracked and appeared functional he climbed down then walked over to the hood and lifted the passenger side which he folded up and over the engine was surprisingly clean it smelled strongly of thick grease and fresh oil the belts and hoses while not new were serviceable and the electrical wires and battery looked good gannon climbed down can you start her up the man walked around opened the door and climbed into the drivers seat after pulling out the choke he pumped the gas pedal then twisted the key after turning over a few times the engine roared to life smoke drifted out of a rusted hole in the exhaust pipe but the engine settled into an idle gannon listened carefully there was no tapping from the valves but he placed his hand over the covers just to be sure nothing was amiss rev her up he shouted the owner depressed the gas pedal then left off he did this four times okay gannon said you can shut her off the owner turned off the engine pocketed the key and then climbed from the cockpit he was small a shade over five feet tall with tanned skin and slightly almondshaped eyes smiling at gannon he awaited the verdict do you have spare belts and hoses i can find some the man told him gannon reached into his pocket and removed a wad of bills wrapped with a thick rubber band removing the rubber band he fanned out the bills how much to take me and a cargo to the border with tibet he asked with amnesia included amnesia the man said not understanding after this is over gannon said i want you to forget we ever met the man nodded one thousand dollars he said easily and one dvd player sounds reasonable gannon said now do you know where i can buy an ox theoregon was a buzz of activity belowdecks in the magic shop the players in the band were checking their instruments and arranging their costumes juan cabrillo flipped open his cell phone and answered a call situation is stabilized here linda ross said im headed to the site now weve got three men inside and one watching from outside the wall cabrillo said if anyone catches on you sound the alarm and help will come running piece of cake ross said the telephone went dead and cabrillo turned to max hanley iselda is making her entrance so far so good hanley said mark murphy finished with kasim and patted his back there you go he said michael halpert was playing with a microphone murphy turned to him and motioned come on kid he said let me get you strapped halpert walked over and turned his back to murphy who raised halperts shirt this is a featherlight thirtyeight mike murphy recited as he taped a holster containing the weapon on halperts lower back now i want you to reach back and yank the smoke wagon it was a line murphy had heard from the movie tombstoneever since then hed used it unmercifully halpert reached back and pulled the pistol hang on murphy said its too high youre cocking your elbow he readjusted the holster and waited until halpert tried it again thats better he said let me see your boot halpert turned and raised his pant leg murphy strapped on a knife inside a hard plastic case be careful with this mike murphy told him the blade has been dipped in a paralytic poison if things turn to shit you just have to nick someone and theyll go down the problem is the same thing happens to you if your target takes it from you be sure hes close and make sure you are in control of the situation okay mark halpert said quietly the knife was in place and murphy climbed from his knees you worried he asked quietly a little halpert said im usually not on the operational end murphy nodded and smiled dont worry buddy im going to be right next to you if trouble breaks out they have to get through me first halpert nodded then walked over to pick his microphone up again boss he said to cabrillo youre last cabrillo smiled and walked over to murphy he was dressed in a costume that would make elton john blush murphy raised one of the sequined pockets on the vest and slid two hypodermic needles in covers inside in the other pocket he slid an arced carbonfiber blade that had holes for fingers your blade is dipped in paralytic agent too he said spinning cabrillo around and strapping a small automatic weapon to his lower back the bullets are wad cutters theres not as much horsepower in the rounds as i like so be close before you pull the trigger lets hope it doesnt come to that cabrillo said lincoln had already been outfitted and he stood to one side playing with his bass guitar cabrillo smiled then spoke okay everybody well be going in soon he said remember the order of operations and make sure youve memorized the out if at any time i give the signal to pull out make your way to the extraction point keep in mind this portion today is only one part of the bigger pictureif this goes haywire we still have ways of salvaging the operation there are no bold heroesonly old heroes the weapons are to be used only if everything goes to hell and one of our people is in danger of losing life or limb what we want as always is an orderly operation where we do our job and return here safe and sound any questions the magic shop was silent okay people cabrillo said then give your letters to julia medical officer julia huxley hated this part of her job the letters gave instructions for the lengths of medical care each man wanted if critically injured they also gave detailed instructions as to the dispersal of the operatives funds and other bequests whatever was in the letters huxley was bound to see it through she walked around the room collecting the sealed envelopes when she was done the room was quiet that always puts a pall over the proceedings murphy said laughing were not going in to disable a nuclear warhead were just stealing some gold the sour mood dissipated and they resumed talking we have some time before we need to leave hanley said so if you need to eat or whatever the time is now everyone filtered out of the room leaving only cabrillo and hanley meadows and jones ready cabrillo asked right on schedule hanley said and the flyboy jetting his way here hanley said as we speak then the fun is about ready to happen a pair of men on motorcycles with sidecars sat on the side of rua de lourenco and watched employees from the macau public works department erecting barricades along the route of the good friday parade the side streets would all be blocked off but the barricades were wooden sawhorses and would yield to the bumper of a car or the front tire of a motorcycle lets ride over to the staging area one of the men said the other man nodded and pushed his starter button then placed the cycle in gear and drove up the street a few blocks away he slid over to the side of the road and shut off the engine the street leading out of the staging area was festooned with banners and crepepaper streamers paper lanterns holding candles were placed along the route waiting to be lit at dusk various vendors were setting up shop in handcarts to offer food and drink to those watching the parade while a street sweeper made a lastminute pass to make sure the street at least started out clean they sure are big on dragons said one of the men pointing to a large line of floats there were at least seventy different floats ships stages where musicians would play sword swallowers and juggling acts and dragons red crepepaper monstrosities a blueandyellow dragon with a long tail posed in the air the floats were built on motorized platforms then outlined in thick wire and covered with cloth paper or in one case what looked like hammered copper a single driver perched inside each steered down the route by staring through a small slit in the front of the float the exhaust from the small internalcombustion engines was vented out the side it was quiet now but by the amount of speakers on the various floats it was obvious that once the parade got under way there would be a medley of sights and sounds im going to go take a look one of the men said as he climbed off the motorcycle and walked over to a nearby float lifting the side curtain he stared at the framework before a policeman walked over and shooed him away lot of room under there he said to his partner as he returned and climbed back into his seat several members of a marching band trudged past followed by an elephant with a handler sitting atop in a basket chair hell of a deal the second man said quietly hell of a deal richard truitt stared in the mirror in his hotel room on avenida de almeida ribeiro then adjusted his tie reaching into his shaving kit he removed a round container and opened it up touching his fingertip to the colored contact lens he placed it over an eye and blinked it into place after placing the second lens he stood back and examined the result truitt was pleased and he smiled then he reached into another bag and removed a dental appliance and slid it over his top row of teeth now he had a slightly bucktoothed look removing a pair of tortoiseshell glasses from the bag he placed them over his ears and adjusted them on the bridge of his nose if it was geek he was seeking hed hit the mother lode all that remained was to grease down his hair and sprinkle a little false dandruff on the collar of his tweed jacket perfect walking into the living room of the suite he removed a document from the out tray in his printer and gave it an examination it was ornate and pompous in true british fashion by royal appointment to the queen said one line since said another truitt folded the document and slipped it into the inside pocket of his jacket then he turned off the computer and printer and packed it into its case his bags were already packed and sitting by the door he returned to the bathroom to gather up his things there then walked back into the living room and slid them into a side pocket of one of the bags then he walked over to the telephone and dialed a number on my way he said quietly good luck cabrillo replied now he just needed to make his way out of the room without being seen for the most part linda ross was a goodnatured and positive person thats what made playing iselda so much fun most people have a bitchy sidethey just keep it suppressed since the report on iselda claimed she suppressed the best and not the worst ross was playing the opportunity to the hilt riding down the elevator to the parking garage she stepped over to the attendants window and frowned the man raced from the enclosure to bring her car as ross waited she tried to decide what iselda would tip and decided it was probably nothing the attendant pulled up in a dirty peugeot and opened the door ross slid into the drivers seat and muttered ill get you next time to the attendant and slammed the door the inside of the car smelled like a wisconsin roadhouse at closing time the carpet was littered with ashes and the ashtray was overflowing the inside of the windows were covered with a film of nicotine here we go she whispered as she reached into the glove box and removed a pack of cigarettes and lit one up then she placed the peugeot into drive and rolled out to the street ten minutes later she pulled in front of the mansion and passed her first test open the gate she shouted at the guard who stared inside and seeing it was her pushed a button im late parking over to one side of the driveway she climbed from the car and lit another cigarette dump my ashtray when you get a chance she said to a gardener who walked past the man ignored her and continued on walking to the front door she rang the bell then waited until the butler opened the door out of my way she said as she swept past and headed for where she remembered the kitchen to be from the blueprints shed memorized bursting into the kitchen she stared at the stove then turned to one of the chefs iselda had hired is that the bisque she asked yes maam the chinese chef answered strutting over to the stove she removed the lid and smelled spoon please the chef handed her a spoon and she tasted the soup seems light on the lobster she said ill add more the chef said good good ross said if mr ho needs me ill be out back let me know when you bake the first shrimp puffsi want to sample them very good the chef said as ross headed through the rear door leading to the grounds as soon as she was spotted leaving the house the caterer in charge of the libations walked toward her he paused and stared you look particularly lovely today miss iselda he said flattery will get you zilch ross said do you have everything ready except for that one thing we spoke about yesterday the caterer said damn ross thought what thing ross said i cant be expected to remember everything the glacier ice the caterer said it will be here in another hour or so good good ross said now make sure all the glassware is polished she hurried away to where a chef with an electric chain saw was cutting an ice sculpture the caterer shook his head at the exchange her demeanor was the same but the caterer could swear that the mole on iseldas cheek was a few inches lower he banished the thought and went to check the glasses ross crushed her cigarette out under her high heel her head was spinning from all the smoking and she paused and took a few deep breaths more detail on the wings she said to the chef who nodded and continued working a tall man walked past carrying several stacked chairs he smiled and winked high in a hickory tree on the property a corporation employee dressed in a ghillie suit that blended into the leaves keyed a microphone and spoke lindas in and working he said quietly stanley ho was standing in his topfloor office staring down at the party preparations he had seen iselda walk onto the yard but the last thing he wanted to do was talk to her the butch portuguese woman annoyed hoshe was good at what she did but she took herself much too seriously this was a party after all not a broadway musical from past experience ho realized that a few hours from now most of the guests he had invited would be so inebriated that if he served rat as an entrée most wouldnt even notice ho was more concerned by the insurance adjuster who was due to arrive that and the fact that on the history of the golden buddha he had commissioned the historian had noted that the icon supposedly had a secret storage compartment ho had yet to find it was a minor detail but it bugged him nonetheless the insurance adjuster was apparently an expert in ancient asian art ho figured hed question him when he arrived and see if he could supply the answer if not spenser would be here soon and ho could ask him about it richard truitt drove the rental car carefully up praia grande to the gate of the mansion then stopped rolling down the window he handed the guard his invitation let me call the house the guard said dialing hos extension the guard waited mr ho the guard said theres a mr samuelson from the insurance company here that wasnt who hed been dealing with ho thought go ahead and let him in ho said and have him wait downstairs then he hung up and dialed another number go on in the guard said park by the garage and wait downstairs ho tapped his finger on the desk while the telephone rang lassiter residence a voice with a cantonese accent answered this is stanley ho is mr lassiter available mr lassiter sick the voice said doctor coming soon did he leave any message if i called ho asked hold on the voice said ho waited a few minutes then a croaking voice came on the line sorry old bean the voice sputtered ive taken ill a mr samuelson from our main office was in town hell keep the appointment as scheduled lassiter didnt sound anything like himself ho thought whatever hed caught sounded serious hes here now ho said dont worry mr ho the voice said hacking hes very knowledgeable an expert on ancient asian art i hope you feel better soon ho said the sound of a phlegmy coughing fit erupted that lasted for almost a minute me too the voice said and i hope i can view the golden buddha very soon ho hung up the telephone and rose to walk downstairs on the oregon the operator disconnected the line and turned to the man who had portrayed lassiter for a chef he said quietly you make a hell of a spy winston spenser was not wired for a life of crime and deceit at this instant he was vomiting into the toilet in his hotel room someone might argue it was all the booze from the night before but in fact it was the tension that was ripping his guts apart the tension that comes from living a lie from being wrapped in deceit from doing what one knows is wrong by now there was nothing but bile risingany food he had ingested was long gone any liquor left was in his pores spenser reached up grabbed a hand towel then wiped the corners of his mouth rising from the floor he stared at his image in the mirror his eyes were red and bloodshot and his skin pallor a ghastly gray the tension he was feeling was revealed by the muscles in his face they twitched and popped like a kernel of popcorn in a sizzling pan he reached up to dab a tear from the corner of his left eye but his hand was shaking he supported one hand with the other and finished the task then he climbed into the shower to try and sweat out the fear richard truitt stood in the living room waiting he stared around the room and tried to form a picture of his target if truitt was to guess he figured the man who resided here was selfmade and had only recently become affluent he based this judgment on the furnishings and general décor the pieces in the room were expensive enough they just had no soul and they were arranged in a fashion favoring flash over comfort the possessions of old money always contained a storythe story truitt was seeing was of objects bought in bulk to fill a space and give a picture of the occupant that was neither real nor imaginative there was a stuffed lion but truitt doubted the owner had stalked and shot the animal himself a few paintings from contemporary artists like picasso but the paintings were far from the artists best works truitt imagined they had been bought for image value guests without foundation or substance would be rightly impressed an ancient coat of armor that to truitts eye appeared to be a reproductiona french louis xvistyle couch that looked about as comfortable to sit on as a bed of nails mr samuelson a voice said from the staircase truitt turned to see who was speaking the man was small five and a half feet tall and slight of build his hair was jet black and styled like a s california hustler the mouth was small with teeth that held a certain feral rage although truitt imagined the man was smiling to be friendly the effect from his grin made truitt want to reach for his wallet to see if it was safe im stanley ho the man said reaching the bottom of the stairs and extending his hand the stage was set and truitt became the actor paul samuelson he said extending a slightly limp wrist for a handshake the home office asked me to take over for mr lassiter who has unfortunately been stricken with a bug truitts version of samuelson was coming across as a lightintheloafers michael caine i trust youre familiar with this type of sculpture oh yes truitt gushed i did graduate studies in asian art its one of my favorite forms ho motioned to the stairs then led the way up the object is known as the golden buddha are you in any way familiar with the piece they rounded the first leg of the stairs and crossed the landing to the second flight im afraid not truitt said breathlessly has it ever been displayed no ho said quickly it has been part of a private collection for decades then i shall examine it with an eye for comparison to the other pieces i am familiar with they had exited the second flight and were winding their way around to the last set of stairs you have a beautiful home truitt lied the staircases are mahogany are they not yes ho said pausing at the door to his office to scan a card that unlocked the door from brazil and hand fitted without nails or screws ho opened the door and stepped aside how lovely truitt said he stared across the office to where the golden buddha sat but nowhere near as lovely as this truitt walked over to the buddha followed by ho magnificent truitt said easily may i touch it please ho said the insurance adjuster was acting just as ho had hoped equal parts respect and sublimation there was a good chance the appraisal would be in his favor if it was not to his liking ho was sure he could bully the agent into capitulation truitt rubbed his hand over the face of buddha then stared into the jeweled eyes might i ask some about the history hes from the thirteenth century and from indochina ho said truitt opened a small leather clutch he had been holding and removed a jewelers eyepiece he placed it over one eye and examined the stones exquisite ho watched as the adjuster examined the buddha from head to toe the man seemed competent so he decided to ask him about the secret storage compartment i had a historian dig into it a little and he mentioned that some of these pieces contained an inner chamber the part of buddha where there is no ego truitt said quickly the void then you are familiar with the idea ho said oh yes truitt said he was glad the corporation had seen fit to provide him with a report on ancient asian art the void had been part of the study i cant seem to find one on this piece lets look closer truitt said the two men spent the next twenty minutes carefully examining the object but no secret compartment was found truitt decided to use the revelation to his favor shall we sit for a bit he asked ho the men took seats around hos desk what value do you have in mind truitt said that you would like our company to underwrite i was thinking in the neighborhood of two hundred million ho said thats an expensive neighborhood truitt said smiling leaning forward he spilled the contents of his leather clutch on the floor scooping down to pick up the contents he attached a small bug to the bottom of hos desk silly me he said after the bug was attached and the bag placed back on his lap what do you think is the value ho asked the absence of the secret compartment actually adds to the rarity of the piece truitt lied it places the age at least a few decades before what i had estimated the voids date from the twelfth century and later you may have something here that defies accurate pricing ho smiled his feral smile he loved it when he bested someone in a deal and he was beginning to think hed outsmarted some of the wisest art collectors in the world at first the million hed paid had seemed like a kings ransomnow it was looking like hed bought cheap what are you saying he asked i could easily insure it for twice what you are seeking truitt said but of course the premiums would reflect the increased value this was going better than truitt could have hopedgreed had removed hos doubt in his identity he had come a stranger but now he was a friend bearing gifts cons only work when the mark wants to believe ho wanted to believe but ho said slowly if i insured it for more banks would loan on the increased value yes truitt said banks tend to follow our lead ho nodded slowly why dont you figure the premiums on four hundred million i would of course need to contact our main office for the quotes truitt said but i can easily attest to the value ho sat back in his chair the realization that he owned a truly priceless work of art was sinking into his soul now his ego needed stroking a stroking that only other rich people could give him im having a party today he said i saw the preparations truitt said smiling you of course are invited ho said but i was thinking of displaying the artifact to my guests i would feel more comfortable if i had a rider covering the piece until i receive the actual quote just something to cover today you are of course thinking of displaying it downstairs truitt said ho wasnt but he was now yes ho said perhaps out on the grounds truitt nodded let me make a quick call ho pointed to his telephone but truitt whipped out a cell phone and hit the speed dial samuelson here richard youre a magnificent bastard the voice said we have been listening for the last few minutes over the bug nice work i need a quote on a oneday rider to mr hos policy to cover a piece of art valued at four hundred million until we can come up with an accurate figure for longterm coverage la de dah de dah all right then the operator on the oregon said let me make up a number for you how about twenty thousand dollars or whatever you decide but id take the fee in cash if i was you then we can have a party after this is over i see truitt said nodding so we will require increased security hold on a minute truitt placed his hand over the telephone back on the oregon the operator turned to hanley truitts redhot today he said i had not even thought of that angle ho was waiting for the adjuster to speak the fee for the rider for the day will be eighteen thousand five hundred us but my company is insisting on increased security luckily we have a local firm we usemy office will contact them and have some men out here within the hour if thats okay with you does the fee include the security detail ho asked truitt thought for a second but decided not to push the fee includes three security guards but we will want the fee in cash truitt said seriously ho stood up and walked over to his safe sounds reasonable he said truitt smiledthe offer was anything but reasonable but ho had no way to know that ill tell them truitt said ho began spinning the dial to his safe we have an agreement he said to the operator on the oregon but well need the security people here as soon as possible damn youre good the operator said yes i am truitt said quietly then disconnected ho returned with two wrapped stacks of dollars each strip read removing fifteen of the hundreddollar bills from one of the stacks he handed truitt the rest sliding the stacks of money into his leather clutch he smiled at ho do you have a sheet of paper what for ho asked i need to write you a receipt truitt said hanley reached for the telephone and dialed cabrillo dick truitt just got us three more men inside the compound acting as security guards excellent cabrillo said and there was no problem with the appraisal he handled it like the pro he is hanley said have we got security guard uniforms in the magic shop absolutely hanley said ill just call nixon and have him blast off a jazzy patch on the embroidery machine get on it cabrillo said quickly so we can extract truitt truitts been invited to the party hanley said unless you want me to order him out have him wait until the fake security team arrives cabrillo said that way he can verify their identity to ho then have him stick aroundi have another job for him done hanley said cabrillo disconnected and hanley dialed the magic shop kevin he said i need three security guard uniforms with the appropriate badges name hanley thought for a moment before answering make them redman security services as in redford and newman you got it hanley said the sting it will take me twenty minutes or so to make the badges nixon said but send the three operatives down right away i can fit the uniforms while the patches are forming they will be there shortly hanley said in closing hanley glanced at a clipboard in the control room most of the corporation stockholders were already assigned to functions of operations extraction or backup his remaining choices were an assistant chef rick barrett a propulsion engineer named sam pryor and a middleaged man who worked in the armory gunther reinholt none had ever worked on the operations end but beggars cant be choosers get me reinholt pryor and barrett hanley said to one of the communications operators and have them meet me in the magic shop the operator began paging the men dont worry murphy said to halpert it just smells like marijuana murphy was waving what looked like an incense stick near the members of the band when cabrillo walked into the conference room smells like a grateful dead concert in here he said murphy walked closer and let the smoke waft over the chairman its the little things he said with a grin that makes the corporation successful the real band was sober cabrillo noted but ho doesnt know that cabrillo nodded listen up dick truitt has managed to get three more operatives inside the men will be dressed as security guards ill have the company name shortly be careful because there might be other guards ho already hired dont slip up and mistake ours for them just then cabrillos telephone rang he listened then disconnected redman security is the name on our guys uniforms he said to the group a moment later julia huxley walked into the room wow kasim said huxley was dressed in a pair of formfitting leather pants that laced up the side and showed two panels of leg from foot to hip her top was a metalstudded vest that barely covered her ample bosom around her neck was a strap of leather with a dshaped hook and one of her arms was decorated with a flowing tattoo of barbed wire and flower vines her hair was teased and coated with hair spray in a wild fashion and her makeup was bold and thickly applied fiveinch pumps and a dusting of glitter on her exposed skin completed the picture slutty enough for you boys she asked i didnt know the magic shop had such costumes in stock halpert said huxley walked over to halpert and rubbed herself along his side as the lead singer he of course was the one who got the girl what do you mean she asked this is from my own collection huxley was lying of coursebut then this entire operation was a façade now who would argue kasim said that americas not the greatest country in the world ross was checking the smoke machines when ho walked out onto the lawn miss iselda he said as he walked over i have a new piece of artwork ive decided i want to display out here on the lawn ross watched ho carefully the man was gesturing toward one side of the tent he looked back at her expectantly there was no hint he found anything amiss is it a painting ross asked no its a statue ho said two workers were waiting alongside the colored lights near the smoke machine take a break for a few moments ross said the men walked into the shade of the tent describe it to me ross asked six foot tall and made of gold ho said ross quickly thought perhaps we could place the object thereshe pointed a few feet awayat the end of the red carpet leading into the tent as sort of a sentinel ho and ross walked over to the spot i could light it with blue and red spotlights she said what else ho asked ross racked her brain what could help the corporation with the theft what do you think about some billowing clouds of smoke she said slowly so the object seems to appear and disappear like a mirage excellent ho said eagerly ross smiled out of the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse of a trio of men from the oregon they were dressed in security guards uniforms somehow her team had sent help barrett acting as the leader of the guards walked over to where she and ho were standing are you mr ho he said im ho the insurance company sent us barrett placed a finger to his eye and winked at ross when ho was not looking good ho said im glad you arrived so quickly this is iselda shes in charge of planning we were just now figuring out the best place to place the object you will be guarding barrett nodded were thinking there ho said pointing near the entrance to the tent barrett scanned the grounds as if to determine the security of the spot he turned back to ho and spoke my company mentioned it was a statue right ho said a sixfoottall buddha barrett nodded as if he were weighing his options is it heavy he asked it weighs about six hundred pounds ho said why do you ask well sir barrett said i thought you might want it to be more of a part of the festivitiesyou know have it moved from place to place as the party proceeds six hundred pounds is too heavy for my men to move however ross was catching on you mean to have the statue become one of the guests she said eagerly something like that the guard admitted the object would actually be safer the more people that are around interesting ho said the partys almost ready to start ross said but i could see if i could scrounge up some other buddha statues and do an entire theme in that direction what do you mean ho asked maybe i could find some plaster buddha statues and have them placed around the grounds ross said that would help with security barrett admitted by confusing the real and the fakes do you think you can ho asked dont worry mr ho ross said my company can work miracles the band was assembled in the conference room on the oregon hanley and cabrillo were walking them through their lastminute instructions as you know we have three more men inside cabrillo said posing as security so we dont need to worry about getting it down to ground level it should already be there thats a plus franklin noted so the actual removal from the site has become easier hanley said but we have the added problem of more witnesses that means we almost certainly need to drug the guests kasim noted its beginning to look that way cabrillo admitted the playlist features three sets hanley continued that gives us two breaks between sets when you as members of the band can move freely about watch the chairman for the lead and be flexiblethis entire caper is still unfolding do we have the plane waiting to receive the icon after the theft halpert asked arranged cabrillo said a plane is inbound as we speak whens the extraction scheduled monica asked ten minutes before midnight tonight hanley said the oregon sails away from here sometime tomorrow cabrillo said no matter what the outcome so lets just do our jobs and take our leave a little richer for the effort murphy said smiling thats the idea cabrillo agreed thin tendrils of richly scented incense smoke wafted toward the ceiling in the ama temple a scattering of tourists filed through the public areas and left offerings at the foot of various buddhas they walked on the pebbled paths sat on the carved wooden benches on the grounds and stared at the sea in reflection it was a place of tranquillity a port of serenity in a storm of confusion and haste winston spenser was not feeling calm fear gripped him the golden buddha was laughing at himof that he was sure the calm gaze and unmoving solidness made him uneasy spenser dreamed of when he would be rid of the curse and collect his money he could see it in his mind the armoredcar company picking up the icon again and delivering it to the software billionaires plane the crates of money he would receive he rose from the bench in the main temple then walked out the door and down the hillside to his waiting limousine the parking lot was half empty most of the people in macau were preparing for the parade and tonights parties a pair of motorcycles sat off to one side under a tree spenser didnt notice themhe was wrapped up in his own certain failure climbing in the rear of the limousine he gave the driver directions a few moments later the limousine rolled out of the lot ive seen what i need to see one of the motorcyclists said i agree said the other six chinese valets awaited the first of the guests after showing their invitations to the guard they pulled through the gate drove up the circular drive then climbed from their cars near the front door of the mansion the sun was slowly dipping in the west and the view from the mansion was an expanse of sea lit with the golden hues of a waning sun spenser climbed from the rear of his limousine and stared at the scene he was dressed in a black tuxedo that hid the pools of sweat under his arms squaring his shoulders he walked into the foyer juan cabrillo rolled down the window of the van and handed the guard a slip of paper park over by the garages the guard said then unload your equipment and wheel it around back cabrillo nodded when the gate opened he drove around to the garages then backed the van up near the edge of the lawn showtime he said and the band climbed from the van and began shuttling equipment to the rear of the house cabrillo walked around to the rear of the house seeking ross he saw her in the distance talking on a cell phone several people were standing nearby were the minutemen he said when she had disconnected good ross said the bandstand is over there we have some large speakers cabrillo said that well need some help moving let me summon some help we like to take care of our equipment ourselves cabrillo said we just need some carts ross nodded and turned to one of the caterers this is the leader of the band she said he needs to borrow a few of the carts you use to move the tables the man nodded and motioned to cabrillo right this way mark murphy stood on the bandstand and surveyed the surroundings three large tents were erected forming a y with the band at the far end the bandstand was slightly elevated from the ground and to the rear the back of the tent had slits that opened to provide access electrical cables to power their speakers and lights stretched out under the tent he sat his guitar down and poked through the slit in the back forty feet behind the rear of the tent was part of the wall that formed the boundary of the house to the right side of the y portion of the tent some thirty yards away was the rear wall of the mansion and the doors leading to the kitchens and inside he began to walk the perimeter of the tent at the front or top of the y were the entrances for the guests in the opening between the legs of the y there was a portable fountain and a small wooden platform that was currently empty murphy continued around the other side examining the way the tents were fastened to the ground there were large metal stakes on the edges with guy wires running farther out onto the lawn where they were staked into the earth he stared up long metal poles two per each section of the three separate tents poked through the tops he found a slit in the tent and walked over to one of the poles the bases sat on plastic holders murphy figured it wouldnt take much to bring it all down ho was making his way back to the mansion when he stopped in his tracks several longhaired men were approaching the tent but that didnt concern him what did concern him was the lady that was following ho pivoted on his heel and walked over im stanley ho he said smiling im your host im candace julia huxley said hos eyes were riveted on huxleys ample assets i find this hard to believe ho said but i dont remember meeting you before im with the band candace said smiling wickedly at least i came with them performer ho asked in many ways candace said smiling ho was beginning to get the feeling that if he played his cards right he might get lucky i need to go inside and greet my guests ho said quickly as he saw iselda approaching from the corner of his eye perhaps we could talk later he turned and moved toward the back door of the mansion mr ho ross shouted after him i think we have the placement figured out just take care of it ho said over his shoulder ross passed by huxley slut she whispered lesbian huxley replied max hanley was sitting in a leather chair in the command center of the oregon okay people he said to the trio of operators that remained were a go display from the tree hanley ordered the image from the tiny camera in the tree filled one of the screens in the control room hanley could see cabrillo rolling a cart containing several long speaker boxes across the lawn ross had just passed huxley and was now turning to go back toward the tent murphy popped out from the side of one of the tents as if on cue he turned to the tree and smiled larry hanley said all okay larry king was the corporation member hiding in the tree he adjusted his sniper rifle and then pushed the tiny microphone over his voice box and answered hows the picture boss looks good hanley said you holding up king had been forced to take his position above the party sometime just after am hed been in his perch over twelve hours already there was a good chance hed need to remain there almost that long again i did six days once in indonesia king said this is a piece of cake have you dialed in your fields of fire hanley asked already knowing the answer about a thousand times boss king said swatting away a fly on his arm king was a us armytrained sniper if hanley gave the order he could lob a dozen shots onto the grounds in about as long as it took to sneeze hanley hoped it wouldnt come down to thatbut if one of the crew was in trouble and there was no other choice king was the great equalizer stand by larry hanley said well call you if we need you affirmative king said as he continued to scan the grounds through his scope try the inside of the tent hanley ordered an image filled the screen from a camera that was inserted in the body of cabrillos electric keyboard the image was slightly off juan hanley said cabrillo was pushing the cart around the side of the tent but he could hear through his tiny earpiece youll need to adjust your keyboard slightly to the right were missing a little of the left side of the tent cabrillo made a slight nod to confirm go to the van hanley ordered another picture flicked onto a separate screen that was split in half the cameras had been attached to the vans folding mirrors they were showing a pretty good view of most of the front of the house lincoln was removing a box from the back of the van frankie hanley said franklin lincoln moved out of the back of the van and stared into one of the rearview mirrors as if he were fixing his hair try to leave the van where it is hanley said you guys got lucky and placed it where we have a good field of view lincoln made an okay sign at the mirror okay men hanley said to the operators were the eyes and ears so be alert winston spenser walked into the mansion snagged a glass of champagne from a passing waiter and slurped down half of the flute before approaching the receiving line stanley ho was beaming and shaking hands with each guest that passed ahead of spenser were an australian couple who were just being greeted and directly in front of him was the local portuguese consular agent spenser waited patiently finishing the first glass of champagne and summoning the waiter for another then took his place in front of ho winston ho said smiling its good to see you but youre a little latethe insurance adjuster was already here sorry spenser said i was running late spenser tried to keep moving along but ho reached out and took him by the arm thats all right ho said it seems your timing is perfect ho pointed to the staircase spensers stomach did a backflip the golden buddha strapped to a dolly like a patient in a mental ward was descending the stairs being helped down by the guards from redman security ive decided to display my newest treasure ho said so all the guests can share in the glory dont worry ill let everyone who asks know who helped me handle the acquisition a thousand thoughts raced through spensers mind none of them were good sir spenser began to say but the line was moving along and ho was already preparing to greet the next guest i dont think ill talk to you when we are outside ho said quietly as he turned to shake a couples hands at the rear door hanley said pointing to a screen he flipped a switch on the communication console then spoke into a microphone juan the buddha is being wheeled outside on one of the screens cabrillo could be seen inside the tent checking the connection to his keyboard he raised his head and made a signal that he understood ross walked over to the front of the tents as the buddha was wheeled up then supervised the placement near the fountain the target of all the planning and preparation was now in plain sight chief inspector of the macau constabulary sung rhee watched the statue from his place on the lawn near the rear door of the mansion rhee had known stanley ho since before hed become wealthy he was an acquaintance not a friend the first ship ho had owned the start of his shipping fortune had been a constant thorn in rhees side the chief inspector had been a mere detective at that time assigned to vice and smuggling and he had become convinced ho was moving drugs with the ship rhee had just never been able to catch him in the act hos fortune had grown fast and the chief inspector knew what that usually denotedthe problem was that as the shipowners fortune had swelled so had his power twice in the past decade rhee had been ordered away from hos activities when he was close to amassing enough evidence to bring charges now rhee was beginning to understand that as ho legitimized his holdings he probably never would pay the price for his past shady dealings rhee had been invited to the party in an unofficial capacitywindow dressing for the guests like the mayor the ambassadors of various countries and the minor royalty who were present rhee was here today to add to the theme of legitimacy ho so desperately craved he was a propbut that didnt make the police officer inside him take leave he stared at the chunk of gold and tried to decide how if it was up to him he would steal it rhee stared around the grounds trying to imagine an escape route the wall surrounding the grounds almost insisted on a departure through the main gate the fact that the object was being placed out in the open actually helped the security it would almost certainly always be in view of someone he glanced around again then shook his head slightly rhee concluded theft was not a problem and went inside for some shrimp puffs a dark green mercedesbenz limousine pulled up to the gate and the driver was waved through tom reyes the driver swung around on the circular driveway and positioned the passenger door near the front door of the mansion he then climbed out and opened the door to the rear compartment and helped the occupant out once crabtree was standing alongside the limousine reyes raced to the front door and said to the butler this is princess aalborg of denmark the butler stood aside as she swept into the foyer in a rustle of satin and lace then walked toward ho who was now standing alone princess aalborg reyes announced from two steps behind ho bent over and lightly kissed the proffered hand then raised his head and smiled im honored to have you visit my humble home charmed monica crabtree said in a bizarre accent ho snapped his fingers and a waiter instantly appeared may i offer you a libation champagne with a strawberry would be nice crabtree said ho motioned to the waiter who scurried off jeeves crabtree said to the driver ill be fine nowyou may take your leave reyes backed away a distance then turned and walked toward the front door moving the limousine away from the front of the mansion reyes parked in a spot near the garage and climbed out then he walked around to the front of the limousine tilted back his cap and lit a cigarette monica is safely inside hanley reported to cabrillo twilight fell over the grounds with a light breeze that brought the smell of the sea a few miles away at the staging area for the parade the engines of the lead floats came to life the marching band that was the first group to walk the route began to assemble in orderly rows awaiting the signal to begin macau began to settle in for the night and in the highrises in the city center and along the waterfront lights began to flicker on out to sea the navigation lights of the ships approaching port began to be visible and the scattering of airplanes both inbound and outbound appeared as light specks in the distant sky all of the guests had arrived and the front lawn of the mansion looked like a luxury car dealership there were jaguars and bmws a single lamborghini a pair of ferraris twelve limousines a lone armored humvee and an old rollsroyce crowded the lawn on the wall along the road the security cameras swept back and forth but no more cars approached and the guard tired of watching the monitor so no one noticed when a pair of motorcycles drove slowly past if someone had and they were knowledgeable they might have noticed that one of the motorcycles sidecars had been enlarged and reinforced the modifications were barely perceptible but if you looked closely you could see that there was a heavyduty training wheel underneath and that the passenger seat had been removed and made into a cargo compartment the motorcycles continued north to the stop sign then turned left and headed in the direction of the inner port the bikers had an appointment to keep in a place not too far distant the band was performing a sound check the wall of speakers behind the bandstand lent an air of fullon rock concert but the actual sound coming out of them was less than one would have thought unless someone was standing directly in front of the speaker wall hed have no way to tell that many of the speakers were not functioning some were hollow shells others held items that would be needed for the operation ross walked over and spoke to cabrillo the first set starts at seven she said are you ready cabrillo stared at the players then at the crowd that was still milling about the tent some seated more still flitting from table to table ill put the background music on in a second that should signal were about to begin he walked over to the main console and adjusted a switch at the sound of the music the crowd began to make their way to their assigned seats stanley ho was standing just inside one of the tents on the left side of the y he was attempting to regale huxley with stories of his vast wealth and power i love the buddha huxley said smiling perhaps you have some other artwork you could show me later id be glad to ho said in fact there are many pieces in my upper office that might interest you maybe we could slip away later and take a look id like that huxley said ho nodded greedily he was already imagining the possibilities the suicide blonde might offer his libidoif he needed to ignore his guests for the opportunity so be it i need to go to the front and make my introductions now ho said but we can meet later huxley smiled and slinked away ho walked through the crowd stopping at various tables to gladhand his guests a few minutes later he was standing in front of the bandstand im stanley ho he said to halpert might i use your microphone to make an introduction halpert handed his microphone to ho who tapped the top to be sure it was working ladies and gentlemen he said the crowd quieted down id like to welcome you to my good friday party the crowd clapped i hope that you are finding the food and drink to your liking another round of applause i hope each of you has a chance to view my latest acquisition a goodluck charm i have displayed the piece at the entrance to the tent like another we honor tonight he signifies enlightenment and spirituality and that is the theme of this evenings festivities now if we could take a second to remember those that have sacrificed themselves for our freedoms the crowd was silent thank you ho said a few moments later we will have fireworks and light displays tonight as well as an excellent band straight from california in the united states please join me in welcoming the minutemen he handed the microphone back to halpert at the same time the lights in the tent began to dim until a single spotlight illuminated halperts back which was turned from the crowd the band keyed their instruments and the opening notes of the eagles song already gone began pulsing through the crowd halpert swung around and began to belt out the lyrics more than any one thing the key to a successful robbery is stealth the pair of men on the motorcycles knew this and they moved quietly through the ama temple toward their target the tourists had gone home for the night and most of the monks were in the dining hall partaking of their simple evening meal the side room where their target stood was dimly lit and the men who were dressed in black clothes and face masks blended into the air like whispery goblins there he is one man whispered the man was pushing a heavyduty dolly stolen from a rental store the previous night he wheeled it over examined the artifact then waited while his partner closed the door on the wooden crate and tilted it so the other man could slide the dolly underneath after securing it with straps they began to make their way toward the door winston spenser was past wine and into cognac he was pleasantly buzzed and beginning to feel that he might just accomplish his goal he glanced at his watch he had some time before he needed to slip away and meet the armoredcar company at the temple then he would make his way to the airport and consummate the sale with the software billionaire by first light hed be on his way away from here then hed take a break from all the drinking finishing the snifter he motioned to a passing waiter for a refill then he turned to one of the guests seated next to him excellent band they truly are crabtree replied two hundred and twentyseven miles from macau in the south china sea the burgundy jet was passing over tungsha island inbound for landing the software billionaire walked forward fastening a sash around his black silk kimono the ladies are tired he said with a barely hidden trace of pride could you prepare pitchers of coffee orange juice and some pastries and take them to the rear immediately the blondhaired man said leaping to his feet continuing forward the billionaire knocked on the cockpit door the copilot opened the door sir he asked how far out are we less than half an hour the copilot said glancing at his navigational chart have you arranged for refueling all taken care of sir the pilot said turning his head toward the cockpit door passing through the galley the billionaire could smell the coffee brewing about a half hour and well be on the ground he said as he passed the blondhaired man waited until he was gone then removed a digital pager from his belt and pushed a few buttons then he winked at the other flight attendant and resumed his preparations the trio of redman security officers glanced up as the band was finishing the last song in the first set then sam pryor turned toward a camera and touched his nose back on the oregon max hanley reached for a microphone julia he said you can start now huxley slipped from behind the speaker wall and motioned to halpert cabrillo lincoln and murphy began to remove a few speakers from the bank behind them ho walked over you have two more sets he said we have some electrical glitches cabrillo told him three of the tower speakers arent working dont worrythey havent worked yet and we sound all right do you want me to take them back to the truck huxley asked thats part of your job halpert said ho stared at huxley the thought of his suicide blonde becoming sweaty disturbed him ill have one of the guards give you a hand ho said miss candace asked earlier if she might have a tour of my home okay mr ho cabrillo said well move them around to the front of the tent then have one of the guards help us put them in the van whatever ho said now candymay i show you my home ross motioned to the caterer before the second set mr ho wants to make a special toast the passion fruit punch the caterer said correct ross said just before the main meal is served thats the plan ill go ahead and ice down the punch then the caterer said you look busy here ross said ill take care of the punch when the chef had his back turned ross removed the flask of liquid and broke the seal the viscous fluid was a strange blue green with flecks of what looked like powdered silver she swirled it around then poured it into the vat taking a wooden spoon she stirred the mixture and added a block of ice the caterer was on the far end of the kitchen talking to the chef ross called across the room have the punch transferred to the crystal pitchers and taken into the tent she said then order the waiters to begin serving the caterer waved a hand in reply and ross walked back outside signal from ross larry king said on board the oregon hanley was watching the monitors we saw it too larry hanley zoomed in on the buddha reinholt pryor and barrett were standing in a delta formation around the object while to the left three large speaker stacks sat on carts awaiting removal as soon as ho makes his toast and the band resumes we can begin the extraction hanley said did anyone see where ho went he headed inside with huxley king noted ive got him on audio in the upper office one of the operators on the oregon said put him on speaker hanley ordered its a manet ho was saying i always get monet and manet confused huxley said but then art is not my strong suit what exactly is your strong suit ho asked just then hanley keyed the tiny earpiece in huxleys ear julia he whispered you need to have ho get back to the tent and make the toast now its something i need to show you not tell you candace purred but it takes some time once the band starts the next set and my boyfriend is busy id feel a lot safer safer is good ho said huxley walked over to ho and rubbed her ample assets against his side ill quickly go make the toast he said with a growing need i need to make an appearance too huxley said then well have plenty of time ho motioned to the door and the pair started out of the office inside the tent the waiters were clearing away the appetizers then they began to pour the punch from crystal pitchers into small glass cups at each setting most of the guests had returned to their seats by the time ho walked through the center of the tent toward the stage snagging a cup of punch from a passing waiter he continued toward the stage mark murphy was setting the last of the charges around the perimeter of the grounds and tent he pocketed a small remote trigger then walked around to the rear of the stage juan cabrillo was standing off to one side of the stage staring at the crowd crabtree had her large purse on the floor next to her and she moved her foot to make sure it was at her feet kasim lincoln and halpert stood off to one side awaiting their cues at the front of the tent the trio from redman security paced nervously ho walked over to cabrillo is the pa system on just a second cabrillo said as he flicked a switch okay sir ho tapped the microphone to see that it was working the monk walked out from the dining room then stopped in his tracks there was a banner with arabic writing stretched across the alcove where the golden buddha had been placedbut the massive golden icon was nowhere to be seen he raced back to the dining room to alert the others a dozen monks in yellow robes entered the main temple after appraising the situation the head of the monks walked into the office and lifted up the telephone why dont they make dollies with brakes one of the motorcyclists said as he dug in his heels to slow the descent down the hill outside the temple the other man was in front of the dolly trying to slow buddha down but the loose soil was not allowing him much purchase and he was sliding downhill fast drop it down and dig in the rear he whispered with more of a slide than a controlled descent they reached the bottom of the hill once they had regained control of the dolly they quickly wheeled it over to the motorcycle sidecar and cut the straps the man at the front lowered the door on the sidecar lets get him in he said at just that instant a gong on the grounds of the temple started sounding damn the first man said as the two wrestled the chunk of metal into the sidecar i figured wed at least be out of the parking lot before someone caught on ill strap him down the second man said you start your engine the man climbed aboard the motorcycle and pushed the starter the engine roared to life the second man finished with securing the buddha and walked over to his motorcycle and started the engine looking up the hill he caught a glimpse of several monks starting down and he beeped his horn the first man turned his head and upon seeing the monks stumbling down the hill reached for the clutch then toed the motorcycle into gear he twisted the throttle and began driving out of the parking lot again ho said thank you all for coming before i make a toast lets give a round of applause to the minutemen the crowd clapped now ho said if you will all raise your glasses he paused to peace and prosperity on this holy day he said let us all remember the sacrifices the few have made so that the many may find peace ho tipped the glass cup to his lips and took a drink the crowd followed suit the dinner will be served now ho said and in a second the band will begin again the potion is in hanley said to everyone listening we move in five minutes sometimes if you know where to look a person can realize that life is a wellorchestrated ballet if one is in tune seemingly unrelated events begin to reveal themselves if there were someone high above the party what he would see right now would be two distinctly different groups the people from the corporation began to move like pieces on a chessboard while those who were part of the party seemed to act as a single unit sung rhee tried to focus his eyes but the view of the inside of the tent was ebbing and flowing specks of blue dotted the far edges of his peripheral vision then he saw what he thought was a yellowandred weasel out of the corner of his eye but when he moved his head it was gone at just that instant his cellular telephone rang rhee i can barely hear you sir one of his detectives said rhee stared at the tiny telephone he was holding it a foot from his mouth as if unable to gauge distances he tried to move it to the proper place but he slammed it into his temple hows that he asked better sir we just received a call from the head abbot at the ama temple they report that a pair of men has just stolen a large golden buddha they had on display rhee thought for a second the buddha was right outside the tent thats all right rhee said i saw our friend earlier what are you talking about sir rhee stared at the floral arrangement in the center of the table the head of a tiny horse appeared and spoke in a british accent take me for a ride it said listen you rhee said my horse is here sir the detective said im coming over there right away rhee dropped the telephone and turned to the person next to him see my horse the person was a troll and he was speaking in a language rhee could not understand over the roar of the motorcycle engine a siren came from just over the hill the two men shut off the engines and listened the sound neither grew louder nor diminished good the first man said theyre stuck in traffic just like we planned lets do it the second man said they started their engines and roared away detective ling po was screaming into the radio as he raced toward the mansion he was a half mile away when the traffic ground to a stop can anyone reach the temple he shouted the units reported in one at a time only the car along the inner port road was making any progress we have a pair of men on motorcycles that have stolen a large gold buddha he said as he beeped his horn has anyone seen them pass the reports were negative po steered his squad car onto the sidewalk and blaring his horn continued on the band was performing the thin lizzie song the boys are back in town on the oregon hanley was watching the monitors in alarm they had expected some unusual behavior once the potion was administered but what he was seeing was chaos a crowd of guests in tuxedos and evening dresses had suddenly filled the dance floor and several of the ladies were shedding their clothes stanley ho was walking through the tent in a daze he was feeling strange but he had no idea why spotting candace across the tent he began to make his way toward her okay everyone we go in sixty seconds hanley ordered i hear sirens king reported and they are growing closer monica hanley said are you hearing crabtree turned to where she knew the camera was in the keyboard and winked now hanley said crabtree bit down on a packet she had taken from her purse and slipped it inside her mouth ho was a few feet away and she stumbled toward him with foam seeping from the edges of her mouth she grabbed him around his neck and held tight go ahead murph hanley ordered murphy slipped his hand inside his pocket and hit the trigger almost instantly there was a series of explosions like fireworks the outside lights and those inside the tent went dark were a go for switch hanley said at exactly that instant barrett and pryor slid one of the speaker boxes off the cart and opened a back door a goldpainted plaster buddha replica slipped onto the ground at the same time reinholt flipped the edge of the tent over the buddha on display several potted plants placed in the y inside the tent shielded the guards from anyone who might be watching all dark on the western front king said as he scanned the ground through the pale green light of a night scope anyone moving hanley asked king swept across the grounds then down the hillside theres an unmarked police car with a portable light on the roof proceeding along avenida republica hes three hundred and fifty yards distant can you hit at that distance hanley asked oh ye of little faith king said its a car not a bug i doubt i can hit the drivers nose but you never know just a tire larry hanley said hold on king said supporting the rifle on a branch he regulated his breathing then waited until the police car was in his field of fire he was in an almost zen state of concentration when the target appeared it was as if it were in slow motion king squeezed the trigger then willed the bullet to run true inside the rifle the firing pin hit the shell primer and sparked the gunpowder burned and propelled the shell out of the cartridge and sent it spinning through the rifling inside the barrel leaving the end of the barrel and passing through the noise suppressor the slug started down the hill in a straight line toward the target shit po said as his front tire shredded he slowed down and climbed out of the squad car leaving the door open looking back onto the sidewalk he tried to see what he had hit there was nothing visible but that didnt mean anything he stared up the hill to his intended destination then decided the hill was too steep to climb po slid back into the drivers seat and reached for the radio target has stopped and hes calling for help king said good job hanley said hanley was watching the monitors but without lights there was little to see he stared at his watch then glanced at the schedule of actions thirty seconds passed king continued to scan the grounds a few of the kitchen workers had popped out from inside and were clustered around the rear door he swiveled his scope to the front of the house and noticed that the front gate to the driveway had opened automatically when the power was cut ten seconds have you sighted the charge on the fireworks display hanley asked got it king said protect your eyes after the shot hanley said ill switch back to regular sights king agreed we go in five four three two one king squeezed the trigger and hit the explosive packet murphy had laid in place hours earlier the fireworks exploded with a roar roman candles streaked skyward and the large mortarlike devices began to spew forth in belches there was shrieking and thumping sounds as the fireworks began to discharge king rubbed his eyes and stared at the nowlitup scene three flickers from a flashlight at the front of the tent caught his attention i have a signal the switch has been made king noted signal the helicopter hanley said to one of the operators shes having a seizure ho shouted monica crabtree hung on to hos neck and rolled her eyes back in her head a doctor ho knew was dancing on one of the tables nearby but he didnt respond to hos request to come over at just that instant barrett walked over this woman is sick ho said the guard grabbed crabtree and slid her to the ground the inside of the tent was chaos the music was blaring but in the dim light no one noticed the band had left the stage hos head was spinning and he was having trouble concentrating the guard placed his lips over crabtrees no tongue please crabtree whispered faking cpr the guard turned to ho this woman is dying call for help ho said the guard reached for the radio on his belt and called for an ambulance juan hanley said the bird is inbound time to pull out cabrillo said to his team round everyone up reinholt and pryor were rolling the cart containing the falsebottomed speakers over the lawn to the far side of the heliport once the cart was positioned they removed green light bars from their pockets and bent them in half the chemical reaction made the tubes glow and they spread them in a crude circle so the helicopter pilot would know where to land the scene inside the tent was absolutely chaotic people were singing howling dancing and prancing sung rhee was groping a woman at his table the mayor of macau was drinking the water out of the table arrangement only winston spenser seemed composed when his stomach was upset he was sensitive to fruit juice he had faked the toast and was beginning to see something was terribly wrong right then he felt a prick on his neck a second later his head slumped over on the table the traffic opened up for a second and the police car racing along the inner port road managed to make some headway in the distance the officer managed to glimpse the motorcycles making a turn onto calcada da barra pushing the gas pedal to the floor he raced after the retreating pair of motorcycles i have them in sight he shouted over the radio theyre northwest on calcada the man aboard the motorcycle carrying the buddha glanced in his rearview mirror and saw the police car approaching he waved his hand in the air and the second motorcyclist turned his head dropping back a little he waited until the police car was right behind him then he reached over and tripped a lever on his sidecar stanley hos meticulously planned party had deteriorated into a bacchanalia juan cabrillo walked over to where ho was standing next to the prone crabtree ho was in a daze there were so many things happening his drugaddled brain could not comprehend them all a few moments ago the lesbian party planner had come to him and said that she could not figure out how to restore the lights inside the tent and offered to have some workers raise some of the side panels to allow the scant natural moonlight to filter inside it was now a little brighter inside the tent but many of the guests had started wandering outside onto the lawn sir the security guard said the roads are choked with traffic and the ambulances cant get through they recommended an air evacuation ho stared down a minor member of a royal family expiring at his party would definitely put a crimp in his social aspirations do it ho said through the fog in his brain i already did the guard admitted but we have another problem that was all ho needed what is it theres another guest slumped over the guard said pointing toward spenser have him taken out too ho said juan cabrillo spoke mr ho some of my band is feeling queasy we indulged in some of the appetizers and i think something was bad id recommend we end this party and have the guests seek medical attention immediately the entire affair was collapsing before hos eyes the band wants to leave cabrillo said were going to pull our van around to the rear and load up our equipment i need the pa system to make an announcement ho said we already broke it down cabrillo told him but we have a portable megaphone we can let you use ill go get it from the van ho turned to the security guard who is watching the buddha the other two guards he said id recommend we place it back inside take it to my office ho ordered the sound of an approaching helicopter grew louder the guard reached for his walkietalkie and ordered the buddha to be moved upstairs then he reached down and lifted crabtree and cradled her in his arms he started walking out of the tent toward the landing zone cabrillo raced across the grounds to the van once inside he adjusted the outside mirror and stared into the camera were collecting the props he said as he twisted the key and started the engine on the oregon max hanley was watching the unfolding scene with amazement the two distinct groups were obvious the corporation members were moving about in a blur of motion and action while the rest of the party seemed caught in a haze of indecision and disbelief the element of chaos in the surroundings was complete it was almost time to stoke the fires of escape murph lincoln halpert hanley said juans coming around with the van load up fast and make your way to the front of the mansion he saw the waves of acknowledgment ross dispose of the punch and the doctored appetizers left on the tables larry hanley asked what do you see the policeman is leaning against the front of his car waiting for help i think we can count him out for now one of the guards has just left the tent carrying monica hes making his way to extraction point one king scanned the grounds with the scope two of the guards are wheeling the faux buddha toward the rear door as i speak good hanley said everything is in play you can make your egress anytime you deem fit if you make your way along the wall and wait by the street ill have juan slow the van down as he passes understand king said he began to break down the rifle and fit it into its case once that was done he climbed down to the edge of the wall and began to make his way west who havent we used hanley asked one of the operators who stared quickly at the list of participants truitt the operator replied wheres julia last we saw her she was going back inside the tent the operator said but since the chairman broke down the keyboard set weve lost the camera inside dick hanley said if you can hear me signal someone in our team cabrillo pulled the van to the rear of the tent it had been slow going with all the people wandering the grounds he slid the van into park and opened the door truitt appeared at the rear of the tent and motioned to the camera in the vans mirror dick i need you to find julia hanley said she immobilized the art dealer carry him to the landing zone then i want the two of you to exit via crabtrees limousine truitt gave the camera a thumbsup and raced away the members of the team were tossing the remaining speakers and electronics into the rear of the van out over nam van lakes the landing lights of the helicopter were visible and growing brighter the thumping of the rotor blades increased as the helicopter drew near inside the tent it was pandemonium truitt found huxley talking to ho who seemed unable to move from where he stood too much was happening his brain could not put it all into place the megaphone he said in a daze i have to warn the guests who has it truitt asked ho the band ho said the band said they had one i just saw them at the rear of the tent truitt said you should go there ho raced off truitt reached over and whispered in huxleys ear wheres the art dealer huxley led him over and she and truitt carried spenser out onto the grounds the helicopter pilot slowed his forward speed and initiated a hover the eurocopter ec that the corporation had leased was a sweet machineit hung in the air with little input from the controls reaching to the radio on the control panel the pilot changed the radio frequency im waiting he said to the oregon what do you see hanley asked the pilot flicked on his landing lights i have two people carrying a body to the zone the pilot said everything else is in place as soon as they reach the zone touch down hanley said but watch for another party who will be arriving well need four to get the object aboard tom hanley said crabtrees limousine driver was behind the wheel of the car he flashed his lights i have a car flashing their lights the pilot said drive onto the lawn and park near the landing zone then load the helicopter the lights flashed again and the limousine began moving he heard you the pilot said hanley was pacing back and forth there were several carefully timed actions occurring as long as everyone followed the plan the team would be out in a few more minutes this was what the corporation called critical time the time when it could all go to hell in seconds juans waving one of the operators said pointing to a monitor just then ho wandered over what are you doing he asked cabrillo turned and smoothed his hair back just checking my hair ho nodded you said you had a megaphone i could use cabrillo nodded and reached between the seats removed the megaphone and handed it to ho its battery operated he said just flick that switch ho flicked it on testing it worked he stared into the van where the rest of the band members were sprawled across the seats and atop the cases of equipment wheres candace ho asked his head was starting to clear that was dangerous we are going to meet her around front cabrillo said as he climbed into the drivers seat now i need to get my people to the hospital tell her she can stay if she wants ho said ill mention it cabrillo said as he twisted the key then placed the van in gear and slowly began to steer through the crowd ho wandered back into the tent he was thinking clearer now the megaphone was not that powerful but if he could find a spot above the crowd they would probably be able to hear his warning his officehis office was on the top floor the helicopter pilot touched down and truitt opened the rear door then truitt barrett reyes and huxley struggled to slide the crate inside the cargo area once the golden buddha was safely stowed they laid spenser on the floor and helped crabtree inside truitt slid the door closed then slapped it twice to signal the pilot to lift off then they bent over and protected their faces from the rotor wash as the eurocopter lifted back into the air once the helicopter was safely away reyes stood up im supposed to give you guys a ride he said easily at that instant reinholt and pryor had just reached the bottom stair they opened the front door and walked out onto the driveway the door had only been shut a few seconds before ho raced to the first step and headed up to his office whats the playlist hanley asked an operator the helicopter has crabtree the limo contains reyes barrett truitt and huxley with reyes driving cabrillo has the band inside the van the operator pointed to the screen they are just past the end of the tent and will be on the driveway momentarily wheres ross there on the grounds the operator said pointing the van containing the band was passing and she came into view a few minutes before ross had ordered the waiters to dump all the cups of punch then she wheeled the cart containing the pitchers outside and tipped it over linda hanley ordered go to your car now i want you out of there ross began walking quickly to the front who else hanley asked king is on the wall awaiting extraction the other two guards should be in front now and thats it the operator noted is the van full hanley said to cabrillo cabrillo mouthed yes in the mirror the van rolled onto the drive with the mercedesbenz limousine directly to the rear ross followed the retreating motorcade she reached the peugeot and started the engine slow at the front door and tell the guards they will be catching a ride with ross hanley said to cabrillo who acknowledged the instruction a second later he slowed the van and explained then continued down the driveway toward the gate the first team was almost off the property stanley ho opened the door to his office he started toward the window to warn the guests then stopped dead in his tracks cabrillo made it out the gate and turned right slow along the corner of the wall hanley ordered the king is coming the limousine was not far behind the van it slowed at the gate to turn at the same instant ross pulled up at the front door and reinholt and pryor climbed inside the peugeot she steered toward the gate close the gate ho screamed the electricitys out the guard said the gates are locked open you need to stop anyone from leaving ho shouted ross was twenty feet from the gate when the guard burst from the guard shack fumbling with his holster ross never hesitated never faltered she steered toward the guard and hit the gas at the same second the guard was making a lifeanddeath choice cabrillo heard a thump as larry king jumped from the wall and landed on the roof of the van sliding off the roof still holding the case containing his sniper rifle he opened the passenger door tossed the case between the seats and climbed into halperts lap the limousine passed the stopped van and then blew through the stop sign at the end of the street the front gate guard could not get his weapon out of the holster as the peugeot accelerated toward him he could only jump out of the way ross blew through the gate at nearly fifty miles an hour then stomped on the brakes and twisted the wheel to the stops the peugeot slid around in a hard right turn ross hit the gas cabrillos van was moving again he raced through the stop sign and turned right following the limousine just as the guard made it to the middle of the street in front of the mansion and removed his sidearm sighting down the barrel he began to squeeze off rounds the first hit the left rear taillight the second and third went wide the fourth entered the rear window and shattered the rearview mirror at the same instant ross passed the stop sign and did a lefthand turn toward the water once the lever was pulled back the cargo inside the sidecar of the motorcycle began sliding down a chute and spilling onto the road the small metal orbs were about the size of marbles but were shaped like childrens jacks the difference with these jacks was that the dozen points sticking out were razorsharp they bounced off the asphalt and spread across the road the motorcycle accelerated away as the police car hit the patch of metal shards the two front tires exploded followed a second later by the rears the police car careened out of control as the officer fought with the wheel while at the same time stomping on the brakes the police car slid hard to the left slammed into a newspaper rack then into a telephone pole just beyond the rack a microsecond later the air bag deployed and slammed the policeman back against the seat by the time the cloud of powder from the airbag inflating cleared the motorcycles were two blocks away after pushing the bag away from his face the officer reached for the radio ive crashed and lost them he said detective ling po was monitoring the radio inside his unmarked squad car as the tow truck pulled alongside headquarters had just reported the robbery at the mansion and po knew his immediate superior sung rhee had been scheduled to attend po had no idea why rhee was not already coordinating the efforts to capture the thieves a few minutes before hed heard the report from the officer chasing the motorcyclists who had robbed the ama temple and he was beginning to think the two were related he jumped out of the car and ran over to the tow truck hook this up fast he said then tow me up to estrada da penha right away the driver said po reached into his car and removed a portable radio he continued listening as the driver hooked his car to the rear a few moments later they were on their way around the hill then up to the mansion eight minutes later the tow truck stopped on the street outside the wall around the mansion and po raced toward the gate a guard stood in the dark near his shack and po flashed his badge detective ling po he said quickly macau police im glad youre here the guard said mr ho is going crazy tell me what happened po said the guard related what had occurred i got off a few shots he said but they kept going po made notes on the vehicles descriptions and radioed them in to headquarters i want a countrywide bulletin issued if anyone sees the vehicles he is to follow them but not make a stop unless he has backup after headquarters had confirmed his request po turned to the guard have you seen any other officers here tonight he asked my boss a mr rhee was scheduled to attend i saw him when he came the guard noted he hasnt left po nodded and raced up the driveway cutting across the lawn he made his way to the front door and flung it open stanley ho was sitting in the front living room on the couch a portable telephone at his ear chief inspector rhee was in a chair nearby what happened sir po asked rhee rhee rubbed his face before answering i think i was druggedmy head is starting to clear but im still having trouble concentrating po nodded then listened to ho on the telephone what do you mean he shouted we called the emergency number we have no record of any call the operator said well get back to you ho said disconnecting who are you he asked po this is detective ling po rhee answered one of my best men heres the situation ho said a priceless piece of artwork i owned was stolen tonight what exactly sir po asked a sixfoottall solidgold buddha figure ho said a similar icon was heisted from the ama temple earlier tonight po said i doubt that is a coincidence that makes me feel better ho said sarcastically the telephone call you just completed po asked what was that about a guest became ill and we called a helicopter ambulance to take her to the hospital ho said only the hospital has no record of our request did you call for the helicopter no it was a security guard ho said but i was standing right there ill question the guard po said thats the problem rhee interjected the guards are gone did you hire them yourself po asked the insurance company supplied them ho admitted which company po asked ho retrieved a card from his tuxedo and po dialed the number after explaining who he was he grilled the company operator left his cell phone number and then hung up shes calling her boss mr ho po said but she has no record of any contact with you in the last month thats nonsense ho said they had an underwriter come out here and everything was he your usual agent the detective asked suddenly it all became very clear to ho hed been set up from the start those bastards ho screamed sweeping his arm across a side table he spilled the knickknacks on the floor then threw a chair against the wall calm down mr ho detective po said quietly and tell me what has happened from the start hanley watched the blips on the gps screen showing the progress of the van limousine and peugeot all were progressing according to plan so he flipped over the page in the playbook time to report the kidnappings he said to an operator the man dialed the macau police and gave them lassiters address then he did the same with iselda two minutes later police cars were racing to the separate scenes it was one more element of confusion and discord in an already confusing situation below ama temple near the maritime museum linda ross slid the peugeot to a stop and climbed out reinholt who was sitting in the passenger seat had been hit by the bullet that had shattered the rearview mirror and was bleeding from his right ear help him to the boat she said to pryor then she raced over to the dock where a thirtyfootlong highperformance scarab sat waiting climbing aboard she raced to the helm and started the motors once the engines had settled into an idle she climbed off again and walked toward the peugeot get him aboard and keep his head elevated she said as pryor scurried past then she took the keys to the peugeot opened the trunk and stared inside twisting a timer she waited to make sure that it was counting down then raced back to the boat can you drive this she asked pryor damn straight he said as he engaged the drives ross started to administer first aid to reinholt as the scarab pulled away from the dock the boat was one hundred yards from the dock and just climbing up on plane when the peugeot erupted in a fireball that lit the night sky we have an explosion near the maritime museum the dispatcher reported to po summon fire and rescue po said whats the status on the kidnapping calls units are just now arriving at the first scene the dispatcher said its a home in the northern section a second group should be at the highrise location in a few moments keep me posted po said walking to the window and staring at the column of smoke in the distance on the front seat of the limousine next to reyes barrett started removing his redman security uniform he was wearing a pair of lightweight slacks and a black tshirt underneath so rick do you like the galley or operations better huxley asked huxley was in the rear compartment with richard truitt she had pulled a sleeveless blue sweater over her leather top and was now fumbling around inside the sweater unfastening her vest once she got it off and slid it out from under the sweater she rolled down the window and tossed it out barrett had been watching the entire affair through the rearview mirror i cant say the galley is quite this exciting he admitted truitt flicked on a light in the center console of the limousines rear compartment then removed a fake mustache from a small clutch and slapped it on his face once it was straight he removed a set of false teeth from the same bag and slapped them over his own he stared at the results in the mirror he was rubbing gray liquid from a small bottle in the bag as he spoke by now theyre on the lookout for this vehicle he said reyes reached to his chest and pulled on his limo drivers uniform shirt it ripped cleanly away revealing another shirt underneath tearing at the tabs on his pants he unleashed the pleats sunglasses he said to truitt who handed them over the seat he placed them over his eyes at the same time huxley ripped the velcroattached legs off her leather pants and reached into a compartment in the rear of the limousine and removed a conservative skirt which she slipped under herself and zipped up peeling off her false eyelashes she took a plastic bag from truitt and removed a wet cloth and scrubbed her face clean of the garish makeup looks like were good to go truitt said reyes pulled to the side of the road and the four climbed out walking through an alley they made their way toward the main market and split into groups of two back on the street the limousine sat running with the door open a police officer would find it there in less than ten minutes but the vehicle had been cleaned of clues and there would not be much to report cabrillo touched the garage door opener halfway down the block and the door began to rise once the van was inside and the door had shut again everyone piled out they have descriptions of everyone by now he said quickly as he popped the top off a fiftyfivegallon drum containing their change of clothes and disguises so change fast and make an exit removing a folder from the top of the clothes he set it aside and quickly dressed once he was changed and the others were doing the same he opened the packet and began to remove documents a couple of you are staying in town tonight he said removing passports and hotel reservation forms we dont want too much traffic heading back to the oregon as always the rule is no boozing and stay where we can reach you so if theres a change we can alert you he handed out the various assignments then stared at the group so far so good he said just as a siren approached cabrillo ran over to a window but the car continued past the building fire truck he said ross must be safely away he walked back to the group okay men he said make like an egg and scramble filing out through a side door the men went their separate ways pryor steered the scarab around the end of the southern peninsula then set a course for where the oregon was anchored ross stepped into the opening between the seats next to the helm hows he doing pryor asked over the noise of the racing boat not too good ross said hes lost some blood and the top of his ear as well is he in pain damn right it hurts reinholt said we should contact the oregon pryor said so they can have the clinic ready were on radio silence ross said the authorities might hear pryor turned and looked back at his fallen friend reinholt smiled gamely the oregons monitoring all the frequencies right he asked ground sea and air ross agreed and we need to maintain silence on the marine bands right but the helicopter can talk because if it goes silent air traffic control will know somethings up right yeah ross said suddenly understanding pryor reached for the walkietalkie on his belt these can sometimes transmit on the aviation bands ross grabbed for it and hit scan a few seconds later a burgundy passed overhead and ross could hear the pilot receiving final clearance pressing talk she gave the call sign for the helicopter a few moments before he had landed and transferred spenser and crabtree to a waiting car he had just returned to remove his headset when the call came in another two minutes and he would have been gone helicopter fourtwo xray alpha he said go ahead sixthree report one indio ross said over the roar of the boats engines sixty three was rosss employee number indio was the code for injured party on the oregon hanley reached for the microphone helicopter fourtwo xray alpha ive got it continue to point agreed sixthree report indio eightfour get me the file on eightyfour hanley shouted to an operator who pulled up reinholts records on the computer screen his blood type was at the top of the chart sixthree understand hanley said bravo affirm sixthree eta in five terminate communications hanley ordered ross clicked the button three times hit the gas she shouted go down to the clinic and check the blood supply hanley said staring at the computer we need ab positive standing ready you he said to another operator go on deck and watch for lindas approach through the night scope as soon as you see the boat approaching flash the deck lights then help her offload the injured party got it the man said racing away at that exact same instant the helicopter pilot was pulling a white chevrolet suv out of a gate at the far end of the runway driving down the road he stopped at a stop sign then merged with the traffic leaving the airport he was just touching thirty miles an hour when two police cars with flashing lights passed and then slowed to turn down the road where he had come from punching the accelerator to pass a bus he turned to crabtree that was close he said crabtree was checking spensers pulse by placing her hand on his jugular true but were free and clear she said the boat slid alongside the oregon and pryor grabbed a line tossed through the air tying the scarab into the sling that would lift it back onto the deck he waited until ross and the operator from the control room had carried off reinholt then he loosened the lines and positioned the scarab in the slings that were already in the water shutting off the engines he climbed off the boat and walked over to a switch on a nearby bulkhead slowly the scarab rose from the water once it was clear of the upper deck he pushed another button that rotated the davits around so the scarab was over the deck the entire operation required only a few minutes and that was good in the distance across the water he could see the sweep of the searchlight from a police patrol boat as soon as the davit stopped in its arc he pushed another switch four of what looked like rusty metal plates rose from the deck of the ship and surrounded the scarab then he pushed another button and a retractable roof slid closed over the vessel by the time the patrol boat passed alongside in the channel the man was already inside and making his way to the clinic in his disguise juan cabrillo looked like an aging academic or a retired bureaucrat not the leader of a group of specialized operatives walking through downtown macau he fiddled with his personal communicator then waited for hanley to answer at this instant his team was about onequarter of the way through the assignment and there was still a host of variables the first part of the operation had gone wellthe team had loaded the buddha onto the helicopter as planned and made a smooth exit but he had no way to know the progress of team two that information would come from the control room on the oregon cabrillo had just passed a goldsmiths shop when his communicator vibrated an address was displayed and he made his way toward the location yes sir the macau police officer said into a cellular telephone both he and his wife were bound and left in bed were they harmed po asked no sir the policeman said in fact whoever did this left music playing on the stereo to entertain them and a note of apology how were they restrained po asked do they have a description of the assailants no the policeman admitted they witnessed nothing both of them have small punctures on their upper arms like they were given shots from a hypodermic needle and they were bound with plastic ties they only awoke when we arrived whoever this crew was they were goodpo had to give them that take the note to the lab he said and make sure the technicians carefully search the house for clues theyre doing that now sir the policeman said good po said ill be in touch he disconnected and turned to rhee they drugged the insurance man and his wife he said quietly and left a note of apology stanley ho was becoming increasingly agitated not only had he been made a fool ofhe had been made a fool of in an open and obvious manner it was that sonofabitch british art dealer so i was set up from the start ho said loudly the countess was fake her illness a ploy and the air evacuation a ruse po raised his hand to be quiet as his telephone rang again po sir the officer said we entered the apartment in the highrise and found a woman named iselda tied up in her closet was she harmed other than severe nicotine deprivation no the officer said shes smoked half a pack of cigarettes since we untied her did she see her assailants she said it was like staring into a mirror the policeman relayed a woman disguised to look like her popped out of the closet and held a rag soaked with something to her mouth thats all she remembers po held his hand over the cell phone and spoke to rhee they switched the party planner ho raised his hands in the air and began cursing carefully search the apartment for clues po ordered then have the kidnapped woman fill out a report at the station house got it boss the officer said as po hung up rhees mind was almost back to normal he paced the living room as he spoke this was a highbudget carefully orchestrated operation he said so lets take a minute and look at what happened from the start the insurance man was a plant ho said they replaced my party coordinator and band with others then put fake guests inside as well it appears they even provided their own security rhee noted the alleged protectors were the thieves just then the tow truck driver who had brought po to the mansion walked into the living room what do you need po asked your tires have been changed the driver said but i found a hole inside the inner fender well what do you mean i think someone shot out your tire the tow truck man said theres probably a slug somewhere inside the engine compartment well look into it po said if the cars ready you can take off just bill my department the tow truck driver walked from the room this is not some haphazard group of thieves rhee noted they have snipers capable of longrange shooting helicopter pilots and masters of disguise they sure as hell arent locals po said quietly oh that makes me feel so much better ho said loudly at least i was robbed by professionals how about you two work on recovering my buddha first then you can play all the mind games you want about their modus operandi at this second there were seventeen macau police officers and two other detectives searching the grounds and mansion in addition a trio of teams had been dispatched to the airport and the two kidnapping sites the entire force had been mobilized and ho was complaining we are doing everything in our power mr ho the detective said were going to catch them ho shook his head with disgust and walked out of the room the parade came down the hill just as the fireworks barge in the inner harbor launched the first several rounds of the evenings display the macau police had moved quickly and surrounded the edges of the route as soon as the pair of motorcyclists had been spotted there was no chance of escape except a shootout it was just a matter of time until the police captured the men the man driving the motorcycle containing the buddha steered down a side street then honked his horn for the crowd to part his partner followed close behind with the sound of sirens growing closer a tall float of a dragon was just ahead at regular intervals his mouth spewed fire on the oregon max hanley stared at the screen then moved the joystick a little to the left the dragon moved to the center of the road on another screen a camera was showing a view from the side hanley caught sight of the motorcycles another screen displayed a gps map of macau with pulsing dots that showed the location of the police cars the net was closing in on the motorcyclists he adjusted the movement of the float again and then stared at the blueprints stolen from the macau public works department cliff hornsby was tired and sweaty staring at his watch he arose from the crate he was sitting on in the storm drain then inflated a lift bag at the base of a metal ladder once that was in place he climbed the rungs of the ladder on the way up he tested the wooden ramp to ensure it was solid finding it fine he touched his hand to the bottom of the manhole cover he had already removed once earlier in the night to make sure that it was free now he just had to wait for the signal hanley stared at the control box gas jets for the fire from the dragons mouth aluminum powder charges for the maelstrom joystick for control just then a voice came over the radio they have blockaded the route at avenida infante d henrique halpert said got it hanley said youre done michael get out of there halpert began walking in the direction of his hotel for the night go now hanley said to the motorcyclists steering the float with the dragon over the top of the manhole cover hanley stopped it in its tracks from the side camera he could see the motorcycles approaching from the side street pop the top hornsby he said over the radio hornsby pushed against the manhole cover and lifted it in the air then he slid it to the side and stared up into the bowels of the beast that had stopped over his lair unclipping a flashlight from his belt he scanned the inside there was a metal frame constructed of welded tubes with a fabric outer layer a round gas canister with tubing was attached to one side another tube with a small explosive charge on the other the explosive charge was flashing with a tiny green light at just that instant hornsby heard the sound of motorcycles approaching and he ducked down the first motorcycle drove under the fabric side wall and slid to a stop inside it was as if he were inside a tent the interior of the dragon float was fifteen feet long and more than eight feet wide and the peaked top reached nearly seven feet above the motorcyclist felt like a kid in a secret fort as he climbed off the seat the second motorcycle steered under the fabric side curtain and stopped hornsby climbed from the hole bob meadows was unfastening his helmet he got it off and tossed it to the side i could see the cops he said quickly theyre right at the end of the street pete jones tossed his helmet aside so be it he said to meadows hey horny meadows said as he began to unfasten the golden buddha from the sidecar jones walked over and dropped the hinged metal sides of the sidecar this is heavy cliff ive got a ramp hornsby said if we walk it to the ground and over to the ramp we can just let goitll slide down to a lift bag at the bottom slick meadows said as he started to wrestle with the buddha hanley stared at the image from the forward camera the macau police had organized and with weapons drawn they were walking carefully through the parted crowd he hit the button for flames and the dragons mouth roared the golden buddha was lined up above the ramp then released it plunged down the wooden ramp onto the lift bag then tumbled over on its side hornsby wrestled the ramp over to one side then motioned to meadows and jones you two first he said pull the ramp aside when you hit bottom ill close the cover meadows and jones started climbing down the ladder hornsby walked over to the charge on the metal tube and armed the device the light flicked red he was walking back to the hole when hanley came over the radio the police are less than a hundred feet away he said quickly where are you at hornsby climbed down the ladder a few feet then reached up and slid the manhole cover back in place he flicked a tiny switch on the lapel of his thin jacket and spoke were armed and the door closed he said give me ten seconds to reach the bottom got it hanley said hornsby reached the bottom of the ladder and stared at the crate containing the golden buddha so what have you guys been up to he asked hanley pushed a button and increased the flow of gas to the dragons mouth a flame shot forty feet forward and the crowd backed away then he pushed the button to ignite the charge a small explosion ripped into the side of the metal tank containing the aluminum powder it began to burn with a hot white light almost instantly the fabric covering of the float ignited and began to burn in a few seconds the float was a maelstrom with flames reaching twenty feet into the air we need fire and rescue one of the officers said giving the address then he stared at the firestorm waiting for a pair of men to run screaming forth but no one emerged from the glowing pile the white chevrolet suv pulled to the side of the road and cabrillo climbed into the front seat the helicopter pilot george adams pulled away from the curb gorgeous george he said any problems adams looked like a poster child for the american way he had a chiseled jaw short brown hair parted to one side and a smile that could sell toothpaste strangely enough in spite of his looks he was almost without ego married to his high school sweetheart he had been an army warrant officer before joining the corporation no sir he said monica cabrillo said turning to the rear seat no boss she said our guest is still out of it however cabrillo stared at spenser slumped against the window then back to the rear compartment where the speaker frame holding the fake buddha was sitting did the folding ramp work he asked adams like a dream adams said we just adjusted the legs to the same height as the helicopter floor then pushed the package across on the wheels good weve rented part of a small hangar at the airport he said to adams we need to go there now adams nodded and steered the chevrolet back toward the bridge a light rain began falling over macau sung rhee and ling po were standing on the front porch of the mansion staring toward the city po disconnected his cellular telephone and turned to rhee down the hill near the maritime museum the lights from the fire trucks that had extinguished the burning peugeot were still visible to the right along the parade route a column of smoke lit by the city lights was visible from the burning float whoevers stealing buddhas tonight theyre well trained and well funded po said to rhee rhees mind was back to normal and he was as mad as a doberman it was bad enough that some team of thieves was using his city as a playgroundit was worse that he had been made part of the heist whatever happens he said they still have to spirit the icons out of the country i have men at the airport and patrolling the waters po said and the border into china has been alerted to be on the lookout they wont be able to leave macau thats for sure all of the suspects except the british art dealer are american rhee said did you pull up the list of tourist visas the tourism authority is closed for the night po admitted but ill have someone there first thing in the morning these guys are professionals rhee said quietly they wont hang around by the time we get the list and begin to question all the americans they will be long gone pos telephone rang and he unfolded it and pushed the button po the fire reached part of one of the buildings an officer at the parade reported but the fire department has got that under control they are hosing down the float as we speak but the framework is still hot and it melted in onto itself there is a pile of twisted metal that is still too hot for inspection can you see the motorcycles inside the wreckage it seems they are inside the frame the officer said but its hard to be certain im coming down there po said keep the crowd back and order the rest of the floats to the end of the route the parade has officially ended excellent sir the officer said see you shortly po disconnected and turned to rhee im going down to the parade would you like to come along sir rhee considered this for a moment i dont think so ling he said were going to get some flack over thisi think its best if i go to headquarters and coordinate efforts there i understand sir po said as he started to walk down the driveway you find these men rhee said and recover the objects ill do my best sir po said then rhee opened the door to the mansion and went inside to report to the mayor of macau inside the chevrolet suv juan cabrillo adjusted his radio and called the oregon where are we at max there was a slight lag as the scrambled signal was rearranged and delivered the ross team took a casualty hanley said hes being worked on in the clinic report to me as soon as you know more cabrillo said what else the temple team has made it to the catacombs as planned i saw the smoke cabrillo said no injuries none hanley said so far so good they are initiating the extraction what about the others most everyone staying in town has reported in hanley said king made it back to the boat and is going to direct offensive actions until murphy returns target three the landed a few moments ago hanley reported they should be going through customs as we speak our man is still with them awaiting instructions what else the second leg of the journey is almost ready to activate hanley said the way it looks so far we can deliver the package on time good cabrillo said were almost at the airport hanley stared at the flashing blip on one of the monitors ive got you made juan now all i have to do is collect on our side deal cabrillo said and we can be on our way good luck mr chairman hanley said cabrillo out meadows jones and hornsby looked like three tourists on an arizona mine tour they were wearing silver hard hats made from pressed metal with small batteryoperated lamps that spewed beams of light from the front hornsby was holding a blueprint that showed the underground drainage systems the map looked like the tentacles of an octopus jones stared overhead as the first drops of water from the rain above filtered down through an aged tile drainpipe in the wall did the operations plans factor in possible rain he asked as long as there isnt a prolonged shower hornsby noted we should be okay what if there is jones asked thats not good hornsby admitted so we should get moving meadows said exactly hornsby said but lets not worry too muchthe plan states we can have six hours or so of continuous rain before the drains reach chesthigh level we can be out of here by then jones said thats the plan hornsby agreed the golden buddha was resting on the wooden ramp when hornsby had entered the storm drain through a side tunnel earlier that evening he had brought along a bag that contained four rubbertired wheels that attached to the ramp it was a crude arrangement but it would allow the three men to wheel the heavy object along the tunnels a pair of olive drab ditty bags was atop the crate containing the golden buddha these contained emergency supplies and weapons the entire affair stood at nearly chest height heres where i came in hornsby said its a shame we cant leave the same wayits only about two hundred yards to the grate the problem is when we emerge were right in the middle of town and the police should be everywhere by now meadows looked to where hornsbys finger was pointing so which way did the control room route us hornsby traced the route with his finger thats a long way jones noted a couple of miles hornsby agreed but we come out in a secluded spot alongside the inner port where we can be extracted meadows wiped the edge of his hard hat to dispel a few drops of water then walked around behind the golden buddha youve got the map horn dog he said why dont you pull the front strap and navigate me and jonesy will push from the rear slowly the three men began trudging along the storm sewer outside the rain grew in intensity within the hour it was a fullfledged monsoon linda ross walked into the oregons control room max hanley was pouring a cup of coffee from a pot on a side table his face was lined with tension and ross could see he was stressed reinholts rebounding she said quietly it looked worse than it was if we keep any infections at bay he should pull through will there be any lasting damage hanley asked as he motioned to the coffee and ross walked over and poured a cup the top of his ear is gone ross said hell need plastic surgery to make that right hows his attitude he came out of the stupor once and asked where he was ross said when i told him he was on the oregon he seemed happy propulsion engineers always seem more comfortable on board ship hanley said hows the rest of the operation going ross asked the actual golden buddha is currently in an underground storm sewer hanley said pointing to a monitor that team is making its way to the waterfront i thought the buddha was lifted out by helicopter ross said that was the fake hanley said but ross started to say it was on a needtoknow basis hanley said remember when the chairman arrived by seaplane sure ross said when we were under way at sea he had just returned from the art auction where the icon was sold the corporation jumped in thenwe arranged the shipment to macau gunderson was the pilot then a couple of our men met the plane with an armored carwe thought wed just grab it then the art dealer had other plans however he was planning to screw the owner with a fake so we just went along with his plan knowing all the while where the true artifact was hiding so all the efforts at the party were a façade it was designed to throw off the authorities and confuse the picture hanley said meanwhile if all goes well cabrillo will complete the art dealers sale and the corporation will pocket the proceeds so reinholt was shot for no reason ross said there were a hundred million reasons reinholt was wounded hanley said a hundred million and one if you count the fact that we confused the macau police and made the art dealer the prime suspect so the art dealer is the patsy ross said hes our oswald hanley agreed diabolical said ross its not over yet hanley said quietly we still need the payoff and to get out of here in beijing the foreign secretary the head of the chinese army and president hu jintao were staring at satellite photographs as of yesterday the foreign secretary said novosibirsk in siberia is the busiest airport in the world the russians are ferrying in military supplies at an alarming rate cargo planes are landing at the rate of one every few minutes hu jintao was examining a photograph with a magnifying glass tanks personnel carriers attack helicopters are already on the ground the head of the chinese army handed jintao a photograph the amount of supplies already on the ground can support nearly forty thousand ground troops and more is arriving every minute ive already contacted legchog zhuren in tibet jintao said hes mobilized his forces and they are starting toward the northern border how many men are under his control the foreign secretary asked he has twenty thousand combat and support troops in tibet the head of the chinese army answered then its already two to one the foreign secretary noted jintao pushed the photographs aside to maintain control inside tibet we have sponsored mass immigration from the other regions of china over the years zhuren has mobilized the chinese citizens in tibet and drafted them into the army that gives us nearly twenty thousand more that are of the right age to serve some have already left lhasa for the march northwe are trying to train them as they travel the russians have crack troops the head of the chinese army said our recently recruited farmers and shopkeepers will be wiped out thats if the russians cross the border the foreign secretary noted they are still claiming through diplomatic channels that this is just an exercise thats a damn big exercise jintao said quietly he sat back in his chair to think the last thing he wanted was to face off with the russiansbut he could not back down from the threat either the boeing was still undergoing customs inspection when cabrillo and the others arrived at their rented hangar spenser had started to come out of his stupor a few minutes before adams opened the rear door of the white suv then waved smelling salts under his nose spenser shook his head several times then cracked open his eyes adams helped him to his feet just outside the door of the chevrolet spenser stood on the floor of the hangar on wobbly legs and tried to remember what had happened come here adams said leading him over to a chair alongside a workbench and seating him with the help of kevin nixon cabrillo was erecting the folding ramp to unload the fake speaker case holding the faux buddha nixon had arrived at the hangar several hours earlier and had been busy ever since is everything ready cabrillo asked yes sir nixon said as he grabbed one side of the speaker case the two men rolled the case onto the wheeled metal conveyor when it reached the end they tilted the case upright folded the legs of the ramp under then bent it in half on the hinges and slid it back into the suv we have the clothes cabrillo inquired i stopped at his hotel room on the way over his bags were already packed nixon said the bestlaid plans cabrillo said of mice and men cabrillo followed by nixon walked over to where spenser was sitting the art dealer stared up at cabrillo you look familiar he said slowly weve never met cabrillo said coldly but i know a lot about you who are you people spenser said shaking his head to clear the fog and what do you want from me adams was standing a few feet from spenser while his rugged good looks did not make him appear menacing spenser was sure that if he tried to stand he wouldnt get far cabrillo walked right in front of the art dealer and invaded his space he stared into spensers eyes and spoke quietly right about now cabrillo said youre not in a good position so shut up and listen a few miles from here you have one infuriated asian billionaire who is convinced you bilked him out of a couple of hundred million dollars and contrary to what you might think he is not a nice manhe launched his fortune by running drugs for an asian triad and though hes legitimized his actions hes still connected i would guess hes already made a call and the entire criminal element of this country is searching for you as we speak what are you spenser began to say youre not listening cabrillo said acidly we know you switched buddhas and were just about to resell the icon if you cooperate we will give you a chance to run otherwise well do the switch anyway then phone ho and tell him where you can be found as they say you are out of options spenser thought wildly for a moment without the sale of the buddha he was financially ruined but as soon as word got around about what he had tried here in macau his life as an art dealer was finished his only hope was to change his identity and disappear escape to some faraway place and start his life anew he truly was out of options i cant run without papers he said can you help me there cabrillo had him and he knew itnow he just needed to reel him into the boat kevin cabrillo said are you linked to the ship yes sir nixon answered good cabrillo said then shoot mr spenser for me my pleasure nixon said the last ferry from hong kong slowed near the dock and the captain began manipulating the thrusters to line the ship up with the dock on the bow a man wearing highly polished cole haan loafers a pair of lightweight wool pleated slacks and a silkandcottonblend shirt waited to depart his hair was longer than usual and wavy and tucked into his shirt was a cravat of fine silk if you knew what to look for the signs of a facelift were barely visible but one would need to look close as it had been an expensive and painstaking operation save for the fact that the man was exhausted from the flight from indonesia to hong kong and the long day he had already faced you might not have noticed anything odd about him at all the man was fortyfive but appeared a decade younger he watched the deckhands secure the lines the men were young and fit and he liked that he liked the ethnic look and enjoyed young mens passions in the country where he resided he tended to seek out companions of latin descent there were many where he was from and luckily they seemed attracted to him as well quite honestly he wished he was home right now cruising the hilly streets of his city in a quest for love or lust but he was not he was thousands of miles from home and he had a job to do he smiled at one of the deckhands as he walked past but the man did not return the greeting slowly the ramp on the front of the ferry lowered along with the few other passengers at this late hour he made his way up the slight rise then into a door marked visitor handing over his passport he waited as his entry into macau was approved ten minutes later he walked from the building and hailed a cab then he flipped open a satellite telephone and checked his email back on the oregon max hanley was catching a catnap his feet were propped up on a desk in the control room and his head slumped to one side in his chair one of the operators touched his shoulder and he was instantly awake sir the operator said i think we have a problem hanley rubbed his face then rose and walked over to the coffeepot and poured a cup go ahead he said someone flagged just passed through macau immigration the corporation maintained a large database on their computers over the years the names of many people had been entered whenever any of them cropped up on any of the numerous systems the corporation hacked into the information was examined and analyzed hanley took a sip of coffee and then read the sheet of paper the operator handed to him we considered that possibility hanley said quietly and now hes here nixon walked over to spenser aimed at his head and pushed the button then he stared at the image in the digital camera can you grow facial hair cabrillo asked its sparse spenser admitted what have we got cabrillo asked nixon to make him look different nixon walked over to the bench and rustled through a box of disguises weve got hair makeup and prosthetic mouthpieces how far do you want to go its the new you cabrillo said where are you planning to hide spenser considered the question on the one hand he was not interested in having anyone know his ultimate destinationon the other hand from what he had seen so far these people would probably find out anyway i was thinking south america spenser said cabrillo nodded go with a light tan medium matching mustache nothing big and slightly longer hair he said to nixon who nodded and began removing items from the box i know from your file you dont speak spanish or portuguese so if i were you id try uruguay or paraguay where your british accent wont stand out as much crabtree walked over why dont you have kevin make him a canadian cabrillo nodded heres the deal he said you do the switch for us and we will build you a new identity you become a canadian who immigrated to paraguay a few years ago and hold citizenship well give you a flat one million us dollars to start over and a plane ticket from hong kong to asuncion what you do then is up to you and luck the authorities will stop me if i try to leave hong kong with a million cash spenser said feeling hope well take care of that cabrillo said now pick a name nixon walked over and began to apply the disguise norman mcdonald spenser said norm mcdonald it is cabrillo agreed tiny gunderson was watching the customs officials walk through the when his digital communicator vibrated he removed it from his pocket and stared at the readout memorizing the message he erased it and slid the device back in his pocket the customs agents walked to where gunderson was standing then signed a sheet of paper and handed it to the pilot well move to the fuel ramp now the pilot said to the officials who nodded and walked out the door and down the ramp the ramp was retracted and the operator drove it away close the door the pilot said to gunderson then he steered down the wet runway thirty minutes later the was refueled and parked in a large hangar only yards from where cabrillo and his team were waiting the software billionaire dialed his satellite telephone hornsby meadows and jones stopped to catch their breath all along the walls of the storm sewer metal and tile pipes were funneling water into the main line there were eight inches of water on the floor of the main sewer and it was dotted with cigarette butts scraps of paper and the refuse from the world above their heads were gaining an inch every few minutes meadows said hornsby was staring at the blueprint under the light of his miners helmet he traced the route and stared at his compass i dont think the water is rising that fast he said but it is cause for concern jones stared around the crowded space he didnt like being in confined spaces and he wanted out as soon as possible which way do we go horny we take the left passage hornsby said inside the control room on the oregon max hanley was staring at a weather radar image a cell of clouds the center an angry red color was situated in the water between hong kong and macau show the movement he said to an operator the man entered commands into the computer and the image moved in a slow sweeping wave to the west at the present speed the storm center would pass over macau around four am sometime during breakfast the trailing edge would reach the chinese mainland and the weather would clear between now and then there would be only rain eddie hanley said im going to need you to take a team into the tunnel eddie seng was the corporation goto guy he had served in marine recon had spearheaded more than a few corporation projects and had an innate knack for making good out of bad so far cabrillo and hanley had kept him on the sidelines in this operation he was their reserve man in case of unforeseen circumstances and he was itching to get in the game ill need a couple of zodiac boats and a method of locating the men if the water keeps rising seng said murphy kasim and huxley hanley said quickly ill have the boats prepped and the equipment arranged you assemble the team and meet me back here seng walked quickly from the control room no comment sung rhee said slamming down the telephone the reporters for the local newspapers had gotten wind something was happeningthey just did not know what the hospital was filled with guests from hos party but as the drug wore off they were leaving one by one food poisoning was mentioned as the source of the guests discomfort but the cover story was flimsy and someone would soon pierce through that lie the kidnappings were being investigated reporters with police scanners had ensured that the theft at the ama temple the burning peugeot the fire at the paradeall were being investigated by reporters only stanley hos house was sealed from them once he had cleared the house he had locked the doors to outsiders once morning came rhee would be compelled to comment just then his telephone rang again the wreckage of the float is cooling but we have yet to get close enough to inspect for remains detective po said but my guess is they burned up in the conflagration was the float being observed the entire time rhee asked yes sir po said then find me some teeth rhee said and melted gold yes sir po stared at the firemen who were still spraying water over the twisted mess of metal within the hour he should be able to inspect the wreckage in the meantime hos theft would take center stage somewhere in macau was another golden buddha and po intended to find it our deal was cash spenser said in answer to cabrillos question monica crabtree was on the secure line to the oregon she made notes on a sheet of paper then disconnected mr chairman she said i think you should see this nixon was doing layout on spensers new documents once he had the basic package together he entered a command and they were sent through the lines to the oregon where there was a store of blank passports immigration documents and blank credit cards someone on board would print up the material and deliver it to the hangar cabrillo stared at the notes and handed them back to crabtree shred them tom reyes was driving at breakneck speed with franklin lincoln in the passenger seat lincoln stared at the cab dispatch records then out the windshield once again there were three cabs dispatched to the ferry dock numbers twelve one twentyone and fortytwo ive been listening to the scanner reyes said fortytwo has already dropped its fare at the hotel lisboa and number twelve is heading along the new road he must be on number one twentyone he called the dispatcher to report that he was inbound to the hyatt regency on taipa then he was supposed to wait for his fare and take him onward reyes steered onto the bridge leading to taipa call hanley and explain the situation lincoln turned on his radio and reported to the control room give me a minute or so hanley said access the hyatt computer and search for this name he said handing eric stone an operator the sheet of paper and get me a room stones hands danced over the keyboard a second later he turned to hanley what timing stone said hes just now checking in stone waited until the data filled the screen room twentytwo fourteen he said hyatt regency room twentytwo fourteen hanley said to lincoln and grab him fastif he asked the cab to wait hes headed for the airport soon got it lincoln said then what bring him here reyes steered up the driveway to the hyatt regency room number twentytwo fourteen lincoln said we grab him and bring him to the oregon reyes stopped the car and slid it into park you got any money sure what for lincoln asked theres the cab reyes said pointing pay him off and tell him to leave then meet me on the twentysecond floor michael talbot paid the bellman then closed the door he was due at the airport any minute but he was grimy and decided on a quick shower undressing he walked into the bathroom and adjusted the shower tom reyes reached into his wallet and removed a universal key card then he slid it through the slot and waited until the light went green then he slowly opened the door at first he thought no one was in the room then he heard the shower running reyes started to close the door but heard the sound of footsteps approaching down the hall he peered out and saw lincoln reyes touched his finger to his lips then motioned lincoln inside barrett hanley said are you crosstrained in the magic shop ive worked it before barrett said go down there and warm up the latex machine youve got it boss barrett said walking quickly out of the control room talbot was toweling himself off and trying to decide what he would wear he stepped from the bathroom and into the bedroom a large black man was sitting at his table and the image so surprised him that his mind was unable to process the discovery for a second then from the side of the door he felt a hand around his mouth he was thrown facedown on the bed his eyes pressed tight against the bedspread next he was quickly gagged and blindfolded and his arms and legs secured with plastic ties earplugs were slipped into his ears he could not hear reyes tell lincoln ill go find a room service cart you stay here lincoln nodded and flipped on the television their prisoner was not going anywhere he lay trussed like a thanksgiving turkey not moving a muscle eight minutes later lincoln and reyes had snuck him out a back entrance of the hotel then brought the car around and slid him onto the backseat im hungry reyes said as he reached over to place the car in drive man lincoln said you always say that at the same instant that reyes and lincoln were pulling alongside the oregon and parking max hanley was checking a device in the magic shop in the background on one of the numerous workbenches the machine that heated liquid latex beeped to signal it was at operating temperature then automatically went to standby hanley turned and stared at the latex machine then diverted his eyes back to the small box in his hand okay hanley said to barrett lets try it again testing one two three barrett said the brown cow jumped over the red moon four score and seven years ago our thats fine hanley said cutting him off he stared at the small box then placed it to his throat and repeated what barrett had said staring at a computer screen displaying a series of bar graphs he noted the discrepancy and adjusted a series of tiny stainlesssteel screws on the rear of the box with an optometrists screwdriver go again i did not have sex with that woman miss lewinsky barrett said read my lips no new taxes out of respect for the family i will not answer that question la de dah hold on hanley said he repeated barretts ramblings while staring at the screen barrett watched and raised an eyebrow his voice was coming from hanleys mouth it was both eerie and amazing my mother couldnt tell the difference he said modern technology hanley said still astounds me how are you going to attach it barrett asked hanley showed him reyes glanced around the port no one was watching with lincolns help he removed talbot from the rear seat then dragged him up the gangplank onto the oregon met at the inner door by julia huxley the trio was directed down to the magic shop talbot still blindfolded stumbled down the passages into the elevator then along the last stretch of hallway until they reached the magic shop once lincoln opened the door reyes directed talbot to a chair then sat him down and placed straps across his body a light was moved to the front of talbots seat then turned on talbot could feel the heat from the lamp a few seconds later his blindfold was removed and the blinding light met his eyes you michael talbot hanley asked yes talbot said turning from the light eyes forward hanley said talbot complied but he had a hard time looking into the light he could sense someone was behind him but the straps were too tight to turn did you have sex with a teenage boy in indonesia who are you people talbot said a second later he felt a touch on his neck then a surge of electricity hit his body we ask the questions here hanley said did you have sex with a teenage boy he told me he was eighteen talbot said through gritted teeth were tired of slime like you coming over to asia to partake of your sick desires hanley said its giving america a bad name im here on busi talbot started to say the sharp bite of electricity silence hanley snapped talbot was afraid the kind of deepdown fear of the unknown and unseen that creeps into a mans soul and plays with his nerves and internal organs talbot began sweating from his forehead and the need to urinate was overpowering i have to pee he said when we say you can hanley said first we are going to make a mold of your head then we will produce a threedimensional image of it which we will transmit over our computer network from here on out the asian police organizations will be on the lookout for you then you are going to read a confession aloud if you cooperate and perform these tasks you will be taken to hong kong so that you can catch the first flight to the united states screw with us in any way and you will be washing up on the beaches of mainland china a few days from now whatll it be lover boy okay okay talbot blurted but im about to pee my pants take him to the facilities hanley said blindfolded once again talbot was led to a restroom and his hands untied four minutes later he was back in his seat and strapped in place fifteen minutes after that the mask was formed and the voice print recorded a few minutes later michael talbot was placed facedown on the rear seat of the sedan again and was driven toward the ferry dock winston spenser was trying to figure an angle there was none he had grabbed for the brass ring and come up short his choice now was to live or to die and the people that were controlling him had made a compelling argument hed walk out with a new identity and a million in funding he decided this was a deal he would honor spenser stared at his new passport and documents then watched the lady in the group talking on the cellular telephone she disconnected and turned to the leader the president is on his way mr chairman she said hes taken care of the problem spenser had no idea of the identities or affiliation of the people who had taken him hostage he only knew from what he had witnessed so far that they had a power that went far beyond anything he had ever seen they seemed to exist in a world of their own creation a world of control and illusion and whatever spenser may have planned they had always been one step ahead and then it hit him you were at the auction in geneva he said to the leader cabrillo stared at spenser as if trying to decide yes i was how did you know id switched the buddhas you paid our company to fly the icon here to macau then take it by armored car to the temple cabrillo said so you staged the entire affair at the party as a ruse that and we wanted to fulfill your deal with the man outside cabrillo said unreal spenser said and the one hundred million it will go to charity cabrillo said we were hired to bring the real buddha back to its rightful ownerthis side deal is just frosting on the cake spenser thought for a moment what is your ideology your groups motivation we are a corporation cabrillo said that is the only ideology we need so you exist to make a profit we exist cabrillo said to make right from wrong but along the way weve learned how to make that a very lucrative enterprise amazing spenser said not as amazing as this cabrillo said as the door to the hangar opened and the car carrying hanley drove inside once the door closed hanley climbed from the passenger side of the suv meet michael talbot cabrillo said to an astonished winston spenser the software billionaire took a key from a chain around his neck and opened the leather portfolio on the table then he removed a folder and flipped through the papers the stack of papers was nearly an inch thick and was composed of bearer bonds in various amounts the largest denomination was for an even million the smallest the banks that had issued the bonds were from a hodgepodge of european countries from great britain to germany to the most prevalent switzerland and liechtenstein the total was million it was a kings ransom to purchase a princely prize but to the software billionaire it was just money he lived for the fulfillment of his own desires it was not the art of the golden buddha that intrigued him nor the history that surrounded the icon like a cloud it was the fact that it had once been stolen and now it had been stolen again it was the crime that turned him on the inflation of his ego he would feel when he knew that he was the only man in the world to possess the rare and priceless artifact truth be told he already owned a collection of stolen art that rivaled any museum in europe monet manet daumier delacroix da vinci sketches donatello bronzes illuminated manuscripts crown jewels stolen historical documents warehouses in california were filled with antique automobiles historic motorcycles and early airplanes stolen civil war artifacts romanov icons heisted from a museum in st petersburg scientist nikola teslas writings lifted from a museum in romania after the fall of communism secret presidential letters even a toilet from the white house the first computer the first personal computer the first massproduced consumer computer those last were for nostalgia since computers were where his fortune had come from he still had a hard copy of the first program his company had soldone he had stolen himself from an unsuspecting programmer whod believed he was just helping another enthusiast that had been his first and largest theft and it had set the stage for all the others he stared at the bonds again then reached for the satellite telephone eddie seng watched as a pair of olivegreen zodiac boats were raised from a lower deck on a utility elevator that exited amidships on the oregon as soon as the elevator stopped sam pryor hooked a cable to the center hoisting ring of the first boat and swung it over the side then into the water down at water level murphy took the bowline of the boat and tied it to the dock while pryor was hooking up the second boat murphy climbed aboard and checked the fuel and oil for the highoutput fourstroke outboard motor the oil was fresh and full the tanks topped to the rim murphy turned the key and watched the lights on the dash once he was sure everything was fine he twisted the key and the engine started and settled into an almost silent idle once the second boat touched the water kasim duplicated murphys efforts the two boats sat idling in the night seng climbed aboard murphys vessel and checked the supplies that had been loaded aboard down in the inner workings of the oregon finding all in order he spoke to huxley in a low voice you got everything huxley stared at her list then found the last item were good next seng reached across between the boats and handed kasim a cd these are the coordinates for the onboard gpswe are running an exact copy on this boat lets try to stay within ten feet or so of one another that way the radar shielding should hide us both kasim nodded you got it eddie okay mark seng said quietly as he threw off the line you can take us out murphy slid the control lever down and the boat backed in reverse a few minutes later the two boats were skimming across the rainsplashed water at speeds of nearly thirty knots for all intents and purposes they were undetectable any radar that might try to paint them was being jammed anyone listening for the engines would not be able to hear the noise over the storm help was coming two in the morning and the trio in the tunnel had between three and four hours until first light that was not as much of a problem as it might seem right now the main threat was drowning hornsby stared ahead to where a large tile pipe was spilling its contents into the main sewer what had begun as a trickle from the offshoot pipes had grown into angry torrents of water the pipe ahead was raging with such force that the stream of water was slapping against the far wall of the main sewer like the torrent from a broken fire hydrant from that point forward meadows said we lose the bottom half of the sewer to water already the water was kneedeep and the farther the men had gone the more it had risen now they were at an impasse from here to the end of the line the water would be too deep to walk through lets inflate the rafts jones said wearily hornsby opened one of the duffle bags and removed a pair of folding rafts taking a highpressure air supply from inside the bag he attached it to a raft and turned the switch the raft unfolded and quickly became rigid two minutes later hornsby turned off the inflator we need to place the buddha in one raft hornsby said and the three of us in the other weight problems jones asked each raft can carry a maximum of seven hundred pounds hornsby said since none of us weighs under a hundred pounds hell need to ride alone meadows was unpacking the second raft he laid it out and attached the inflator as it was filling with air he spoke what do you think he asked his partners should we let the buddha lead or follow hornsby thought for a moment if hes behind the weight might push us into something but if he leads jones said we can let go of the lead rope if we get into trouble meadows stared at the rapidly filling pipe just ahead there will not be much steering required he said pointing to the rising water i think well all just go with the flow then he leads hornsby said as he grabbed one end of the buddha to wrestle it onto the raft and we just go along for the ride hear hear meadows said makes sense to me jones added talbot spenser said youre part of this hanley walked over to spenser and stood as the art dealer examined him at least he seemed to be passing the visual testspenser was waiting for him to answer winston spenser you old hanley croaked he sounded like a cheap pa system in a rundown school hanley moved the small device from his voice box and spoke in his normal voice kevin he said come take a look at thisi thought i had it dialed in right nixon walked over and flipped the device over he took a pen from his shirt pocket and clicked a small toggle switch over two notches you had the delay used for telephone transmissions engaged boss nixon said try it now hi winston hanley said long time no see spenser stared at the man and shook his head had he not seen the device malfunction he might have been all rightas it was everything that had happened to him was rushing back in a flood now these people had created some kind of robot who knew what they might do next mr talbot spenser managed to say i think you fixed it kevin hanley said spenser stood mute okay everyone listen up cabrillo said its almost time detective ling po stared at the mass of melted metal the support beams of the float had been twisted into grotesque shapes by the intense heat of the fire and they were wrapped around the remains of the motorcycles like the blackened tentacles of an octopus a handler with a dog was poking at one side of the wreckage sir the handler said the dog is not signaling any human remains does that mean there are none po asked usually it would need to be an extremely hot fire to fully turn a corpse to ash anything less than that hell smell po glanced at the wreckage it had melted the asphalt of the road and parts of the metal support beams were imbedded into the roadway there was no way to tell with any certainty what was underneath hook a chain to the end po said and drag it with one of the trucks i want to see whats under there a fireman ran to remove a chain from the storage compartment on his truck a few minutes later he had one end secured to the wreckage and the other end to the trucks bumper slowly the fireman eased the truck forward and the wreckage was wrestled from down in the asphalt after dragging it a few feet north the fireman stopped his truck it that far enough he shouted out the window to po perfect po said staring at the manhole cover bending down po tried to lift the cover but he had no luck another fireman removed a tool from the truck and slid it into the small opening on the manhole cover then pried it open he slid the cover a few feet away po removed a small flashlight from his pocket and shined it down into the hole bingo he said reaching for his cell phone he dialed the number for headquarters sir he said i think i know where the ama temple buddha went there are a total of sixteen places in macau where the storm runoff exits into the bay seng and his team were pulling up to the only one that mattered after securing the zodiacs to some rocks alongside the grate seng walked over and examined the metal shield the square screen was made of tubular stock with the openings measuring some two feet by two feet or large enough to allow any trash to pass through it was connected to the angled concrete slab that attached to the storm sewer by a series of large bolts seng walked back to the zodiac and removed a toolbox finding the proper size socket he attached it to a batteryoperated wrench then walked back over to the grate and began to remove the bolts once the bolts were all free seng huxley murphy and kasim positioned themselves on all four corners of the grate and lifted it free the water was racing out of the outflow and on the far side murphy and kasim had some trouble pulling the grate onto the rocks once it was out of the way everyone stared into the opening its becoming a river in there huxley said finally seng threw a strip of bright yellow plastic in the stream and then timed the movement he stared at the second hand of his watch intently once the piece of plastic was fifty yards out in the inner harbour he calculated the speed the waters flowing about ten miles an hour he said but you know thats going to increase piece of cake for the zodiacs murphy said seng nodded as long as we dont run out of headroom kasim said we should be able to collect our boys and be back on the oregon in an hour or so seng started walking back to the zodiac okay you two seng said drive on in and collect the team julia and i will be providing security just like we planned be back shortly kasim said as he climbed behind the wheel if only itd be so easy cabrillo took an erasable marker and drew on a board placed on one of the benches i just checked again and the is parked here cabrillo said making an x on the board they wont be moving until they taxi out to leave adams will drive spenser in the suv to the ramp then park adams nodded in agreement once youve stopped climb out and erect the portable awning over the rear of the truck cabrillo said then you can open the crate displaying the buddha what if the buyer wants us to bring the buddha aboard spenser asked tell him no cabrillo said he needs to do his inspection on the ground and take ownership on macau soil spenser nodded but he didnt look convinced max cabrillo continued you are going to leave in a few minutes and make your way around to the front terminal where a cab will bring you back to the got it hanley said cabrillo paused and stared at the team this should go nice and easy he said quietly hanley will verify the authenticity the payment will be made and then the billionaire can haul the buddha aboard any questions no one spoke all right then cabrillo said good luck max hanley nodded and walked toward a rear door to the hangar george cabrillo said you and spenser can climb in the suv well want to give hanley a few minutes to make contact and some small talk then we need to make the approach adams nodded and motioned to spenser to climb in the passenger seat of the chevrolet the software billionaire was drinking tea with coconut milk and smoking a thin cheroot the intrigue of the event had caught up to him and a few minutes before he had retired to the rear compartment of the to change into all black clothing his success in the software industry a condition of luck and timing more than skill and ability had over the years allowed his ego to swell into dangerous proportions he was beginning to believe his own hype at this instant with the drugs and sex wearing off and the nicotine and caffeine increasing he was beginning to think he was a secret agent the heist followed by the payoff and then absconding with the goods he was already thinking about the fun he would have relaying the story to his friends hanley walked over to the macau taxi and climbed into the backseat the taxi rolled around the edge of the main terminal then back down toward the once it was close to the ramp hanley ordered the driver to slow then sound the horn the billionaire heard the sound and glanced out a window of the jet seeing talbot in the rear of the taxi he walked forward toward the open cabin door then stood at the top of the ramp hanley climbed from the rear of the taxi the billionaire motioned for him to climb the ramp hanley started up the steps at that exact instant juan cabrillo picked up a portable radio and pushed talk flyswatter he said how you holding up larry king was perched inside the scooped intake of the hangars airconditioning system the rain was occasionally blowing inside the shaft but at least he had something over his head i stopped by the oregon after the party king said and picked up a thermos of tomato soup a waterproof cover for the nightscope and some depleted uranium rounds im in tall cotton cabrillo was always appreciative of kings professionalism the corporation could parachute him into a barren wasteland with a few packaged meals and his rifle and within hours he would have found a nest and lined up his shots then he would patiently wait until his special services were needed or not without complaint since cabrillo had access to the operatives personal records he knew that king was also the owner of a piano bar in sedona arizona it had been odd the single time cabrillo had traveled through the area and caught king at worknot only had the sniper been dressed in a black tuxedo instead of camouflaged sniper clothes but hed sung mainly love songs and ballads in a sweet melodious voice hows the reception larry cabrillo asked the parabolic is distorted some by the droplets on the glass king admitted but i can make out some of whats being said you know to call if something big happens yes sir king said staring through the nightscope and touching the earpiece to the microphone hanley just made his greetings monica crabtree was on the far end of the hangar staring out a crack in the door mr hanley just walked inside she said across the space of the hangar come on in out of the rain michael king heard the billionaire say hanley passed gunderson in the aisle as he followed the billionaire he touched the middle finger of his left hand to his eyebrow as if to wipe away a droplet gunderson brushed his chin in reply have a seat the billionaire said as they reached a conference table in a compartment in the front section of the hanley slid into a seat and stared at the man i couldnt tell you what was happening over the telephone the billionaire said but the buddha that you bid on for me has come up for sale once again thats quick hanley said the billionaire nodded but offered nothing more your voice sounds rough can i offer you something the rain and the air on the commercial flights ive been taking hanley said i think im coming down with something the billionaire pushed a button and gunderson appeared could you bring mr talbot some tea with lemon and honey and for you sir ill have a snifter of warmed ouzo please right away sir gunderson said on the roof of the hangar king heard the exchange they are ordering drinks sir open the door monica cabrillo ordered crabtree hit a button and raised the hangar door far enough for the suv to exit time to go men cabrillo shouted to adams and spenser adams placed the chevrolet in gear and drove slowly to the door then he exited the hangar into the pouring rain gunderson returned with the drinks to find the billionaire staring silently at hanley the pilot asked me to tell you that a truck is approaching said gunderson the billionaire turned from hanley and stared out the window a white chevrolet suv pulled near the ramp and a man he didnt recognize climbed from the drivers seat and walked to the rear once there he removed a folded portable aluminumlegged awning from the rear and erected it then the billionaire watched as spenser climbed from the passenger seat come on the billionaire said to hanley our prize has arrived at the same time hanley and the billionaire were walking toward the ramp adams pulled the crate containing the buddha forward and opened the top then he walked back to the drivers seat and climbed inside out of the rain the billionaire appeared at the top of the stairs and spenser under the awning motioned for him to descend the two men walked down the ramp lets do this out of the rain the billionaire said when he reached the tarmac inside my plane spenser shook his head in the negative i dont know you and you dont know me he said so until i receive payment and you take delivery the golden buddha remains on the ground the billionaire turned to hanley is this the dealer that made the winning bid yes hanley said youre mike talbot spenser said michael hanley corrected did you bring cash like we agreed spenser asked bearer bonds the billionaire answered if everything checks out hanley stood quietly with the gusts of wind blowing sprinkles of rain onto his mask check it out the billionaire said to hanley hanley walked over and examined the buddha in detail then reached down and shaved a small sample of gold from the foot did you bring the other sample he asked the billionaire who reached into his pocket and removed an envelope hanley removed an eyepiece from his pocket and pretended to study the sample for a few minutes they match he said at last ill retrieve the payment the billionaire said at exactly the same time chuck gunderson was placing the last strip of duct tape over the mouth of the copilot binding the mens wrists with plastic ties he laid the pilot and copilot together on the floor of the cockpit targets heading up the stairs king radioed cabrillo make the call cabrillo said to nixon inside the gunderson turned to the brunette flight attendant do me a favor he said close that cabin door as the billionaire climbed the stairs in the rain he could not hear the footsteps as adams spenser and hanley sprinted through the puddles to the rear of the hangar his mind was on the golden buddha and retrieving the briefcase that held the key to owning the icon he was halfway up the ramp when the door to his jet started to close just as he reached the top step the hatch was locked in place banging on the door the billionaire began screaming at the top of his lungs across town ling po was just about to enter the manhole when his cell phone rang things have gotten too hot for us an unknown voice said to po you win detective there is a white chevrolet tahoe on the runway at macau airport it has the buddha that was stolen from the party goodbye the telephone went dead in pos ear for a moment he stared at it in amazementthen he quickly dialed sung rhee i just had a call from the thieves po said rapidly they claim the buddha is in a white chevrolet truck on the runway at macau airport hanley spenser and adams ran to the rear of the hangar to where a limousine was sitting with the engine running monica crabtree was behind the wheel once the trio of men was safely in the rear compartment she placed the limousine in gear and raced toward the gate okay kevin cabrillo said using a remotely operated device he had installed a few hours earlier nixon began to back the ramp away from the as soon as the ramp lurched backward the billionaire knew he had been hadhe swiveled around at the top of the ramp and glanced down the truck was there but no one was visible larry king watched the through the nightscope less than a minute later he watched as gunderson slid into the pilot seat then motioned he was ready king flashed a red laser on his rifle sight at the pilots window of the and at the signal gunderson fired the engines on the jet the ramp was retracting faster and faster and nixon steered it to the side once it was safely clear of the jet he let his joystick go neutral and the ramp began to roll to a stop tossing the controller into a box he did a final visual sweep of the hangar with cabrillo he and crabtree had packed everything else into the trunk of the limousine in the half hour before spenser had made his approach all that remained was for nixon and cabrillo to hightail it off airport property once the ramp was free of the and a safe distance away king signaled again with the laser and gunderson began to advance the throttles cabrillo and nixon were walking quickly for the rear door when king radioed chucks started his taxi king said the ramp had finally slowed enough for the billionaire to leap off he ran down the tarmac after his retreating a few seconds of that and he knew the situation was hopeless so he raced toward the chevrolet once he reached the vehicle he was surprised to find the buddha still aboard pushing over the aluminum awning he slammed the rear door closed then climbed into the drivers seat another break the keys were still in the ignition his million in bonds were lostbut the buddha was worth twice that now his plan was to escape with the golden buddha and worry later about who had stolen his jet he started the truck and placed it in gear on board the the brunette flight attendant was guarding the cockpit door no one had told her to do this she had just thought it prudent one of the bimbos walked forward and started for the cockpit door get back the brunette said i need to talk to the pilot the blonde said she started for the door again and the brunette threw a punch that never landed the blonde deflected the blow then struck the brunette in the breadbasket with a chop chucky the blonde shouted over the noise of the engines will you tell this bitch you need me up there the brunette was bent over trying to catch her breath when the cockpit door was flung open through the open door the brunette could see the taxiing faster toward the runway for takeoff gunderson was sitting in the pilots seat he turned and smiled thats okay honey gunderson said quickly shes my copilot the macau taxi was sitting to the rear of the hangar the purring engine making puffs of smoke in the rainsoaked air cabrillo and nixon climbed into the rear just as king radioed again okay boss he said easily he went for the truck come out of the nest cabrillo said and well meet you around front king began to extract himself from inside the air intake at the same time the billionaire had the chevrolet up to speed on the road leading from the hangars to the main terminal inside the burgundy gunderson scanned the storm scope and answered a call from the control tower then he hit the switch to allow him to talk over the cabin speakers ladies if you could take a seat id appreciate itwell be taking off in a second also after we get in the air if one of you could bring a pot of coffee and some sandwiches to the cockpit youd be our hero then he turned to the blonde sitting next to him hi judy long time no see along the bridge leading from macau proper to the island where the airport was situated twelve police cars with sirens screaming and lights flashing formed a rolling barricade as they raced to the main terminal there they go crabtree said as she drove in the opposite direction she watched in the rearview mirror as several cars left the bridge then crossed the median and sealed off both lanes of traffic just made it adams noted the driver steered the cab slowly around the front of the building then waited as king slid down the drainpipe and climbed into the front seat then he turned his head and stared at cabrillo take us to the far south end of the airport across from coloane cabrillo said we have a boat to catch on board the the final clearance was approved at the same time as the chevrolet suv passed in front of the main airport terminal in the distance the billionaire could see a line of police cars blocking the road turning his head he could see through the rain the flashing lights on the wings and fuselage of his burgundy as it lifted from the runway and headed out over the bay destination judy asked singapore gunderson answered now tell mehow was it for you and tracy we took a couple for the team judy said then he got tired the full fury of the storm descended on macau only a few minutes after gunderson and the cut a wide arc out over the south china sea to head south inside the storm sewer the waters were rising faster now and the rafts holding the golden buddha and his three liberators hurtled faster toward salvation or destruction prior to reaching each junction one of the men would climb off the raft and drag the rear rope to slow the raft with the golden buddha then he would push the side of the raft toward the proper channel and let the current do the rest the randomly spaced overhead pipes that drained into the main sewer were running full now and each time the rafts passed under the spray some of the water made it into the floors of the rafts the men were using their hats to bail out the buildup but as each mile passed the effort was becoming harder and harder hornsby stared at the blueprint carefully weve passed the halfway point he said but if we make the same rate of progress and the water continues to rise at the current pace by the time we reach the exit to the inner harbor the water will be almost at the top of the pipe the oregon will have sent help by now jones said and they will have a copy of the blueprints meadows wiped some water from his forehead before speaking that doesnt change the problems we face it just places more people in harms way hornsby was standing in water up to his waist pushing the raft with the buddha to the left with his hip once the raft entered the other stream and started to move he rolled back inside the following raft not only that he said if the pace continues when we do reach the inner harborif we doit will be at first light and then we risk detection hornsby turned his head he could see jones grinning in the dim light from his faltering hardhat lamp then he spoke were the corporation jones said quietly were always one step ahead the trio of men nodded as the pair of rafts hurtled faster in the growing current toward a rendezvous with a rescuing force that was fighting problems of their own the fourstroke outboard on the zodiac being driven by mark murphy was blasting water out of its jet drive the current was running stronger every few feet but the powerful engine was propelling the craft forward in spite of the strong stream running against the bow to the middle of the inflatable hali kasim was unscrewing the tubular metal top that supported a canvas sun awning and the electronics sensors to gain a few feet of needed clearance finishing the job he stacked the last of the pipes inside the zodiac and turned to murphy maximum headroom he said now hit the gas if we dont meet up with the other team and tow them out of here soon were all going to be swimming murphy advanced the throttle and steered around a bend for lights he used a handheld spotlight for navigation a portable gps unit held between his knees find the air horn murphy said to kasim i have a feeling well need it soon sheets of rain washed from east to west as rick barrett steered the scarab close to the southernmost strip of manmade land that comprised the macau airport barrett was wearing a bright yellow rain suit that should have made him stand out but in the dark of night and the pouring rain he and the scarab were virtually invisible he listened for a sound in his earpiece but heard only static scanning the shoreline with a pair of nightvision binoculars he began to fear the worst what do you mean po shouted in anger the head of the macau public works department was far from happy himself hed been awakened from a sound sleep and ordered to make his way to his office to locate the blueprints of the storm sewer system once there he had been unable to find the documents i mean that they are gone the man told po deleted from the computers and the hard copies removed from the office are you certain po asked i have had the entire night shift searching the man said nothing is left so we have no way to know for certain where the water exits into the bay po asked we dont have a map of it the man agreed but there is one way to tell well po said how pour some dye into a drain the man said then see where it goes po turned to one of the patrolmen nearby find a hardware store he said quickly and buy me a dozen gallons of paint then he stared down the manhole there was no use entering the maze the rats would be flushed from the hole by the water and when they were po would be waiting he smiled at the thought but failed to notice a man standing some ten feet distant in the entryway of an allnight café the man touched his ear to adjust his earpiece then walked inside the restaurant the billionaire slid the chevrolet into park there was really no other choice to his front three police cars were blocking the road the officers were standing behind their vehicles with pistols drawn to the rear were more cars and an armored personnel carrier that was being used as a temporary command post inside the apc sung rhee peered through a gun port at the stopped truck reaching for a microphone he spoke over the pa system you are surrounded he said step slowly from the vehicle with your hands above your head then he turned to one of the officers driving the apc light him with the spotlight the man flicked a switch and a fourmillioncandlelightpowered spotlight turned night into day rhee watched as the drivers door slowly opened then a man dressed entirely in black stepped onto the wet pavement and took a few steps away from the truck stop rhee ordered the man stopped dead in his tracks keep your hands in the air rhee ordered if you are the only occupant of the vehicle wave your left arm slowly the mans left arm moved back and forth take six steps into the direction of the light the man complied now lay down kneesfirst then bellydown on the road the man eased himself down until his entire body was prone on the wet road two officers forward rhee said and restrain the suspect a pair of officers approached from behind the police cars to the front and slowly made their way over to the man with one covering the other man bent down and handcuffed the suspects hands behind his back then he yanked him to his feet im an american the billionaire said and i demand to see the ambassador rhee waited as the rear door of the apc was lowered then he stepped out into the rain and walked over to the chevrolet after first flashing a light inside to verify the other seats were empty he scanned the rear storage area and caught sight of the buddha flipping open the rear gate he glanced at the sixfoottall chunk of gold then he reached for his cell phone the limousine carrying hanley was just pulling up in front of the oregon wipe it carefully and get rid of it he said to crabtree you come with me spenser followed hanley as he bounded up the gangplank once on the deck of the ship he motioned for spenser to follow him inside and started in the direction of the control room opening the door he nodded at eric stone call for a guard for spenser here stone spoke over a microphone wheres the chairman hanley said next stone pointed to a screen that showed a flashing light almost at the end of the airport island and a second separate light a few yards distant there stone said pointing the other is barrett doing extraction hanley watched as the first light slowed then stopped signal barrett that they have arrived spenser was staring at the operation in amazement he was just about to ask hanley a question when the door to the control room opened and sam pryor walked in take this man to the brig hanley ordered and secure him level pryor asked minimum hanley said but you stay with himhes not to use any communications devices or talk to anyone you can feed him and you may allow him to sleep or use the entertainment system for television or movies but no computer yes sir pryor said hanley turned to spenser you fulfilled your end of the bargain he said dont try anything stupid now and well do exactly what we promised pryor started to lead spenser away by his arm when will i be free to go the art dealer asked well let you know hanley said but it will be soon pryor led spenser into the hall just before the door closed he looked back to see hanley begin to peel the latex mask from his face barrett heard a beep in his earpiece and stared at the shoreline with his binoculars a quick flash of headlights appeared like twin explosions in the green screen of his nightlit viewer then the white dots faded to black barrett flashed the docking lights on the scarab then steered closer to shore tom reyes finished wiping his fingerprints off the steering wheel and controls then twisted the key to off turning around in the seat he stared at cabrillo and nixon were clean and green boss reyes said as he slid the keys into his pocket lets go get wet cabrillo said as he opened the rear door of the cab nixon climbed from the cab clutching the last box of props and tools and followed reyes and cabrillo to the water staring to the east he could just make out the sky beginning to lighten to the west the wind was diminishing in a few hours it would be morning and the storm would have passed over macau but for now the sheets of rain continued to rake the islands barrett angled as close to shore as he dared then tilted the drive up to avoid rocks cabrillo waded into the water and grabbed the bow and held it in place reyes climbed into the scarab then took the box nixon held in his arms placing it on the deck he reached over again and helped nixon over the gunwale once nixon was on the deck cabrillo gave the scarab a push backward and reached for reyess hand as the boat drifted backward he climbed over the side and barrett lowered the drive and slid the control into reverse slowly he backed away from the southernmost edge of the airport island once free from obstructions barrett slid the control forward and steered toward the oregon what do you mean hanley asked the lead detective sent for buckets of paint michael halpert said quietly they are planning to pour them down the storm sewer to trace the flow of the water i understand hanley said good job you can return to the oregon now stone was studying the returns on the radar scope and he turned to hanley barrett is headed back across the water he should reach us in a few minutes hanley was watching the storm scope make sure there are a couple of deckhands standing by hanley ordered we need the scarab back in the hangar and out of sight yes sir stone said as he reached for the microphone sung rhee walked over to the suspect who had been moved under the overhang just outside the departure terminal at the airport in the bright lights spilling from inside the terminal the man looked vaguely familiar one of your partners turned on you rhee said and phoned in your location the man stared at rhee with a look that contained equal parts pity and contempt ive got no idea what you are talking about there is no reason to try to be coy with us rhee said we caught you redhanded you caught nothing the man said i was buying a piece of art and a team of thieves scammed me theyre the ones you should be harassing not me when did you arrive in macau rhee asked a couple of hours ago the man replied the last ferryboat was three hours ago rhee said and the next does not leave for two more in addition there are no commercial airline flights from the hours of one am until five am your story is obvious nonsense i have my own jet the man noted indeed where is it now rhee asked i have no idea the man said the thieves stole it how convenient rhee said you understand if you refuse to answer our questions we can make this very uncomfortable the billionaires ire was rising fast any dealings with bureaucrats were usually limited to him telling them what he wanted to do he was tired slightly hungover and missing his hundred million dollars he looked right into rhees eyes listen you asshole the man said my was stolen from your airport and inside was a briefcase containing one hundred million dollars in bearer bonds i dont know what the hell has been happening tonight in this little pisspot of a country but if you just unhook me from these handcuffs and let me use a telephone i can clear this up in about ten minutes had rhee listened to the billionaire the might have been tracked instead the mans belligerent attitude doomed him rhee motioned to one of the officers holding the mans arms take him to headquarters he said barrett steered the scarab into the sling then barrett cabrillo reyes and nixon climbed up the boarding ladder while the deckhands secured the boat doing some operation time tonight cabrillo said to barrett do you like it not as easy as frosting a cake barrett admitted but a lot more exciting the four men walked through a hatch into the interior of the oregon cabrillo motioned down the hallway you men go and clean up ive still got some work to do the men started down the hallway to their cabins hey cabrillo said to the retreating men good job then he walked down to the control room and opened the door stepping inside he began to unbutton his wet shirt then turned to hanley where are we at max four feet of space remained between the surface of the rising water and the top of the storm sewer the batteries on the hardhat lights were growing dim the water was rising fast and the men could no longer safely climb from the raft to steer the golden buddha along meadows had lashed the rafts together and he and jones were on each side where the two rafts met standing in a half crouch as the rafts careened along they attempted to alter their direction by pushing against the hard sides of the pipe with their legs junction coming up hornsby shouted we need the left channel at the v in the pipes just ahead the fastflowing water was being parted like the bow wake on a nuclear submarine chunks of debris littered the water the roof of the pipe was dripping so hard they might as well have been outside and the pair of rafts was accelerating almost beyond control jones watched ahead and timed his action as the rafts reached a spot twenty feet in advance of the v he reached over with his leg and shoved against the wall the rafts lumbered to the left side and then were carried in the current past the junction we made that one jones shouted but if we get much more water in this pipe were going to have trouble on the next one if we dont get some help soon meadows said were going to need to cut the buddha loose and try to save our own skin one at a time detective po said to the officer using a screwdriver on his key chain the officer opened the first can of paint and poured the contents through the open manhole into the racing water below from the light of his flashlight po could see the purple paint mix with the water then spread out placing the empty can to the side the officer pried open a second and repeated the process at just that instant pos cell phone rang and he stepped a few feet away and answered ling sung rhee said i want you to come to headquarters weve captured a suspect right boss po said the authorities have decided to trace the flow of water in the storm sewers with paint hanley said to cabrillo cabrillo was wiping his wet face and hair with a hand towel once he was finished he tossed it onto a table and ran a comb quickly through his hair if they did realize our men had escaped through the sewers i was hoping that removing all the blueprints would slow down the pursuit long enough for our men to be extracted he said looks like we need to implement one of the backup plans hanley pointed to a computer screen as you know the outflow pipe we picked for the exit into the bay is the only one on the southwest point of the southern peninsula the outflow runs between the nam van lakes and enters the water just north of the island of taipa cabrillo stared at the computer screen the image of the storm sewers looked like a crooked tree with sagging limbs the sewer his team would use to exit was the trunk at the roots have we been able to establish contact with them cabrillo asked no luck with hornsby meadows and jones hanley admitted the portable radios they carry just dont seem to have enough power to penetrate the layers of soil overhead what about murph and kasim weve been trying hanley said but the voice transmission is spotty data seems to be passing through howeverwe are in contact by alphanumeric signals so we can type orders to the zodiacs and they can respond cabrillo asked so far hanley said eric stone interrupted the conversation sirs he said pointing to a screen the portable camera halpert left near the manhole is showing something you might want to watch cabrillo and hanley watched as the officer poured paint into the hole give me a simulation of how long that paint will take to reach our men cabrillo said quickly stones hands danced over the keyboards and a few seconds later the screen showing the sewer system began slowly to take on a red color the men stood watching as the color advanced along the arteries of the sewer system a counter in the corner of the screen timed the movement seventeen minutes until the paint reaches where we believe the men are now stone said slowly twentytwo until it reaches the water above taipa at just that instant a printer off to the side whirled and a sheet was spit into the tray hanley walked over and picked it up the order just went through to the police boats and the two chinese navy boats here in macau they are supposed to begin patrols immediately to scan for the colored water then when they find an outflow remain there on station start a timer cabrillo ordered quickly were in crunch time now make sure everyone is aboard and prepare the oregon to sail i want my team out of that storm sewer with the golden buddha and safely back aboardthen we need to vacate macau by first light with the chinese navy on patrol this ship is in jeopardy broken arrow hanley asked confirm broken arrow cabrillo said put it out mr stone hanley said stone sounded the alarm in a few minutes the oregon was a blur of activity tiny gunderson was eating a salami sandwich and sipping on a glass of iced tea as he flew over the south china sea the brunette flight attendant rhonda rosselli was sitting in the flight engineers chair the door to the cockpit was open and the blonde copilot judy michaels walked inside and slid back into her seat she was dressed in a khaki flight suit and her face was freshly scrubbed tracy is changing and checking the equipment she said did i tell you you did a great job gunderson asked you both are most convincing hos a masters degree in political science from georgetown and four years with the national security council and im sleeping with the enemy michaels said gunderson popped the last of the sandwich in his mouth then brushed the crumbs off his hands washing the last bite down with a sip of iced tea he spoke i think you forget i seduced a romanian countess a few years ago gunderson said we do what we have to to accomplish the objective i remember chuck michaels said in fact i seem to remember you rather enjoyed the assignment gunderson smiled so you didnt like yours michaels noted readings from the instrument panel on a clipboard the guy was a freak she said capital ph phreak then it serves him right gunderson said as he unbuckled his seat belt and slid from the pilots seat that we swiped his plane on the controls michaels said i have to use the restroom gunderson said to rosselli be right back in the dining room on the oregon winston spenser was sipping tea and worrying off to one side at a separate table a guard sat on silent watch juan cabrillo entered the dining room walked over to spenser and handed him a slip of paper thats the account number of the bank in paraguay cabrillo said the transfer has taken place and the funds are available now if the account is not accessed within one year of today the funds will automatically bounce back to one of our banks the second you make a deposit or withdrawal however within the next year the computer erases all traces of where the money came from or would go to why one year spenser asked because cabrillo said in the financial shape youre in if you dont touch the money in a year itll be because youre dead spenser nodded next cabrillo handed spenser a folder with a plane ticket hong kong to dubai then on to paraguay first class its the first available flight tomorrow morning spenser took the ticket here is ten thousand dollars in us currency cabrillo said handing spenser an envelope any more will arouse suspicions spenser took the envelope that concludes our agreement mr spenser cabrillo said we have called a cab to take you where you want to go it will be pulling up at the side of the ship in a few minutes the guard stood up and waited for spenser to rise cabrillo started for the door can i ask you a question spenser said cabrillo had just opened the door he stopped turned and nodded this all seems a little too perfect spenser said whats the catch you still have to make it to hong kong cabrillo said as he walked through the door on the oregons rear deck george adams waited as a landing pad on the fantail rose up to deck level a hard rain was raking the deck and the winds were a steady twenty knots from east to west he turned to tom reyes once the deckhand locks the lift in place we need to rotate the whirlybird into the wind he said then im going to need to make a hot takeoff into the wind reyes nodded and watched as another deckhand rolled a metal cart containing several boxes near the lift the elevator operator signaled that the lift was locked and adams and reyes walked over the robinson r helicopter was a mediumsized pistonengine craft with a top speed of just over miles an hour the weight was pounds the horsepower of the power plant and the cost was about the two men attached groundhandling wheels spun the ship around then removed the wheels and handed them to the deckhand we distributed the dye into plastic baggies like you ordered the deckhand noted adams nodded and turned to reyes keep the box at your feet but away from the foot pedals ill take us down as low as we can safely go but the ride will be touchy because of the wind i understand reyes said adams did a quick walk around the helicopter checking fuel oil and general condition then motioned to reyes hop in he said and well get this show on the road once both men were in the seats adams reached down and ran through the preflight checklist once he was done he screamed clear out the window and engaged the starter once the engine had fired and the clutch was engaged the rotor blades started slowly spinning then gathered speed until the helicopter was shaking and vibrating adams watched the gauges closely and when the engine was warmed and everything had settled down he spoke through the headset microphone to reyes hold on tom adams said this will be like a giant jump neutralizing the cyclic adams quickly lifted the collective and the tiny bird left the pad a second later adams eased the cyclic forward and the helicopter nosed over into the wind rising and moving forward at the same time clear of the oregon adams flew directly into the wind heading offshore a distance he then started to angle back toward macau around the knee of his flight suit was a strap with a metal clip and in the clip was a folded slip of paper showing the locations of the storm sewer outflows there we go adams said spotting the dirty water where a pipe spilled into the bay reyes reached down in the box removed a baggie slid the top open partway and then tossed it out the small window opening in the passenger door it tumbled through the ten feet from the helicopter to the water and began to spread out like blood from a rare steak in the distance a police boat heard the noise from the helicopter but it could not make it out in the rain adams moved the helicopter up the line salting the water on the east side of macau then he steered around the end of the peninsula between macau and taipa to repeat the exercise detective po parked in front of the headquarters of the macau police department then walked through the rain toward the front doors in the east the sky was lightening some but the rain continued on unabated entering the building he rode the elevator up to rhees floor then exited the elevator and walked down the hallway upon reaching the reception area he instantly knew that there was trouble afoot the us consular agent the mayor of macau a chinese general and four reporters were clustered around a man dressed entirely in black this isnt a case of shoplifting the man in black said loudly theyve stolen a boeing for gods sake it had been a case of blind luck for the software billionaire still refused a telephone call he had been brought to headquarters to be questioned by rhee in his office as soon as they had entered the office however the billionaire had noticed a copy of fortune magazine on rhees side table his face was gracing the cover once hed pointed that out to rhee things had begun happening fast the billionaire had turned from suspect to victim in seconds po walked over and stood next to rhee po heard him whisper damn as the elevator door opened again and stanley ho started down the hall have you found my buddha ho said as soon as he was within range who the hell is this the billionaire asked im stanley ho ho said in aggravation who the hell are you marcus friday the billionaire said loudly you might have heard of me and you of me ho said affronted im one of forbess richest people i know all the people ahead of me on the listyou arent one of them friday retorted detective po smiled to himself if all this was true it was the greatest game of oneupmanship he had ever seen here was a pair of obscenely rich men vying for attention like children trying to be picked for kickball yeah ho began to say well this is my town and you can mr ho detective po said quickly why dont you come down to my office so we can sort this out im not going anywhere ho said loudly everyone calm down rhee said he motioned to a conference room pointed for the reporters to remain in the foyer and then led the rest inside once everyone was inside and seated he picked up the telephone ordered tea to be delivered then spoke okay everyone he said slowly who wants to begin ho stared at the chief inspector a buddha i purchased for two hundred million dollars in switzerland was stolen tonight while you were at a party at my house i demand to know if you have recovered it yet i lost a hundred million dollars in bearer bonds and my to a gang of criminals the billionaire said and want to know what is going on in this godforsaken country po stood up and paced for a second was your plane valued over a hundred million he asked friday the billionaire shook his head then it looks like two hundred million is the highest bid here tonight po said the storm sewer was fast becoming a watery grave less than three feet separated the rising water from the arched dome of air overhead the drainpipes on the top of the tube were gushing like a downpour the water was littered with refuse washed from the streets above hornsby saw a rat swimming toward them in the current and slapped at the creature with a paddle just ahead was another junction we need to make a decision he shouted over the roar of the water sink or swim meadows looked forward in the dimming light from the miners hard hat he could just see the torrent ahead a cascade of white water that would make the rafts uncontrollable ready with the paddles he shouted the horse has to lead the cart digging into the water on the left side of the raft they swung the stern of their raft to the right the nose of the lead raft which was carrying the golden buddha pulled hard left but made the turn into the proper channel the turn was not as smooth for the raft carrying the trio of men it slammed amidships into the junction and the corner struck jones hard in his right side he hung there for a minute pressed against a concrete arch until the rope holding them to the lead raft went taut and yanked them down the channel jonesys been hurt meadows shouted above the din pete jones was clutching the side of his chest and wheezing to catch his breath turning his head in the dim light hornsby could just make out his shredded shirt and anguished expression my ribs jones managed to groan we need to cut the raft loose hornsby shouted theres no way well make the next turn maybe we should slit the side and sink the buddha meadows shouted then we can return when the water recedes and pull it out of here jones gritted his teeth and stared at his watch the oregon he said painfully is due to sail this morning if we dont get this out now we never will hornsby thought for a second then decided the next junction would be coming up in a few minutes taking a pen from his shirt pocket he stared at the gps then drew the rest of their intended course on the back of his hand bob he said im going onto the lead raft my weight will place it low in the water but it should still remain afloat as soon as im on top of the case holding the buddha cut me loose he handed meadows the gps you sure horny hornsby threw his paddle onto the top of the buddha pulled the rope to bring the rear raft closer then turned ready your knife he said unclipping a folding knife from his belt meadows opened the blade and nodded hornsby crouched and hopped the short distance to the lead raft as soon as he was clear meadows sliced through the tether then dug his paddle into the side to slow down his raft hornsby squirted ahead in the dim light meadows could see the buddha was awash and only a portion of hornsbys head and torso were above the waterline going right hornsby shouted as he pulled ahead then left as the storm sewer pipes came closer to the water they increased in diameter so the storm water would not become pressurized and blow apart the tiles at six places under macau were large square pondlike storage facilities where the water could pool and lose some speed before spilling out into the last series of pipes and eventually the bay murphy and kasim were motoring around in circles in one of them five more minutes murphy shouted then we go in and find them kasim gave three more blasts on the air horn they should be here by now he agreed at just that instant murphys digital pager beeped and he pushed the button to light the screen scrolling through the message he nodded his head they poured paint into the sewers to follow the flow he said as he steered the zodiac into another tight circle if it makes it down our escape channel were screwed what do you mean kasim asked the paint will bring the chinese to the area as well as marking the sides of the zodiac murphy said then theyll grab us and take us in for questioning whats the oregon recommend murphy was quiet for a moment before answering they want us to blow up the tunnel leading into here and seal off the tainted water how long do we have six minutes and fortyseven seconds murphy said removing a satchel charge from one of the bags in the bottom of the boat what about the others kasim asked if they arent out by then murphy said the oregon said to assume they took a wrong turn or drowned inside then we need to protect our own asses and make a safe retreat murphy angled the zodiac over to the pipe leading into the holding pool using the power of the outboard motor he held the boat in place against the strong current until kasim had attached the charges to the top of the storm sewer once the explosives were in place kasim activated the digital timer four three two one and the red light blinked give the signal again murphy said as he backed the zodiac away it was like hornsby was riding a log down a flume he was almost awash and the distance over his head to the top of the pipe was narrowing as the water continued rising the last turn had been made by gouging his paddle into the water and bringing the bow slightly to one side he readied his leg to push against the wall for the next bend hornsby had lost sight of the others the light on his hard hat was nearly out and he had no way to know if meadows and jones had taken the correct channel anyway there was nothing he could do if they hadnt he was more concerned for his own survival he jammed his leg against the wall and the raft lumbered over into the correct channel and then like the distant chirping of a mother bird calling her young he heard the faint sound of a horn sounding three times the raft with hornsby atop the golden buddha raced on the current in the direction of the sound as the zodiac circled kasim attempted to keep a portable spotlight trained at the opening of the pipe the timer on the satchel charge was ticking down and quite honestly he was beginning to lose faith this was all going to work out two minutes he said over the sound of the motor murphy listened intently a sound was coming from the tunnel that sounded like the bellowing of a wounded animal and then riding on a scream and a prayer cliff hornsby shot from the pipe and slid halfway across the pond murphy quickly angled the zodiac alongside and kasim grabbed the edge of the raft where are the others murphy shouted hornsby wiped the water from his eyes and glanced at the highbarreled ceiling just barely visible from the spotlight trained on the timer they were right behind me did you see any colored water kasim asked what do you mean they poured paint in the manhole to trace the flow of water murphy said did you see anything in the water no hornsby said one minute thirty seconds kasim said whats happening hornsby asked weve been ordered to seal off this exit murphy said so we have a chance at a clean escape sound the horn jones was lying in the bottom of the raft barely able to move if they had to go in the water or needed to attempt an escape meadows figured hed have to carry him they had made the last turn but just barely anything from here on out had a limited chance for success hows it going pal he asked jones listened to the distant sound then opened his eyes and grimaced did you hear that what meadows asked thinking jones was hallucinating they came for us jones said eighteen seconds later their raft shot out of the pipe and into the holding pond i dont have time to explain murphy yelled but take this line and hold tight just passed thirty kasim yelled murphy finished tying the leads for the two rafts to the rear of the zodiac then slammed the throttle forward the outboard prop dug into the water and the boat lurched forward across the holding pond then into the exit tunnel heads down murphy shouted staring at his stopwatch at just that instant a roar filled the square holding area and reverberated out the escape tunnel a second later the inflow pipe collapsed down on itself and sealed off the holding pond at the same time a wave began to build that rolled across the pond and sought the only opening the top of the wave was higher than the exit pipe and filled the outflow to overflowing kasim swung the spotlight around and noticed the approaching tsunami shock wave approaching he shouted as the zodiac with the rafts in tow entered the pipe leading to the bay on board the oregon preparations for departure were moving at lightning speed juan cabrillo reached for the telephone and placed a call to the acting harbormaster dont worry he said after lying that his parent company had ordered him to leave immediately we have another ship lined up in manila to take the load of fireworks to the united states shell be here day after tomorrow the harbormaster seemed to accept this as fact because it was late and little was happening he was talkative singapore cabrillo said in answer to his question but they havent told me the cargo only that we need to be there seventytwo hours from now singapore was fifteen hundred miles as a crow flies and from what the harbormaster had heard the oregon would be hardpressed to make twenty knots an hour the man had no way to know that if the ship made it into open water by sunrise it could be in singapore by lunch the next day nor did he know the oregon was not going to singapore at all yes cabrillo said its pushing for sure but orders are orders is the pilot on his way here the harbormaster answered in the affirmative and cabrillo hurried to get off the telephone well keep an eye out for him cabrillo finished and thank you hanging up the telephone cabrillo turned to hanley the time was am sounds like he bought it cabrillo said order the lookout to watch for the approaching pilot boat hanley nodded the helicopter with adams and reyes is back and ive ordered all the hatches battened down which means we need to retrieve the zodiacs in open water what do you hear from them cabrillo asked seng and huxley report they are still waiting outside hanley said staring at his watch murphy was ordered to blow up an inner cavern any time about now to seal off the flow of paint and at least allow the four rescuers to escape as of the last communication a few minutes ago hornsby jones and meadows had not shown up with the golden buddha i dont like it cabrillo said i had to make a decision when you were dealing with the art dealer hanley said quietly if the helicopter salting the water didnt throw off the chinese not only would we lose the men in the tunnel but the rescue crew as well i know max cabrillo said youre just following the book the two men stared at one another for a moment then eric stone spoke sirs stone said pointing at a screen we just detected a shock wave from an explosion murphy had the throttle on the zodiac as far forward as she would go the trio of boats was rocketing down the tunnel leading out to the bay they were only ten feet ahead of the approaching wave from the explosion but now that they were at full speed the margin was remaining constant try to reach seng on the radio murphy shouted over the noise and tell him whats happening kasim nodded and reached for the microphone eddie he shouted into the microphone we have the target with us clear away from the openingwere coming out hot got it seng shouted from just outside the pipe a few minutes before seng and huxley had heard the rumble from the explosion and had climbed aboard the second zodiac they were just backing away from shore when kasim radioed seng turned the zodiac and then accelerated away into the bay once they reached the edge of the fog and rain band he turned toward land and pointed a spotlight at the outflow pipe call the oregon he said to huxley and report team two is on their way out the pilot boat pulled alongside the oregon a single tugboat hovered nearby awaiting instructions from the pilot the pilot climbed off his boat at a boarding ladder made his way on deck and then stared around the upper deck was a tangled mess of rusting equipment and cables he stared above where the smokestack was polluting the air around the slip with smoky oily fumes this was a ship begging to be put out of her misery at a scrapyard what a pile of junk the pilot muttered to himself a man stepped from behind a pillar im captain smith he said welcome aboard the captain was dressed in a tattered yellow rain slicker spotted with grease and dirt his face had a full beard stained around the mouth by nicotine and when smith cracked a smile he showed a forest of yellow stubs im ready to guide you out the pilot said staying a safe distance away from the mans odor this way the captain said turning the pilot followed the captain as he wove his way around the tangled mess on the decks to the rusted metal stair leading to the pilothouse halfway up the stair the pilot gripped for a handrail and it came off in his hand captain he said smith turned then walked a few steps to where the pilot was stopped then he took the length of rusted pipe in his hand and tossed it over his shoulder onto the cluttered deck ill make a note of that he said swiveling around again and climbing the last few steps to the pilothouse the pilot shook his head the sooner he was off the ship the happier hed be six minutes later the oregon was turned and partway out of the port the pilot ordered the line from the tug removed and the oregon headed away from land under her own power to the rear of the oregon now growing dimmer in the distance the mountain peak on macau began to recede in the rain and fog only a few lights from the airport remained in sight how long until you can be picked up cabrillo asked the pilot the pilot pointed to a channel marker thirty yards ahead the highpowered light was penetrating the gloom a few more minutes and he could be off this beast of a ship light at the end of the tunnel murphy shouted the zodiac was racing toward the bay just ahead of the shock wave that would fill the pipe to the top hornsby was holding tight to his raft and the top of the golden buddha while meadows gripped the side of the zodiac and glanced down at jones who was clutching his side in the bottom of the raft a few more seconds jonesy he shouted and well be in the clear jones nodded but did not speak the exit from the pipe was like riding over a waterfall on a class iv rapid the water was spewing out of the pipe with tremendous force the plume cascaded through the air twenty feet then dropped seven feet down to the water of the bay murphy held to the wheel as the zodiac was propelled through the air as soon as he felt the boat leave the water he pulled back on the throttle so he wouldnt overrev the engine then braced himself for the splashdown let go he screamed to hornsby and meadows the lines on the two towed rafts were released and they separated a few feet from the zodiac at the same instant the wall of water filled the pipe then burst through the air with tremendous force wow seng shouted at the sight of the rafts squirting through the air hold on meadows shouted to jones as the raft flew through the air then slapped on the surface of the water before slowing almost to a stop are you okay meadows said a few seconds later do you need anything jones wiped the water from his face then shifted his body to ease the pain of his cracked ribs as the raft stopped in the water and bobbed ive been better jones said i think it would help if you would hum a few bars of suwannee river po was inside the conference room with rhee ho and marcus friday a police sergeant entered and whispered in his ear what the hell do you mean he asked a few of our people heard what sounded like a helicopter the sergeant said now all the waters around macau are a bright pink color those bastards po said theyre covering their tracks who the sergeant asked i dont know who po said but i intend to find out po waved the sergeant away then walked over to rhee and motioned for him to move a few feet away so they could talk in private once he explained what the sergeant had told him rhee had only one thing to say seal the port rhee said no one in or out as soon as kasim helped meadows and jones aboard the zodiac murphy slit the rubber raft with a knife the raft drifted away and began to sink at the same time seng and huxley helped hornsby aboard and the three of them wrestled the golden buddha aboard their zodiac murphy idled his boat close just as they had finished stowing the golden icon amidships i just spoke to hanley he said to seng the oregon is almost to the outer buoy we are supposed to rendezvous with them in open water kasim raised his hand for quiet as the radio barked he listened intently over his earpiece got it he said that was the oregon again he said they just intercepted a transmission from the police to the port authorities they have ordered the port sealedno one in or out the police and port authority boats have been given orders to fire on any craft that refuses to comply shh seng said the sound of a ship under power came across the water theyre coming seng said captain smith walked the pilot to the ladder leading down and bid him farewell the pilot climbed down the ladder then stepped across to the pilot boat which quickly backed away from the oregon smith watched the pilot boat accelerate away into the rain the pilot boat was still visible when it began to slow and turn cabrillo reached for a tiny radio at his belt and flicked it on max he said quickly whats happening the authorities have ordered the port sealed hanley said the pilots been ordered to bring us back to port cabrillo sprinted across the deck as he spoke full steam ahead he shouted ill be in the control room in a few minutes rhee was in his office the ports night manager was on the other end of the phone line they wont stop he asked the pilot boat cant reach them the port manager noted the pilot that guided them out mentioned that the vessel was in terrible shapemaybe their radios are faulty have the pilot boat outrun them and deliver the message in person i already ordered that the manager said in exasperation but the ship keeps gaining speedthe pilot boat cant seem to catch up with her i thought you said the ship was a rust bucket rhee said shes a fast rust bucket the manager noted our pilot boats can do over thirty knots damn rhee said how long until the ship reaches international waters not long the manager admitted get me the navy rhee shouted to po who reached for another telephone what do you want us to do the port manager asked nothing rhee said youve already done enough he slammed down the telephone and took the one in pos hand the second in command of the chinese navy detachment in macau was on the line this is the chief of the macau police we need you to stop a ship heading out into the south china sea he said quickly we have a hydrofoil that can run at sixtyfive knots the chinese navy officer told him but it isnt very heavily armed this is an old cargo ship rhee said loudly i doubt shell put up much of a fight rhee had no way of knowing it but hed just made the biggest error of his life cabrillo burst into the control room shedding his grimy rain suit while at the same time removing the dental appliance that made his teeth appear as stubs he tossed both to the side and tugged at his fake beard as he spoke okay whats the situation we just intercepted a communiqué from the chinese navy to their highspeed hydrofoil theyve been ordered to intercept usa naval frigate and a fastattack corvette are following any other ships no hanley said thats the only chinese navy firepower currently in macau wheres our team with the golden buddha cabrillo asked as he tossed the beard aside then spit out a sliver of latex left over from the false teeth mold they are driving at full speed out of port stone said pointing to a screen but it looks like they have picked up a tail get me adams cabrillo said while hes making his way here have the deckhands drop the walls on the helicopter pad and start raising the robinson from the lower hangar got it stone said max cabrillo said get me langston overholt on a secure line hanley started to assemble the satellite link cabrillo stared at the screen showing the progress of the zodiacs and the ship pursuing them then he glanced over at another screen that showed the oregons location and the path of the chinese navy vessels giving chase the screens were filled with blinking lights and estimated paths adams will be here in a second stone said sound battle stations cabrillo said quietly stone pushed a button and a loud whooping noise filled the oregon belowdecks in the sick bay gunther reinholt heard the sound and sat up in bed swiveling to one side he slid his feet into a pair of carpet slippers rising to his full height he reached around and tightened his hospital gown around his body then with one hand on his iv drip which was hanging from a stainlesssteel rack with a wheeled base he began to shuffle from the sick bay to the engine room reinholt knew that if the oregon went to war they would need every hand on station the captain of the chinese navy hydrofoil galeforce deng ching stared through the square floortoceiling windows of the control room with a pair of highpowered binoculars his craft had risen up to her full height of twelve feet above the water a few moments before the hydrofoil was now reaching speeds of nearly fifty knots ching turned and glanced at the radar screen the cargo ship was still a distance away but the gap was closing are the sailors on the forward guns locked and loaded he asked his second in command yes sir the officer replied once we draw closer ill want to send a volley over their heads ching said that should be enough the second in command agreed langston overholt sat in his office in langley virginia on his left ear was the secure telephone connected to cabrillo on the oregon his right ear was occupied by a telephone connected to the admiral in command of the pacific theater presidential directive four twentyone he said to the admiral now what do you have nearby were checking now the admiral said ill know in a few minutes can you bring some force to bear on the chinese without it being tied to the us understood mr overholt the admiral said force from afar thats it exactly admiral leave it to the navy the admiral said well come up with something the telephone went dead overholt replaced the receiver and spoke to cabrillo hold tight juan he said quietly helps a coming fair enough cabrillo said before disconnecting in the movies when a submarine goes to battle stations it does so with much whooping from sirens and gongs men scurry down narrow passageways as they race to their stations and the tension that comes over the big screen is palpable and thick reality is somewhat different noise inside or outside a submarine is the enemyit can lead to detection and death on board the united states navy los angelesclass attack submarine santa fe the motions for battle were more like a roadie setting up a rock concert than the chaos of someone yelling fire in a crowded theater a red light signaling action pulsed from numerous fixtures mounted in all the rooms and passageways the crew moved with purpose but not haste the action they would take had been rehearsed a thousand times they were as natural to the crew as shaving and showering the commander of the santa fe captain steven farragut stood on the command deck and received the condition reports from his crew with practiced ease electric check completed on packages one and two an officer reported acknowledged farragut said boat rising to optimal firing depth the driver reported excellent farragut said easily countermeasures and detection at one hundred percent another officer reported perfect farragut said sensors report clear sir the chief of boat said we appear to be alone out here we can commence operation inside of eight repeat eight minutes acknowledged farragut said the great beast was rising from the depths and preparing to bite if necessary adams burst into the control room of the oregon he was dressed in a tan flight suit that he was zipping up as he approached mr chairman he said smiling a blindingly white smile what can i do for you cabrillo pointed to one of the computer screens george we have a situation we have the two zodiacs along with seven of our people trying to get out of macau waters we cant turn to pick them up because were being pursued ourselves cabrillo pointed to another screen you can see they also have a tail you need to provide support ill mount the experimental weapons pods mr hanley designed for the robinson that gives me minirockets and a small chain gun so i can cover their exit what about the extraction system cabrillo asked i cant pull seven people aboard adams said i dont have the payload thats not what i was thinking cabrillo said let me explain captain ching stared at the radar screen he had been told the ship he was supposed to intercept was an aging cargo ship named the oregon from the description given by the pilot the vessel was little more than a bucket of rust somehow ching was beginning to doubt thatgale force was steaming at fifty knots and if the radar on the computer screen was correct the cargo ship was doing fortyfive at the current speeds the oregon would be safely in international waters in less than five minutes then there would be the risk of a major incident if the sailors on gale force attempted a boarding give me full speed ching ordered the engine room the hydrofoil is accelerating hanley noted at the increased speed they will intercept us a minute or two before we reach the demarcation line cabrillo glanced at the screen showing the water in front of the oregon the clouds were finally clearing and soon they would be free of the fog bank lets raise them on the radio cabrillo said and explain the situation stone started tuning the radio while cabrillo reached for a different microphone engine room he said sir a voice said this is reinholt cabrillo didnt bother to ask why the ailing engineer was not in sick bay as he had been ordered the man had obviously felt well enough to help reinholt cabrillo said quickly is there any way to coax out a few more knots were on it sir reinholt answered down belowdecks the weapons pods had already been attached to both sides of the r while the elevator lifted the helicopter up to launch height adams slid a pair of nomex flight gloves over his hands then slid a pair of yellowtinted sunglasses over his eyes he stepped from foot to foot in anticipation and as soon as the elevator stopped and locked in place he raced over did a quick preflight and checked the underneath harness then stepped to the pilots door of the robinson and cracked it open he was sliding into the seat as a deckhand raced over do you want me to pull the pins the deckhand asked arm me adams said quickly then clear the deck im out of here as soon as i have operating temps the man bent down removed the pins from the missiles and checked the power to the minigun once he was finished he popped his head inside the door again check your weapons console adams stared at the small screen attached to the side of the dashboard im green the deckhand shut the door and raced away adams waited until he was clear then engaged the starter four minutes and twentyeight seconds later using the surface wind from the accelerating oregon as a crutch adams lifted from the deck then pivoted the r in midair turned and headed back toward macau the zodiacs were skimming across the water at thirty knots according to their crude radars they were keeping ahead of the pursuing boats but just barely sengs boat with the added weight of the golden buddha was straining to maintain speed he had the throttle all the way to the stops but there was no more speed to be coaxed from his engine the fog and rain were still thick and they shielded the inflatable boats from the pursuers but seng could sense they were just out of visual and auditory range if one thing went wrongan engine miss or overheating a leak in the inflatable pontoons that slowed them downthey would be toast at the same instant seng was having his dark thoughts huxley heard the oregon calling over the radio she cupped her hand over her ear so she could hear because of the potential for interception the message was brief and to the point help is on the way stone said understand huxley answered she turned to seng and hornsby the oregons sending the cavalry she said not a moment too soon seng said as he stared at the temperature gauge for his engine now beginning to creep into the red not too far distant the zodiac carrying kasim murphy meadows and jones heard the message as well kasim was steering meadows standing alongside with jones lying prone on the deck to the stern once meadows heard the news he turned crouched down then yelled the news over the sound of the wind and waves to jones i wish id have known jones quipped i would have asked them to bring some aspirin you want another bottle of water meadows asked not unless theres a bathroom on board jones said grimacing hang in there buddy meadows said well be home soon like the distant view of a shoplifter across a crowded store the outline of the oregon started to form through chings binoculars as the fog began to clear concentrating on the hull ching could see the large whitecapped wake being created by the racing cargo ship the wake and the cargo ships track were like nothing he had ever witnessed before most cargo ships and ching had tracked and intercepted more than a few moved through the water like lumbering manateesthis iranianflagged vessel he was chasing moved like a thoroughbred in heat the water out the stern was not churning as with most ships instead it seemed to be forming into concentric whirlpools that flattened the sea to the rear as if a large container of glycerin had been poured overboard ching stared at the decks but no crew was visible there was only rusty metal and junk piled high though the decks were deserted the oregon did not give the appearance of a ghost ship no ching thought beneath her metal skin much was happening at just that instant a mediumsized helicopter flew over the gale force about a hundred yards to the port side just above wavetop level where did that come from ching asked his electronics officer what sir the officer said staring up from a screen a helicopter ching said heading from sea toward land it didnt show up on the sensors the officer said are you sure you saw it through the fog yes ching said loudly i saw it he walked over to the screen and stared at the radar returns whats happening he asked a few seconds later the electronics officer was short and slim he looked like a jockey in a fancy uniform his hair was jet black and straight and his eyes brownedged with bloodshot red from staring at the radar sir he said finally im not sure what you see has been happening intermittently since we began the chase one second we seem to get a clear return then it jumps to the other side of the screen like its a video game playing hideandseek the image is not even the correct size captain ching noted it grows then diminishes to a pinprick the officer said then jumps across the screen ching stared out the window again they were drawing closer to the oregon theyre jamming us i can detect that the officer said then what is it ching asked the officer thought for a minute i read in a translated science journal about an experimental system an american engineer was building instead of making objects disappear as with stealth or using extra signals as on most jamming equipment this system has a computer that takes in all the signals from our hull and reforms them into different shapes and strengths so this system can make them appear or disappear as they decide ching said incredulously thats about it sir the officer said well ching said finally theres no way an old rust bucket has anything like that on board well lets hope not sir the electronics officer said whys that ching asked because the article also stated that by changing the object dimensions they can increase the targeting potential which means that if the frigate to the rear or the fastattack corvette coming up quick on our stern fires anything other than bullets and they have a system like this they could redirect the fire to us chinese missiles used to sink chinese ships exactly ramming and jamming eric stone shouted lincoln was on the far side of the control room at the primary fire control station he was running a quick diagnostic check on the missile battery he stared intently at the bar graphs as they filled the computer screen mr chairman im good to go he shouted toward cabrillo a few seconds later cabrillo turned to hanley heres the deal as i see it the entire thrust of this operation was the retrieval of the golden buddha we have it but its still inside the circle of chinese influence our first priority must be to get our teams and the golden buddha safely back on the oregon while at the same time making our escape i hate to say it juan hanley said but i wish the weather wasnt clearing a wasted wish but i agree cabrillo said we dont know what the navy is sending hanley noted but we can safely assume there wont be surface ships involvedour sensors dont detect any other vessels for a hundred miles they launched cruise missiles from the persian gulf into downtown baghdad cabrillo said so we can assume either missile or aircraft support the enemy has rockets on the fastattack corvette and some long guns that can fire highexplosive rounds plus the frigate should have some chinesemade cruisetype missiles they any good cabrillo asked not as accurate as ours hanley admitted but they can sink a ship the hydrofoil deckmounted machine guns only hanley said and the zodiacs are being pursued by harbor patrol boats correct hanley said a pair of fortysixfoot aluminum cruisers with diesel power they each have a single bowmounted machine gun radios nothing special hanley said so even if we took out the harbor boats cabrillo said the zodiacs would still need to pass the trio of vessels on our tail im afraid so hanley agreed cabrillo started sketching on a yellow pad with a black magic marker when he finished he handed the pad to hanley make sense to you yep hanley said okay then cabrillo said forcefully hard a starboard were going back toward land adams eased the cyclic to the left and banked the r a few seconds earlier he had passed to port of the chinese corvette and had just picked up a glimpse of the vessel through the fog it was a wonder the chinese vessel had not fired on himsurely they had detected the helicopter as it flew toward land the frigate was fast approaching and adams planned to give it a wide berth he was keeping the robinson five to ten feet above the tops of the wavesmaybe that was shielding him from detection but adams doubted it to avoid radar detection he needed to be closer to the wave topstwo three feet maximum with the weapons pods hanging from each side of his skids and seawater detrimental to their correct operation adams was taking no chances if he had to trade avoiding fire from the chinese ships to arriving too high to help his team members hed do it adams eased forward on the cyclic and watched as the governor adjusted his rotor speed he was doing miles an hour and according to his calculations he should be seeing the first zodiac one minute fortyfive seconds after he passed the frigate he strained his eyes to catch sight of the chinese vessel while at the same time watching the dashmounted storm scope which was sending a radar signal into the weather huxley pointed to the dash of the zodiac but said nothing seng nodded then bent down and shouted into her ear if i was to guess he screamed id say we have something partially blocking the raw water intake holes on the drive might be something as simple as a piece of soaked paper or part of a plastic bagthe problem is we need to stop and raise the outboard out of the water to check it doesnt seem to be getting any worse julia huxley said no it doesnt seng said we are in the low red and staying there if the engine can run at those temperatures for a little longer we might just make it out of here alive huxley scanned the water through the fog as they raced along she turned and caught a quick glimpse of the zodiac being piloted by kasim off the starboard stern the pair of diesel cruisers had yet to get close enough to catch sight of either vessel and if they maintained their speed they never would too bad we cant ask for a time out huxley said so i can clean the water intake eddie seng strained to hear huxleys voice over the noise of his racing outboard motor something else was causing his ears to perk upa slight thumping coming from the bow then through the fog he caught a glimpse of the r and a voice came over the radio the command bridge on the gale force was a buzz of shouted instructions messages were repeated more than once as the news that the oregon was starting a turn back to land was relayed from radar operator to captain captain to helmsman then around to the other officers the event was relayed to the captains of the corvette and the frigate who immediately began to slow captain ching figured it would take the oregon close to a nautical mile to complete the turn once again ching would underestimate with magnetohydrodynamics engines powering the oregon there was no need to slow down to change directions on the drives there were no shafts to twist no props to bend no gears to strip the water jets from the stern came out of a rectangular shaft with a scoop on the end that could be diverted like the thrust of a harrier jet engine to the fore or to the rear with the push of a few buttons one of the propulsion engineers could divert the flow of one engine forward and one back and the oregon would almost pivot on her keel so long as the speeds were kept below thirty knots such an abrupt maneuver made for a rough ridethe ship would kneel over and the gunwales would dip almost into the waterbut the corporation had done it more than once other than a few broken dishes and other objects being tossed around the oregon had been none the worse for the wear the engineer plotted in a turnradius profile on the computer that resembled a uturn then he alerted the control room that they were ready once the ship commander gave the order the engineer simply pushed a button and held on to a nearby table as the oregon threaded herself across the surface of the water as if she were on rails down in the engine room sam pryor glanced over at gunther reinholt who had just disconnected his iv and was sipping from a cup of strong coffee after inputting the command for the turn elementary mr reinholt pryor said smiling indubitably mr pryor reinholt said both men stared at the lyingdown ushaped track on the computer screen for a second mr chairman reinholt said over the intercom were ready when you are were going to do a fast turn and bunch up the three ships chasing us cabrillo said over a scrambled radio link you will need to take out the pair of cruisers fast so the zodiacs can slow before they run up on the stern of the frigate understand adams said well alert seng and kasim to slow as soon as the cruisers are disabled ill blow all the ordnance of the port pod on the lead cruiser adams said and the starboard on the following craft that should stop them cold do your best to hit them in the sterns cabrillo said if possible we want to keep casualties to a minimum at almost the same instant that the lead harbor police patrol boat caught sight of kasims zodiac in the lessening fog the lookout also reported a helicopter approaching from out to sea adams had turned and looped the r around to intercept the lead boat straight on her rear quarter placing the crosshairs on the firing screen on the rear third of the fortysixfoot aluminum ship adams flipped a switch so all the missiles were targeted to the same spot just above the waterline then he took a deep breath and squeezed the trigger the lookout caught a quick glimpse of the bubble canopy of the helicopter a second before the port weapons pod erupted with a volley of four missiles the missiles were smallonly slightly thicker than a mans armbut their noses were packed with high explosives with a sixfoot plume of fire belching from the rear the missiles raced across the gap and slammed into the side of the lead cruiser and severed the bow from the stern as easily as a machete through a pineapple the captain just had time to sound the alarm to abandon ship before the bow started sinking now mr reinholt cabrillo said as an alarm sounded throughout the ship reinholt reached up to the console and pushed a red button then took hold of the table next to him in a death grip the oregon keeled over and started to turn it was as if the ship were on the track of a roller coaster the g forces were severe everyone in the ship clutched the nearest immovable object and bent their knees like mogul skiers on a gnarly slope a few moments later the oregon came out of the fallen u and rolled upright again lincoln sitting in a tall fire control chair with a seat belt across his lap shouted yeah baby well pass abreast of the hydrofoil in twenty seconds hanley said hit them in the pontoon mr lincoln cabrillo said what the ching started to say as he watched the massive cargo ship change directions hard a port he ordered but before the order could be carried out the oregon was almost alongside them everywherei go im just a gigolo lincoln sang as he lined up his target and fired the missile battery on the bow of the oregon popped up and rotated toward the target now at lincolns command a pair of harpoon missiles burst from their launchers and streaked across the distance they slammed into the thin slabsided pontoon that reached down into the water and blew it off as cleanly as a guillotine would a finger the gale force was still making fast forward speed when she was hit once the pontoon allowing her to ride up above the waterline disappeared her main deck lurched to the side then began to topple over she didnt quite flip over on her backit was more of a crippled disintegration into the water the helmsman managed to place the engines in neutral before she flipped and that saved lives if not the ship a minute after being hit the gale force had her decks awash and she was rapidly sinking captain deng ching was bleeding from his nose and mouth after slamming into the command console he was in a daze from pain the second in command gave the order to abandon ship a helicopter just attacked the captain of the rapidly sinking harbor police boat shouted into a portable radio as he climbed into the emergency raft our boat is sinking understood the captain of the second harbor boat said well come pick you up ill shoot a flare well watch for it then the captain turned to a sailor nearby man the deck gun he said quickly and if any aircraft approaches shoot it down the first time had worked so well adams decided to do it again once again approaching from the port side he lined up the crosshairs on the second harbor boat and pushed the button nothing happened perhaps the starboard weapons pod had been splashed with more seawater than had the port maybe it was simply that the few extra minutes of time had allowed the fog and rain to seep into the circuitry it could have been a glitchthis was the first time the weapons pod had been usedand rarely did a system work flawlessly the first time out whatever the case the missiles wouldnt fire from the tubes the r passed over the harbor patrol boat just as the sailor yanked back the lever on the deck gun and flicked off the safety he pivoted the gun to the correct height and started shooting at the rear of the retreating helicopter adams felt the cyclic get mushy as a single bullet nicked a control rod to the main rotor he flew away into the fog to assess the situation control he said over a secure channel on the radio ive eliminated one target but now my horse is wounded and they broke my bow hanley took the call in the control room of the oregon he scanned the radar screen before answering do you have control of the craft its not too bad adams said calmly i think i can set her down okay were coming in your direction now hanley said blow the pods and bring the ship home what do you mean adams asked theres a toggle switch on the weapons control panel hanley said flip up the cover and lower the switch and the racks will drop free well deal with the second boat adams started an arc toward the harbor boat give me a second he said i have an idea across the room juan cabrillo was on the satellite telephone to langston overholt in virginia we had to sink the vessel closest to us he said but theres a corvette and a frigate still to contend with overholt was pacing in his office while talking on the speaker phone in front of his desk sitting in a chair and dressed in full uniform was a united states navy commander who was attached to the cia i have a naval officer here in my office my superiors are worried about fallout if you attack and sink the other two ships how far away from you are they we are in no imminent danger for a few more minutes cabrillo stated if we can stop them in their tracks overholt asked can you effect an escape cabrillo thought for a minute before answering we can retrieve our men and the object we came for and be back at full steam in five to ten minutes he said as long as the chinese dont launch any planes at us i think we will be home free as of this instant overholt said the only radio transmission that got through was about a helicopter attacking a harbor police boat right now at least as far as the chinese are concerned youre just a cargo ship they cant reach on the radio that could change however once the survivors of the ship you sank are collected by then we should be far out to sea traveling south cabrillo said and back into the fog bank with the electronics on board we can hide from shiptosea radar the fog will keep us hidden from above overholt turned to the navy commander will this new device affect our ship as well not if they turn all the electronics off as it passes alongside juan overholt said did you hear that yes he said but i dont understand its a new toy the navy has overholt said called a fritzy it is designed to short out electrical circuits and we believe it will disable the remaining ships what well need you to do is shut down all the systems on the oregon when we give you the order eric stone was scanning the radar and said were coming up on the zodiacs now slow to stop cabrillo ordered prepare to take our people aboard adams climbed to three thousand feet then dove toward the harbor boat in the steepest angle the r could handle he could feel his body go light in the seat and then tighten against the shoulder harness through the plexiglas bubble windscreen the harbor boat came into view then grew in size as he streaked down from above the bow gunner tried firing on the helicopter but his arc of fire was limited by the wheelhouse directly behind him the gunner got off a few hundred rounds while the helicopter was still high in the air but the rounds went wide and then he could fire no more adams raced down in a steep dive when he was only eighty feet above the stern he pulled back on the cyclic and up on the collective this slowed the dive then began to raise the nose just as the r hit the bottom of her arc adams flipped up the cover and down on the toggle switch both pods dropped from the sides of the helicopter and plunged straight down into the stern of the last harbor police boat a static spark from the pods being cut loose fired one of the remaining missiles and it streaked down the last twenty feet igniting the rear of the boat in a maelstrom of destruction with the weight and drag of the pods gone adams found he had better control turning the robinson toward the direction of the oregon he began to scan the water for the outline of the ship scratch two he said quietly im coming home when a person is far out in the ocean and the weather is bad the sight of anything manmade brings comfort and solace for the seven people and one golden buddha on the small boats being chased by the chinese navy the bow of the oregon looming up through the fog was as welcome as the sight of four of a kind to a losing poker player steer over to the davits hanley said over the radio we need to get you aboard fast the two zodiac pilots eased their boats into a pair of davits located off the port and starboard stern of the oregon the deckhands had the boats and the people hoisted through the air and back on the deck in less than two minutes murphy was climbing off the zodiac when franklin lincoln walked over i played with your toy he said you can put another ship sticker on the console murphy smiled good shooting tex everyone okay lincoln asked all but jones murphy said pointing we need to carry him to sick bay lincoln walked across the deck to the second zodiac and stared inside jones he said smiling you look pitiful dont make me laugh jones said my ribs are killing me you do what you set out to do lincoln asked always jones said pointing to the case containing the golden buddha now get me below to the sick bay and fill me up with painkillers up you go lincoln said as he reached into the inflatable and carefully lifted jones from the floor as easily as plucking a puppy from a litter three minutes to fire a voice said over the intercom on board the santa fe down in the launch bay the pair of modified tomahawk cruise missiles with the experimental fritzy electronic destruction modules sat ready to launch the fritzy system used a burst of electronic waves to scramble the circuitry of any powered electronics captain farragut was waiting anxiously for the launch the anxiety did not stem from being worried about his crews actionsthey were highly trained and would perform the task flawlessly it was caused by the unknown farragut was curious if fritzy was all it was cracked up to beand if he could soon claim the crown as the first commander to use it in battle that fact might help at promotion time at the very least it would be worth a few free drinks once the santa fe made port again doors open sir the chief of boat said and all is in order we see you hanley said to adams but you need to land now adams was making his approach behind the stern of the oregon and lining up for his descent onto the landing pad two minutes or so adams said in a minute thirty hanley said staring at a timer your electronics will cease to function clear the decks adams said loudly ill climb then shut the engine off and initiate autorotation firefoam the decks hanley said over the intercom we shut down all the electrical power in one minute many people think that once a helicopter loses power it plunges from the sky actually if power to the rotor is lost the pilot can use the wind from his descent to spin the blades the procedure autorotation is tricky but the maneuver has saved more than a few lives over the years usually the pilot has a reasonably large field or clearing to land on doing a forced autorotation onto a pad just slightly bigger than the helicopter herself takes nerves of steel and fortitude adams used his minute to gain altitude then he lined up behind the landing pad when his watch said it was time he flicked off the governor and rolled back the throttle the rs freewheeling unit engaged and the drive shaft to the main and tail rotor disconnected adams reached up and turned off the key suddenly without the noise from the engine it was strangely quiet the only sounds the whooshing of the wind racing past the fuselage and the sound from adamss lips as he whistled bobby darrins mack the knife the r was making a steeper descent than normal but adams was in complete control only when all the lights on the oregon went dark in the fog did he give it a second thought one away the chief of boat said quietly now two the cruise missiles left the launch tubes and streaked skyward then turned and dived down to wave level programmed to the target by a sophisticated computer the missiles raced toward the chinese corvette and the frigate at kilometers an hour once the cruise missiles were close to the two ships they sent out a concentrated burst of electronic friction similar to that emitted after an atomic bomb blast the electronic circuits throughout both ships shorted as cleanly as if a switch had been thrown the engines ceased to function and the electronics in the wheelhouse and below went black both ships slowed in the water just as a burst of wind and rain raked across the sea yeeha adams shouted as the wind hit the r he was eighty feet back of the stern and twenty feet in the air when he initiated his flare pulling up on the cyclic he pitched the nose up using the drag on the powerless rotor to bleed off forward speed he was four feet above the pad when the forward speed ceased and the robinson dropped down on the deck with a thud the foam reached halfway up the fuselage as adams pulled on the rotor brake to stop the blades from spinning then he unlocked and pushed the door open next he began to unsnap his harness richard truitt waded through the dissolving foam to the door as soon as the rotor stopped you okay he asked shaken but not stirred adams smiled whats new at just that instant the oregon started moving again truitt shrugged were heading out open seas adams said climbing from the cockpit here we come fill out a repair order truitt said then meet me in the cafeteria we need to do a little planning the two men reached the edge of the foam just as a deckhand began to hose the foam over the side with a stream of seawater they brushed flecks off their pants as they made their way to the door leading inside do i need to bring anything special adams asked highaltitude performance charts truitt answered theoregon steamed south just inside the edge of the storm the time was am and the cafeteria aboard smelled of bacon sausage eggs and cinnamon rolls cabrillo was sitting at a table talking with julia huxley as hanley walked toward them with a cup of steaming coffee in his hand he smiled and nodded now that he said to cabrillo was exciting never a dull moment around here cabrillo agreed how are reinholt and jones hanley asked huxley minor injuries huxley reported jonesy has a couple of cracked ribsi gave him pain medication and hes sleeping in sick bay reinholt claims hes better but i have him resting in his cabin just to be sure did you check on repairs to the r cabrillo asked yes mr chairman hanley said as an attendant walked over and set a plate containing a cinnamon roll in front of him a buckle that controls movement to the rotor head was bent they are replacing it now and estimate it will be ready to fly in a couple of hours good cabrillo said once the oregon steams closer to the mainland ill need adams to drop me off at the airport just like we planned hanley agreed now all we need to do is find the secret compartment inside the golden buddha cabrillo said and see if its contents are still intact sung rhee caught sight through the window of the four men approaching his office they did not look happy and the aide did not bother to knock before swinging the door open rhee rose from his desk as the aide stood aside and allowed the admiral to enter we managed to get air bags under the hydrofoil to keep her afloat until a salvage ship can tow her back the admiral said without preamble but my men tell me repairs will require close to six months sir rhee started to say enough the admiral thundered i have one ship out of commission and our only frigate and fastattack corvette disabled and dead in the water you set me upand you will pay sir rhee said quickly we had no ideathe ship to all appearances was merely a decrepit cargo vessel the ship was far from that the admiral said loudly she shot the side out from under the hydrofoil as if it was a routine exercise we still dont know what happened to the other two ships just outside the door the admirals aide was whispering into a satellite telephone he poked his head into rhees office admiral he said quietly beijings on the line chuck tiny gunderson smiled at rhonda rosselli and held out one of the bearer bonds so he said heres the deal tracy judy and i need to make an unscheduled midair exit once we are safely out you can untie the pilots youre abandoning me rosselli asked pointedly all that talk about me joining your team was a lie gunderson pulled a thick cigar from his flightsuit pocket and slid it under his nose then he bit off the end and lit it with a solid gold lighter he puffed the stogie to life i never lie to a pretty girl he said smiling and im always right then whats the deal gunderson slipped the bearer bond into a plastic envelope and sealed it inside with the others the bond i showed you will be mailed to your home address once i reach land thats your payment for a job well executed what do i say when we land rosselli asked id tell them everything gunderson said except about the bond that should remain our little secret just tell them rosselli said incredulously why not gunderson said i was careful not to relay any information that can incriminate my group my team will make sure that the united states embassy is notified in whatever country the plane lands just spill your guts and theyll let you go in a few days once you get back to california someone that works with me will make contact in due time so i wont see you again she asked you never know gunderson said as redhaired tracy pilston walked over our ride is only a few miles ahead pilston noted and were both ready to fly the coop did you take her down gunderson asked pilston nodded were to receive a signal so we can time the jump gunderson removed two parachutes from a storage compartment where a corporation team member had hidden them when the was in her hangar in california he helped strap one on pilstons back then strapped on the other removing a sack containing goggles he handed one over to pilston well alert judy he said quietly and exit from the rear go forward gunderson said to rosselli tell judy its time then stay in the cockpit wont everything be sucked out the rear rosselli asked were not pressurized gunderson said so it wont be that badi wouldnt try walking around however just stay in the cockpit and after the egg timer goes off raise the rear door and untie the pilots okay rosselli said as she went forward opened the cockpit door and reported the news to michaels understood judy michaels said then she checked the speed once more made sure the autopilot was operating then pushed the lever to lower the rear door the door began to lower slowly and the alarms on the dashboard began to beep twisting a cheap plastic egg timer michaels slid past rosselli keep the door closed and when that timer chimes you know what to do rosselli nodded nice meeting you michaels said as she slipped out the door racing down the aisle michaels stopped for gunderson to check her parachute the farther the rear door lowered the more wind raced through the fuselage of the magazines rustled and any loose items inside fluttered in the wind gunderson watched as a silk kimono filled like a sail and shot out the rear then the trio made their way to the rear where the steps were now pointing straight below the tail of the what do you think theyll do to rhonda pilston asked not much they can do gunderson said as he adjusted his goggles and helped michaels into position to jump i think shes sweet on you pilston said as she moved into place next to michaels theres something about gunderson said an aqua velva man at that instant the signal was received from the satellite to his alphanumeric pager the pager began to vibrate gunderson took one lady under each arm then he ran off the end of the ramp and once he was clear pushed them away plodding through the south china sea the helmsman on the kalia challenger noticed the sky was finally clearing he noticed it because the sky overhead was suddenly filled with a pair of chinese antisubmarine aircraft as well as a single longrange heavylift helicopter the kalia challenger had originally been built in for the united states line as one of an elevenship class of express cargo cruisers later sold to a greek shipping concern she plied the seas on a regular schedule from asia to the west coast of the united states at just over five hundred feet with a seventyfoot beam the vessel featured derricks on the upper deck for loading and unloading of cargo her lower hull was a rusty red with a black band along the gunwales she was a work ship who had served a long and useful life and the wear and tear showed still functional though dated she was possessed of one major flaw from a distance to an untrained eye she resembled the oregon she was far out in international waters when the antisubmarine aircraft dropped the first depth charge it landed a hundred yards ahead of the bow and exploded with a cascade of water that reached eighty feet into the air heave to the captain shouted the alert reached the engine room and the kalia challenger slowed then stopped in the water it would be nearly an hour before a chinese boarding party climbed across her decks the illegal stop was never explained delbert chiglack stared up at the sky in amazement he had seen some incredible things in the fourteen years he had worked on offshore oil rigs strange sea creatures that defied explanation unidentified flying objects weird weather phenomena but in all the years he had drilled offshore he had yet to see a trio of parachutists come from nowhere and attempt to land on his rig gunderson michaels and pilston had leapt from the at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet just above a cloud layer that hid the airplane from view sucking on oxygen bottles as they made their descent they had floated around near the target before directing their parachutes in arcing corkscrews until they lined up above the helicopter pad on the offshore rig the rig was twenty miles off the coast of vietnam eight hundred miles from macau and owned by zapata petroleum of houston texas george herbert walker bush owned the companyand someone from virginia had asked him for a favor tracy pilston landed nearly dead center on the x in the center of the pad judy michaels only six feet away it was chuck gunderson who had the worst landing he alit on the side of the elevated pad the breeze tugged at his parachute before he could cut it away and had del chiglack not grabbed him he might have gone over the side once his chute was free and chiglack had yanked him back from the edge gunderson smiled and spoke my friends called he said i believe we have a reservation for three chiglack spit some snuff juice into the wind welcome aboard he said your ride will be here soon thanks gunderson said now chiglack said if you and the ladies will come inside ill buy you a cup of coffee back in the control room hanley turned to cabrillo we just received word from tiny he said they arrived safe and sound with the bonds theyre awaiting a ride home cabrillo nodded you look beat hanley said why dont you catch a few hours sleep and let me hold down the fort cabrillo was too tired to argue he rose and started for the door wake me if you need me dont i always hanley said once cabrillo was walking down the hall to his stateroom hanley turned to stone truitt will be here in a few minutes to relieve you take four hours and get some sleep yes sir stone said then hanley accessed the computer next to his seat and began to read the plan again langston overholt slept all the way to paris the challenger jet he was riding inside was registered to a company named strontium holding plc which was allegedly based in basel switzerland in reality the jets tires had never touched swiss soil the challenger cl had been purchased from a broker in london using cia funds and outfitted with advanced electronics at a shop in alexandria virginia near bolling air force base the large canadianmade business jet seated ten people had a cruise speed of miles per hour and a range of miles the distance from virginia to paris was just over miles where the jet was refueled and provisions were loaded aboard the second leg of the trip paris to new delhi would cover miles the first leg of the journey required eight hours to complete the second leg was made with a favorable tailwind and took just over seven hours within an hour of receiving word from cabrillo at am macau time that the corporation was in possession of the golden buddha overholt had left us soil virginia time had been pm good friday by the time the challenger touched down the time changes and flight time made it am saturday the trip by turboprop to little lhasa in northern india took just over two more hours so it was almost exactly noon on saturday when overholt finally met with the dalai lama again the revered leader of tibet had made it clear that if there was to be a coup detat it needed to take place on easter sunday march exactly fortysix years after his being forced into exile that gave overholt and the corporation twentyfour hours to make a miracle happen carl gannon had been earning his keep the last several days after procuring the truck in thimbu bhutan and plotting a route into tibet he had received a shopping list of tasks from the control room on the oregon as the corporations head scrounger gannon was used to accomplishing the impossible to obtain what was required gannon would have to use the vast network of contacts he had carefully nurtured over the years the funding would come from the corporations bank on the island of vanuatu in the south pacific ocean and the oregon had made it clear that time not cost was the object gannon loved it when he received directives like this using a laptop computer linked to a cell phone he began typing in a stack of telephone numbers codes and passwords from memory at seventy words a minute eighty stinger missiles were bought from a friendly middle eastern nation with delivery arranged to bhutan using a south african company that had never failed to comply eight bell helicopters with extra fuel pods from an indonesian company that specialized in offshore oil work arrived to deliver the load of missiles and small arms eighteen mercenary pilots from throughout the far east were recruited sixteen to fly two extras in case someone got sick fuel pods food for all the participants and a series of hangars manned by philippine special forces guards were secretly arranged gannons last item was the strangest the oregon wanted to know if he could procure a large but slowmoving plane in vietnam that and a winch with a hundred feet of thin but strong steel cable that could be mounted on the floor of the plane it took gannon a couple of telephone calls but he found a russianbuilt antonov an colt owned by a laotian company that had a logging contract with the vietnamese government the big biplane with a wingspan of fiftyeight feet a cruise speed of only miles an hour and a stall speed of could best be described as a flying pickup truck the large interior was mainly cargo space and she could carry nearly five thousand pounds of payload the winch he bought new from a dealer in ho chi minh city on a company credit card after finishing the arrangements for the plane and winch gannon slurped the last drop from a bottle of cocacola and dialed the oregon on the satellite telephone he waited as the number beeped and popped while the signal was scrambled go ahead carl hanley said a minute later ive got the plane max he said but you didnt ask for a pilot one of our guys will be flying hanley said its a russian antonov gannon noted i doubt we have someone typed in this model well download some manuals off the internet hanley said thats about all we can do shes fueled and waiting at the airport in old saigon gannon said the mechanic should be finished bolting the winch in place in the next hour im faxing a picture well be seeing you soon hanley said everything okay in the meantime smooth as a babys bottom gannon said easily on the zapata petroleum rig off vietnam delbert chiglack took the sheet that had just printed out of the fax machine then called once more to the incoming helicopter when finished he returned to the lunchroom on the rig and handed the sheet to gunderson this just came for you thanks gunderson said quickly staring at the picture of the biplane the oregon had sent then folding it and placing it in his flightsuit pocket just then a siren on the rig sounded twice your rides here chiglack said walking the trio out to just below the helicopter pad chiglack waited until the helicopter touched down then shouted over the noise up the ladder heads down the door should be open he said thanks for the hospitality michaels shouted watch your hair ladies chiglack called as they started up the stairs four minutes later the helicopter was airborne again heading back toward land chiglack shook his head as the helicopter retreated in the distance then he walked back to his office to report his guests had left the rig gunderson handed the photo of the biplane to the copilot shes on the north side of the airport he said as the copilot clipped the photo to a strap around his knee if you can land nearby wed sure appreciate it the copilot replaced his headset over his ears then relayed the information to the pilot who made an okay sign with his fingers the copilot smiled at gunderson nodded yes then motioned for him to sit back in his seat twenty minutes later the coast of southern vietnam came into view as they passed over shallow water he caught sight of a wrecked ship below the surface of the water in the bushes nearby was what looked like the remains of a bombedout tank from the war some thirty years before pilston tapped on gundersons arm as the helicopter approached the airport and located the antonov from the air slowing his speed the pilot neared the large biplane then hovered in the air above the tarmac after touching down smoothly some fifty feet away the copilot unbuckled his belt then slipped back and unlatched the door to the bell later alligators he shouted gunderson pilston and michaels bowed their heads and sprinted away from the helicopter once they were clear the pilot throttled up pulled up on the collective and moved the cyclic so the bell rose in the air and made a sweeping turn the helicopter disappeared into the haze as it flew off to the south the trio was ten feet from the biplane when michaels spoke what are we going to do with this beast she asked the plan is gunderson said as he approached the open door and stared inside to fly out to the oregon what on earth for pilston asked our chairman has a meeting to attend inside the oregons magic shop kevin nixon was loosening the top off a long wooden crate with a pry bar the crate was stamped us air force special operations the second line read ea fulton aerial recovery system checked and then the initials of the airman who had rendered the verdict that the system was operational setting the top aside nixon peered inside then he began to remove the contents first was a harness made out of nylon webbing similar to that on a parachute on the front of the harness was a swivel hook next was a length of hightension strength line last a deflated balloon and the fittings to hook the system together nixon checked each piece carefully as he removed them from the box everything looked fine just then the door to the magic shop opened hows it look hanley inquired good nixon answered hanley pointed to a strange forgedmetal threepronged hook on the ground whats that nixon nodded at the bottom of the crates lid where a set of directions had been stenciled on the surface thats the hook that grabs the line at the end of the balloon doesnt it have to be aboard the pickup plane ideally nixon admitted so hanley asked nixon pointed across the room good thing we have rules around here he said always have a backup hanley said smiling reading the sign but of course nixon said ill notify the plane hanley said we have a few hours yet mr hanley nixon said you just tell me when the single engine on the antonov colt droned with a monotonous sound as gunderson michaels and pilston headed out into the south china sea the skies were clear the wall of the southmoving storm still hundreds of miles ahead gunderson just hoped that the oregon which was cruising at full speed made it out of the leading edge of the storm before he reached the ship he was a great pilot but even in clear skies what they were about to attempt was akin to trying to hit a bulls eye on a dartboard at ten paces while blindfolded gunderson had the windows in the cockpit and the cargo area cracked open to vent the gasoline fumes as they cruised along the antonov normally carried gallons of fuel but since this plane was used for remote logging operations two more tanks of gallons each had been fitted along the center of the cargo bay that was a good thing without the additional fuel capacity there was no way they could make it out to the oregon and back to vietnam a distance far beyond that of a helicopter the problem was the inside of the plane smelled like an exxon station after a big spill gunderson stared at his portable gps receiver hows it look tiny michaels asked so far so good gunderson answered but this unit burns through batteries like a kid with a video game did they by chance load any spare batteries on board pilston who was crouched between the pilots and copilots seat rooted around in a pair of paper bags but came up empty sorry chuck she said no luck what did we get he asked pilston did a quick inventory some mres two thermoses of what i assume is coffee some hershey bars and mms bottled water maps and some mouthwash what about towels and soap pilston dug around in the bottom of one of the bags yep gannons pretty good about that gunderson said yawning michaels stared at the speed indicator we have five more hours until we reach the oregon she said tracy and i got some sleep last night why dont you clean up a little and try to get some rest well wake you when we get close think you can fill the copilots duties he asked pilston i received my private pilots certificate last year pilston told him i dont have many hours but i think im qualified to watch the needles quiver gunderson nodded wearily off the controls he said as soon as he was sure michaels had the plane he stood up slid out of his seat and slid past pilston who quickly climbed into the pilots station the antonov could be flown from either the left or right seat so there was no reason for michaels to move across the cockpit once pilston was situated she turned around to gunderson theres a cot that folds out of the wall she said and a toilet that basically dumps out the side of the plane you want anything to eat first no ladies gunderson said just wake me if you need me then he walked back to the cot removed his shirt and crumpled it up as a pillow stretched out and was asleep within minutes the antonov droned north for the rendezvous over the years of its existence the corporation had invested in a variety of legitimate businesses the company was either owner or part owner of mining concerns a coconut plantation a specialty firearms manufacturer hotels resorts a machine tool company even a charter jet service with divisions in north america south america europe and asia none of the employees of these concerns had any idea of the source of the parent companys funding and true purpose they only knew they were highly paid and treated well and never subject to cutbacks or layoffs for the most part the actual operations end of the corporationthe specialized army and intelligence apparatus that formed the nucleus of the growing fortuneleft these companies alone to operate on their own sometimes however they came in handy right now was just such a time max hanley returned to the oregons control room and slid into his chair pull up the flight operations center of pegasus air he asked stone stone punched commands into the computer and a few seconds later a worldwide map filled one of the large monitors whats the fastest way to fly the chairman to his meeting stone punched in commands and the route filled the screen its a long flight he said and i assume you want it nonstop absolutely hanley said that pretty much ensures that well need to use the g then where are they now hanley asked stone punched in commands and flight records overlaid the map the asian g is in route to hawaii so thats out stone noted paris on oneno hold onthe south american g just landed in dubai shes due to leave again tomorrow how long for her to reach da nang its thirtysix hundred miles so roughly six and a half hours hanley took a pad of paper and a pencil and began writing numbers itll be tight he said finally were bucking time zones refueling and getting fast clearances to land but its doable want me to book the jet stone asked hanley handed him a sheet of paper this is the flight plan what else make sure our man in the vietnamese air force is greased so we dont have any problems getting in and out of da nang for a quick refuel hanley said what else set up a secure link to karamozov hanley said i need to confirm anything else stone said as he made notes on a pad when all thats done hanley said call truitt to relieve you and go get some sleep what about you sir stone asked ill catnap here hanley said right where i like to be the dalai lama was praying in front of a statue of buddha when overholt walked into the room he stood quietly until he rose i sensed you come into the room the dalai lama said and you seem happy overholt asked are you ready to return yes the dalai lama said very much so good overholt said it will be tomorrow did your people recover the golden buddha they did overholt said nodding and have they found the compartment yet theyre still working on it your holiness the dalai lama nodded and smiled theyll figure it out and then theyll know what to do with what they find he paused hard to believe the dalai lama said that something my people have owned all along shall be our salvation were not home free yet your holiness overholt said the dalai lama smiled and considered this for a few moments no mr overholt were notbut we will be greed is what brought the chinese to my country and greed again will set us free overholt nodded silently life is a circle the dalai lama said and someday you will see that overholt smiled as the dalai lama began to walk toward the door now he said kindly let my people feed you you must be hungry from your long journey the two men walked out of the room toward a destiny determined by an obscure ship manned by mercenaries at am local time the oregon exited the fog bank in front of the advancing storm the weather was perfect a calm before the storm the sky was azure blue and the seas were as flat and reflective as a mirror in the hours since leaving macau the oregon had made good time the ship was off hainan island in international waters at the current rate of speed the vessel would pass along singapore tomorrow at noon local time after turning and traveling through the strait of malacca and heading north she was due to arrive high in the bay of bengal off bangladesh sometime around pm sunday by then if all went according to plan the dalai lama would be in power again and the corporation would make its exit with no one ever the wiser juan cabrillo woke in his stateroom then showered and dressed leaving his suite he walked along the gangways toward the control room then stopped and opened the door max hanley was asleep in his chair but he sat upright as soon as cabrillo entered hanley rose and walked over to the coffeepot and poured two cups handing one to cabrillo he asked feel better amazing what a little rest will do cabrillo said taking the cup richard hanley asked truitt turned from the screen he was studying im okay he said whats the score cabrillo asked without further preamble hanley walked back to his chair and motioned for cabrillo to sit then he pointed at a screen that showed a red line from ho chi minh city directly toward the oregon that line is gunderson and his team they will be arriving in about a half hour to pick you up they aboard the amphibian nope hanley said it was still too far south to get here in time so we secured another seaplane cabrillo asked gannon pulled out all the stops hanley told him but there were none available cabrillo sipped his coffee while truitt swiveled his head and stared back at him youre yanking me off cabrillo said sorry mr chairman hanley said it was the only way you could make your flight out of vietnam on time and the buddha hell go first hanley noted why cabrillo said do i always end up in these situations the money truitt said smiling or the thrill of victory said hanley on board the antonov gunderson was brushing his teeth and washing his face spitting out the window he rubbed the washcloth across the stubble on his cheeks once he had finished he walked forward and motioned to pilston why dont you let me take over pilston slid out of the pilots seat and gunderson climbed aboard howd our rookie do he asked michaels shes not a bad pilot michaels noted i had her do most of the flying while i napped gunderson smiled and turned back to stare at pilston be sure and log the hours he told her when you have two hundred you can apply for a commercial license our last operative who certified got a fivethousanddollar bonus from cabrillo this old beast is a smooth flying plane pilston said slow as a slug but as stable as a table how far out are we gunderson asked michaels michaels stared at the gps and examined her marks in the charts then did a couple of calculations in the flight computer twentyfour minutes give or take have you maintained radio silence as we planned michaels replied gunderson adjusted the mixture to the engine and watched the gauges a few seconds satisfied all was okay he spoke again tracy can you pour me a cup of coffee its time to call the mother ship pilston unscrewed the cup off the thermos put a piece of folded duct tape on the bottom then poured a cup and handed it to gunderson he sipped the hot liquid then set the cup down on a flat surface where it stuck then he reached for the radio adjusted the frequency and spoke tiny calling the chairman of the board you out there a few seconds passed before an answer came this is control go ahead the ladies and i tiny said will be there in a few minutes to hook you on board we have you on the scope cabrillo said you should be seeing us shortly whats the drill gunderson asked youll have two yanks cabrillo said the first is the objectremember its heavy we have a cargo slide with a belt but the door to this old bird is on the side gunderson said my plan was to winch whatever we were taking aboard close then do some fancy flying to get the load aboard back on the oregon cabrillo shook his head in amazement dont try that on the second load whys that boss because the second load is me michaels was staring out the window a speck that was the oregon came into view i have a visual she said we have you in sight gunderson said and well take it easy bringing you aboard mr chairman dont you worry im going topside to strap up cabrillo said is there anything else you need gunderson looked at pilston and michaels who shook their heads no maybe just some hamandcheese sandwiches gunderson said ill see what i can do cabrillo said were descending now gunderson said see you in a few cabrillo opened the door and walked into the magic shop nixon had the golden buddha on a small table and was waving a small electronic radar device across the belly he stared at a monitor and shook his head theres a space there boss nixon said to cabrillo but ill be damned if i can figure out the access cabrillo stood thinking for a moment then turned to nixon hand me a heat gun he said nixon walked over to the tool bench and removed a heat gun from a peg attached an extension cord then dragged it over to the golden buddha cabrillo flicked the switch on and started to heat the buddhas belly what are you thinking boss nixon asked over the roar of the heat gun people always want to rub buddhas belly for good luck cabrillo said rub something enough and you make heat nixon reached over and touched the golden belly it was becoming warm like human skin cabrillo stared at the icon then turned to nixon get me a singleedge razor blade he said nixon walked to the workbench found a box of razor blades grabbed them then walked back peeling the paper off one of the blades there cabrillo said theres a crack forming nixon slid the blade into the tiny gap slide in another cabrillo said and begin to wedge off the belly plate minutes passed as the gap widened as it did cabrillo diverted the heat under the plate which heated the glue applied centuries before at last the crack was large enough that a hand could fit inside cabrillo handed nixon the heat gun slid his fingers inside the crack then gently pried back the plate while nixon continued heating the yakshoof glue slowly the plate peeled back then all at once it came off in cabrillos hand he stared through the opening into an inner compartment inside lay ancient parchments rolled into a tube and secured with a decomposing strip of rawhide cabrillo reached in and carefully removed the bundle nixon looked at cabrillo and smiled what now boss we copy them cabrillo said quietly and put them back sung rhee was in the center of a maelstrom of angry people the admiral from the chinese navy had called beijing to report the damage to his ships the two billion aires had both returned with teams of attorneys and his assistant had just called to report that the mayor of macau was downstairs and on his way up and then his telephone rang i told you he told his receptionist no interruptions president hu jintaos office is calling put him through rhee said motioning with his hand to clear his office put him through a few seconds later a voice said president jintao is on the line good morning mr president rhee said good morning mr rhee jintao said quietly i understand you had a bit of trouble last night rhee began to sweat aa minor theft he stammered nothing we cant handle mr president mr rhee weve received calls this morning from the united states embassy the head of the chinese navy and the vice president of greece wanting to know why one of his ships was illegally stopped and boarded on your orders that does not sound like a minor theft to me therehas been some trouble here rhee admitted the telephone was silent for a few seconds mr rhee jintao said coldly i want you to tell me everything that happened right now from the start slowly rhee began speaking gunderson started a long lumbering turn around the oregon as he stared out the cockpit window he could see a large balloon do a fast inflate then head up in the air towing a line on the stern deck of the oregon kevin nixon checked the straps around the crate containing the golden buddha again the threepronged hook was ducttaped to the crate and would be used to yank cabrillo aboard if they were successful getting the icon aboard the antonov hanley stood off to the side checking the fit on the harness that wrapped around cabrillos chest and upper thighs satisfied it was properly attached he snapped a smaller bag containing the sandwiches to one side of the harness the old fulton recovery system cabrillo said youd think with all our funds wed have found a replacement by now its so rare were this far offshore hanley said past the point our amphibian or a helicopter can reach us you ever ridden one of these cabrillo asked never had the pleasure hanley said smiling it feels like a mule kicked you in the ass cabrillo said thats the least of your worries the way i see it how do you figure cabrillo asked the only winch we could find was designed for light trucks hanley noted i just hope they can reel you in fast enough before you strike the rear stabilizer you make it all sound so appealing cabrillo said wryly the sound of the antonov was growing louder clear the decks nixon shouted for the first approach gunderson was noted for never becoming flustered no matter what the situation he always maintained his cool lowering the flaps on the antonov he slowed the speed to just above stall then lined up less than a hundred feet above the deck anybody got any gum he asked michaels quickly peeled the foil off a piece and jammed it in his mouth head back to help tracy gunderson said ill hook the fatso on the first pass then ill shout back before i roll her over inside the oregon the cameras on the deck relayed an image of the operation throughout the ship everyone watched as gunderson steered closer in the cargo compartment pilston and michaels were watching out the open door the steel cable stretched backward but the hook on the end was out of view gunderson was peering out the front window then the side window in a rapid ballet of visual olympics at the top of the cable leading to the fulton aerial recovery system just below the balloon the cable spread into a y shape gunderson chomped on the gum as he steered the antonov closer its show time he shouted the hook dangling back from the plane slid cleanly into the y and snagged the cable a split second later the crate containing the golden buddha was yanked from the deck as cleanly as ripping a bandage off a wound gunderson instantly felt the drag on the plane and shouted for pilston to engage the winch she threw the lever forward and the package started to reel aboard while at the same time gunderson eased the biplane over on her side hanley watched from the deck in amazement tell me when the loads within ten feet gunderson shouted a minute or so later michaels shouted okay chuck gunderson did a quick sideways dive to the ocean now only some eighty feet away and the crate went temporarily weightless from the g forces the crate floated in the air for a second rolling flat gunderson shouted pilston and michaels moved away from the door and the cable tightened and reeled the golden buddha aboard as easily as a book sliding into a bookcase the crate slammed against the far inner wall of the fuselage and stopped the crate was cracked but not much pilston turned the winch motor off gunderson stared back quite happy with the results he reached for the radio mr hanley he said i scratched your box a little but the cargo is safe and sound hanley pushed the button on his portable radio as gunderson began to climb and bank around hell of a job tiny theres a different hook attached to the box attach that to the cable before you pull the chairman aboard roger that gunderson said then he shouted back to michaels to attach the other hook to the end of the line by the time gunderson had passed over the top of the oregon again and was starting his turn to line up the hook was attached and pilston started to reel out the cable once again gunderson adjusted his flight controls they set the speed of the antonov to right at stall once i hook the boss man gunderson shouted you reel him in as fast as possible when hes next to the door reach out and pull him inside got it pilston shouted here i come boss gunderson said into the radio ready or not cabrillo had moved onto the rear deck and nixon inflated the balloon it shot in the air when the antonov was only a hundred yards off the bow clear the decks nixon shouted as he sprinted away juan cabrillo stood quietly there was really no way to prepare for what was about to happen in a few seconds he would be yanked from the safety of the oregon and into the air over the ocean from the known to the unknown in a split second so cabrillo simply cleared his mind and waited gunderson chewed his gum watched the line carefully and then put the threepronged hook directly into the center of the y once again bam one second cabrillos feet were on the deck the next second he was yanked into the air he moved his feet back and forth like he was trying to run the wind crept past the goggles he was wearing and his eyes began to weep as the antonov grew larger cabrillo could see hands reaching out of the door as he rose closer to safety he tilted his head back and looked every few seconds the cable was bumping against the rear stabilizer and he prepared to push himself off as he grew closer hes going to hit the tail pilston shouted to gunderson cabrillo put his feet in the air to push against the stabilizer he was only a few feet away when gunderson pulled back on the controls and pitched the nose of the antonov up cabrillo hanging from the cable like a pendulum dropped a few feet and slid past the tail a few seconds later he was next to the door michaels and pilston grabbed his arms and pulled him inside gunderson started the antonov climbing then glanced back into the cargo area hey boss he yelled how was the ride michael halpert flicked on the computer in the oregons library working the party in macau had been excitingthe element of danger involved in operations ensured that even so halperts forte was the arcane accounting and banking network he had constructed for the corporations activities in that halpert was a master the twisted matrix of corporate law and structure was exciting to himhe loved to hide the corporations assets like a penny under a glacier and shield its ownership in companies through complex structures that would take teams of accountants years to unravel today he would need to use all his skills halpert was building what he liked to call a skeleton a skeleton was a series of corporations forming the bones to support the skull that held the nerve center of an operation each would need to be structured funded and interlinked until the actual source of ownership and control was as cloudy as a london morning he scanned a database of available existing companies first would come the skull itselfthe eventual owner of the assets that would soon be created for that he chose a corporation based in the tiny country of andorra the company cataluna esteme had been founded in with the purpose of mining and trading lead andorra all square miles of territory is perched in the pyrenees mountains with spain to the south and france to the north the population of andorra is some sixtyfive thousand people and the primary industry is tourism with an emphasis on snow skiing the country had been in existence since and was modern and progressive plus halpert had never used it before cataluna esteme itself had been active in the lead business until when the aging owner had been felled by heart trouble while on a visit to paris over the next year or so the assets of the corporation had been distributed to the owners heirs and the company itself had gone dormant cataluna esteme existed in the desk drawer of a lawyer in andorras capital city of andorra la vella halpert scanned the history and found it ideal the company had perfect credit a past history of large sums passing through the corporation coffers as well as the shield of privacy offered by andorran law the remaining stock in the company was available for the equivalent of this sum would give them complete control of a corporation that had existed for over thirty years had a charter similar to the intended use and was completely untraceable halpert decided to buy cataluna esteme for the feet of the skeleton he used two companies the corporation already owned the first was gizo properties based in the solomon islands in the south pacific the second was paisen industries based in san marino a country on the adriatic coast completely surrounded by italy accessing the companies accounts over the computer halpert deposited in gizo properties and in paisen industries in the blink of an eye halpert had moved million into already existing accounts the money would not remain there long next gizo properties and paisen industries through a special shareholders resolution that halpert drafted and passed each agreed to buy stock in two more companies the first was alcato based in lisbon the second tellemedics of asunción paraguay both of these companies were operating concernsalcato built specialized marine electronics tellemedics made telemetry equipment used in hospitals throughout south america the portuguese company had a book value of million us the paraguayan nearly million both had been secretly owned by the corporation for nearly a decade halpert pulled up the corporate records of both and found sufficient cash reserves for his plan with the legs now in place he looked for the torso he would need a recognizable and stable platform that would appeal to the corporations soontobe partners for this he could only use central europe halpert needed a company based in a country with rocksolid political stability ironclad currency and worldwide recognition of financial wherewithal he scanned his database and found he had three companies to choose fromthe first was based in basel switzerland the second in luxembourg the third which he favored in vaduz liechtenstein liechtenstein it was albertinian investments sa was a currencyandgoldtrading concern that had proved widely successful since the recent upward move in precious metals prices the company secretly controlled by the corporation owned a beautiful sixstory building in vaduz where it occupied the top two stories had a cash balance in accounts amounting to over million us and frequently invested in other companies that showed promise next alcato and tellemedics passed corporate resolutions making loans of million each to albertinian investments these were composed of the monies transferred from gizo properties and paisen industries plus some cash from the coffers of each albertinian investments agreed to pay each company percent interest for the loans as well as an option to convert the loans to stock at a set price for the next five years the trail of money was becoming cloudier by the minute there was now an extra million of washed and clean funds in albertinian investments halpert sipped from a glass of iced tea then he entered the commands into the computer and albertinian investments offered to buy cataluna esteme for the asking price the transaction would take several hours for the attorney in andorra to complete next halpert scanned a base of lawyers the corporation had used in the past in spain finding one in madrid he dialed the telephone and waited carlos the second please he said in spanish when the receptionist answered mr halpert calling exactly fortytwo seconds later the lawyer came on the line sorry for the wait mr halpert the lawyer said what can i do for you i need you to fly to andorra immediately halpert said we are buying another company standard protocol the lawyer asked open bank accounts rent offices and such thats the idea halpert said and we need it done yesterday ill need to charter a plane then the lawyer said i doubt there are commercial flights available at this late hour we will approve the costs halpert said how big are you looking sir the initial funding will be ten million halpert said five will be a direct loan from one of our divisions in liechtenstein the second five will be in the form of a line of credit available immediately i understand sir the lawyer said ill leave right away one more thing halpert said find us a public relations firm in andorrai have a feeling what we are planning will garner some press interest anything else if there is halpert said ill contact you when you reach andorra very good the lawyer said as he hung up the telephone then the lawyer sat back in his chair and smiled he knew his rather excessive fees would be paid in cashwhich he would fail to report to the tax authorities reaching for the telephone he called a local company to charter a propjet for the trip north like being kicked by a mule cabrillo said over the noise of the droning engine pilston was closing the side door of the antonov she wrestled it in place and held it closed while michaels locked it down cabrillo placed his hand on the golden buddha to stabilize himself and then removed the package of papers and the satchel of food he placed them on the floor then unsnapped the harness and set it aside he stared around the cargo bay of the antonov before walking forward to the cockpit hows she fly tiny he asked as he slid into the copilots seat shes as slow and steady as a diesel trawler gunderson answered did you get any sleep yep gunderson said tracy needed to rack up some flight time so she and judy flew us here from vietnam cabrillo nodded and turned his head back to the cargo area howd it go with mr silicon valley he asked we made it through michaels said i want to apologize to both of you cabrillo said quietly if there was any other way we know sir pilston said it was just a joband we treated it as such still cabrillo said it was above and beyond what we should ask of you i approved a special bonus for you both and hanley has scheduled you for a month off with pay as soon as we finish this mission thank you sir michaels said and this helped soften the blow somewhat she held up the stack of bearer bonds i trust gunderson said you mean that figuratively and not literally the us ambassador to russia sipped from a small glass of vodka then smiled at president putin the men were seated in front of a roaring fire inside the presidential offices in moscow outside a spring storm was finally exhausting itself after dumping nearly a foot of wet snow on the capital city soon the first flowers would pop their heads from the soil then it would all turn green how much are we talking about putin asked billions the ambassador said and the structure as you know the ambassador said taking another sip this is not a united states government operation for all intents and purposes you will be making the agreements with a separate company that we subcontract with but they work for you putin asked not on paper the ambassador said but we have used them in the past give me some details putin said as he rose to stoke the fire with a poker id like to know with whom im getting into bed they call themselves the corporation the ambassador noted quietly they handle things of a sensitive nature for us and other countries the company has specialized skills huge amounts of funding and an unparalleled reputation for integrity they can be trusted putin asked you may consider their word their bond the ambassador confirmed who runs this corporation putin asked a man named juan cabrillo the ambassador answered and when do i meet this juan cabrillo putin said turning from the fire placing the poker back in the rack and sliding into the armchair he will be in moscow late this evening the ambassador said good putin said i welcome the chance to hear him out the ambassador finished the small glass of vodka and waved away putins attempt to refill it now he said how much hassle are you getting from the chinese enough the russian president admitted but not more than we can handle if you need to the ambassador asked are you ready to go in putin pointed to a folder of papers on the table there is the plan in less than twentyfour hours we can cross the tarim basin in a lightningfast raid and reach the border of tibet lets hope it doesnt come to that the ambassador said if i have to order that approach putin said i want your president on paper supporting that move there is no other way we dont think youll need to do that the ambassador said it wont go that far just know putin said if we stand uphe does too ill let him know the ambassador said they appeared out of nowhere the head of chinese state security said chinese president hu jintao stared at the man with barely concealed contempt five hundred buddhist monks just materialized out of the mist in peoples park in downtown beijing jintao said thats some magic the man sat mute there was nothing to say and they are chanting and calling for tibetan freedom yes sir the man from state security said when was the last time we were faced with a tibetan protest jintao asked in beijing the man said its been over a decadeand then it was tiny and easily dispersed and this one its growing by the minute the man admitted ive got a massive russian war exercise on the border with mongolia tibetan separatists in downtown beijing and im not sure whats going on in macau province this spring is not coming up with freshsmelling flowers do you want me to order troops to disperse the protesters the head of state security asked absolutely not jintao said our world standing still has not been repaired from tiananmen square and that was in we take action against peaceful buddhist monks the repercussions will reverberate for decades then do nothing for now jintao said until we figure out what is happening where are we at on this thing the president of the united states asked off the record sir the director of central intelligence asked i did not sneak you into the white house through the underground tunnel so that i could discuss it tonight on larry king director yes completely off the record its progressing perfectly the dci noted and we are shielded behind an armor of deniability that couldnt be penetrated with an antitank round how soon before you need me to do my thing the president asked tomorrow the dci said if all goes according to plan then the president said rising you make sure it does yes mr president the dci said as the president walked through the door and down the hall to a state dinner that was already in progress theoregon was flying across the water the schedule called for the ship to stop in ho chi minh city once there the operatives that would be needed in tibet would be offloaded and flown in a c northwest to bhutan then the oregon would continue on passing singapore traversing the strait of malacca the vessel would race north into the bay of bengal arriving off bangladesh on easter day that was the closest to tibet that the oregon would ever be no one in the corporation enjoyed it when the oregon and her battery of electronics and firepower were far from the operation the ship was the lifeline to the crew their home away from home their anchor in the stormy sea of intrigue where they operated ross and kasim were doing their best to smooth the difficulty ive tested the satellite uplink kasim said the oregon will have commandandcontrol capability everyone will be reachable either by radio or secure telephone ross glanced up from her computer screen im programming the drones we have two thats less than i would like but theyre just so damn expensive who will fly them kasim asked they will need to be operated from within three hundred miles she noted thimbu or inside tibet itself kasim nodded she scanned a sheet of paper that listed crew qualifications four of us are trained in the operation you me lincoln and jones lincoln would stand out in tibet like a debutante at a tractor pull kasim noted if he operates the drone at least hell be hidden inside a tent if i were you id recommend to hanley he get the job ross nodded her head in agreement hes good she said and the drones are criticalthey will be our only eyes in the sky if lincoln can keep them over station above lhasa airport the control room here can watch the action unfolding what have the chinese got in tibet to shoot them down kasim asked ross glanced at the sheet listing chinese defenses that had been recently smuggled out of tibet by the underground freedom movement some old antiaircraft guns and one tenyearold missile defense battery around gonggar airport near lhasa theres not much she said looks like a couple of cargo planes some helicopters and rifles carried by the troops id make a note to hanley to target the antiaircraft guns for early destruction kasim said then have lincoln fly only one drone at a time thats what i was thinking ross said if he flies high he can scan the entire city plus keep the bird out of sight of riflemen makes sense kasim said what do you find for radio and television transmitters there is one television kasim said and a pair of radios we need quickly to gain control of both so we can keep the tibetan people alerted whats the report say ross said will they rally against the chinese when the time comes we think so kasim said and god help the chinese when they do the dungkar ross said tibetan for blackbirds with red beaks kasim said the fighting arm of the tibetan underground ross glanced at the sheet holding the assembled intelligence when it is time we will feed on the carcasses of the oppressors and the beaks will be red with blood and the day will be black with death brings a chill to my spine kasim said and i thought ross said we had the air conditioning too cold one floor below where ross and kasim were planning mark murphy was in the armory munitions and crates were piled to one side and sam pryor and cliff hornsby were slowly moving them toward the elevator to be taken to an upper storage area where they would be offloaded in da nang on each crate to be used murphy attached a redtaped sticker then the contents were labeled with a felttipped pen he was singing a ditty while he worked im a gonna blow some stuff up tomorrow he said gonna blow me up some stuff pryor wiped his forehead with a handkerchief before bending down to lift another crate to carry to the elevator shoot murph he said you packing enough c you cant have too much murphy said smiling at least in my opinion heck it doesnt spoil and you never know what might come up you got enough here to blow up an egyptian pyramid hornsby said walking into the room after placing his crate in the elevator and enough mines to register shock waves on a seismograph those are for the airport murphy said you dont want the chinese to be able to land troops do you land pryor said you use all these there wont be an airport i have other plans for some of them murphy said ive got the feeling youre looking forward to this hornsby said murphy started singing again as he walked over to crates of stinger missiles and began to attach the red tags letting loose a long whistle he finished with the sound of a blast hornsby and pryor carried crates out the door and headed for the elevator id sure hate to have him mad at me pryor said the antonov was less than a hundred miles from da nang heading due west at its current speed the plane would touch down in about forty minutes or just around pm local time the biplane although slow had performed flawlessly gunderson balanced the yoke with his knees and reached into the air and stretched this babys a peach he said to cabrillo after this mission is completed you can check into buying one for the company if you think well use it enough cabrillo said take the wings off and we could probably fit it into a fortyfoot shipping container gunderson said if we had murphy mount a fire cannon out the door wed have a hell of a gunship for the last hour cabrillo had been checking arrangements with the oregon over his secure telephone the last call from hanley had placed the gulfstream g on final approach to da nang airfield cabrillo was nodding at gundersons comment when his telephone buzzed again the gulfstreams on the ground and refueled hanley told him the pilot is setting the course now i contacted general siphondon in laos and received permission for you to cross through their airspace how is the general cabrillo asked his usual self hanley said dropping hints about a classic car hed like at least hes upfront about his wants cabrillo said and an oldcar fetish i can understand what is it hes after hemi roadrunner convertible hanley said apparently some air america pilot had one shipped over to use during the war the general was only a kid then but it stuck in his mind any around ive got keith lowden in colorado checking out the market hanley said hell get back to us when he knows whats available excellent cabrillo said now what about thailand and myanmar all cleared hanley said so itll be a straight shot to india c shes due to leave bhutan and touch down in da nang just after eight pm do you have the team ready cabrillo asked theyll be ready by the time the oregon reaches port hanley said this is a tight timetable cabrillo said and we only have one shot at this no doovers hanley said quietly no doovers cabrillo agreed in northern india at little lhasa the oracle was deep in a trance the dalai lama sat to one side as the man spun and danced from time to time the oracle would race over to a sheet of rice paper and scribble notes furiously then return to his ritualistic motions a strange animallike sound seeped from his vocal cords and drops of sweat flew through the air at last he collapsed in a heap on the floor and his helpers removed the headpiece and robes the dalai lama picked up a wooden bowl filled with water dampened a sheeps skin then stepped over bent down and began to wash the sweat from the aging man you did well he said in a soothing voice there is much information written on the sheets the oracle allowed the dalai lama to drip some water into his mouth he swished it around and spit it to the side i saw bloodshed and fighting he said quietly much bloodshed let us pray not the dalai lama said but there was a second way the oracle said i think that is what i wrote bring some tea and tsampa the dalai lama ordered an aide who rushed out of the room twelve minutes later the oracle and the dalai lama were sitting around a table in the great room the tibetan tea flavored with salt and butter as well as the tsampa roasted barley flour usually mixed with milk or yogurt had brought the color back to the oracles cheeks where only moments before he had seemed aged and weak he now appeared animated and in control your holiness he said eagerly shall we see what i received please the dalai lama said the oracle stared at the sheets of rice paper the letters were in an ancient script only he and a few others could read he read them through twice then smiled at the dalai lama is someone from the west coming to see you the oracle asked yes the dalai lama said later this evening here is what you tell him the oracle said thirty minutes later the dalai lama nodded and smiled at the oracle i will have my aides prepare notes to buttress our argument he said and thank you rising from the chair the oracle walked unsteadily from the room langston overholt was using a borrowed office in a far corner of the compound at little lhasa he was speaking on a secure line to the director of central intelligence in hushed tones i didnt order that he said i simply dont have the apparatus in china to pull it off the estimates from our people on the ground place the number at five hundred and growing the dci noted ill ask the contractor overholt said but it may just be a lucky break whatever the case the dci said reports say the chinese are paying close attention to the protests what about the mongolians overholt asked i had a secret meeting with their ambassador the dci said theyll play it either way what did that cost overholt asked dont ask the dci said but suffice it to say the united states strategic reserves of tungsten and molybdenum wont need replenishing for some time that gives us choices for the contractor to offer to the russians overholt said as soon as he meets with them i need to know what they have decided the dci told him no matter what the time overholt said day or night the dci said before disconnecting gunderson could not believe the lift the pair of wings gave the antonov though he and the others had been flying the plane for nearly eight hours this was the first time he had needed to land lining up to land he floated the antonov down to the runway like a feather fluttering to the floor halfway down the length of the runway gunderson realized hed need to force the plane to the ground moving the yoke forward he felt the wheels finally touch sorry about that boss he said pointing out the window at the gulfstream on the far end of the runway she floats like a butterfly ill taxi us back over to the gulfstream cabrillo nodded and unsnapped the seat belt walking into the cargo area he began to collect his things lifting the stack of bearer bonds he placed them all in his bag then thought better of that he turned his head toward the cockpit do you have to take the plane back south again he asked gunderson no sir gunderson said slowing as he approached the gulfstream gannon worked it outthe company will pick it up here the ladies are boarding the oregon and im flying north on the c as soon as it arrives cabrillo began to count the pile when he finished he spoke again im leaving you a pile he said to everyone give them to hanley when he arrives tell him i took the rest northi may need them to grease some wheels gunderson stopped the antonov then reached for the checklist for postflight okay boss he said as he started through the steps to shut down the engine michaels was unlatching the door while pilston stood off to the side you have some time to kill until the oregon arrives cabrillo said youll have guards from the vietnamese air force but id stay close hanley will make payment to their general when he arrives so you shouldnt have to deal with much will they take us to a bathroom michaels asked im sure they will cabrillo said as he walked for the door but one at a time please and whatever you do dont let anyone know you have that stack of bonds you got it boss gunderson said cabrillo stopped at the door for a second ladies tiny he said smiling ill see you soon then he stepped off the antonov and began walking to the gulfstream the pilot and copilot were standing next to the open door the pilot smiled at cabrillo and motioned for the step were ready for you sir he said welcome aboard theres a box on the biplane cabrillo said get some help and haul it aboard cabrillo walked up the ramp made his way to a seat and then waited while the pilots got the crate loaded inside shut the door and started the engines two minutes later they were airborne the gulfstream was still climbing to cruising altitude when they crossed over the mountains of laos in novosibirsk russia general alexander kernetsikov was staring at a large chalkboard inside a hangar at the airport troops and material continued to pour into the area at a rate of deployment seldom seen in times of peace there were thousands of details to attend to but there was one that bothered kernetsikov the most have we received an answer yet he said to his aide if this is a go i need to know which fork to take at barnaul we either violate kazakhstan and enter china near tacheng or we need to move the troops into mongolia take the road toward altaj and cross over the mountains there then sweep quickly across the plains and pass lop nur the aide stared at the general lop nur was the home of the chinese nuclear test base and he imagined it would be heavily defended the other route featured mountains that were still covered in snow it was like choosing between a root canal and ripping off a toenail theres been no communication general the aide said including whether this is not merely an exercise in fast deployment and war planning its just a feeling the general said quietly but i think that before this is over well be crossing the mountains like hannibal the aide nodded every good officer under whom he had served had a strong sense of history he just hoped the general was wrongfacing off with the chinese even with the firepower they had amassed was not a welcome thought in beijing general tudeng quing was offering president jintao a possible solution if we pull all but two thousand troops out of tibet concentrating those left only in lhasa we could divert the rest to u rümqi in the xinjiang province they could be in place starting tomorrow how many jintao asked say a thousand by plane in the next few hours quing said the tanks and armored carriers have a ninehundredmile journey running them full out at forty miles an hour with refueling and such they could be in place tomorrow this time we dont have any troops closer jintao asked airborne we can bring them in from anywhere quing noted its the armor we needother than tibet the closest armored division we require is almost twice that distance away and the trip is over rougher terrain my aides have calculated three or four days minimum jintao sat back in his chair and stared at the ceiling then he turned to legchog raidi zhuren the chairman of the tibet autonomous region who had so far remained quiet will two thousand troops give you a sufficient level of security until we can replace your armor in four or five days jintao asked mr president zhuren said tibet has been quiet for yearsi dont see that changing any time soon now if i may be excused i should be leaving for my return to tibet jintao turned to general quing order it done next jintao turned to the chinese ambassador to russia you he said loudly figure out what the russians have planned if they are planning to annex mongolia let them know we wont stand for that the mongols conquered us onceim not going to give them a chance to try it again within two hours of the meeting the first chinese transport planes began to land at lhasa airport and began ferrying troops north to xinjiang province in the haste to counter the russian threat the organization of the chinese army in tibet would suffer junior officers would be placed in charge of partially staffed battalions weapons and ammunition would be depleted the mission and purpose would be compromised cabrillo was napping in the rear of the gulfstream when his secure telephone buzzed go ahead he said instantly awake its me overholt said with good news the nsa just called the dci who called me the russian bluff is working transport planes are leaving the airport in lhasa and hauling troops north in addition a column of tanks has just left the city and theyre traveling at breakneck speed everyone said its looking up so far cabrillo glanced at his watch ill be there in about an hour or so are we all set up for the meeting its all taken care of overholt said good cabrillo said if we reach an agreement there ill continue north you really think you can sell everybody on this idea overholt asked this missions like an onion cabrillo said every time i peel back a layer theres a layer underneath thats not the half of it overholt said the dalai lama has a new plan i cant wait cabrillo said i think youre going to like it overholt told him theoregon docked off ho chi minh city the team that would enter tibet was transported by shore boat to land then they were driven in a vietnamese air force truck to the airport where the c sat waiting the total corporation force would number a bakers dozen six menseng murphy reyes king meadows and kasimwould be tasked with the offensive operations they would link up with the dungkar already inside the country and direct them in the proper targets to hit first crabtree and gannon who were already in bhutan awaiting the teams arrival would handle supply and logistics adams and gunderson would fly while lincoln was in charge of setting up and operating the predator drones huxley was tasked with setting up a medical facility to treat anyone wounded or injured the thirteenth member was cabrillo he would arrive after he finished his pair of meetings to the untrained the mission looked like suicide a dozen or so against a force that was close to two thousand odds of one hundred and fiftyplus to one it looked like a bloodbath in the making a trained observer however would be praying for the chinese troops first one had to consider the dungkar the shadowy underground chinese opposition thought to number in the thousands in lhasa when unleashed the dungkar would burn with a fever that only comes when fighting an enemy on home soil second was the element of surprise the chinese were not planning for a concentrated and expertly executed coup detat in the next twentyfour hours the third was the most basic it is almost a certainty that a wellplanned offense will defeat an unplanned defense every single time that was where the corporation excelled already most of the chinese forces inside tibet were heading north in a helterskelter deployment that had left little time for planning and even less for preparation the troops left around lhasa were not the cream of the crop they were the leftoversthe administration clerks mechanics and painters plodders and planners the officers were not combat trained would not be knowledgeable about their individual soldiers strengths and weaknesses and would lack a complete picture of where all the parts fit together right now in tibet the army was a jigsaw puzzle without a design kasim walked from the truck and approached the c radio operator what have you got from inside he asked we have another plane circling out of sight of the chinese deployment capturing their signals and bouncing them here the operator said right now most of the communications pertain to laying fuel dumps on the road north the tanks are outrunning the fuel supply have you heard from the tail kasim asked the operator a chinese american formerly employed by the defense intelligence agency and now attached to the cia proprietary airline supplying the c scanned his notes as of nineteen thirty zulu time the rear of the convoy had passed through naggu theyre making good time kasim noted at this speed they will pass through amdo before eleven pm and then another two hours or so and they will make the border with tsinghai province the operator stared at a classified satellite photograph and compared it with a detailed defense mapping agency map the pass at basatongwula shan will slow them some its riddled with steep mountains and tight turns the altitude is almost sixtyone hundred meters twenty thousand feet kasim said thats high the borders about two hundred fifty miles from lhasa kasim noted and our reports state these are the older type fiftynine tanks that gives them a range of two hundred seventy miles on a tank of diesel or about a hundred more if they have the external fuel tanks mounted the operator nodded ive been watching the progress the type fiftynine on a road can top out around fifty kilometers an hour or thirtyplus miles an hour normally however they cruise at something like twenty miles an hour what are you saying kasim asked the operator smiled and reached for a pack of cigarettes he tapped one from the pack lit it with a zippo lighter then took a drag blowing out the smoke he answered what im saying is that these boys are running at nearly full speed no matter what the cost in fuel usage they will need to stop in amdo and fill the tanks so they can make the pass then theyll have a run downhill that will take them to kekexili for the next stop so when they reach there sometime around breakfast easter day kasim said they will be four hundred miles from lhasa with a twentythousandfoot pass in between them and us sounds about right the operator said thanks for the help kasim said a line of vietnamese air force airmen carried the last of the crates aboard the c hanley stood off to the side talking to the vietnamese general in charge of the arrangements kasim watched as hanley handed the man an envelope then the two shared a laugh hanley shook the generals hand then walked over to the c mr hanley kasim said i have a plan the gulfstream g carrying cabrillo and the golden buddha landed at amritsar india and cabrillo and the icon were flown in a helicopter the rest of the way to little lhasa near dharamsala in the northern himachal pradesh region of northern india the aide quickly ushered him in to his meeting with the dalai lama your holiness cabrillo said as he entered and bowed his head slightly the dalai lama stood silently staring at cabrillo for a full minute then he smiled you are a good man he said at last langston told mebut i needed to be sure for myself thank you sir cabrillo said these are the papers that we recovered from inside the buddha he said handing them to the dalai lamas aide ill need them transcribed before my meeting with the russians copy them and translate them into english the dalai lama ordered his aide mr cabrillo will need to leave again shortly the dalai lama motioned to a long couch where overholt was already seated cabrillo sat on the end and the dalai lama slipped between the two men so explain the plan he said i believe the russians will support your bid to regain your country they will offer the muscle to deter the chinese from making an assault once we gain control of lhasa in return for the rights to develop what you claim those documents represent the vast oil reserves of the himalayas their locations known only to us said the dalai lama in those documents soyour president got them to the border by offering them the aid package the dalai lama said but to fight they need more exactly cabrillo said and you the dalai lama asked your company what were you hired to do we were hired to steal the golden buddha and to pave the way for your return once you are back inside tibet our obligation would by the contract wording end so i would be lefthow do you say ithigh and dry the dalai lama said hard to say cabrillo admitted and this has bothered me and my associates why the dalai lama said are you not mercenaries once your obligation is over dont you just blend into the night cabrillo thought for a minute how to answer this question he paused and thought as the dalai lama waited its a little more complex than that your holiness if we did what we did just for money we would have all retired by now its more involved than that in the past most of us worked for one government agency or another and we were compelled by congress or public opinion to do things we knew or felt were wrong we dont do those things anymore we were formed to make a profit thats for sure but as much as we like the money we are also cognizant of the chances that arise for us to somehow right the wrongs of others you are speaking of karma the dalai lama said something i am most aware of cabrillo nodded we have decided that to leave you alone to fight the chinese would be wrong the solution came to us when we realized the significance of the papers inside the golden buddha and i assume your company will profit from such a deal the dalai lama asked is that bad cabrillo asked not necessarily the dalai lama said but explain more ten minutes later cabrillo was finished im impressed the dalai lama said now let me explain mine another five minutes passed as the dalai lama spoke brilliant cabrillo said when the dalai lama had finished thank you the dalai lama said but to sway the vote will take fundswill you bear the cost we made a little money on a side deal cabrillo said thinking of the million in bearer bonds so the costs are not a problem overholt had remained silent as the two spoke now he interjected if you can pull this off he said eagerly the president will kiss you mr cabrillo the dalai lama said this gives us both an opportunity to keep the bloodshed down while at the same time offering our actions a legitimacy that is indisputable if you can make this happen i will agree to your deal as offered thank you your holiness cabrillo said good luck mr cabrillo the dalai lama said may buddha bless your mission after a short meeting with overholt cabrillo collected the translated pages and maps then climbed back in the helicopter and was flown back to amritsar president putin had been promised the meeting would be worth the effort cabrillo would not fail to deliver just after midnight the c carrying the members from the corporation landed in thimbu bhutan and the plane was surrounded by a dozen philippine special forces soldiers off to the side the eight bell helicopters were aligned in a row with ten feet separating each ship a large domed hangar was nearby with the door open and light spilling out onto the runway carl gannon walked from inside and extended his hand to eddie seng they tell me youre in charge until the chairman arrives he said let me show you around the others followed seng and gannon inside the hangar ive managed to scrounge up radios and have established a link with the oregon he said pointing to a wooden table with a computer and a stack of papers the latest data is on top alongside the table were several corkboards displaying maps of tibet satellite weather images and other documents a chalkboard was erected on an easel where seng could make notes and draw the plans as well as a large plasticcovered map showing the city of lhasa that was taped to a piece of plywood and sat atop another table off to the side milling around an area with a large coffeepot small refrigerator and cardboard boxes containing food were the eighteen mercenary pilots murphy made his way to the coffee poured a cup and greeted an old friend gurt he said you old dog gurt a midfifties blondhaired man with a crew cut and a gold tooth in front smiled murphy he said flashing the tooth i thought this might be something youd be involved in it had the smell of a corporation operation the men continued visiting while seng flipped through the information gannon had amassed five minutes later he called everyone to sit in the rows of folding wooden chairs arranged in front of the boards the pilots ambled over and took seats behind the corporation crew seng glanced at the assembled group before speaking for those of you who dont know me he said easily my name is eddie seng please call me seng and not eddie so there is no confusion i will be commander in charge of this operation until the time that our chairman juan cabrillo arrives in the theater the group nodded the breakdown of flight operation will be as follows six of the helicopters will be tasked with offensive operations one for the chairman when he arrives one for medical we will draw the assignments out of a hat on who is assigned to what to be fair each of the helicopters will carry one member of our team and the pilots will be required to fly this person anywhere he requests gentlemen we will potentially be under fire and in harms way for the next twentyfour to fortyeight hours if this is not what you signed up for let me know now so you can be replaced if not i want you to understand that as pilots you will be answering to the team member aboard if you hesitate or refuse to comply with a request you will be replaced by one of our team that is qualified in helicopter operations and you will forfeit your second half payment any questions gurt raised his hand when do we receive our first half aha real pilot seng said the answer is as soon as we are finished here everyone okay with that heads nodded if you have personal property or letters to loved ones or wish us to transfer the funds to another party if something happens to you seng noted please see either gannon or crabtree gannon and crabtree raised their hands now are there any other business matters before i explain the operation the hangar was silent good then seng said heres the plan the gulfstream g was at fortyone thousand feet racing toward moscow as cabrillo talked over a secure satellite telephone to the oregon go over them again he said as he scrawled notes on a yellow pad okay ive got them the line was silent as cabrillo studied the list and halpert set up the main corporate entity in andorra correct hanley said lucky break cabrillo said but then by looking at this list the dalai lama is a lucky one too if this had been scheduled last year i dont know if we could have pulled it off isnt that the truth hanley said heres how i see it cabrillo said of the fifteen members of the united nations security council we have three of the five permanent members the united states the united kingdom and russia china is obviously not going to vote our way and france is currently trying to sell whatever they can to the chinese so theyll probably vote with them so as not to upset any deals they have in progress the remaining ten will be trickywe need to pull six out of the ten to give us the nine we need for the resolution let me go over it with you afghanistan were not going to geteven with the us involvement a few years ago there are still too many pockets of antibuddhist revolutionaries for their leaders to risk voting with us sweden is and will always be pacifistic at least at the start as will canada cuba receives too much aid from china to risk voting our way not to mention they almost always vote the opposite of the us sounds about right hanley said that leaves us brunei laos qatar andorra kiribati and tuvalu correct hanley said its blind luck that we have two tiny south pacific nations on the security council at the same time cabrillo said its like a couple of years ago when cameroon and guinea were both members at the same time hanley said it happens each country in the united nations has one vote cabrillo said but this is the first time i really considered the impact same here hanley said cabrillo thought for a moment i know the emir of qatar he said if we offer him a favor later hell order his people to vote the way we want what have we got coming up hanley thought for a moment nothing right now but that can change the last time he went in with us he made something like eighty million if we call in the past favor and dangle something ahead you got the vote youre right cabrillo said ill take care of dealing with him good hanley said laos should be easy theyre buddhist and the general wants his car offer him several cabrillo said where are we funding this from hanley asked were going to try to use around half of the hundred million windfall for everything easy come easy go hanley said brunei should be ours the country is fifteen percent buddhist and the sultan cant risk alienating his constituents plus we saved his brothers life a couple of years ago cabrillo added andorra hanley said what about them good thing halpert set up the new company there cabrillo said whats their gdp hanley scanned through an almanac and found the information its around one point two billion once the oil comes online cabrillo noted well be bringing another twenty percent to the table if someone explains that to their ambassador hed be stupid not to see his way to giving us their vote money talksplus this is the right thing to do anyway i agree hanley said that just leaves the little guys cabrillo said kiribati and tuvalu kiribatis gdp is sixty million hanley said tuvalus is even less its something like eight million split up over ten thousand citizens put two to a room and one of the major las vegas hotels could house the entire country cabrillo was silent for a moment call lowden in colorado and have him start buying cars for the general next send halpert to andorra to explain the impact our company will have on their economy ill take care of the emir of qatar and the sultan of brunei and the little guys truitts free isnt he asked cabrillo yes he is get him on a jet with a stack of bearer bonds you want him to buy the votes hanley asked exactly the storm that brought the torrential rains to macau had turned into spring snow by the time it crossed russia had it not been night cabrillo would have seen that moscow was covered in a wet blanket of white that rounded the edges of buildings and quieted the sounds peering from the windows of the gulfstream as the pilots shut down the engines he could see a trio of black zil limousines with police escorts front and rear holding a fax that had arrived from overholt only minutes before he slid the document into the file and then unbuckled his seat belt and rose the copilot was unlatching the door as he walked forward do you men need anything cabrillo asked i think were okay boss the copilot said well just refuel and await your return cabrillo nodded and waited as the step was lowered wish me luck he said as he stepped down onto the snowcovered tarmac a tall man in a thick dark blue wool coat was standing a few feet from the gulfstream his head was covered by a fur cossack cap and his breath made puffs of mist as he exhaled he approached cabrillo while removing a glove and offered his hand cabrillo shook it then the man motioned to the middle limousine im sergei makelikov the man said as the driver opened the door special assistant to president putin cabrillo followed the man into the rear of the limousine juan cabrillo chairman of the corporation the door was closed and a few seconds later the police cars started away from the gulfstream followed by the trio of limousines the president is very interested in hearing what you have to say makelikov noted may i offer you a drink perhaps vodka or some coffee coffee please cabrillo said makelikov reached for a silverplated thermal carafe and poured the contents into a red mug with the crest of the russian republic on the side he handed it to cabrillo how was your flight the streets were deserted at this late hour the procession roared down the road toward central moscow followed by a cloud of snowflakes cabrillo sipped the coffee no problems cabrillo said smiling cuban cigar makelikov asked dont mind if i do cabrillo said as he selected one from the box makelikov held trimming the end with a tool from inside the box cabrillo leaned over for a light from makelikov well be there shortly the russian noted in the meantime perhaps you would like to hear some music he motioned to a cd player and a stack of discs they were all jazz i see you know my taste in music cabrillo said we know a lot about you makelikov said easily and that is why president putin is staying up late to see you cabrillo nodded and smiled great cigar makelikov lit one and puffed it is isnt it cabrillo slid a cd into the player and the men relaxed and listened fourteen minutes later the procession slid to a stop in front of a row of town houses near gorky park makelikov waited until the driver opened the door then he stepped out onto the snowcovered sidewalk one of the presidents hideaways he said as cabrillo climbed out we can talk here in private the two men headed up the walkway to the steps and climbed up to the door where makelikov nodded at a russian army sergeant he saluted and swung the door open makelikov and cabrillo walked inside mr president makelikov said loudly your visitor has arrived im in the living room a voice said from a room to the right let me take your coat makelikov said helping cabrillo out of his overcoat go on inill join you in a few minutes cabrillo walked into the living room the room was fitted and furnished like the library of an expensive gentlemans club dark wood paneling the walls were covered with paintings of hunting scenes and birds along the right wall was a fireplace containing a roaring wood fire a pair of highbacked red leather chairs framed the fireplace with a couch just behind them closer to the door a thick red carpet atop the inlaid wood floors led almost to the fireplace hearth two brass lamps on each side of the couch cast pools of light in the otherwise dark room president putins back was to cabrillo as he stoked the fire finishing he stood up and turned mr cabrillo he said smiling come in and have a seat cabrillo slid into the red leather chair to the left of the fireplace while putin took the right back when i was with the kgb i had quite a file on you putin said and me you cabrillo said in russian putin nodded then looked directly into cabrillos eyes your russian is much better than my english thank you sir cabrillo said putin nodded i assume you have done a recent psychological profile on me he said did it hazard a guess as to how i would respond it doesnt take a team of psychologists cabrillo said to know youll say yes then why dont you tell me what im agreeing to putin said smiling cabrillo nodded then opened the file he had brought sir he said weve been commissioned to put the dalai lama back in power we think weve worked out a solution that can benefit everyone we just need some russian muscle explain putin said cabrillo handed over the document overholt had faxed to the gulfstream this is a classified satellite image of potential oil reserves inside tibet we recently recovered ancient documents that list thousands of oil seeps in the northern region from the golden buddha that your company stole in macau putin asked your intelligence is good cabrillo said putin studied the image and nodded yes it is he said the preliminary estimates place the reserves in the neighborhood of fifty billion barrels thats an expensive neighborhood putin said about half of the reserves in kuwait or around five percent of the worlds known reserves its potentially an elephant field cabrillo agreed even if it is less we believe it is definitely larger than the field on the north slope of alaska that would put it in the top twenty of all known fields putin noted exactly sir cabrillo said however right now the chinese have control of the field and they dont even know of its existence putin said so you want us to remove them from tibet not exactly sir cabrillo said what we are proposing is that russia join in a consortium to develop the field fifty percent to tibet forty percent to your country and the other ten percent the other ten percent will be owned by my company cabrillo said for putting it all together nice tip putin said smiling but you are asking me to commit my forces for a profit as soon as the casualties start pouring in my citizens will smell a rat cabrillo nodded slowly then he set the hook then we make a deal with china he said easily jintao wants out anywayhis economy is tanking and his increasing oil imports are accelerating his problems you make a diplomatic mission to china and offer him half of the production at a cost of fifteen dollars a barrel for the next ten years and i think hell take it and back down putin laughed brilliant theres one more thing cabrillo said slowly yes we need your un vote in the security council meeting monday cabrillo said youre going to legitimize the coup putin asked we think we can pull the votes cabrillo agreed a lot could go wrong putin said but it could work what exactly would russia need to do to participate first we need your troops to enter mongolia cabrillo said i understand the mongolian government would okay the incursion that draws the chinese farther from tibet second i would need as many crack paratroops as you can field to enter the country as soon as the dalai lama returns and we stabilize the situation the dalai lama has agreed to invite russia to provide security until the situation stabilizes the invitation will be announced to the world community so the fallout other than from china should be small third we need you to make the diplomatic approach to china with the oil offerit has been made clear to me the united states wants no direct involvement in the liberation of tibet i have spoken to your president putin said he mentioned the need for secrecy good cabrillo said next i need that vote in the un if we can hold off the chinese until the vote comes in and the peacekeepers arrive then the russian troops will be relieved putin rose from the chair and stoked the fire so russia invests no money only muscle the company that will develop the oilfield has already been formed cabrillo said all i need is your signature on this document that has already been signed by the dalai lama and your word you will do what we have discussed and we can proceed makelikov entered the room just as putin placed the stoker back in the rack he stepped over to cabrillo took the document and read it quickly sergei he said bring me a pen ill swap you gurt said to one of the other mercenary pilots if you dont mind what did you draw the other pilot asked medevac gurt said ill gladly switch the pilot said mine looks to be the most dangerous mission ive worked with murphy before gurt said plus i have more highaltitude flying time than you i dont mind be my guest the pilot said flying a load of explosives north is not my idea of a good time ill make sure its okay with seng gurt said walking off the fastest way to get you there hanley said is to drop you in singapore then have you flown by jet to vanuatu from there well switch you to a turboprop stol that can land at the smaller airfields on kiribati and tuvalu truitt nodded we need those votes hanley said quietly do whatever it takes to make that happen not to worry truitt said even if it takes a river of grease by monday vote time they will be ours later that night the oregon passed the breakwater and entered the port and truitt boarded the waiting jet for the ninehour flight to the south pacific he would arrive on easter morning the zil limousine slid to a stop in front of the gulfstream g cabrillo climbed out clutching a folder containing the documents and made his way up the ramp without hesitating the copilot immediately retracted the ramp and fastened the door then he shouted toward the cockpit were good to go instantly the pilot engaged the igniters and a few seconds later the jet engines began to spool up cabrillo made his way to a seat and fastened the belt as the copilot started for the cockpit we received your telephone call sir the copilot said over his shoulder as he slid into his seat the course is all plotted and weve received preliminary clearance whats the distance cabrillo asked straight through its about thirtyfour hundred miles the copilot said the winds are favorable so we estimate six hours flight time the gulfstream started taxiing toward the runway easter morning seven am cabrillo said thats the plan sir the copilot said sometimes it all comes down to a few a few minutes a few strokes of luck a few people at this instant it was two murphy and gurt two men one helicopter with extra fuel pods and a load of explosives would form the advance team for the liberation of tibet they lifted off just after am under the waning light of a quarter moon once gurt had the bell at an altitude of one thousand feet above ground level and in a steady forward flight he spoke into the headset our mission he said seems fairly impossible is it the altitude of the pass murphy asked or the lack of fuel for the return flight that concerns you the most neither gurt said its missing sunday service and the chicken dinner afterward murphy reached behind his seat and retrieved a small pack unzipping it he removed a single can and a small bluecovered book spam and a bible he said excellent gurt noted i can proceed then will there be anything else murphy asked only one more thing gurt said whats that keep your eyes on the road gurt said i dont want to get lost not to worry murphy said the oregon is running the command and control this operation will run like a welloiled sewing machine i would have felt better gurt said pointing out a herd of deer underneath that were lit by the moon had you said like a computer murphy was staring at the instruments were a little hot he said take it down a notch gurt made the adjustment they continued north at about the same instant that the bell carrying murphy and gurt crossed into tibetan airspace briktin gampo was steering the twoandahalfton truck along a rutted dirt road locating the spot his dungkar cell leader had marked he slowed and pulled to a stop gampo was on the flats just below basatongwula shan in an open meadow ringed by stunted trees climbing from the truck he walked around to the rear and removed several metal tubes and felt them they were cold to the touch remembering what he had been told gampo pulled a small fuel oil stove from the rear moved a distance away then erected the legs once the stove was assembled he removed some tent poles and slid them inside an offwhite canvas tent and hoisted the apparatus into the air once the tent was secure he lit the stove brought the tubes inside to keep them warm then went back to the rear of the truck and removed a radio a folding chair and a fur to cover himself while he waited then he switched on the radio and began to listen outside the tent thousands of stars flickered against the black sea of deep space a cold wind blew down from the mountain gampo pulled the fur closer around his neck until the tent warmed then he patiently waited for the hours to pass on the oregon hanley was staring at the wall of flatscreen monitors suddenly the satellite feed of the russian troop concentration near novosibirsk began to display a thermal image of tanks being started at the same instant the secure telephone began to ring were a go cabrillo said i have confirmation over the satellite hanley told him the russian tanks are warming link my computer to the oregons data banks cabrillo ordered i want to monitor the situation from here until i arrive hanley nodded to stone who typed in commands on his computer keyboard signals going out stone said a minute later in the gulfstream g cabrillo stared at his laptop suddenly the screen erupted with a burst of light then went dark then slowly began to glow again the screen split into six separate blocks each duplicating what hanley was seeing ive got it cabrillo said mr chairman hanley said call the ball proceed as planned cabrillo said and link me up with seng you got it hanley said eddie seng was pacing back and forth inside the hangar in thimbu bhutan occasionally he would return to the table where the computer screen showed the pulsing red dot that marked the progress of the helicopter carrying murphy and gurt then he would walk around the hangar again like a caged lion he answered his telephone before the second ring eddie cabrillo said were a go yes sir seng said we have a team already flying northi took the liberty knowing we could call them back if necessary good job cabrillo said max im on the threeway hanley said from the oregon send seng the latest data showing the airport near lhasa its being transmitted now seng walked over to the printer a few seconds later it began to spit out documents its coming across now seng noted okay cabrillo said you have your playbook and the latest intelligence yes sir seng said now go take gonggar airport cabrillo said you got it boss seng said eagerly fiveam the earlymorning hours when drunks sweat and nightmares grow ugly a cold wind was blowing across the runway at gonggar airport located fiftynine miles from lhasa a pair of chinese transport planes sat on the far end of the runway along with three helicopters the other chinese aircraft inside tibet had been called north in support of the tank column gonggar airport was as deserted as a cemetery on a weekday a single janitor swept the chipped concrete floor in the crude main terminal taking a break to smoke a handrolled cigarette he stepped outside and stood where a wall shielded him from the wind the limited troops on duty at the airport were sleeping they were not due to rise for another hour a sound came up the valley it was a whoosh like a wellthrown football then a stark whitecolored craft raced past at thirty feet above the tarmac the strange object sped to the end of the airport then made an arcing turn and lined up for a pass suddenly twin streams of fire erupted from the sides and a pair of missiles streaked toward the parked transport planes the predator had found her prey in the hangar in bhutan lincoln stared at the image from the predators onboard cameras steering the predator into another arcing turn he lined up in front of the helicopters and flicked the trigger then he made another turn to see the results the cargo planes were ablaze the helicopters would join them in a second at the same instant yards from the edge of the field nearly one hundred dungkar troops slid out from under white tarps that blended with the snow on the ground screaming a war cry they raced toward the terminal dressed in black robes with ceremonial knives in their belts and handguns and rifles that had been smuggled into the country only days before they swarmed like locusts into predetermined positions from the south came the thumping sound of seven helicopters approaching as the helicopter carrying seng popped up to the plateau he could see the fires from the predators attack burning bright in the early morning then as if a divine light was making its way to earth a series of red light sticks began to flicker on the tarmac the dungkar were sending the message it was safe to land land inside the box seng said to the pilot will do the pilot said starting his descent seconds after the helicopter landed seng climbed from the front while king made his way from the rear seng quickly walked to the terminal where he met up with the leader of the dungkar at the same time king motioned to the troops for help and then began to unload crates of rifles and ammunition from the cargo area what have you got seng asked the man who was no more than thirty the hangars over there the man said pointing contain one fighter plane one cargo plane and a pair of attack helicopters the hangar next door must be for repairsthere is a helicopter disassembled and the fuselage of an observation plane with the engine removed cabrillo had asked the dalai lama to make sure the dungkar officers he picked were able to speak english there was no time for his team to learn tibetan and less time for misunderstanding where did you go to school seng asked arizona state sir the man said eagerly go sun devils good seng said im sure youre glad to be homenow lets see if we can keep it that way first i want a couple of your men to work with the guy coming in on that helicopter he pointed to another bell just touching down twenty yards away we need to rig these buildings with charges to burn them if necessary ill put a dozen of my best men on it the man said eagerly how many chinese have you captured seng asked less than a dozen sir the man said one of mine deadtwo of theirs the airport was a bedlam of activity the fires burned at the far end of the field against the tapestry of the early morning and the sound of the landing helicopters added a surreal element to the quiet air all at once solitude had become a salvo listen carefully seng said to the leader of the dungkar forces this comes from the dalai lama himself there will be no brutality or mistreatment of the prisonersmake sure your men know this clearly once this is all said and done were returning whatever prisoners we capture to chinamy company doesnt want to hear of any atrocities whatsoever this is a coup detat not an ethnic cleansing are we clear on that company sir the man asked arent you united states troops were from the states seng said at least most of us but we are a private firm now working under the direction of your leader if you and the other dungkar do what we order in the next twentyfour to fortyeight hours there will be a free tibet once again youve done this sort of thing before the man asked in amazement theres no time for chitchat seng snapped you all do exactly what youre ordered and this will go as smoothly as possible yes sir good seng said bring the highestranking prisoner to the main terminal and have him seated in a chair and guarded well be setting up operations there in the next several minutesthen i want to speak to him the man shouted orders in tibetan the dungkar soldiers lined up in rows he explained what seng had relayed then ordered six sergeants to the forefront then one group led by a sergeant went off to round up the prisoners another split off to the helicopter kasim had left hali seng shouted take these men and wire the other hangars to blow if we need to kasim motioned to the troops and raced back to the helicopter the bell that had carried seng and king to the airfield was now unloaded king motioned for it to lift off the pilot ascended to one thousand feet over the field and then began to fly in large lazy circles two more touched down and crabtree and gannon climbed out whats your name seng shouted to the leader of the dungkar rimpoche pache rimpoche gannon and crabtree raced over carl seng said this is general rimpoche tell him what you need gannon walked a few feet away to where they could hear better and explained rimpoche summoned a sergeant and a dozen men raced off i need the supplies unloaded and taken inside crabtree said to seng who pointed to rimpoche general rimpoche he said motioning to the man will take care of it seng unclipped a portable radio from his belt and switched it on then spoke airport is under our control he said to hanley on the oregon what do you see hanley studied the satellite image on the screen before answering no troop movement yetbut if they do come it will be from the road that enters from the east there is what looks like a bridge about threequarters of a mile toward lhasa control that and youll be able to make a stand if necessary no planes or helicopter activity seng asked none hanley said anything not on the ground there is far to the north even if they called them back now you have an hour or so good seng said as meadows walked up reach me by portable if the situation changes were on full alert hanley said it all comes down to the next few hours seng clipped the radio back on his belt and turned to meadows bob take fifty troops and your weaponry down that road he said pointing theres a bridge we need to control whos in charge from their side meadows asked general rimpoche seng said pointing to the man at that instant three trucks slowly drove in front of the terminal and were motioned to stop by gannon at the same time tom reyes walked over general seng shouted rimpoche approached yes i need four of your best men crack shots and fearless rimpoche turned and shouted out names to the cluster of troops four men emerged from the crowd not one of the men was over five feet six dripping wet not one of them could have weighed over pounds do any of them speak english seng asked all of them do a little rimpoche said tell them this seng said they will be going into lhasa with two of my men to capture a very important man they need to do exactly what my men tell themwithout hesitation rimpoche translated as soon as he had finished the four men shouted huh and stomped one foot on the tarmac you have your file seng asked reyes yes sir reyes said king was a short distance away removing a long black case from a crate okay larry seng shouted you and tom can go do your thing holding a set of nightvision goggles king walked over lets do it he said reyes motioned to the four tibetans who were eagerly waiting were going to grab someone and were going to do it with a minimum of shootingdo you men understand i speak fair english one of the soldiers said ill translate he reiterated what reyes had said then turned which helicopter this way reyes said leading them back to the helicopter he had just climbed off king followed the four tibetans and once they were seated inside the helicopter lifted off and headed into the center of town who are they after rimpoche asked the chairman of the tibet autonomous region legchog zhuren the last helicopter was on the ground and huxley walked over this is our medical officer seng said to rimpoche poll your troops and see if any of your men have any experience as doctors or nursesif so we need them to work with julia here right now however we need that helicopter unloaded and the contents carried inside the terminal ms huxley will be setting up a field hospital immediately if any of your men were injured or wounded shell treat them shortly rimpoche shouted orders and men raced to the helicopter to unload adams and gunderson were standing to the side waiting for seng to finish he turned and smiled you two go see what the chinese have that we can use seng said i need to interrogate a prisoner the two pilots ambled off toward the hangars seng walked inside to where a chinese air force lieutenant was sitting in a chair in the middle of the terminal with four fiercelooking tibetan soldiers surrounding him damn nice scenery murphy noted glancing out the window like alaska on steroids gurt was watching the altitude gauge as they climbed higher toward the imposing ridge of mountains just ahead the sun had yet to peek over the horizon but her coming was heralded by the pink glow being cast over the rugged terrain we could probably claim the helicopter altitude record gurt said i dont think so murphy said some guy went to twentyfour thousand feet a couple of years ago to perform a himalayan rescue i read about that gurt said but that was in a bell and it had special rotor blades you sound a little worried murphy said not worried gurt said just apprehensive he pointed out the front windshield at the wall approaching the trees were petering out as they drew nearer now there was only the black and gray of rocks streaked with tendrils of snow and ice that dripped down the sides of the imposing mountain like rivulets of ice cream on a childs hand a gust of wind buffeted the helicopter blowing it sideways clouds started to appear around the bell gurt stared at the gauge again it read eighteen thousand feet and climbing the helicopter carrying reyes king and the dungkar forces came in twenty feet above the ground and approached lhasa from the south the sound from the lhasa river helped cover the noise as the pilot landed on a small spit of sand in the river just east of what the chinese referred to as dream island formerly an idyllic picnic spot now replaced by tacky chinese shops and karaoke bars unload the crates reyes shouted to the dungkar as soon as the crates were unloaded and king had exited they all raced a short distance away and crouched down to avoid the blast of sand from the rotor wash as the helicopter quickly lifted off and raced downriver once the helicopter was out of sound and sight reyes opened a small satchel and removed a parabolic dish for listening quickly switching it on he listened for the sound of alarms in the city he heard only the sound of the river nodding he whispered to one of the tibetans look prying a crate open he pointed it was a box of tibetan flags which had long ago been banned by the chinese oppressors the flags featured a snow lion with red and blue rays the man bent down and touched the pile gingerly and when he rose to look at reyes his eyes were filled with tears we need to carry all these crates across the river reyes said to the tibetan and stash them then you and the others need to follow me and king to zhurens house yes the tibetan said eagerly well need one of you to guard the flags and one man to go with mr king the other two of you reyes said quietly will enter the house with me the tibetan nodded then began to whisper orders to his men five minutes later they were all safely across the river and walking toward the barkhor area of lhasa king and his tibetan helper peeled away from the group and made their way to the tallest building near the home of the chinese government official the streets were empty except for a few tibetan merchants who were sweeping the square in preparation of setting up shop taking the steps two at a time king and his helper made their way to the rooftop where they took up position once he was in place king reached into his bag removed a small bottle of oxygen and then took a few deep breaths he then offered the bottle to the tibetan who smiled but shook his head no then he scanned the area through his scope the home of legchog zhuren was an ornate affair whose front faced south onto barkhor square just to the east of the house lay the jokhang a temple built sometime in the seventh century the jokhang the most revered religious building in lhasa featured dozens of statues a variety of gold artwork and some thirty chapels king watched as reyes passed in front of the jokhang he stopped for a second and raised a closed fist into the air then reyes followed by two tibetans made his way down an alley between the temple and the chairmans house and passed out of view king pushed the button on a silverplated stopwatch set the time for one minute and watched when the stopwatch read fifteen seconds king reached into his satchel and removed a hollowedout rams horn and handed it to the tibetan when i say he told him start blowing and dont stop until i tell you to or were dead the man nodded eagerly and took the horn king took another breath of oxygen and checked the stopwatch five seconds he glanced at the guards patrolling the walkway outside zhurens house there were two outside the wroughtiron gate two more just outside the front door sitting on chairs he lined up his shots now he said loudly the horn erupted with the sound of a cat under a vacuum cleaner like wraiths appearing above a graveyard the square was suddenly filled with four dozen dungkar warriors they had posed as shopkeepers and earlymorning walkers and had hidden inside drums containing spices and seeds they screamed war cries and raced toward the gate leading up to the chairmans home on the front porch one of the guards was rousted from a half sleep by the sound of the horn and the approaching horde he stood up and reached for a bell near the front door but before he could reach it to sound the alarm he heard a sharp crack as if in a dream he stared in amazement as his hand and arm from the elbow dropped onto the porch then he screamed as blood erupted from the stump like a geyser at the same time the dungkar reached the pair of guards outside the gate they were dead before they could comprehend what was happening their throats slit like pigs at slaughter swiveling around the frontdoor guard stared in horror at the advancing dungkar his partner started to speak but a second later his head was blown off his shoulders it landed on the porch with a thud the lips still straining to answer a signal from an impulse now dead the first dungkar raced up the steps with his sword held in front the guard tried to reach for his handgun but with no hand he had no chance the sword ran through his middle and pinned him to the wooden door like some macabre christmas wreath he mouthed a few words before dying but only blood seeped from inside the force of the guard slamming into the door burst the lock the door swung open and the dungkar raced inside around the rear of the house the scene was less violent the single guard at the door off the kitchen had been asleep his dereliction of duty would save his life reyes crept up hit him with a stun gun then had one of the tibetans bind his mouth wrists and legs with duct tape before he had a chance to do anything then reyes popped open the lock with a pick and made his way inside he and the tibetans were halfway up the stairs leading to zhurens bedroom before the horn sounded then reyes saw them there were three unarmed men at the top of the landing he reached for his holstered handgun but before he could snap off a round a tibetan houseboy appeared from behind and lopped a leather garrote over the mens heads and pulled tight their heads slammed together then their legs began to kick as the houseboy tightened the cord reyes motioned for one of the men following to help then raced past to zhurens door stopping for a second to line himself up he slammed his polished black boot at a point just above the doorknob the door burst open and he stepped inside the man in the bed slowly started to rise while rubbing his eyes then he reached toward the nightstand reyes fired a round into the headboard above the mans head and the room filled with the smell of spent gunpowder i wouldnt reyes said if i were you i cant see much gurt admitted the clouds had closed in as they neared the top of the pass snow and sleet raked across the windshield of the bell the was slowly ascending but barely making any forward movement at all they were flying blind on the edge of the helicopters performance envelope ive got a road murphy suddenly shouted on the port side gurt spotted the black stripe against the white background a movement of vehicles across the terrain had displaced most of the snow leaving only dirt and rock whats that gurt said straining to see i think its a column of tanks murphy said ill go to one side gurt said and stay in the cloud cover along the side of the road a chinese tank commander was watching several of his soldiers repair a tread that had come loose he heard the helicopter in the distance so he climbed inside and called his superior on the radio no idea his superior reported but youd better find out what it is popping his head out of the hatch the tank commander shouted down to his men then he began to pass rifles out of the hatch two minutes later the soldiers were hiking up the road away from their disabled tank theres the crest murphy shouted find a spot to touch down gurt played with the collective but at this altitude he had little control hold on he shouted the landing was more a controlled crash than a touchdown the came down hard on the skids but they held murphy was already unsnapping his safety harness driver he said smiling just keep her runningill only be a minute opening the door he stepped out and a few feet back and opened the cargo door then he removed a pair of snowshoes which he attached to his feet pulling another coat over the one he was already wearing he began to dig in a crate placing the items he needed into a backpack hold down the fort he shouted to the front of the helicopter im going to set the charges gurt nodded then watched as murphy disappeared into the blowing snow then he began to play with his radio he found little to hear so he switched back to the regular frequency sherpa sherpa sherpa this is the oregon over in the control room eric stone looked at hanley with worry thats the fifth time nothing sherpa sherpa sherpa this is the oregon over oregon this is sherpa gurt answered read you eight by eight there was a twosecond delay as the signal bounced off the ionosphere and down to the ship where are you hanley said taking the microphone were on site gurt reported your man just left for the appointment we just intercepted a communication from the bad guys hanley said someone heard you go over and theyve been asked to investigate this is not good oregon gurt said quickly i have no way to reach murphy and warn him plus its going to take us some time to lift off okay hanley said we can send a signal to murphs beeperwell tell him to return to where you are in the meantime keep a close eye for anyone approaching if they do you take to the air send a message to murphy to withdraw hanley said to stone who quickly punched the commands into his keyboard my visibility is around thirty to forty feet gurt said and im not leaving murphno way no we dont want you to hanley started to say oregon gurt shouted over the radio there are chinese troops coming through the snow murphy was bent over placing the charges in the snow when his beeper chirped he finished attaching the detonation cord then rose up and removed the beeper from his pocket damn he said flipping the switch open so the charge could be remotely detonated then he pulled his m around from his back on its sling and began heading back in the direction of the helicopter gurt reached behind his seat and felt for a handgun in a rack the chinese troops were struggling through the thick snow making slow but steady progress toward the bell they were holding rifles but they had yet to take a shot murphy stumbled along as fast as one could run on snowshoes while he ran he was folding out a grenade launcher reaching over his shoulder into the pack he removed a rocketpropelled grenade and started fitting it into the launcher he was on a sloping ridge racing down when he first caught sight of the chinese troops they were twentyfive feet from the bell murphy estimated his angle and fired a grenade it went over the heads of the chinese troops and exploded they flopped on their bellies in the deep snow what the gurt started to say as he turned and saw murphy approaching in the distance adding fuel to the turbine gurt tried to lift off nothing murphy was twenty feet away now and racing toward the helicopter the first few chinese troops began to rise from the snow and shoulder their rifles gurt started firing the handgun from the window a couple seconds later murphys m opened up ten feet now gurt reached across and opened the copilots door murphy paused in his firing removed his pack placed it gingerly behind his seat and climbed inside holding the m in his lap gurt was firing the handgun and fiddling with the collective at the same time morning murphy said when there was a moment of quiet anything exciting happen while i was away we have no lift gurt said before squeezing off a few rounds ill need to milk the cyclic to get us off the ground the chinese troops had stopped advancing now they were digging in to make their kill shot murphy slipped between the seats into the rear and yanked open both cargo doors quit firing and take us up gurt ill handle these boys milking the cyclic is bad for helicopters it consists of jamming the cyclic from side to side while pumping up and down on the collective it can create lift when there is nonebut it can also easily cause the mast that supports the rotor to bump against other parts of the helicopter then you run the risk of a nick or a fracture in the mast lose the mast and youve lost the helicopter the firefight had erupted so quickly that the chinese tank commander had little time to rally his men now that hed had a few minutes to prepare and his troops were dug in to the snow he began to shout orders that would concentrate the fire in the right direction gurt slammed the cyclic from one side to the other and the began to rise slowly right at that instant the chinese commander screamed for his men to advance and the front line rose at the same time murphy triggered the grenade and it left the launcher with a whoosh and a burning smell that filled the cabin the round landed six feet in front of the lead soldier and exploded murphy followed that up with a complete clip from the m he replaced the clip and prepared to fire again just then gurt got the bell off the ground and struggled to turn away from the firefight they were a hundred feet away from the chinese troops when murphy blew through the second clip and the bloody snow where the chinese troops lay began to fade in the distance he quickly replaced the clip set the m to one side and reached for the remote detonator the c erupted with a force equivalent to ten thousand pounds of tnt a slab of snow was ripped from the side of the hill and raced down the slope covering the chinese troops then the slide raced across the road with a wall of snow and ice twenty feet high in sympathy smaller slides broke loose from the opposite hillside from the shock wave that trembled through the rock and soil these slides added another eight to ten feet to the mess already created the few chinese troops still living after the firefight were buried beneath the wall of snow the pilot of the gulfstream stared at his navigation screen carefully the route he was taking did not allow much margin for error he was flying above a small corridor of indian airspace that jutted between bangladesh and nepal the surface area was but twenty miles in width at the smallest point the land below was hotly contested by all three countries slowly he steered the gulfstream in a sweeping turn to the left sir he shouted to the rear cabin were through the worst of it the gulfstream was now above the wider strip of land between nepal and bhutan how long until we reach tibetan airspace cabrillo asked the pilot stared at the gps screen less than five minutes juan cabrillo should have been bonetired but he was not he stared out the window at the mountainous terrain below the rising sun was blanketed in a glow of pinks and yellows tibet was directly ahead he reached for the secure telephone and dialed in beijing hu jintao was awakened early the actions in barkhor square had not gone unnoticed jintao quickly rose from his bed washed his face and went downstairs still dressed in his nightclothes whats the situation he asked a general without preamble its all fluid mr president the general admitted but the russian tank column has started moving into mongolia their ambassador assures us the movement is just an exercise between their country and russia however at the speed they are moving they could enter china across the altai mountains into the tarim basin anytime in the next few hours what about aircraft jintao asked they have several paratroop units at the staging area inside russia the general said our satellites have detected transport planes moving on the tarmac as of right now nothing has left the ground jintao turned to the head of foreign relations we dont currently have any dispute with russia he said what possible reason would they have to launch an attack on our border at the moment our relations are peaceful most odd jintao said the russian ambassador has asked for a meeting at ten am this morning the man added the request came overnight through a priority channel did he disclose the nature of his request jintao asked no the foreign relations head said jintao stood quietly for a moment thinking mr president the general said theres more we just received reports from the capital of tibet that a protest has formed in one of the main squares inside the city whats the chairman of the region say jintao asked there was a pause before the general answered well mr president thats the problem we have been unable to reach chairman zhuren damn gurt murphy said that was close i think one of the rounds hit a hydraulic line that controls our forward pitch as for me i was hit in my left shoulder how bad is it murphy said quickly shell fly gurt noted but itll be a little hairy i mean you gurt murphy thundered how bad are you hit gurt was steering the bell down the slope leading off the pass through a thick cloud cover the helicopters nose was pointed down and both mens bodies were tight against the seat harnesses hang on gurt said ill lean forward so you can check gurt moved his upper torso away from the seat back and murphy leaned over and looked then he reached over with his hand and felt around a second later he pulled a flattened slug from inside the foam of the seat the round passed clean through and was stopped by the metal back plate on the seat murphy noted but youre losing blood it wasnt hurting until now gurt disclosed i think i was on such an adrenaline high i didnt really notice it much im going to need to bind the wound murphy said hold on a minutelet me make a call he reached for his portable radio and called the oregon wedge it in there gunderson said but make sure the spent cartridges have a way to blow out the side door i dont want any live rounds cooking off inside the cargo area the dungkar soldier assisting gunderson nodded ten minutes earlier they had yanked a rapidfiring antiaircraft gun from its mount on the border of gonggar airport now they were fitting it to the cargo plane to make a crude gunship the soldiers worked quickly as did those at the other end of the hangar george adams watched as the dungkar troops filled the fuel tank on the attack helicopter for the last ten minutes he had climbed around inside the ship in an effort to determine the controls and weapons systems at this instant he was convinced that he could probably fly the birdmaking the weapons perform as desired was a little iffier welcome to the dungkar air force gunderson said walking over we fly you die hows it going over there adams said smiling im not sure gunderson admitted we have the weapon lodged in the rear and supported with enough planks to build a barnif it doesnt fly out the opposite side the first time we light it up we should be okay how about you my chinese is a little rusty adams said about as rusty as an iron ship on the bottom of the ocean but i think i can pilot this beast gunderson nodded lets make a pact old buddy he said smiling whats that adams asked when we get up there gunderson said lets not shoot each other down he turned and started to walk back to the cargo plane good luck he said over his shoulder you too adams answered right then the door started to rise and sunlight and cold air swept into the hangar a minute later the attack helicopter was wheeled onto the tarmac and a motorized cart was attached to the front of the cargo plane to pull it onto the runway barkhor square was rapidly filling with tibetans the crude human telegraph system that operates in time of crisis was working overtime four blocks away a platoon of chinese soldiers were attempting to make their way by armored personnel carrier from their barracks to the square after receiving a call that there was action at the chairmans home tibetans clogged the streets and the going was slow piper piper this is masquerade masquerade this is piper we read request immediate extraction reyes said we have the target state point of extraction masquerade spot one one primary piper spot one three secondary hh acknowledge extraction coordinates masquerade they are inbound in three upon receiving the order the helicopter that had delivered them to the river lifted from the ground at a spot ten miles between lhasa and gonggar airport where the pilot had been waiting once he had the helicopter in forward flight the pilot stared at a map listing the extraction points they had arranged and glanced at the note he had scribbled on a pad attached to the clip on his knee he flew fast and low toward barkhor square in little lhasa the dalai lama waited inside the communications room near a bank of radios in the last few minutes his network of spies inside tibet had begun to report the progress so far at least the operation appeared to be going flawlessly he turned to an aidedecamp are the preparations completed for our trip home he asked as soon as word comes from mr cabrillo your holiness he said we can have you there in two hours by jet the dalai lama thought for a moment once we take off he asked how long will it be until we are over tibet half an hour the man noted give or take i am going to the temple now to pray the dalai lama said rising keep watch on the situation yes your holiness the aide said chuck gunderson was helping george adams strap himself into the attack helicopter none of the chinese helmets inside the hangar were large enough to fit his head so he was using his own personal headset plugged into the radio for communications he was squeezed into the seat like a fat girl in spandex they dont make these for big guys like us adams joked you should see mine gunderson said the chinese still believe in quantity over quality my cockpit looks like im back in world war two i keep expecting glenn miller music to start playing over the radio look at this dashboard adams said as gunderson finished and stood upright on the ladder its got more metal that a fiftyseven chevy just then eddie seng walked over quickly you need to get airborne and clear the runway cabrillo just called hes five minutes out gunderson pushed down on the plexiglas shield over adamss head and held it as he fastened it in place then he thumped the top and gave adams a thumbsup sign climbing back down the ladder he motioned for the tibetan helpers to wheel it out of the way he began walking with seng toward the cargo plane as he heard the igniters in the turbine engine of the attack helicopter begin to wind up mr seng gunderson said whats the latest i interrogated the chinese lieutenant that was the ranking officer here seng said he was not able to get word to beijing before we captured his forces so for now gunderson said reaching the door of the cargo plane we dont need to worry about an attack from chinese fighters from outside the country if the russians do their job and keep the chinese on their toes seng said your role right now seems to be to provide close air support for the dungkar forces ill do what i can gunderson said climbing into the side door of the cargo plane good seng said patting the side of the plane now get to workthe boss is coming at just that second adams pulled the collective and the chinese helicopter lifted from the ground the helicopter wobbled a little as adams fought to get the feel then it moved forward broke through the ground effect and headed in the direction of lhasa gunderson walked up the slope to the cockpit slid into his seat then began the enginestarting procedure once the pair of engines were running smoothly he glanced back to the four dungkar soldiers manning the gun in the rear okay men he shouted over the noise of the engines ill tell you when and where to direct the fire for right now were just taking a little flight that sounded simple enoughbut not one of the tibetans had ever been inside a plane before on board the oregon hanley stood above the microphone and talked in a clear voice i just sent word to your contact he said watch for red strobes as your signal same spot as we had first planned murphy asked yes hanley said now as far as gurt is concerned we talked to huxley you need to apply direct pressure to the wound as soon as possible do you have us on satellite surveillance murphy asked yes hanley said staring at the screen youre about five minutes from the rendezvous point well report back once we land murphy said the radio went dead hanley dialed seng and waited while it rang briktin gampo checked to make sure the strobes were flashing then stared up at the sky the clouds were low almost a fog but from second to second they would shift revealing patches of open air in the distance he could hear a helicopter approaching he walked back inside stirred a pot of tea on the stove then went back out to await the arrival i see one murphy said pointing in the last few minutes gurts face had turned ashen murphy could see beads of sweat on his forehead and his hand controlling the helicopter was shaking hold on murphy said were almost there im starting to see black on the edges of my eyes gurt said you might need to guide me on where to land the sound of the cargo plane lifting off was loud eddie seng was forced to yell into the telephone how bad is it he asked hanley we dont know hanley said but we should dispatch someone nowthe flight north takes a couple of hours if the support is not needed we can call it back got it seng said then he walked toward the makeshift clinic to see if huxley had found anyone trained in nursing to fly along five minutes later he had a helicopter refueled a tibetan soldier with a limited nursing background and supplies in the air youre close enough gurt murphy said and youre about twelve feet above the ground gurt started to descend then vomited across the dashboard of the bell in case i cant when that gauge reads green he said wiping the sleeve of his flight suit across his mouth flick these three switches down that will shut down the turbines six feet above the ground in a slow descent gurt paused and hovered for a second then took her the rest of the way to the ground as soon as the helicopter settled on the skids he slumped over in the harness and sat unmoving murphy started to unsnap him from the belt as he waited for the helicopter to cool then turned the engines off and waited for the rotor to stop spinning then he quickly climbed from his seat and raced around to the pilots door with gampos help they carried gurt inside the tent then murphy began to cut off his flight suit with a knife the cloth was saturated by blood and the wound was still leaking sir the pilot of the gulfstream said were on final approach cabrillo stared out the window smoke was still rising from the burning wreckage at the far end of gonggar airport the sun was over the horizon and he could just catch sight of lhasa sixty miles distant staring up the aisle through the open cockpit door and out the windshield he could see a lumbering silver plane some seventy feet above the runway climbing out and away on the ground were several trucks driving down the road away from the airfield they were a hundred feet above the runway and two hundred yards downwind two minutes later the tires touched the tarmac with a squeal the pilot taxied off the runway near the terminal and stopped the turbines were still spinning when cabrillo climbed out chairman zhuren had tape across his eyes and his wrists were taped behind his back the darkhaired man that had burst into his bedroom was pulling him quickly along zhuren could hear a noisy crowd of people nearby then distant gunfire rang out from a few blocks away the thumping of a distant helicopter grew louder king watched through the scope as reyes led zhuren through the crowd he could see reyes ordering the dungkar soldiers with him to clear the people away from the landing zone turning he glanced from his perch a few blocks away to where the armored personnel carriers were approaching crowds of tibetans were trying to stop them but they were being felled by bursts of machinegun fire the lead apc was coming down a narrow street with tibetans fleeing from the front he watched as it ran over the fallen body of a tibetan freedom fighter it flattened the body like a frog on a train track reaching into his bag he removed a belt of ammunition containing armorpiercing rounds and slid them into the the helicopter was just about to touch down when he started firing ten shots in seven seconds ten more for good measure the lead apc ground to a halt the ones to the rear stopped also the sound of the helicopter was loud in zhurens ears he felt himself being pulled from inside and pushed from outside into a seat then he felt someone slide in next to him he sniffed the air it was the darkhaired man the man who had yanked him from safety into the unknown the helicopter lifted off they will hover above us and well climb inside king said to his dungkar assistant mr sir the tibetan said can i stay whats your plan king asked the tibetan pointed to where his countrymen were swarming over the disabled apc the helicopter was almost to the rooftop king reached into his satchel and removed a black cloth bag these are hand grenades he said do you know how they work pull the metal thing and run the dungkar said smiling you got it king said but keep your people back when you use themthese will shred a human like cheese in a grater the helicopter was above the rooftop and lowering down the tibetan grabbed the bag and started for the ladder down thank you sir the dungkar soldier shouted good luck king shouted as a pair of hands from inside the helicopter reached for him and he stepped up onto the skid then ducked down and climbed inside hows things reyes shouted after the door was closed and the helicopter had turned back toward gonggar airport you know what they say king said wearily we do more before lunch than most people do all day mr seng cabrillo said excellent job so far a cold wind was blowing from the north it bore the scent of forests and glaciers aviation fuel and gunpowder cabrillo zipped the leather jacket he was wearing tighter around his neck then reached in his rear pocket and removed a carefully folded white handkerchief and dabbed his nose which was running thank you sir seng said heres the most current situation report murphy and the contract pilot managed to get the charges placed and cause the avalanche at the pass any chinese armor is now effectively immobilized even if they decided to ignore the russian advance and try to return to lhasa now their only route would cost them at least fortyeight hours of transit time and that is if the weather holds problems with that operation cabrillo asked the contract pilot one gurt guenther was hit by smallarms fire seng said the extent of his injuries is unknown youve dispatched backup a relief helicopter with kasim aboard is en route seng said but they made it to the fuel stop and managed to land so guenther might not be too critical the way it stands now is that if murphys team can fly themselves out we can call back kasim good cabrillo said we might just need him here speaking of the weather seng said we are going to catch a late spring storm this afternoon then it will clear for tomorrow and the next few days the estimate is two to three inches of snow and for the temperature to go below freezing before a slow warming trend the weather has the same impact on us as on the chinese cabrillo said but it is a possible advantage for the dungkar forces well score it in tibets favor from far in the east came the sound of an approaching helicopter cabrillo stared in the distance and tried to make out which type it was thats one of ours sir seng said it contains reyes king and legchog zhuren excellent the two men started walking closer to the terminal zhuren would end up there soon enough we have managed to field an attack helicopter liberated from the chinese and piloted by mr adams also a cargo plane we modified into a gunship with gunderson at the controls as well as the rental bells and the predator an excellent air armada for the newly resurrected tibetan military cabrillo said everything else in the plan has taken place at the correct time seng said but there is one problem that has arisen i discovered it when questioning a captured chinese lieutenant what cabrillo asked because the chinese troops in tibet have always been outnumbered seng said if they were overrunand i mean a broken arrow situation no hope at allthe plan called for them to gas the tibetan rebels with an airborne paralyzing agent the drums must be marked with some symbols cabrillo said well just call washington and receive recommendations for how to disable it thats the problem seng said loudly over the sound of the helicopter hovering to land the lieutenant doesnt know where it was stored he only knows it exists cabrillo reached into his coat pocket and removed a cuban cigar biting off the end he spit the plug to the side then reached for a zippo lighter with the other hand and did a singlehand light he puffed the cigar to life before speaking i have a feeling mr seng its going to be a long day murphy was angry gampo had left him alone in the tent with a weak and bleeding gurt if this was the way the feared dungkar reacted to blood theyd lose this war before it ever started the oregon was sending help but even at the fastest cruising speed the bell could fly that would be hours away gurt his friend and fellow warrior was growing weaker by the minute his skin was an ugly gray and he was drifting in and out of consciousness just then the flap of the tent was pulled back and gampo entered he was carrying a handful of longbladed grass clippings in one hand and what looked like a wet dirt clod in the other and under his chin was a chunk of meat from some unspecified beast where the hell did you go murphy said stir the fire in the stove gampo said quietly setting down the grass and mud then add these to the fire he added removing a leather pouch with powdered minerals inside we need a good amount of smoke inside the tent once you have that done he said pointing to the meat cook that in with the tea and make me a meat broth murphy stared at gampo as if he were crazy but the tibetan was already busy cleaning and bandaging gurts wound so murphy did as he was told two minutes later the tent was filled with a smoke that smelled somewhat like cinnamon cloves washed in lemon three more minutes and gampo stood upright and stared at murphy then he motioned to help him prop gurt up the grass and mud had dried into a pair of oblong bandages front and rear they adhered to his skin like plaster of paris laced with glue gurts eyes began to flicker open and he drew a few deep breaths give him the broth of the bear gampo said ill go gas up your flying ship just across the border of russia and mongolia general alexander kernetsikov was breathing deeply of the dieselsmoketinged air after leaving novosibirsk his tank column had blown through the altai region like a topfueler down a drag strip kernetsikov was riding in the lead tank with his head out of a forward hatch he was wearing a helmet with a headset so he could communicate with his other officers and a uniform with enough ribbons to decorate a christmas tree in his mouth was an unlit cuban cigar in his hand was a gps that he was using to track the columns speed the distance to the tibet border was five hundred miles they were traveling at thirtyfive miles per hour kernetsikov stared overhead as a flight of fighters crisscrossed high in the air above then he called his intelligence officer over the radio to learn what was new the weather was due to change to snow sometime in the next few hours other than that all was the same in macau sung rhee was reaching the end of his patience marcus friday had learned that his plane had been found and had ordered it to return to pick him up and fly him out of the city stanley ho was still angry about the theft of his priceless buddha the later discovery that the one friday had recovered was fake just added to his rage after the chinese navy had realized that the cargo ship they had illegally stopped on the high seas had nothing to do with the incident in macau they had broadened their circle of observation and tracked the oregon to vietnam po had made a few calls to a friend he knew in the da nang police department and learned that a c had left da nang for bhutan a few more calls and some wired bribes had led him to a rumor that the group that had stolen the statue was on their way to tibet po was a chinese police officer and tibet was a chinese region so po had decided to follow the trail flying from macau to chengdu he had arrived on the last flight in gonggar yesterday evening by the time hed arrived at the office of the public security bureau tibets police force it was closed so hed checked into a hotel and waited for morning this morning was chaotic in lhasa but hed managed to meet with the chief of police and requisitioned half a dozen men to help his investigation before the street fighting escalated by now hed figured out which of the band members had been the ringleader the memory of cabrillos face on the tape from the single security camera that had worked had burned a hole in his brain that only death or insanity would erase po set out to see if he could find his targethe had no idea of the impending war as po and the other policemen loaded into a large sixpassenger truck to scour lhasa the chinese military officers were beginning to realize the gravity of the situation they started to assemble to exert control over the city and crush the rebel forces the dungkar started their plan in motion as well time was of the essence and cabrillo had none to spare for a man that had been yanked from sleep bound and transported south to the airport under guard legchog zhuren was surprisingly belligerent cabrillo had first tried to appeal to zhurens sense of goodness asking him just to explain the procedure for the poison gas and where the stockpiles were located but zhuren had spit in his face and puffed up his chest it was obvious that goodness was not a quality zhuren cherished tape him cabrillo said up until this second cabrillo had tried to show respect by allowing zhuren to simply sit in the chair in front of himnow it was time to learn what he needed and for that the chinese leader would need to be secured seng and gannon wrapped his arms and legs with duct tape and secured him to the chair prepare the juice cabrillo said to huxley what are you zhuren started to say i asked you nice cabrillo said to help me save both the chinese in tibet as well as the tibetan nationals you didnt seem to want to cooperate we have a little serum that will help to loosen your tongue trust me youll tell us everything from your first conscious memory to the last time you had sex the only problem is this we cannot always get the dosage right too much and we erase your memory like a wet cloth across a chalkboard usually we gradually increase the dosage to try and avoid thatbut youre a prick so i think well bypass that step youre lying zhuren said in a voice showing fear ms huxley cabrillo said twenty ccs in the lieutenants arm please huxley walked over to where the chinese army lieutenant was still bound to his chair she squirted some of the liquid in the air until she had the correct amount then with her other hand wiped an alcohol swab across his upper arm then plunged the needle into a vein cabrillo watched the second hand of his watch as fifteen seconds passed name and where you were born please cabrillo said the lieutenant rattled off the information like his tongue was on fire what is the total troop strength inside lhasa there were eightyfour hundred approximate troops the lieutenant said just over six thousand were sent north toward mongolia that leaves around twentyfour hundred of those some two hundred fifty were sick or injured the remaining troops are company s company l thats enough cabrillo said i dont mind the lieutenant said smiling we have the following armor four t thats fine cabrillo said zhuren stared at the lieutenant in horror ms huxley cabrillo said slowly prepare one hundred ccs zhuren started talking and it was nearly a half hour before he finished cabrillo was scanning the notes of zhurens disclosures he turned to seng pointed out a spot on the map and then examined a satellite photograph of the area i want to lead this one myself he said slowly ill need a dozen men air cover and some way to destroy the gas sir i inventoried the hangar gannon said there were a pair of fuelair cluster bombs in the ordnance room that should do it cabrillo said stanley ho might own a mansion in macau and bear all the earmarks of legitimacy but the fact was that he was really only one step away from streetlevel thug once he realized that winston spenser had screwed him on the golden buddha his every waking minute since had been used in scheming to settle the score it was not just that spenser had ripped him offthat was one thing it was the fact that he had dealt with spenser so many times in the past that spenser had smiled in his face then stabbed him in the back to ho that meant that spenser had been toying with him that all the art dealers goodnatured asskissing and pandering had been merely a prelude to the big screw ho had been treated like a dupeand he hated that most of all ho had personally gone down to the macau immigration office to bribe the clerk that had given him a list of everyone who had exited the country the day after the robbery with that in hand it had just been a case of eliminating all the improbabilities until ho had gotten down to just three people then he had sent three men hired from the local triad leader to singapore los angeles and asunción paraguay the first two had been washes the parties had been observed and disqualified and the men were called back ho was starting to think that maybe hed need to expand the search that he had somehow eliminated spenser from the first cut by accident he was beginning to think this would take longer than hed planned just then his fax started printing and a picture came across ho was staring at the photograph when his telephone rang yes or no a voice with a rough chinese accent asked ho stared a second longer then smiled his hands and his head he said quietly pack them in ice and overnight them the telephone went dead in his ear paraguay in general and asunción in particular is more european feeling than south american the massive stone buildings and extensive parks with fountains scream vienna not rio spenser tossed some feed purchased from a machine nearby toward the pigeons then wiped the cold sweat from his forehead the fact is a man who commits a crime is never freeeven if it seems he pulled it off the abiding knowledge of his infraction is never far from his mind and it weighs on his psyche and holding it inside only makes it worse only the sociopath feels no remorsethe events happened to another if they ever happened at all spenser brushed the last of the feed from his hand watched as the birds fought over the morsels then stood up it was late afternoon he decided to return to his anonymous hotel and nap before going out for a late dinner tomorrow he would start looking for a house to rent and begin to rebuild his life tonight his plan was to eat sleep and try to forget the art dealer was not a stupid man he knew ho would scour the earth for him right now however spenser was just trying to put that all out of his mind he had a few days at least he thought before the trail here might be detected if it ever was that would give him time to move out of the capital into the countryside there he would eventually make friends who could help warn him if people started poking around and hide him if they came too close at this instant in time however his guard was down and he was weary tomorrow he could worrytonight he would have a fine argentine steak and an entire bottle of red wine crossing through the park he started down the cobblestone street leading up the hill toward the hotel the sidewalk was deserted most people were taking their midday break that gave him comfort he was humming i left my heart in san francisco as he strolled along halfway up the block he saw the awning leading to the street from his hotel spenser was still humming when a side door onto the sidewalk swung open and a garrote was slipped over his head and he gagged over his verse with lightning speed the triad killed and dragged spenser inside a garden at the rear of a home facing the street the occupants of the home were out of town but that was of little matter to the killerhad they been unfortunate enough to be home he would have killed them too four days passed before the remains of spensers body were found it was minus the hands and the head but the arms had been carefully folded across his chest and the canadian passport tucked into his belt truitt stared at the water as the turboprop made a final approach for landing at the kiribati capital city of tarawa the water was a light sapphire color with coral reefs clearly visible beneath the surface fishermen in small canoes and outboardmotored crafts plied the waters while a blackhulled tramp steamer was tied alongside the dock at the main port it looked like a scene out of south pacific the plane was not crowded just truitt a single chubby male islander who had yet to stop smiling and a load of cargo in the rear the inside of the cabin smelled like salt sand and the aroma of light mold that seemed to permeate everything in the tropics it was hot inside the plane and humid and truitt dabbed a handkerchief to his forehead the pilot lined up for a landing on the dirt strip then eased the plane down a bump the feeling of the brakes slowing the aircraft to a crawl then a slow taxi to the concreteblock terminal building truitt watched out the window as the plane stopped in front of the terminal then felt a rush of humid flowerscented air as the pilot walked back and lowered the door the islander climbed down first and walked toward a woman holding a pair of smiling children in her arms while truitt grabbed his overnight bag from the seat behind then he rose and walked down the steps the presidents of kiribati and tuvalu were waiting the attorney hired by halpert sat on the rear deck of the spacious mountain chalet in the distance across a meadow with a stone fence marking the borders and a haystack leaving no doubt as to the purpose of the land a darkhaired man adjusted a portable propanefueled heater then sat down in a chair across the table marc forne molne the head of government of andorra was kindly but direct you may relay to your principals that i sincerely appreciate the investment in my countrywe always welcome finding a home for fine companies however the simple fact is this even if they had not chosen to base their operations here our vote would have gone toward a free tibet molne rose again and adjusted the flame higher opposition against tyranny and oppression is an andorran legacy molne brushed a drop of water from his hands you tell your men they have our vote and you also tell them if they need anything else they need but ask the attorney rose from his chair thank you sir he said i will report back to them immediately molne motioned with his hand and a butler appeared out of nowhere show this man to my office he ordered he needs to use the telephone two hours later truitt had forged an agreement a pair of trusts one for each nation because the population of kiribati was just over they received million tuvalu with a population of received million another million was dedicated for development of ecotourism on the two chains of islands to promote tourism the two countries decided on a series of small island resorts where the natives would act as guides scubadiving masters and overseers the planned stilt homes would be selfservice the tourists could clean their own rooms truitt caught the last flight out on easter day hanley was staring at a satellite image of tibet as he spoke on the telephone youre sure murph he asked hes fit to fly it was like magic murphy said over the secure line gurt looks better than before he was shot hes outside doing repairs on the chopper as we speak hold on hanley said from the oregon ill call off the cavalry reaching for a scrambled radio he called the rescue helicopter stop where you are hanley said and wait if my fuel calculations are correct you should have more than half tanks right now wait until you see the other bell pass nearby then follow her home to gonggar understand the pilot answered whats the eta theyre about an hour away hanley noted but ill monitor the situation and report to you when they are near were touching down now the pilot said and standing by in washington dc handsoff was becoming handson langston overholt sat in a room off the oval office waiting for the president to reappear truitt had notified hanley of his successful mission hanley had faxed the details to cabrillo in tibet once that was done he had telephoned overholt and reported the news overholt then made his way to the white house to report to the president for someone who was supposed to be outside the loop the president said entering the room im as wrapped up in this as a kitten in a yarn ball it was early morning in washington and the president had been preparing for bed when he had been summoned he was dressed in gray sweatpants and a blue tshirt he was drinking a glass of orange juice he stared at overholt then grinned you must know i stay up late and watch saturday night live dont all politicians sir overholt asked probably the president said it was always the rumor that it cost gerald ford the election how did it go sir overholt asked qatar was a gimme he said easily me

minutes ill instruct the ambassador to the united nations to call for a special vote in the morning the president said if your guys can hold down the fort for six hours or so were home free ill notify them immediately sir overholt said rising good the president said then im going to catch a few hours of shuteye a secret service agent led overholt down the elevator and into the secret tunnel twenty minutes later he was in his car and on his way back to langley the white cargo plane slowed to a stop at the end of the runway in vientiane then taxied over to a parking area and shut down the engines once everything was shut down the pilot began the process of raising the entire nose cone in the air opening up the immense cargo area once the nose was in the air cargo ramps were attached to a slot in the open front of the fuselage then one by one cars were driven out onto the tarmac the first was a limegreen plymouth superbird with a hemiengine the second a ford mustang boss in yellow with the shaker hood rear slats over the window and the quartermile clock in the dashboard the third was a pontiac gto convertible red with a black interior redline tires and air conditioning the last was a corvette in greenwood green with the factory speed package and locking rear differential the man who carefully removed the cars from inside the was of medium height with thick brown hair as soon as the last car the corvette was on the runway he reached into the glove box removed a letter then climbed out and lit up a camel filter you must be the general he said to a man approaching followed by a dozen soldiers yes the general said im keith lowden the man said i was told to give you this the general scanned the letter folded it and placed it in his rear pants pocket these all original they are lowden said the serial numbers all match lowden then motioned to the general to walk over to the superbird and started explaining the car the documentation and the rare options by the time lowden had finished with the second car the boss the general stopped him you want he started to say just as lowdens cell phone rang sorry lowden said as he answered he listened for a minute then turned to the general they want to know if its a deal he said placing his hand over the telephone the general nodded his head in the affirmative he said okay lowden said a second later he hung up the telephone and turned back to the general now what were you about to ask me i was wondering if you had time to spend the night here in my country the general said so we might talk about the cars i dont know lowden said smiling this country have any beer some of the best the general said smiling back good lowden said cause you cant talk cars when youre thirsty po and his team were searching throughout lhasa but they had yet to turn up a single us or european citizen the six members of his team were all tibetan and po didnt care for them much first of all like most people he hated traitorsand any way you sliced it tibetans that worked for the psb had sold out to the chinese in the second part the men appeared lazy they did the questioning in a haphazard fashion and didnt seem to be committed to finding the people po was seeking thirdly for being members of the countrys crack police service they didnt seem to have much training in police procedures po for his part had little choice so he doubled his own efforts and hoped for the best the sonofabitches cabrillo said angrily its like putting an atomic bomb in the vatican zhuren had just given them the site of the poison gas it was in potala the home of the dalai lama and one of the most sacred of structures in all of tibet the chinese plan was evil but ingenious potala sat on a hill outside of town if one waited until the winds were right you could blanket lhasa in a matter of minutes seng nodded then reached for his beeping radio go ahead oregon he said is cabrillo there with you hold on seng said handing him the radio juan hanley said quickly we have the votes all you need to do is keep it together for another few hours and help will be on the way whats the latest on the russians cabrillo asked theyre five hours from the mongoliantibetan border hanley said staring at the large monitor on the wall give or take call and have them slow the tank column down cabrillo said if they reach the border before the vote we could have world war three on our hands ill do it hanley said now whats happening on the ground i just found out the chinese have one last trick up their sleeve cabrillo said a doomsday gas do you know the location and type hanley said cabrillo rattled off the chemical composition well get to work here figuring out how to render the gas inert hanley said good cabrillo said that frees me up to pinpoint the exact location somehow hanley said i knew you were going to say that theoregon was surging into the bay of bengal in preparation for the teams extraction word of the street fighting in lhasa had reached the news media television crews newspaper and magazine reporters and radio teams were making final preparations to enter the country to maintain the veil of secrecy necessary for the corporation to conduct business they needed to be away from tibet before the reporters appeared so far the plan had worked like clockwork but there was still a wild card to contend with the russian ruse had successfully tied up the chinese army far to the north but the risk now was from the chinese air force if beijing ordered squadrons of bombers and fighter planes to attack the country the results would be catastrophic the dungkar forces had limited means to wage groundtoair warfare carpet bombing of lhasa would result in heavy losses the only hope was if the news media could shine the beacon of truth on china if the world could be shown via television that the tibetans had overthrown their oppressors on their own and that the control of tibet was in the hands of the people and their divine leader the dalai lama then any bombing by china would be taken for what it wasa senseless act of brutality the ensuing worldwide condemnation would be a burden even china could not bear hanley placed a call to bhutan and ordered the c to prepare to evacuate his team climber one murphy said to rescue gurt was steering the bell above a mountain plain with jagged peaks to each side several miles in the distance the rescue helicopter was visible on the ground as murphy watched through his binoculars the rotor blade started to spin then gain speed until it was just a blur rescue one the radio squawked we have visual and will follow along murphy watched as the helicopter lifted into a high hover then slowly began to move forward passing to one side murphy craned his head to the rear and confirmed they were in formation behind and to one side how are you feeling he said over the intercom to gurt my shoulder feels like ive been kicked by a mule he noted but all in all im not doing too bad id like to know what gampo gave you murphy said some ancient tibetan potion gurt said staring at the gauges i just hope it lasts i spoke to the oregon murphy said one of the backup pilots will fly you back to bhutan heck of a deal gurt said i thought i was a goner me too old buddy murphy said quietly me too for the chinese the battle for lhasa was all but over they had lost the initiative when king stopped the movement of the armored column from that point on the dungkar forces had been seized by a rage that showed no boundaries teams under the leadership of general rimpoche had spread out through lhasa rounding up chinese troops in their barracks and elsewhere the war for the motor pool was bloody but after forty minutes of fierce fighting the dungkar had taken control this was all the red paint available in town a dungkar warrior said as he slid to a stop inside the fenced yard of the motor pool general rimpoche was sitting in the passenger seat of a chinese jeep with a bloody bandage wrapped around his lower leg a redhot chunk of shrapnel from a fragmentary grenade had hit him as he was leading the last charge in the battle mark the captured armored personnel carriers and the three remaining tanks with the dalai lamas symbol he said coughing then alert our forces that these vehicles are under our control the man scurried off to fulfill the request while at the same time his aide approached ive found a dozen men with at least basic knowledge of how to drive the aide said we can have the vehicles on the streets of the city as soon as they are painted good rimpoche said we need to show were in control right at that instant he heard a helicopter approaching from gonggar he watched as it passed overhead and headed for potala detective po and his tibetan underlings had just escaped a mob of tibetans intent on capturing them po was now on the outskirts of lhasa at the east end of the city more and more he was considering his mission a failure either there was no one answering the description of the people he sought or the tibetans he and his men had questioned were lying but the situation went deeper than that in the last half hour po had felt the tide turn more and more he was feeling like the hunted not the hunter his last call to the public security bureau had gone unanswered and although it might be a figment of his imagination he was thinking the tibetans assigned to help him had begun eyeing him differently right then a helicopter flew overhead and slowed to touch down on the flats below potala stop the truck po ordered the driver slowed and stopped the helicopter was only two hundred yards away and the skids had just touched the ground straining to watch with his binoculars po waited until the dust from the rotor wash had cleared and the occupants climbed out the leader of the group was wearing a helmet and he was pointing out a spot on the palace grounds to the other men who had climbed out at that instant po saw the man remove a portable telephone from his belt then he removed the helmet to hear po stared through the binoculars the mans hair was worn in a short blond crew cut but his face was familiar po watched youre sure max cabrillo asked i just received confirmation said hanley a thousand miles away on the oregon good im going in cabrillo said the media is on their way hanley said and the dalai lama has already left india both are due to arrive in lhasa in just over an hour we need you all out of there posthaste ive dispatched the c from thimbu and seng is rounding everyone up just get this doneand get out of there all i can say is that youd better have some beer on board that plane cabrillo said laughing bet on it hanley said the smile the smile was the same as that of the man on the tape po slid the binoculars back in the case and turned to the driver to potala fly the cargo to that level and unload it cabrillo said pointing to a stark white center section of the palace then start searching ill meet you on the courtyard that abuts the taller section the dungkar in charge of the detail nodded im going to take the stair and search the lower levels cabrillo said removing a small portable oxygen tank from inside the helicopter and strapping it on his back he attached a nose clip turned on the flow of oxygen then started up the stairs a few minutes later the helicopter lifted off the flats and dropped off the dungkar and cargo four minutes later the truck carrying po and the public security bureau members slid to a stop at the bottom of the stairs po unholstered his pistol and followed by the others started up the stairs cabrillo disappeared out of sight in the first structure bordering the stairs the helicopter now empty parked on the flats near the truck the pilot noticed the truck and radioed the oregon it has markings from the public security bureau he said ill call cabrillo hanley said but i wouldnt worry about it right now were receiving sporadic radar returns here we have yet to determine the source watch overhead george adams had stopped and refueled the chinese attack helicopter twice chuck gunderson still had half a tank for the most part their mission so far had been quiet gunderson had been called in to monitor the fighting at the motor pool but the dungkar had gained control fast enough that they never needed his makeshift gunship adams had yet to locate a clear target to fire upon in the last twenty minutes the situation had changedother than a few pockets of smallarms fire in the city it appeared that lhasa was now firmly under dungkar control both men could see the transformation clearly from the airthe war was almost over gorgeous george this is tiny gunderson said over the radio hey chuckie george said you as bored as i am im telling you gunderson started to say this is climber one murphy said a trio meaning three chinese fighters just blew past me and rescue one we are fifty miles out of lhasa inbound for gonggar all corporation members this is the oregon hanley said we have detected three chinese fighters inbound from the northern theater assume them as unfriendly prepare to take cover all offensive forces report in now predator ready lincoln said from his remote station in bhutan attack one ready adams said gunship one ready gunderson said im sorry people hanley said they must have slipped in low under the radar we now have intermittent returns and expect arrival in minutes the three fighters roared down the canyon from the north toward lhasa cabrillo was in a large prayer room with small rooms to each side he was searching each room one at a time but the going was slow po and his team had made it up the stairs po paused outside the door with his pistol in the air and peered inside then seeing no one he crept inside cabrillo was searching through a large stack of wooden crates in a storeroom his attention was focused on locating the poison gas so he was unaware that po and his men were outside the crates contained scrolls old textbooks and documents wiping his hands he walked out po was standing outside the door with his pistol trained on cabrillos chest the six members of the public security bureau carried rifles which they pointed at him as well cabrillo smiled morning men he said easily just changing the filters in the furnace this old palace can get a mite drafty when it snows im detective ling po from the macau constabulatory and youre under arrest for theft and murder murder cabrillo said quietly i didnt kill anyone your little buddha theft and the subsequent escape left three chinese citizens dead do you mean when the chinese navy attacked my boat cabrillo said they started it right at that instant the first fighter plane passed over lhasa and all hell broke out murphys warning gave adams and gunderson just enough time to prepare adams clung to the side of a mountain west of lhasa pointing his tail boom toward the fighters gunderson clung to the mountains on the east side with the minigun ready to fire the predator was in a slow orbit over gonggar ready to protect the area the fighters passed over lhasa and unleashed their chain guns killing scores of tibetans then they continued toward the airport a minute or so later the fighters neared gonggar and the antiaircraft guns opened fire flying through flak the lead fighter pilot passed over the airport then made a sweeping left turn back toward lhasa slowly a helicopter appeared against the mountain then a puff of smoke and a flaming spear emerged from under the fuselage adams watched the video camera and made adjustments as the missile streaked toward the fighter hed aimed for the main fuselage what he hit was a wing the pilot ejected and adams saw a chute open in a textbook maneuver the second fighter pilot had broken right he was racing back toward lhasa when a target showed on his radar scope off his left wing before he could react a chinese cargo plane appeared confused for a second by the appearance of a seemingly friendly force the pilot hesitated firing open up gunderson shouted to the rear the tibetan gunner let loose with a volley that stitched the side of the fighter like a shotgun blast to the gut of a duck the man kept firing even after the plane passed from view i think you got him gunderson shouted back hold off gunderson made a sweeping turn and caught a glimpse as the flaming wreckage spun into a mountain there was no ejection no salvation as soon as the third fighter realized they were being fired upon he made a steep climb straight up in the air the predator was hot on his tail fire four lincoln said over the radio as he blew off all his remaining missiles at once the jet raced into the heavens but the lighter and smaller missiles were faster the tibetans on the ground watched as the white contrail from the jet made a straight line up into the sky two sets of twin tendrils of steam followed then high over lhasa a fireball erupted the three fighters would fight no more go see what that was po ordered one of the tibetans the man walked out and stared down at the city then walked back inside planes attacking was all he said when he returned thats the chinese retaking the city po said in a few minutes just then cabrillos telephone rang so he answered it excuse me he said to po holding his hand over the receiver right cabrillo said okay good no not yet there has been a slight snag there is a macau policeman here thats po slid his pistol in his holster and batted the telephone to the floor you shouldnt have done that cabrillo said i didnt buy the extended warranty po was enraged his control was slipping and he needed it back now on the oregon hanley was still listening to the open line against the wall po said dragging cabrillo against a stone wall then stepping back cabrillo stood there the realization of what was happening slowly dawning what do you think po he spat that youre judge jury and executioner men po said line up the tibetans formed a firing line their rifles at their shoulders on the oregon eric stone was next to hanley listening in sir he said what can we do hanley raised his hand to quiet him on behalf of the macau authorities po said i have heard your admission of guilt and find you guilty of murder your sentence is death by firing squad at this time and place stone looked in horror at hanley whose face remained impassive do you have any last words or pleas po asked yes cabrillo said i ask that you stop this nonsense immediatelythere is a deadly gas somewhere in this palace and if i dont find it soon we all will die enough of your lies po thundered men prepare to fire cabrillo brushed his hand along his crewcut hair then smiled and winked fire po shouted a volley of shots rang out and the prayer room was filled with the scent of gunpowder there they are the leader of the dungkar detail said three stainlesssteel canisters were marked with chinese symbols the dungkar erected the apparatus to burn off the gas then started to dress in gas masks and rubber gloves the gas had been right where zhuren had said has anyone seen the american the dungkar leader asked the answer came back negative slowly and carefully start to destroy the gas the leader said im going downstairs to report the smoke cleared and cabrillo was still standing one of the public security bureau officers reached over and took pos handgun from his holster then he did a quick patdown search to look for other weapons you missed cabrillo said wiping a fleck of blood off his cheek from where a chip of stone had struck stone looked over at hanley who smiled the tibetans are with us he explained they have been all along stone raised his arms in the air in exasperation no one tells me anything he said cabrillo was walking over to pick up his telephone when the dungkar leader burst into the room he stared at the scene in shock against the far wall was a large outline of a man that had been made by the bullets striking the stone five psb officers were standing with rifles while a lone psb officer was placing another man in handcuffs we found the gas the dungkar blurted out were burning it off now cabrillo bent down and retrieved the telephone max he said did you hear that i did juan hanley said now get the hell out of there cabrillo folded the telephone in half and slid it in his pocket norquay i assume he asked the leader of the psb officers yes sir the officer answered assist the dungkar with the destruction of the gas cabrillo said then secure potala general rimpoche will be in contact with you soonthanks for your help norquay nodded to a free tibet cabrillo shouted to a free tibet the men answered cabrillo began walking toward the door sir norquay said theres just one more thing cabrillo paused what do you want us to do with him norquay said motioning to po cabrillo smiled let him go cabrillo reached for the door handle but take his uniform and papers hes just too emotional to be a policeman then cabrillo walked out the door climbed down the steps and boarded the helicopter five minutes later he was back at gonggar airport ten minutes later he and his team were airborne in the c they passed the fleet of leased helicopters in the air headed for bhutan and the pilot of the c wagged his wings the helicopters returned the goodbye by flicking on their landing lights then the team settled in for the short flight soon theyd be back on the oregon in beijing news of the events in tibet was filtering in and a hurried meeting was held president jintao was direct what are our options he asked we could send bombers to hit lhasa the head of the chinese air force said then ready paratroopers for a later assault but that leaves us short on the mongolian border jintao noted whats the latest intelligence on the russian movements the head of chinese intelligence was a short man with a pronounced belly he adjusted his glasses before speaking the russian forces are enough for them to sweep down and flank our troops that are currently still headed down the pass into qinghai province if they supported their efforts with air power we could lose both qinghai and xinjiang provinces basically the entire western frontier that would give them control of our secret advanced weapons facilities at lop nur plus a good portion of our space program jintao said wearily im afraid so sir the head of intelligence noted okay jintao started to say before his aide rushed into the room and walked over and whispered in his ear gentlemen president jintao said continue discussionsi have an emergency meeting the russian ambassador is insisting we talk and has arrived ahead of his scheduled meeting the russian ambassador was waiting in an outer office he rose as jintao walked into the room mr president he said solicitously i apologize for moving up the time of our meeting but the president of my country insisted i see you immediately do you come bringing a declaration of war jintao asked directly motioning the russian to take a seat on a couch near a window with a view of the outer gardens the russian ambassador sat on the left end of the couch jintao farther down on the right no mr president the russian ambassador said straightening his suit pants i come with a business offer that can put an end to the tension between our countries as well as placing your economy on solid footing again jintao stared at his watch before answering you have five minutes the russian ambassador explained it all in four so you are convinced you can pull a un security council vote jintao said after he was through we can the russian said what do we get if we go along with the vote jintao asked if china votes to go along the russian ambassador smiled world peace i was thinking of a larger percentage of the field two minutes later the russian had his offer mr president he said allow me to make a telephone call tell them i want your armored column stopped immediately jintao said confirmed by satellite reconnaissance eight minutes later the new percentages would be confirmed and the russian armored column would grind to a halt further negotiations would continue right up until the un vote at the same instant the russian ambassador was calling moscow the c containing the corporation team was crossing into india off the right wing the jet carrying the dalai lama home passed the pilot of the jet wagged his wings and the pilot of the c reciprocated less than an hour later the team reached calcutta india and was met by the corporations amphibious airplane within minutes of the c touching down the crew was being flown out to the ship by sundown on march the oregon was steaming south in the bay of bengal on the deck hanley and cabrillo watched the setting sun i got a call from overholt after you left calcutta hanley said im sure it was the usual cabrillo said rah rah good job the check is in the mail he did mention that and a wire transfer that halpert has already confirmed what else cabrillo asked he has another job for us hanley said where cabrillo asked the land of the midnight sun mr chairman hanley said the arctic circle cabrillo sniffed the salt air then began walking for the hatch inside come on you can explain over dinner it had better be dinner and drinks hanley said i havent had a cocktail since cuba cuba cabrillo said wearily seems like years ago epilogue there exist snippets of history etched into the fabric of time and so perfectly formed that they may never be duplicated seemingly scripted by a power with perfect timing and blessed with scenes that know no bounds these moments exist to be captured on film to be remembered and cherished for centuries to come these snippets do not happen often they are as rare as the perfect turn on skis as delightful as homemade ice cream in the hot sun they exist to remind man there is hope they exist to show promise they exist for generations yet unborn the dalai lamas return to lhasa was one of these events april dawned with clear skies and no wind the snowcapped mountains surrounding the city appeared to be close enough that one could run his fingertip across the sharp crests the very air in lhasa seemed alive with energy it filled the lungs of the faithful with a hope silent for decades and soothed and cooled the fires of war unbelievable a reporter for a los angeles newspaper said quietly it was an image from shangrila potala palace was glistening like a mirage in the mind of a complicated man the hillside surrounding the palace was covered with a flowing field of red and blue blooming flowers that spilled down the hill in a waterfall of color one thousand buddhist monks in yellow robes filled the steps from top to bottom like a colored strip of dna molecules on the lower buildings parts of the green roofs were visible adding contrast while the white rocks of the structure seemed to have been scrubbed clean of dirt as a result of the cloak of oppression being lifted high overhead a hawk circled lazily on the warming air the chosen one was coming home nearly a mile away on the large flat meadow below potala a monk stepped over to a sixfoottall gong suspended from a dark carved wooden frame he glanced at the dalai lama who was sitting atop a gold gilded throne chair the throne chair was topped with a fringed silk awning supported by wooden poles at the corners and held aloft by six stout monks who walked in unison with the throne chair the six monks chanted a singleword chant and the woodandleather hammer struck the gong the sound of the gong filled the air one two until it sounded three times and then the procession started forward the ngagpa carrying the symbolic wheel of life led the column directly behind the ngagpa were tibetan horsemen their steeds decorated with ceremonial blankets whose intricate needlepoint depicted scenes from tibetan history the horsemen wove their mounts back and forth in a choreographed display of precision in their hands were triangular flags attached to long bronze staffs that were capped with fluted tops to the rear of the horsemen were two dozen archers with bows at parade rest against their shoulders they marched in perfect harmony next came a dozen porters carrying cages filled with songbirds that chirped a song of freedom and happiness the porters were followed by fiftyfive monks from the dalai lamas home monastery at namgyal they chanted in a single voice and carried in their hands the sacred texts next were more horsemen four dozen in total who were also musicians they played their flutes and stringed instruments while they steered their mounts with their knees the horsemounted musicians were followed by monks from the tsedrung order who represented the government of tibet followed by children waving thin pointed ornately colored flags that danced through the air like kites without tails to the rear of the children was another group of horsemen with serious faces dressed in tibetan army uniforms of green cloaks and red hats they steered their horses a few feet forward then stopped a few more feet then a pause again these soldiers carried the tibetan seals of state just to the rear of the soldiers carrying the seals of state were ten simple monks barefoot and dressed in yellow robes the ten monks were humming loudly the golden buddha came next it sat on a plain wagon pulled by a single horse only a few feet behind the golden buddha was the throne chair containing the dalai lama two hundred thousand tibetans lined the procession route leading to potala they massed on both sides of the cleared path through the meadow the day they had prayed and hoped for over these last decades was finally hereand they allowed their joy to wash across the land as soon as the golden buddha appeared the crowd went wild a roar erupted and the faithful prostrated themselves onto the hard soil then began to chant as one the dalai lama began passing through the crowd and witnessed the tears of joy on the cheeks of the faithful the sight filled him with happiness duty and honor and it caused him to smile following the throne chair were members of the dalai lamas inner cabinet the kasag next came the kusun depon the dalai lamas bodyguards dressed in their black padded suits and carrying their curved swords following the bodyguards was the commander in chief of the tibetan army the makchi and a platoon of soldiers the makchi and the soldiers were dressed in their ceremonial uniforms consisting of blue trousers and yellow tunics covered in gold braid they marched in slow and perfect cadence with their boots making a timed thumping sound as they struck the soil next were the dalai lamas religious tutors and teachers as well as family and friends at the rear of the procession came a wagon with a tiger in a cage followed by a single horseman holding a thirtyfoottall staff flying the formerly outlawed tibetan flag the parade was both magisterial and magnificent it was based on two thousand years of tradition and strengthened by fiftyfive years of exile the procession continued toward potala at the base of the eightyfoottall foundation wall of potala four hundred laborers had worked eight hours the night before to build a series of stone steps leading from the edge of the meadow to the top of the wall as soon as the first of the procession reached the lowest step they parted to each side like the flow of water in a stream being split by a boulder then took their positions alongside the temporary stairway once the golden buddha reached the base of the steps the ten monks walked over formed a ladder with their arms then carried the buddha up the steps and placed it on the top of the wall then they descended the stairway as the throne chair containing the dalai lama slowed and stopped at the base on a signal from the dalai lama the monks carrying the throne chair bowed down on their knees then swiveled to the side holding the throne chair only inches above the ground they waited until the dalai lama climbed off the chair onto the thick woven carpet that lay upon the ground breathing a sigh of relief as the weight was removed from the chair the monks waited until the dalai lama started up the stairs then they set the throne chair upon the ground and rose to their feet with a soul seeped in tradition and divinely inspired the dalai lama ascended the stairway reaching the top he slowly turned and stared out at the crowd the mass of humanity stretched across the meadow and onto the surrounding hillsides he bowed his head then closed his eyes for a moment then he spoke i have missed you he said simply the crowd so subdued only seconds before once again erupted into cheers twenty minutes would pass before it quieted down enough for the dalai lama to speak again
