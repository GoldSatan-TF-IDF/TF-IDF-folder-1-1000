david morrell desperate measures one the pistol a colt semiautomatic was capable of holding seven rounds in its magazine but at the moment it held only one which pittman fed into the firing chamber by pulling back the slide on top of the weapon the welloiled metal made a smooth snicking sound fourteen years earlier when pittman had written his first newspaper story it had been about a retired policeman who had committed suicide pittman had never forgotten a conversation he had overheard the respectful tones with which two patrolmen at a coffee machine in their precinct headquarters had referred to their former comrades death poor bastard couldnt stand retirement drinking problem wife left him went out with style used his backup guna semiautomatic colt just one round in it the reference had puzzled pittman until he did some research and learned that when fired a semiautomatic pistol ejected the used empty cartridge and chambered a new one the hammer recocked itself this feature made rapid firing possible during an emergency but the retired policeman who had shot himself had evidently considered it unethical to leave a loaded cocked weapon next to his body after his suicide there was no way to predict who would find his body his landlady perhaps or her tenyearold son who might foolishly pick up the gun so to avoid the danger that someone might later get hurt the retired policeman had put only one round in the weapon he knew that after the bullet was discharged the slide would remain back the firing chamber empty the weapon completely safe went out with style thus pittman too put only one round in his pistol weeks earlier hed applied for a permit to have a firearm in his apartment this afternoon after the authorities had determined that pittman wasnt a felon had never been in a mental institution because of violent behavior et cetera he had been allowed to go to the sportinggoods store and take possession of the pistol a the same as the retired policemans the clerk had asked how many boxes of ammunition he wanted pittman had responded that one would definitely be more than sufficient i guess that means youre just going to keep it at home for protection huh yes protection pittman had said from nightmares he had silently added in his small thirdfloor apartment with the door locked he now sat at his narrow kitchen table studied the cocked pistol and listened to the din of evening traffic outside the clock on the stove made a whirring sound one of its mechanical numbers changing from to he heard dehumanized laughter from a television situation comedy vibrate through the wall behind him he smelled fried onions the odor seeping under his door from an apartment down the hall he picked up the weapon although he had never been trained to handle firearms he had done his customary research he had also read about the anatomy of the human skull its soft spots the temples the hollows behind the ears and the roof of the mouth were the most obviously vulnerable pittman had read about wouldbe suicides who had shot themselves in the head only to give themselves a lobotomy instead of killing themselves although infrequent it most often happened when the barrel was aimed toward the side of the forehead squeezing the trigger evidently caused the barrel to move slightly away from the temple the bullet struck and was deflected by the thick plate of bone above the eyebrows the wouldbe suicide became a vegetable not me pittman thought he meant to do this completely the retired policeman whose example he followed had chosen to place the barrel of his gun inside his mouthno way of flinching and moving the barrel away from its targetand he had chosen an extremely powerful handgun a pittman had gotten a drink at a bar on the way to the sportinggoods store and at two other bars on the way back home he kept a bottle of jack daniels in the cupboard next to the refrigerator but he had not had anything to drink since he had locked his door behind him he didnt want anyone to think on the basis of a medical examiners report that drunkenness had led him to behave irrationally more he wanted to be clearheaded he wanted to approach his last act with maximum focus a question of procedure occurred to him how could he justify the mess he would make by process of elimination he had decided that his selfinflicted death would have to be by means of a bullet but here at the kitchen table his blood on the wood the floor the refrigerator possibly the ceiling pittman shook his head stood held the carefully and walked toward the bathroom he concentrated to maintain his balance climbed into the bathtub pulled the shower curtain closed sat down in the cold white tub and now he was ready thes gun oil smelled sweet as he brought the pistol toward his mouth he opened his lips felt a moments revulsion then placed the hard greasy barrel within his mouth the barrel was wider than he had anticipated he had to stretch the corners of his mouth the bittertasting metal scraped against his bottom front teeth making him shiver now he had thought about nothing except his suicide ever since he had applied for the permit to buy his gun the waiting period had given him a chance to test his resolve he had exhausted every argument for and against he had been in such emotional agony that every portion of his brain screamed for release for an end to his pain he tightened his finger on the trigger but the triggers resistance was more than he had expected he had to squeeze harder the phone rang he frowned the phone rang again he tried to concentrate the phone rang a third time pittman wanted desperately to ignore it but as the phone persisted he reluctantly realized that he would have to answer it this decision had nothing to do with second thoughts a need to give himself time to change his mind rather it was a need to be thorough a man of principle he had promised himself that he would leave no loose endsno debts unpaid no favors unreturned no slights unapologized his will was in order his slim assets going to his exwife along with a note of explanation his work obligations had ended yesterday the conclusion of the two weeks notice he had given his employer he had even arranged for his funeral then who would be phoning him he wondered a wrong number a salesman what if there was some final detail to which he had not attended he had done his best to round off his life the phone kept ringing he got out of the tub and went into the living room grudgingly picking up the phone hello it was such an effort to speak matt this is burt there wasnt any need for burt to identify himself his cigarette smokeravaged throat made his distinctive voice constantly hoarse and gravelly you took so long i wasnt sure you were home in that case why did you let the phone keep ringing your answering machine wasnt on burt said even when its on im sometimes home well how would i know that if you never answered pittman felt detached from the conversation as if drugged what do you want burt a favor sorry cant do it dont turn me down till you hear the favor it doesnt make a burt were even we dont owe each other anything lets leave it at that you make it sound like just because you quit well never see each other again hey well keep owing each other plenty yesterday was your last day so you probably havent heard they gave us the word this morning the chronicle will close its doors a week from friday burts voice seemed to come from far away pittman felt groggy what we realized the newspaper was in bad shape not this bad though bankrupt couldnt find a buyer indepth stories cant compete with tv news and usa today so the owners are liquidating nine days from now after a hundred and thirtyeight years the final issue hits the stands i still dont i want you to come back to work matt we were understaffed to begin with now look ive spent thirty years of my life on the chronicle i dont want it to go out like its garbage please come back and give me a hand its just nine days matt the obit departments as important as any department weve got next to the comics and the sports thats what most readers turn to first i dont have time to break in a new guy and i couldnt find one anyhow not when were going to be out of business a week from friday and some bastards are taking off work looking for other jobs be a buddy matt if not for me for the paper hell you worked here fourteen years you must have some feeling for this place pittman stared at the floor matt pittmans muscles cramped from emotional pain matt are you there pittman studied his gun your timings lousy burt but will you do it you dont know what youre asking sure i do for you to be my friend damn you burt pittman set down the phone in anguish he waited for it to ring again but it stayed silent he set down the pistol went over to the bourbon bottle next to the refrigerator and poured himself a drink no ice no water he quickly drank it and poured himself another under the circumstances it struck pittman as ironic that he worked in the obituary department of a dying newspaper his desk one of many separated by waisthigh partitions was on the fourth floor across from and midway between the elevator and the mens room although the chronicle was understaffed movement and noise surrounded pittman people walking phones ringing reporters answering computer keyboards being tapped arts and entertainment was behind him home tips on his left the community service calendar on his right he felt a gray haze distance him from everything you look awful matt pittman shrugged you been sick a little whats happening to the chronicle will make you even sicker yeah so i heard the tubby man from business placed both hands on the front of pittmans desk and loomed down maybe you also heard the damned pension might be in trouble and but how could you have heard i forgot you quit two days ago saw it coming huh gotta give you credit hope you made a deal a few weeks extra pay or no pittman cleared his throat actually i didnt know anything about it then why i just got tired the man looked blank tired what are you doing back here pittman was having grave difficulty concentrating came back to help only a week from tomorrow everything will be over then already the time felt as if it would be an eternity well if i were you and i had money in the bankwhich i assume you must have or you wouldnt have quiti wouldnt be wasting my time here id be looking for another job pittman didnt know what to say to that the tubby man leaned so close to pittmans desk that his open sport coat covered the phone which suddenly rang in surprise the man peered down toward the hidden source of the ringing he straightened pittman picked up the phone the call from what sounded like a middleaged woman her voice strained with emotion was about a seventyfiveyearold man pittman guessed it was the womans father who had died at his home pittman reached for a form and wrote down the deceaseds full name did you wish to specify the cause of death excuse me the woman sounded breathy as if shed been crying this has been such a strain what do you mean specify did you wish to be exact and say why he died maam perhaps you wish to say after a lengthy illness or perhaps you dont wish to give any cause of death at all he had cancer the statement struck pittman as if an icy blade had knocked him off balance unprepared he suddenly had mental images of jeremy robust with thick long windblown red hair playing football frail hairless dead in an equipmentcrammed room in a hospital intensivecare unit im sorry what pittmans throat constricted i lost a son to cancer im sorry an awkward pause made the line seem to hum a lengthy illness the woman said dont say he had cancer other details surviving relatives former occupation time and place for the funeral donations pittman asked for what i dont understand sometimes close relatives of the deceased prefer that instead of flowers a donation be sent to a favorite charity in this case perhaps the cancer society but wouldnt that be the same as saying he had cancer yes i suppose it would a lengthy illness my father died from a lengthy illness i dont want to get involved in the rest of it if i mention the cancer society every charity in town will be calling me is that all you need dont forget to mention he belonged to the east side senior citizens bowling team ive got it pittman said in that case ill need your address but i already told you where my father lived no i need your address so the chronicle can send you a statement for printing the obituary statement yes maam you mean a bill yes maam the newspaper doesnt print obituaries as a community service no maam shit it had been a mistake pittman realized he hadnt imagined the intense effort that it would take for him to go through the motions to pretend to be committed to his job even the simplest gestures picking up his phone writing notes required an exertion of will that left him as exhausted as the marathons he used to run before jeremy became ill he took four more calls each requiring a greater effort each more draining death by car accident drowning hanging and old age hanging had been a method pittman had considered when hed been a reporter research on one of his stories had taught him that in males hanging was rumored to have erotic side effects its victims producing erections hanging also had the advantage of being less messy than a death by gunshot but the trouble was it wasnt instantaneous it didnt guarantee results the rope might slip or someone might find you in time to resuscitate you then youd have to go through the pain all over again someone coughed glancing up pittman saw a stocky craggyfaced man in his fifties with a brush cut and bushy eyebrows the man had his navy blazer draped over his shoulder his muscular upper arms bulging against his rolledup shirt sleeves his striped tie was loosened and the top shirt button was open exposing his bulllike neck he gave the impression that he was out of uniform that he belonged in the military but like pittman burt forsyth had never been in the military burt had worked for the chronicle since hed gotten out of college eventually becoming its editor glad you could make it burts voice was even more gravelly than it had sounded last night pittman shrugged you look beat so people keep telling me pittman said id have thought your day off would have made you look rested well i had a lot of things to do i bet burts gaze was piercingly direct does he suspect pittman wondered considering how busy you are i appreciate your making time for the chronicle for you pittman said the same thing when jeremy had gotten sick when jeremy had died when pittman had collapsed burt forsyth had always been there to provide reinforcement need to go to the hospital to see your boy take all the time you need need to stay with him in intensive care as long as you want your job dont worry about it your desk will be waiting for you burt had visited jeremy in the hospital burt had arranged for the most valuable national football league player to phone jeremy burt had escorted pittman to and from the mortuary burt had gotten drunk with pittman although pittman had tried to convince himself that he had paid back every debt the truth was that burt could never be repaid of all those who might have called last night burt was the one person pittman could not refuse burt studied him got a minute my time is yours in my office what now pittman thought is this where i get the lecture the chronicle had a no smoking policy pittman could never understand how burt managed constantly to have the recent smell of cigarette smoke on him his office reeked of it but there werent any ashtrays and there werent any cigarette butts in the wastebasket besides burts office had glass walls if he was breaking the rule and smoking in here the reporters at the desks outside would have seen him a big man burt eased himself into the swivel chair behind his desk wood creaked pittman took a chair opposite the desk burt studied him been drinking too much pittman glanced away i asked you a question burt said if you were anybody else youd tell me it was none of my business but since im the one asking have you been drinking too much depends pittman said on what you call too much burt sighed i can tell this isnt going to be a productive conversation look you asked for nine days im giving them to you but that doesnt mean you can run my life whats left of it you keep drinking as much as i think you have and youll kill yourself now thats a thought pittman said drinking wont bring back jeremy thats another thought and killing yourself wont bring him back either pittman looked away again besides im not trying to run your life burt said its your job im trying to run ive got something different i want you to do a special kind of obituary and i want to make sure youre up to doing it if youre not just say so ill keep you on the desk answering obit calls and filling out forms whatever you want i didnt hear you i came back to work because you asked if theres something you need i can do it what kind of special obituary the subject isnt dead yet pittman changed positions in the chair of course it wasnt any surprise to him although it generally was to what pittman called civilians that some obituaries were written before the subjects death aging movie stars for example celebrities of one sort or another who were mortally ailing or in extremely advanced years common sense dictated that since they were going to die soon and since they were famous why not prepare the obituary sooner rather than later on occasion the subjects were remarkably resilient pittman knew of one case where a lengthy obituary had been written for an elderly comediantwenty years earlierand the comedian in his nineties was still going strong but pittman judged from burts somber expression that he hadnt been summoned here just to write something as ephemeral as an obituary for a notyetdead movie star burts brows were so thick they made his eyes seem hoodeddark intense all right pittman gestured the subject isnt dead yet burt nodded but evidently youre convinced that he or she will be dead within nine days burts expression didnt change otherwise the obituary wont be any good pittman said because the chronicle will be dead a week from tomorrow and i never heard of other newspapers buying freelance obituaries its my gift to you gosh i dont know what to say how generous youre not fooling anybody burt said you think i havent figured out what youre planning to do pittman showed no reaction ellen phoned yesterday burt said pittman felt sudden heat in his stomach but he didnt allow himself to show any reaction to that either to the mention of his exwife she says youve been acting strangely burt said not that i need her to tell me ive got eyes in fact anybody who thinks of you as a friend has noticed youve been going around making a point of paying back favors money you borrowed whatever youve been apologizing for any harm you caused and i know its not because youre cleaning house as part of joining aa not the way youve been drinking that car accident three weeks ago three am a deserted road in jersey a bridge abutment what the hell were you doing out driving at that hour and even as drunk as you were i dont see how you couldnt have avoided that big an obstacle you meant to hit it and the only reason you didnt die is that your body was so loose from the booze you bounced like a rag doll when you were thrown from the car pittman touched a stillhealing gash on the back of his hand but didnt say anything dont you want to know what ellen wanted burt asked pittman stared at the floor come on burt demanded quit acting like youre already dead i made a mistake what coming back to work i made a mistake pittman stood dont burt said let me finish a reporter appeared in the doorway in a minute burt said the reporter assessed the two men nodded somberly and went away other reporters seated at their desks were glancing toward the glass walls of burts office phones rang what ellen wanted was to tell you she was sorry burt said she wants you to call her tell me about this obituary give her a chance our son died then our marriage died theres plenty to be sorry about but i dont want to talk about it im through talking about it ninecorrection since i promised last night if we count today its eight more days burt thats all the time im willing to give you then were even tell me about the obituary assessing pittman burt didnt blink for quite a while at once he shrugged sighed then picked up a folder on his desk jonathan millgate pittman felt a spark speed along his nerves that name ought to sound familiar from when you were working on the national affairs desk before selfconscious burt let the sentence dangle before i cracked up you mean or fell to pieces or whats the euphemism these days needed a rest im not so fuzzyminded that i wouldnt remember the name of one of the grand counselors burt raised his thick eyebrows from the forties from the beginning of the cold war onward a group of five east coast patricians had exerted a continuous influence on american government policy by acting as major advisers to various presidents at first they had been cabinet members and ambassadors later private consultants mostly to republican presidents but not exclusively during the democratic administration in the late seventies carter was supposed to have consulted with them about the iran hostage situation it was rumored that on their advice he authorized the failed hostagerescue attempt and in effect opened the way for ronald reagan to get into the white house eventually as they aged they acquired the status of legends and became known as the grand counselors jonathan millgate would be about eighty now pittman said mother a society maven in boston father a billionaire from investments in railroads and communications systems millgate graduated at the top of his class with a law degree from yale nineteen thirtyeight specialty international law which came in handy during the second world war went to work for the state department moved upward rapidly named ambassador to the ussr named ambassador to the united nations named secretary of state named national security adviser tight with truman jumped parties to become a republican and made himself indispensable to eisenhower not close to kennedy but despite the party differences johnson certainly relied on millgate to help formulate policy about vietnam when the republicans came back into office nixon relied on him even more then millgate suddenly dropped out of public view he retreated to his mansion in massachusetts interestingly despite his seclusion he continued to have as much influence as a highlevel elected or appointed official he had a heart attack this morning pittman waited here in town burt said but apparently not a fatal attack because you said the subject of the obituary wasnt dead yet since the chronicles dying anyhow we can afford to experiment i want the obit long and i want it dense with facts with intelligence with style a cross between the front page and the editorial page that used to be your specialty youre gambling he wont last until a week from tomorrow that hell die before the chronicle does what im really gambling burt said is that youll find the assignment interesting enough to make you want to do others like it that youll get committed to something besides grief that you and the chronicle wont die together gamblings for suckers and working on obituaries too long can make a person morbid right pittman said dryly its not like reporting on national affairs can make you morbid he turned to leave wait matt theres one other thing pittman glanced back and saw the envelope burt was holding his chest felt cold the guy who subbed for you yesterday found this in your desk drawer burt opened the envelope its addressed to me so he figured hed better deliver it burt set a sheet of paper on the desk i guess i got it earlier than you wanted pretty impersonal dont you think given all weve been through pittman didnt need to read the typed note to know what it said matthew pittman west th st died wednesday evening from a selfinflicted gunshot wound a memorial service will begin at noon on saturday at donovans tavern west th st in lieu of flowers memorial donations may be made to the childrens cancer fund at sloankettering in the name of jeremy pittman it was all i could think of brevitys a virtue burt tapped the sheet of paper but so is thoroughness you didnt mention that you worked for the chronicle i didnt want to embarrass the newspaper and you didnt mention that you were survived by your exwife ellen pittman shrugged you didnt want to embarrass her either burt asked pittman shrugged again i got writers block when it came to calling ellen by her new last name i finally decided to hell with it i wish you could ignore your other problems as conveniently eight more days matt you promised me eight more days thats right you owe me burt said i know pittman said with force i havent forgotten what you did for to interrupt the confrontation he glanced at his watch its almost noon ill get started on millgates obituary after lunch the tavern had three things to recommend it it was out of the way it didnt do much business and the little business it did wasnt from staff members of the chronicle pittman could drink in peace knowing that he wouldnt be interruptednot in this place its only reason for existing was for the coming and going of numbers runners when pittman had come in and asked for a drink the bartender had looked shocked to be having a legitimate customer pittman nursed two jack daniels on the rocks while he did his newspapers crossword puzzle anything to occupy his mind burt had been trying to do that as well to distract him and burts tactic had been effective because the crossword puzzle wasnt effective the only words that kept coming into pittmans mind were jonathan mitigate pittman had once worked on a story about millgate back when he had been at the national affairs desk before jeremys death before seven years ago jonathan millgate had been rumored to be involved as a middleman in a covert white house operation whereby munitions were illegally supplied to rightwing governments in south america in exchange for the cooperation of those governments in fighting the war against drugs it was further rumored that millgate had received substantial fees from those south american governments and certain weapons manufacturers in exchange for acting as a gobetween in the secret exchange but pittman had found it impossible to substantiate those rumors for a man who had once been so much in the public eye millgate had become a remarkably private guarded person the last interview hed given had been in after the tet offensive against american forces in vietnam millgate had spoken to a senior reporter for the washington post expressing strong sympathy with the nixon administrations policy of sending considerably more us soldiers to vietnam because millgate was respected so much his statement was interpreted to represent the opinion of other conservative political theorists especially millgates fellow grand counselors indeed the implication was that millgate was endorsing a policy that he and the other four grand counselors had themselves formulated and privately urged the nixon white house to adopt heightening americas involvement in the vietnam war by the time pittman became interested in millgate because of the possible munitions scandal millgates effect on presidential attitudes was so discreet and yet powerful that his reputation for diplomacy had achieved mythic status but no government source could or would say anything about him as a consequence pittman full of energy motivated in his prime had gone to burt forsyth and requested permission to investigate millgates legend pittmans telephone log eventually recorded one hundred attempts to call millgates business and government associates each executive had declined to be interviewed pittman had also contacted millgates law office in an attempt to make an appointment to interview him pittman was put on hold he was switched from secretary to secretary he was told to call numbers that were no longer in service pittman had phoned the justice department hoping that the team investigating millgate would give pittman an idea of how they stayed in contact with him he was told that the justice department had no need to remain in contact with millgate that the rumors about his receiving kickbacks because of his alleged involvement in a munitions scandal had been proven to lack substance and that the investigation had been concluded in its early stages can you tell me which attorney represented him in your initial discussions after a long pause the man had answered no i can not i didnt get your name when you picked up the phone who am i speaking to please the connection had been broken pittman had gone to a computer hacker about whom pittman had written what the hacker considered to be a fair story about the hackers motives for accessing top secret defense department computer files i wanted to show how easy it was how unprotected those files were the hacker had insisted but despite his pleas that hed been motivated by loyalty to his government the hacker had gone to prison for three years recently released bitter about how the government had treated him delighted to see his defender again the hacker had agreed to pittmans request and with greater delight had used a modem to access telephone company computer files in massachusetts unlisted number no problem as a matter of fact check thisyour dudes got four of them pittman had looked at the glowing computer screen and begun to write down the numbers forget the penandpaper routine ill print out the dudes whole file that was how pittman had learned not only millgates private numbers but the addresses for his boston mansion and his marthas vineyard estate as well determined he had phoned each of millgates private numbers each person on the other end had treated pittman with deference until with shock they realized what he wanted i demand to know how you learned this number if youd just let me speak to mr millgate what newspaper did you say you worked for fifteen minutes after pittmans final attempt hed been summoned to burt forsyths office youre off the millgate story this is a joke right i wish it was i just got a call from the chronicles publisher who just got a call from somebody who must have a hell of a lot of influence im under strict orders to give you strict orders to work on something else and youre actually going to give me those orders burt had squinted at the smoke he blew from his cigarettein those days smoking in the building had not been forbidden youve got to know when to be rigid and when to bend and this is a time to bend its not as if you had anything solid admit it you were on a fishing expedition hoping youd find a story to tell the truth you were taking more time than id expected and theres something else to be considered its been suggested that you broke the law in the way you obtained millgates telephone numbers did you pittman hadnt answered work on this story instead pittman had been angry at burt for several days but the object of his anger had shifted when there turned out to be a certain synchronicity between the policebrutality assignment pittman was given and what happened next on his free time over the weekend pittman had gone to boston intending to stake out millgates mansion in the hope that he would see millgate leave pittmans plan was to follow millgates limousine until he could find a place that allowed him to approach millgate with questions one minute after pittman parked on the mansions treelined street a police car stopped behind him one hour later he was being questioned as a burglary suspect at police headquarters two hours later he was in a holding cell where two prisoners picked a fight with him and beat him so badly that he needed a thousand dollars worth of dental work visiting pittman in the hospital burt had shaken his head stubborn the wires that secured pittmans broken jaw had prevented him from answering pittman finished his second jack daniels and glanced across the almostdeserted tavern toward the bartender who still seemed startled that hed actually had a legitimate customer a man carrying a bulging paper bag came in looked around the shadowy interior raised his eyebrows at the sight of pittman got a shrug and a nod from the bartender and proceeded toward a room in the back pittman considered ordering another bourbon then glanced at his watch and saw that it was almost in the afternoon hed been sitting there brooding for longer than hed realized he hadnt thought about millgate in quite a whileyearssince well before jeremy had become ill pittmans jaw had healed hed pursued other assignments millgate had managed to make himself invisible again out of sight out of mind the only reminder had been periodic twinges in pittmans jaw during especially cold weather sometimes when he fingered the line where his jaw had been broken he would recall how he had tried to investigate the two prisoners who had beaten him theyd been admitted to his cell a half hour after hed been placed there the charges against them had been public drunkenness but pittman hadnt smelled any alcohol on their breath when they had beaten him subsequent to the beating they had been mistakenly released from jail a mixup in paperwork their names had been common their addresses temporary and pittman had never been able to contact them or investigate their backgrounds to find out if millgate had been responsible for the beating as he left the murky bar his head aching from the harsh assault of afternoon sunlight pittman felt searing anger intrude on his cold despair he had always resented aristocrats and their supposition that money and social stature made them the equivalent of royalty he resented the disdain with which they felt themselves unaccountable for their actions during his peak as a national affairs reporter his best stories had been exposes of criminal activity by those in high places and jonathan millgate would have been the highest target pittman had ever brought down i should have been more persistent pittmans flare of anger abruptly died ahead at a noisy intersection where pedestrians were stopped for a red light he noticed a tall lanky boy with long hair slight shoulders and narrow hips moving his feet slightly to the beat of imagined music the boy looked to be about fifteen he wore a rumpled denim jacket that had an emblem of a rock star his jeans were faded his running shoes hightopped were dyed green and had names written on them from the back the boy reminded pittman so much of jeremy that he felt as if a hand had squeezed his heart then the boy turned his head to speak to a companion and of course the boy looked nothing at all like jeremy whose jaw had not been as strong as this boys and whose complexion hadnt been as clear and whose teeth had needed braces imperfect physically but perfect as a son it wasnt just that jeremy had never gotten into trouble or that his grades had been excellent or that he had been respectful as important as these things were what pittman missed most about jeremy was his captivating personality the boy had been blessed with a wonderful sense of humor he had always been so much fun to be around never failing to make pittman feel that life was better because of his son but not anymore pittman thought the brief angry fire hed felt when thinking about millgate no longer had significance that was from another time another lifebefore jeremy had become ill pittman resented what burt was trying to do it was an insult to jeremys memory for burt to assume that an assignment about jonathan millgate could distract pittman from his grief i ought to tell him to stuff it no keep your word when you end this it has to be cleanly you cant be obligated to anyone in the old days pittman would have gone to the area formerly in the basement where back issues of the newspaper were stored on microfilm the master index would have contained file cards for millgate and grand counselors and from them pittman would have learned which issues and pages of the newspaper to read on microfilm that section of the newspaper where the microfilm was kept had been traditionally called the morgue and although computer files had replaced microfilm death was so much on pittmans mind that he still thought of himself as entering a morgue when he sat at his desk turned on his computer terminal and tapped the keys that would give him access to the newspapers data files given millgates secretive lifestyle it wasnt surprising that there wasnt much information only a few small items since pittman had researched millgate seven years earlier millgate and the other four grand counselorsstill retaining immense political power even though they no longer had direct ties with the governmenthad been feted at a white house dinner where the president had given millgate the medal of freedom americas highest civilian honor millgate had accompanied the president on air force one to an international conference on world economics in geneva millgate had established an institute for the study of postcommunist reconstruction in russia millgate had testified before a senate confirmation committee about his high regard for a supreme court nominee who also happened to be the son of one of the grand counselors the phone rang pittman picked it up obituaries a fiftytwoyearold woman had been killed in a fire he learned she was unmarried without children unemployed not a member of any organization aside from her brother to whom pittman was speaking there werent any surviving relatives thus the obituary would be unusually slight especially because the brother didnt want his name mentioned for fear people to whom his sister owed money would come looking for him the barrenness of the womans life made pittman more despondent shaking his head dejected he finished the call then frowned at his watch it was almost three oclock the gray haze that customarily surrounded him seemed to have thickened the phone rang again this time burt forsyths gravelly voice demanded hows the millgate obit coming has he still in intensive care well there isnt much ill have the obit finished before i go home dont tell me there isnt much burt said we both know better i want this piece to be substantial seven years ago you wouldnt have given up so easily dig back then you kept complaining about how you couldnt find a way to see millgate well hes a captive interview this time not to mention therell be relatives or somebody waiting at the hospital to see how hes doing talk to them for christ sake figure out how to get into his room and talk to him pittman stood across from the hospital for quite a while the building was soot gray the midapril day had been warm but as the sun descended behind skyscrapers cool shadows made pittman cross his arms and hug himself this was the same hospital where jeremy had died pittman had come to the corner across from the emergency entrance the same corner where he had often stood late at night after visiting jeremy from this corner he had been able to see the window of jeremys room on the tenth floor gazing up through the darkness for several hours he had prayed that jeremy wouldnt be wakened by the need to vomit because of his chemotherapy amid the din of traffic pittman now heard a siren an ambulance veered from the busy street and rushed to a stop beneath the portal at the emergency entrance attendants leapt out and urgently removed a patient on a gurney pedestrians glanced toward the commotion but kept walking swiftly onward pittman swallowed squinted up toward what he still thought of as jeremys window and turned away jonathan millgate was in that hospital in the adult intensivecare ward that was just down the sixthfloor hallway from the childrens intensivecare ward where jeremy had died pittman shook his head he couldnt tolerate going into the hospital couldnt make himself go up to that floor couldnt bear exposing himself to the torment on the faces of people waiting to hear about their loved ones it would be all he could do not to imagine that he was one of them not to sit down with them and wait as if for news of jeremy it would be far too much so he went home rather than take a taxi he walked he needed to fill the time as dusk increasingly chilled him he stopped for several drinksto fill the time the elevator to his thirdfloor apartment creaked and wheezed he locked himself in his apartment heard laughter from a television show vibrate through thin walls from the apartment next to him and had another drink to fill the time he sat in darkness he imagined what it would have been like if jeremy had lived with basketball playoffs approaching he would have spent the coming saturday afternoon playing oneonone with jeremy afterward theyd have gone for pizza and a movie or maybe to tower recordswhatever they wanted to do the future would have been theirs pittman wept he turned on the kitchen light opened the drawer where hed put the and took out the pistol vaguely conscious that the time was pm because the sitcom next door had ended and another was starting he continued to stare at the his eyes became like the lenses of a microscope focusing intensely on the gleaming blue metal magnifying the trigger the hammer the opening in the barrel from which the bullet would the next thing he was aware of a new sound disturbed him the smooth deep voice of a man who spoke in formal cadences the voice came from the apartment next door the voice was a television news announcer frowning pittman turned his gaze from the and fixed it on the stoves mechanical clock its numbers whirred becoming pittman frowned harder he had so absorbed himself in the gun that he hadnt been conscious of so much time passing hand trembling he set down the the news announcer on the television next door had said something about jonathan millgate havent seen you in a while matt the heavy man an italian had gray hair protruding from the bottom of his yankees baseball cap he wore a yankees baseball jersey as well and he held a ladle with which hed been stirring a large steaming pot of what smelled like chickennoodle soup as pittman came into the diner the place was narrow with formicatopped tables along one side a counter along the other the overhead fluorescent lights made pittman blink after the darkness of the street it was almost pm as pittman sat at the counter he nodded to the only other customer a black man drinking a cup of coffee at one of the tables you been sick the cook asked is that why you havent been in everybody keeps saying do i look sick or permanently hungover look at how loose your clothes are how much weight have you lost ten fifteen pounds and judging from them bags under your eyes id say you havent been sleeping much either pittman didnt answer whatll it be for tonight to start with a favor the cook appeared not to have heard as he stirred the soup i wonder if you could store this for me what the cook glanced at the counter in front of pittman and sounded relieved that box pittman nodded the box had once held computer paper now it concealed the and its container of ammunition he had stuffed the box with shredded newspaper so that the gun wouldnt shift and make a thunking noise when the box was tilted he had sealed the box many times with tape just a place to store this pittman said ill even pay you for no need the cook said whats in it how come you cant keep it at your place theres nothing funny about this is there nah its just a gun a gun pittman smiled at his apparent joke ive been working on a book this is a copy of the printout and the computer discs im paranoid about fires id ask my girlfriend to help but she and i just had a fight i want to keep a duplicate of this material someplace besides my apartment yeah a book whats it about suicide let me have some of that soup will you pittman prepared to eat his first meal in thirtysix hours hed packed the gun and left it with the cook at the diner because his experience of losing time while he stared at the weapon had taught him there was every chance he might shoot himself before he made good on his promise to work for burt forsyth until the chronicle died the effort of getting through this particular day the bitterness and emptiness he had felt had been so intense that he couldnt be certain of his resolve to keep himself alive for eight more days this way in the event of overwhelming despair he would have a chance of regaining control by the time he reached the diner got the box and went to his apartment for now he had to do what burt forsyth intendedto distract himself jonathan millgate meant nothing to him pittmans career meant nothing the chronicle meant nothing but burt forsyth did in honor of jeremy pittman felt compelled to keep the promise he had made for eight more days despite his reluctance he went back to the hospital this time he took a taxi not because he was in a hurry after all he still had a great deal of time to fill and would have preferred to walk but to get to the hospital he would have had to pass through several neighborhoods that became dangerous at this hour he found it bitterly ironic that in doing his best to postpone his death for eight more days he had to be extra careful about not dying in the meanwhile he returned to the hospital because of the television announcers reference to millgate through the thin walls of his apartment he had listened to the news report pittmans expectation was that millgate had died and a brief summary of his publicservice career was being provided burt forsyth would be annoyed about thatmillgate dying before pittman finished the obituary in time for tomorrow mornings edition of the newspaper but the tv news story had not been about millgates death to the contrary millgate was still in intensive care as the announcer had pointed out instead the story had been about another possible scandal in millgates background to the governments dismay a copy of a justice department special prosecutors report had been leaked to the press this evening the report a first draft never intended for publication implicated millgate as a negotiator in a possible covert attemptunsanctioned by congressto buy nuclear weapons from the chaos of governments in what used to be the soviet union an unsubtantiated charge against him solely an inhouse assessment of where the justice departments investigation might eventually lead but the gravity of the news announcers voice had made the grave allegation sound like established fact guilty until proven innocent this was the second time in seven years that jonathan millgate had been implicated as a gobetween in a major arms scandal and pittman knew that if he failed to investigate this time if he didnt at least make an attempt to get a statement from millgates people burt forsyth would accuse him of reneging on his bargain to do his best for the chronicle during the brief time remaining to it for burt and what burt had done for jeremy pittman forced himself to try pittman stood on the corner across from the hospitals emergency entrance it was after midnight a drizzle intensified the april nights chill he buttoned his wrinkled london fog topcoat and felt dampness even through the soles of his shoes the drizzle created misty halos around gleaming streetlights and the brighter floodlights at the emergency entrance by contrast the lights in some of the hospital rooms were weak making pittman feel lonely he stared up toward what had been jeremys window on the tenth floor and that window was dark feeling even more lonely he crossed the street toward the hospital at this hour traffic was slight the emergency area was almost deserted he heard a faroff siren the drizzle strengthened wetting the back of his neck when jeremy had been sick pittman had learned about the hospital in considerable detailthe locations of the various departments the lounges that were most quiet in the middle of the night the areas that had coffee machines the places to get a sandwich when the main cafeteria was closed bringing jeremy to the hospital for chemotherapy he had felt uncomfortable at the main entrance and in the lobby the cancer had made jeremy so delicate that pittman had a fear of someone in a crowd bumping against him given jeremys low bloodcell counts a bruise would have taken a considerable time to heal in addition pittman had felt outraged by the stares of people in the lobby who seemed shocked to see a skinny bald fifteenyearold his face gaunt his hairless scalp tinted blue from blood vessels close to the surface terribly sensitive about his sons feelings pittman had chosen an alternate route in the back a small entrance around the corner to the left of the emergency area the door was used primarily by interns and nurses and as pittman discovered the elevators in this section were faster perhaps because fewer people used them retracing this route created such vivid memories that he sensed jeremy next to him as he passed a private ambulance parked outside this exit it was gray it had no hospital markings but through a gap in curtains drawn across the back windows pittman saw a light an oxygen unit various medical monitors a man wearing an attendants white coat was checking some equipment then pittman was beyond the ambulance whose engine was running although its headlights were off he noticed a stocky man in a dark suit drop the butt of a cigarette into a puddle and come to attention seeing pittman you must really have needed a cigarette pittman thought to stand out here in the rain nodding to the man who didnt nod back pittman reached for the doorknob and noticed that the light was out above the entrance he stepped inside went up four steps to an echoey concrete landing and noticed another stocky man in a dark suit this one leaning against the wall next to where the stairs turned upward the mans face had a hard expression with squinted calculating eyes pittman didnt need the stairs instead he went forward across the landing through a door to a brightly lit hospital corridor the pungent acrid toofamiliar odors of food antiseptic and medicine assaulted him when pittman used to come here daily to visit jeremy the odors had been constantly present on every floor day or night the odors had stuck to pittmans clothes for several weeks after jeremys death he had smelled them on his jackets his shirts his pants the vividness of the painful memories caused by the odors distracted pittman making him falter in confusion did he really want to put himself through this this was the first time hed been back inside the hospital would the torture be worth it just to please burt the elevator doors were directly across from the door through which he had entered the corridor if he went ahead he suspected that his impulse would be to go up to the tenth floor and what had been jeremys room rather than to go to the sixth floor where millgate was and where jeremy had died in intensive care abruptly a movement on pittmans right disturbed him a largechested man stepped away from the wall next to the door pittman had used his position had prevented pittman from noticing him when he came toward the elevators the man wore an oversized windbreaker can i help the man sounded as if hed swallowed broken glass you lost you need directions not lost confused the mans aggressive tone made pittmans body tighten his instincts warned him not to tell the truth ive got a sick boy on the tenth floor the nurses let me see him at night but sometimes i can barely force myself to go up there sick huh bad cancer yeah thats bad but the man obviously didnt care and hed made pittman feel so apprehensive his stomach so fluttery that pittman had answered with the most innocent believable story he could think of he certainly wasnt going to explain his real reason for coming to the hospital to a man whose oversized windbreaker concealed something that made a distinct ominous bulge on the left side of his waist footsteps made pittman turn he faced yet another solemn stocky man this one wearing an overcoat the man had been standing against the wall on the opposite side of the door from where the man in the windbreaker had been standing neither man had rain spots on his coat the rain had started fifteen minutes previously so they must have been waiting in this corridor at least that long pittman thought why recalling the man whod been smoking outside and the man in the stairwell he inwardly frowned then youd better get up and see your boy the second man said right more uneasy pittman reached to press the elevators up button when he heard a ding and the doors suddenly opened loud voices assaulted him i wont be responsible for this no ones asking you to be responsible hes my patient now the elevator compartment was crammed a man on a gurney with an oxygen mask over his face and an intravenous tube leading into his left arm was being quickly wheeled out by two whitecoated attendants a nurse swiftly followed holding an intravenous bottle above the patient a thin intense young man was arguing with an older redfaced man who had a stethoscope around his neck and a clipboard with what looked like a medical file in his hand but the risk of i said hes my responsibility the young man surged from the elevator just as pittman felt hands behind him grab his arms and pull him back out of the way the gurney the two attendants the nurse and the young man hurried past him toward the door to the stairwell as the man with the stethoscope charged out trying to stop them two darksuited solemn wellbuilt menthey also had been in the elevatorveered ahead of him and formed a blockade damn it if you dont get out of my way relax doctor everythings going to be fine pittman squirmed pained by the force of the hands that gripped him from behind through the window in the stairwell door he saw the man whod been waiting on the landing dart forward to open the door the attendants pushed the gurney through then lifted it hurrying with it down the stairs to the exit from the hospital although restrained pittman was able to turn his head enough to see the man whod been smoking in the rain yank the outside door open the attendants rushed with the gurney disappearing into the night along with the nurse and the thin intense man the somber stocky men retreated letting go of pittman moving swiftly into the stairwell down the stairs through the outside door the man with the stethoscope trembled by god ill phone the police they cant pittman didnt stay to hear the rest of his sentence what he heard instead were repeated thunks as doors to the private ambulance outside were opened and closed he ran down the stairs peering out toward the drizzlemisted darkness he saw the private ambulance pull away a dark oldsmobile following immediately he lunged into the chilling rain seeing frost come out of his mouth he raced through puddles toward the street corner opposite the emergency entrance from having come to the hospital so often with jeremy he knew the easiest places to hail a taxi late at night and the corner across from emergency was one of the best an empty taxi veered around a curve almost striking pittman as he ran across toward the corner watch it buddy pittman scrambled in my fathers in that private ambulance he pointed toward where a block ahead the ambulance and the dark oldsmobile were stopped at a traffic light hes being taken for emergency treatment to another hospital keep up with them whats wrong with this hospital they dont have a machine he needs hurry please pittman gave the driver twenty dollars the taxi sped forward pittman sat anxiously in the backseat wiping rain from his forehead catching his breath what the hell was going on he wondered although the oxygen mask had concealed the face of the patient on the gurney pittman had noticed the mans wrinkled liverspotted hands his slackskinned neck and his wispy white hair obviously old that wasnt much to go on but pittman had the eerie conviction that the man on the gurney was jonathan millgate i thought you said they were taking your father to another hospital the taxi driver said they are not in new york city they aint in case you havent noticed we just reached new rochelle pittman listened to the rhythmic tap of the taxis windshield wipers as tires hissed on wet pavement he concentrated to provide an explanation the ambulance has a twoway radio maybe they called ahead and the hospital they were going to didnt have the machine they needed where i live over on long island theyve got plenty of good hospitals i dont know why they didnt head there whats wrong with your father anyhow heart disease yeah my brother has a bad ticker thirty years of smoking poor bastard can hardly walk across the room you better hope your fathers strong enough to hang on because it doesnt look like the ambulance is gonna stop here in new rochelle christ at this rate well soon be in connecticut headlights gleamed in the rain id better let my dispatcher know whats going on the driver said listen im sorry about your father and all but buddy this long a trip needs special arrangements if we end up in stamford or some damned place like that i wont be able to get a fare to come back to the city im gonna have to charge you both ways ill pay it how rain tapped the roof what im sorry i wasnt listening how are you gonna pay me you got the cash rough estimatewere talking over a hundred bucks dont worry youll get paid but i do worry i need to know if youve got the cash towait a second looks like they figured out where theyre going the sign at the turnoff heading north said scarsdalewhite plains whats all those trees to the right looks like a park pittman said or a damned forest man were way out in the country i knew i shouldnta done this how am i gonna find a fare back to the city from way out here were not in the country look at those big houses on your left this is some kind of expensive subdivision theres a sign up ahead yeah saxon woods park and golf club i told you were not in the country well either the guys in that ambulance plan to take your father golfing orhold it theyre slowing down so did the taxi driver theyre turning off pittman said there to the right the driver kept going passing a high stone wall and a gated driveway as the red taillights of the ambulance and the oldsmobile receded into the darkness the gatetall made of wroughtiron barsswung electronically back into place funny how these days they make hospitals to look like mansions the driver said what the hells going on buddy i havent the faintest idea what i honestly dont know my fathers really sick i expected say this isnt about drugs is it pittman was too confused to answer i asked you a question its not about drugs you saw the ambulance leave the hospital sure right well i dont plan to spend the rest of the night driving around scarsdale at least i think thats where we are rides over buddy youve got two choiceshead back with me or get out right now either way youre paying both ways the driver turned the taxi around okay let me out where they left the road pittman said the driver switched off his headlights stopping fifty yards from the gate in case its not a good idea to advertise that you followed them im telling you this isnt about drugs yeah sure you owe me a hundred and fifteen bucks pittman groped in his pockets i already gave you twenty what are you talking about thats supposed to be my tip but i dont have that much cash what i asked you earlier if ive got a credit card thats useless to me this cab aint rigged to take it then im going to have to give you a check give me a break do i look like the trusting type the last time i took a check from a guy it hey i told you i dont have the cash id give you my watch but it isnt worth fifteen dollars a check the driver muttered this fucking job after pittman wrote the check and gave it to him the driver studied the address at the top of the check let me see your drivers license he wrote down pittmans social security number if this check bounces buddy i promise it wont well if it does im gonna come to your apartment and break both your legs just make sure you cash it before a week from saturday whats so special about a week from saturday i wont be around pittman got out of the car thankful that the rain had lessened to a mist and watched the taxi pull away in the darkness a distance down the road the driver switched his headlights on in the silence pittman suddenly felt isolated shoving his hands in his overcoat pockets for warmth he walked along the side of the road the shoulder was gravel its sandy bed sufficiently softened by the rain that his shoes made only a slight scraping sound there werent any streetlights pittman strained his eyes but he could barely see the wall that loomed on his left he came to a different shade of darkness and realized that hed reached the barred gate without touching it he peered through far along a driveway past trees and shrubs lights glowed in what seemed to be a mansion what now he thought its two oclock in the morning its drizzling im cold im god knows where i shouldnt have gone to the hospital i shouldnt have followed the ambulance i shouldnt have as his eyes adjusted to the darkness he studied the top of the gate then shook his head he was fairly certain that he could climb over it but he was even more certain that thered be some kind of intrusion sensor up there before jeremys death and pittmans nervous breakdown he had worked for a time on the newspapers sunday magazine one of his articles had been about a man whom pittman had nicknamed the bugmaster the man was an expert in intrusion detectors and other types of security equipmentfor example eavesdropping devices otherwise known as bugs ergo the bugmaster enjoying pittmans enthusiasm about information the bugmaster had explained his profession in detail and pittmans prodigious memory for facts had retained it all a place this size pittman knew was bound to have a security system and as the bugmaster had pointed out you never go over a wall or a gate without first scouting the barriers to make sure youre not activating a sensor but at this hour in the dark pittman didnt see how he could scout anything so what the hell are you going to do you should have gone back to manhattan with the taxi driver what did you think youd accomplish by hanging around out here in the rain through the bars of the gate a light attracted pittmans attention two of them headlights approaching along the driveway from the mansion pittman watched them grow larger thought about hurrying along the road and hiding past the corner of the wall then made a different decision and pressed himself against the wall right next to the gate he heard a smooth welltuned powerful engine he heard tires on wet concrete he heard a buzz and then a whir the gates motor had been activated by remote control the gate was swinging open toward the inside of the estate its sturdy wheels scraping on concrete the engine sounded louder the headlights flashed through the open gate sooner than pittman expected the dark oldsmobile that had escorted the ambulance surged through the opening turned to the left in the direction the taxi had taken to go back to the city and sped into the night pittman was tempted to remain motionless until the cars lights disappeared down the road but he had something more immediate to occupy him for abruptly he heard another buzz another whir the gate was closingfaster than he expectedand he sprinted to get through the opening before it was blocked the sturdy gate brushed past his coat the lock snapped into place the night became silent again pittman found that he was holding his breath despite the expansive grounds ahead of him he felt a spasm of claustrophobia the darkness seemed to smother him at once the cold drizzle sharpened his senses bracing him he inhaled and glanced around reassured that no threat emerged from the shadows you expected guards no but dogs maybe right wouldnt they have followed the car wouldnt you have seen them by now maybe maybe not they might be trained not to follow cars so whats the worst that can happen if there are dogs theyll find you and corner you and bark until somebody comes youll be charged with trespassing thats no big deal for a guy whos planning to kill himself eight days from now but what if the dogs are trained to attack this isnt a top secret military installation its a scarsdale estate relax and anyway so what if the dogs are trained to attack do you think being killed by a couple of dobermans would be any worse than shooting yourself with a yes what standards you have chilled by the rain pittman moved forward at first he was tempted to approach the mansion through the cover of the trees but then he decided there wasnt any needthe night and the gloomy weather provided him with sufficient cover following the murky driveway he came around a shadowy curve and discovered that he was closer to the mansion than he expected next to a sheltering fir tree he studied his destination the building was high wide made of brick with numerous gables and chimneys there were several lights in windows on the ground floor less on the second story from this angle he could see a fivestall garage on the left the garage had a sundeck on top with two sets of french doors leading off the deck into a secondstory room that was lit although pittman couldnt see what was in there mostly what attracted his attention was the private ambulance parked its lights off apparently empty in front of the stone steps that led up to the mansions large front door now what pittman thought he shrugged with eight days to live what difference did it make in an odd way he felt liberated after all what did he have to lose knowing when he was going to die gave him a feeling of immunity he stepped from the fir tree and concentrated to maintain his balance on wet slippery grass as he crept down a dark slope toward the mansion moving cautiously toward the lights of the mansion taking advantage of shrubs a fountain a gazebo to give him cover he came closer to the illuminated windows the drenched grass had soaked his shoes and socks chilling his feet but he was too involved in studying the windows to care curtains had been drawn forcing him to cross the driveway where it ran parallel to the front of the mansion he felt exposed by the drizzleshrouded glare of arc lights as he darted toward bushes beneath the front windows moisture dripped from the branches onto his overcoat again in shadows he crouched tensely moved through an opening in the bushes on the left side of the front doors then warily straightened able to see through a gap in the curtains at one window he saw a portion of a luxuriously appointed oakpaneled living room the room didnt seem occupied quietly he shifted toward the next window moving closer to the front door the next windows curtains were open he showed as little of his head as possible while he peered in immediately he realized that this window was part of the same living room that hed just seen through the other window but why would curtains in one window be closed while the other curtains were not he eased down out of sight remembered the ambulance behind him in front of the mansion and suspected that someone must have been waiting anxiously for the ambulance to arrive when it had that person had hurried from the room too preoccupied to bother closing the curtains but where had that person gone a detail that pittman had seen in the room now acquired significance on a carved mahogany table in front of a fireplace there had been several teacups and coffee mugs okay not one person several but where pittman glanced to his right toward the mansions front steps they were wide made of stone a light blazed above impressive double doors and revealed a closedcircuit camera aimed toward the steps and the area in front of the entrance if there were other closedcircuit cameras pittman hadnt seen them but he had no intention of revealing himself to this one the best way to proceed he decided was to double back to go left instead of right and circle the mansion in the reverse direction from the one in which hed intended to go the method would eventually lead him to the windows on the right side of the entrance but without forcing him to cross the front steps he turned stayed low close to the mansions wall and shifted past the moisturebeaded shrubs ignoring the two windows that hed already checked he came to a third window the drapes on this one completely closed after listening intently and hearing no sounds he concluded that the room was empty and moved farther along rounding a corner of the mansion arc lights caused the drizzle to glisten the lights were mounted on the side of the mansion and beneath the eaves of the sundeck that topped the multistall garage hugging the wall pittman crept ten feet along the side of the mansion then reached the large garage where it formed a continuation of the building there werent any windows so pittman didnt linger coming to the corner of the garage he checked around it and saw that all five garage stalls were closed past the garage he faced the back of the house there fewer arc lights illuminated the grounds but they were bright enough for pittman to see a large covered drizzlemisted swimming pool a changing room fallow flower gardens more shrubs and trees and immediately to his right stairs that went up to the sundeck on top of the garage there had been lights beyond the french doors that led from the sundeck into an upperstory room he remembered deciding that hed better inspect this area now rather than come back after checking the windows on the ground floor he started up the wooden steps the sundeck was disturbingly unilluminated pittman didnt understand crouching in the darkness on top he wondered why the other parts of the building had outside lights while the sundeck did not the room beyond the two sets of french doors was well lit however past substantial ornate metal furniture upon which cocktails and lunches would be served when the weather got warm pittman saw bright lamps in a wide room that had a cocktail bar along the left wall in addition to a bigscreen television built into the middle of the right wall at the moment though the room was being used for something quite different from entertainment leather furniture had been shifted toward the television leaving the center of the room available for a bed with safety railings on each side a long table beyond it supported electronic instruments that pittman recognized vividly from the week when jeremy had been in intensive care monitors that analyzed heartbeat blood pressure respiration rate and bloodoxygen content two pumps controlled the speed with which liquid flowed from bottles on an iv stand into the right and left arm of a frail old man who lay covered with sheets on the bed the two male attendants whom pittman had seen at the hospital were making adjustments to the monitors the female nurse was taking care that there werent any kinks in the oxygen tube that led to prongs inserted in the old mans nostrils the oxygen mask that had obscured the old mans face when he was taken from the hospital now lay on top of a monitor on the table beyond the bed pittman couldnt be totally sure from outside in the darkness but what he had suspected at the hospital insisted more strongly the old man bore a resemblance to jonathan millgate the intense young man who had been in charge of getting the old man out of the hospital had a stethoscope around his neck and was listening to the old mans chest the somber men who had acted as bodyguards were standing in the farleft corner but other people were in the large room as well pittman hadnt seen them at the hospital although he definitely had seen them beforein old photographs and in television documentaries about the politics of the vietnam war four men distinguishedlooking dressed in conservative custommade dark threepiece suits old but bearing a resemblance to images of their younger selves three wore spectacles one had a white mustache two were bald while the other two had wispy white hair all had stern pinched wrinkled faces and drooping skin on their necks their expressions severe they stood in a row as if they were on a dais or part of a diplomatic receiving line their combined former titles included ambassador to the ussr ambassador to the united nations ambassador to great britain ambassador to saudi arabia ambassador to west germany ambassador to nato secretary of state secretary of defense national security adviser indeed several of these positions had been held by all of these men at various times just as they had all at various times belonged to the national security council they had never been elected to public office and yet in their appointed roles they had exerted more influence than any but the most highly placed politicians their names were eustace gable anthony lloyd victor standish and winston sloane they were the legendary diplomats upon whom presidents from truman to clinton republican and democrat had frequently relied for advice their shrewdness having earned them the nickname the grand counselors four of them which suggested that the old man in the bed was in fact the fifth grand counselor jonathan millgate the intense young man with the stethoscope said something that pittman couldnt hear the nurse said something in response then the two male attendants spoke again pittman was too far away to make out what they were saying the man with the stethoscope turned toward the grand counselors and seemed to explain something one of the elderly diplomats a gauntcheeked man with a white mustache winston sloane nodded wearily another his narrow face pinched with wrinkles eustace gable asked a question the man with the stethoscope answered a third elderly diplomat anthony lloyd tapped his cane on the floor in a gesture of frustration although their faces were pale their ancient eyes were fiery with a final comment eustace gable left the room his associates solemnly followed the nurse approached the draperies when she pulled a cord on the side the draperies moved then stopped she pulled harder but something prevented her from closing them all the way from the deck pittman studied the room with increasing confusion the four bodyguards went after the counselors as did the two ambulance attendants leaving only the man with the stethoscope and the female nurse the latter dimmed the rooms lights and now pittman understood why there werent any arc lamps illuminating the sundeck the group didnt want the glare of the outside lights intruding on the room after it was put into comparative darkness the red lights on the monitors were almost as bright as the muted glow of the lamps in the dusky atmosphere the patient was being encouraged to rest but that was about all pittman did understand and as he crouched in the darkness beside the metal deck furniture he wiped rain from his face shivered from the cold and asked himself what he should do you proved your suspicion that was jonathan millgate they took from the hospital you dont know why but you do know where they took him and thats all you can do for now its time to go youll get pneumonia if you stay in this rain much longer that final thought made pittman smile with bitterness you almost killed yourself tonight and now youre worried about catching pneumonia not yet your time isnt up for another eight days and it wont be pneumonia that kills you he watched the man with the stethoscope leave the dusky room as the nurse continued inspecting millgates monitors and tubes pittman turned toward the stairs that led down from the sundeck he heard a noise that paralyzed him it came from directly below him a combination of a drone and a rumble the roof of the sundeck vibrated beneath pittmans wet shoes one of the motorized garage doors was being opened pittmans heartbeat quickened he crouched lower making certain that he wouldnt be a silhouette against the roofline nonetheless he was able to see light spill from the garage revealing raindrops on dark puddles as the door opened higher then stopped its motor becoming silent in the unnerving quiet varied only by the hiss of the drizzle pittman suddenly heard the scrape of footsteps on concrete the creak of car doors being opened the echo of voices priest an elderly mans brittle voice said taut with emotion dont worry a second elderly voice said i told you the priest never arrived jonathan never spoke to him even so its been taken care of the second aged voice emphasized reminding pittman of the rattle of dead leaves its safe now secure but the reporters have no idea where jonathan is everything is under control the best thing we can do is separate and get back to a pretense of normalcy throughout pittman heard the sound of people getting into a vehicle now he heard the thunk of car doors being closed the sudden roar of an engine headlights blazed a dark limousine surged out of the garage and sped along the murky driveway past trees and shrubs and toward the gate that led from the estate pittmans bent legs cramped he began to stand then flinched when he heard further voices the taxi another aged voice said if youre correct that we were followed this voice was crusty yet filled with phlegm pittman couldnt make out the rest of the sentence what he heard instead was a louder rumbling drone as a second garage door rose other lights gleamed into the drizzlemisted night when the noise of the garage door stopped pittman strained to listen hoping that the voices would continue a coincidence a late commuter coming from manhattan but in a taxi perhaps the trains dont run this late there might be several explanations until we know for certain i refuse to become alarmed but we saw the headlights go past the gate as we drove toward the house you heard me send harold to look into the matter if it was the same taxi it had less than a minutes head start before harold went after it and if the taxi came from manhattan it would be one of few if any in the area at this hour its city of origin would be marked on the vehicle im certain that harold would intercept it well before it reached the thruway youll keep me informed of course relax look at how your hands are shaking be calm my friend you didnt use to worry this much i didnt have as much to lose nor did we all good night eustace goodnight anthony despite the worry in their voices the tone of the old men was strikingly affectionate car doors thunked shut an engine roared another dark limousine sped from the garage and along the murky driveway from above crouching in the darkness of the sundeck pittman watched the taillights recede then disappear the sound of the limousines fading into the silence of the night with a final droning rumble all the garage doors descended cutting off the lights inside the gloom in the area intensified pittman slowly straightened his legs were stiff his calves prickled as blood resumed its flow through arteries that had been constricted he turned toward the french doors for a final look at jonathan millgate helpless in his bed surrounded by monitors bottles and tubes pittmans pulse faltered through the gaps in the draperies what he saw seemed magnified by the glass panes in the french doors at the same time he felt as if he watched helplessly from a great distance the nurse had left the room leaving millgate alone she had shut the door millgate had not been asleep contrary to what she evidently believed instead he was attempting to raise himself millgates features were twisted agitated the oxygen prongs had slipped from his nostrils his iv tubes had become disengaged from the needle in each of his arms he pawed with both hands trying to grasp the railings on his bed with sufficient strength to raise himself but he wasnt succeeding his face had become an alarming red his chest heaved abruptly he slumped back gasping even at a distance through the barrier of the french doors pittman thought he heard millgates strident effort to breathe before pittman realized he stepped closer to the window the warning buzzer on the heart monitor should have alerted the nurse he thought in dismay she should have hurried back by now but as pittman stared through the window he was close enough that he knew he would have been able to hear an alarm even through the glass had the sound been turned off that didnt make sense he studied the pattern of blips on the monitor from so many days of watching jeremys monitors and insisting that the doctors explain what the indicators said pittman could tell from millgates monitor that his heartbeat was far above the normal range of to per minute disturbingly rapid at its pattern of beats was becoming erratic the rhythm of the four chambers of his heart beginning to disintegrate a crisis would come soon millgates color was worse his chest heaved with greater distress he clutched at his blankets as if they were crushing him he cant get his breath pittman thought the oxygen if he doesnt get those prongs back into his nostrils hell work himself into another heart attack the son of a bitch is going to die pittman had a desperate impulse to turn race down the steps surge toward the estates wall scurry over and run keep running never stop running jesus i should never have done this i should never have come here he pivoted eager to reach the stairs down from the sundeck but his legs wouldnt move he felt as if he were held in cement his will refused to obey his commands move damn it get out of here instead he looked back in agony millgate continued to struggle to breathe his pulse was now red numbers on his bloodpressure monitor showed normal was the elevated pressure was a threat to anyone let alone an eightyyearold man whod just had a heart attack that placed him in intensive care clutching his chest gasping millgate cocked his head toward the french doors his anguished expression fixed on the windows pittman was sure millgate couldnt see him out in the darkness the dim lights in the room would reflect off the panes and make them a screen against the night even so millgates tortured gaze was like a laser that seared into pittman dont look at me like that what do you expect theres nothing i can do yet again pittman turned to flee instead surprising himself pittman reached into his pants pocket and took out his keys and the tool knifesimilar to a swiss army knifethat he kept on his key ring he removed two pieces of metal from the end of the knife he was fully prepared to shoot himself to death in eight days but there was no way he was going to stay put and watch while someone else diedor run before it happened and try to convince himself that he didnt have a choice millgate was about to go into a crisis and on the face of it the most obvious way to try to prevent that crisis was to reattach his iv lines and put the oxygen prongs back into his nostrils maybe im wrong and hell die anyhow but by god if he does it wont be because i didnt try millgates death wont be my responsibility thinking of the in the box at the diner pittman thought what have i got to lose he stepped to the french doors and hesitated only briefly before he put the two metal prongs into the lock the tool knife from which he had taken the prongs had been a gift from a man about whom pittman had once written an article the man a veteran burglar named sean oreilly had been paroled from a tenyear prison sentence one of the conditions being that he participate in a publicawareness program to show homeowners and apartment dwellers how to avoid being burglarized sean had the slight build of a jockey the accent of an irish spring commercial and the mischievously glinting eyes of a leprechaun his three television spots had been so effective that hed become a new york city celebrity that was before he went back to prison for burglarizing the home of his attorney when he had interviewed him at the height of his fame pittman had suspected that sean would end up back in prison in elaborate detail sean had explained various ways to break into a house pittmans enthusiasm for information had prompted sean to elaborate and dramatize the interview had lasted two hours at its end sean had presented pittman with a giftthe tool knife he still carried i give these to people who really understand what an art it is to be a burglar sean had said what made the knife especially useful he explained was that at the end of the handle past miniature pliers screwdrivers and wire cutters there were slots for two metal prongs lockpicking tools with glee sean had taught pittman how to use them the lesson had stuck now pittman worked the prongs into the lock it was sturdya dead bolt it didnt matter one prong was used to free the pins in the cylinder sean had explained the other was used to apply leverage and pressure once you did it a couple of times the simple operation wasnt hard to master with practice and sean watching pittman had learned how to enter a locked room within fifteen seconds as he freed one pin and shoved the first prong farther into the cylinder to free the next pittman stared frantically through the french door toward millgates agonized struggle to breathe pittman increased his concentration working harder he had worried that when he opened the door he would trigger an alarm but his worry had vanished when hed noticed a securitysystem number pad on the wall next to the opposite entrance to the room from his interview with the bugmaster pittman remembered that owners of large homes often had their security company install several number pads throughout their homes these pads armed and disarmed the system and it made sense to have a pad not just at the front door but at all the principal exits from the dwelling but in this case the security company had installed the pad in the wrong placewithin view of anyone who might be trying to break in through the french doors from pittmans vantage point as he freed another pin in the cylinder of the lock he could see that the illuminated indicator on the number pad said ready to arm because so many visitors had been coming and going the system had not yet been activated pittman felt the final pin disengage turning the second metal prong he pivoted the cylinder and the lock was released in a rush he turned the latch and pulled the door open the opposite door was closed no one could hear pittman as he hurried into the dusky room millgate was losing strength his effort to breathe less strenuous pittman reached him and eased the prongs for the oxygen tube into millgates nostrils the effect was almost magical within seconds millgates color had begun to be less flushed his agitation lessened a few more seconds and the rise and fall of millgates chest became more regular less frenzied throughout pittman was in motion he grabbed the iv tubes that millgate had inadvertently jerked from the needles in his arms as pittman inserted the tubes back onto the base of each needle he noticed that liquid from the tubes had trickled onto the floor how would the nurse account for that when she came back into the room he wondered then he noticed the water tracks that he had brought in from the rain the moisture dripping off his overcoat i have to get out of here a final look at the monitors showed him that millgates blood pressure respiration rate and heartbeat were becoming less extreme the old guys going to make it a while longer pittman thought relieved anxious he turned to leave the room but he was shocked as an aged clawlike hand grabbed his right wrist making him gasp pittman swung in alarm and saw millgates anguished eyes staring at him pittman clutched the old mans fingers and worked to pry them off surprised by the ferocity of the old mans grip jesus if he yells duncan the old man spoke with effort his voice thin and crackly like cellophane being crumpled hes delirious he doesnt know who hes talking to duncan the old man seemed to plead he thinks im somebody else ive been in here too long i have to get out duncan the old mans voice thickened now sounding like crusted mud being stepped upon the snow pittman released the old mans fingers grollier the old mans throat filled with phlegm making a grotesque imitation of the sound of gargling to hell with this pittman thought then swung toward the french doors he was suddenly caught in a column of light the entrance to the room had been opened illumination from the hall spilled in silhouetting the nurse she stood paralyzed for a moment abruptly she dropped a tray a teapot and cup crashed onto the floor she screamed and pittman ran pittmans brief time in the room had made him feel warm as he raced onto the sundeck the night and the rain seemed much more chilling than they had only a few seconds earlier he shivered and lunged through puddles past the dark metal patio furniture and toward the stairs that led down from the deck at once he was blinded powerful arc lamps glaring down at him from the eaves of the mansion above the sundeck reflecting off puddles the nurse or a guard had switched on the lights from inside the building behind him pittman heard shouts he ran harder he almost lost his balance on the stairs gripping the railing flinching from a sliver that rammed into his palm he bounded down the wooden steps at the bottom he almost scurried in the direction from which he had come toward the treelined driveway and the gate from the estate but he heard shouts from the front of the house so he pivoted toward the back only to recoil from arc lights that suddenly blazed toward the covered swimming pool and the flower gardens there too he heard shouting with the front and rear blocked to him pittman charged to the side of the house across concrete at the entrance to the large garage over spongy lawn toward looming dark fir trees rapid footsteps clattered down the stairs from the sundeck stop shoot him pittman reached the fir trees a needled branch pawed his face stinging him so hard that he didnt know if the moisture on his cheeks was rain or blood he ducked avoiding another branch where the there i think hes over behind pittman a bough snapped someone fell my nose i think i broke my fucking i hear in those bushes shoot the son of a bitch get him if they find out we let somebody another branch snapped behind him pittmans hunters charged through the trees just in time pittman stopped himself hed come to a high stone wall nearly running into it at full force breathing deeply he fiercely studied the darkness to his left and then his right what am i going to do he thought in a frenzy i cant assume ill find a gate i cant keep following the wall too obvious theyll listen for the sounds i make theyll get ahead of me and behind me and corner me turn back no the police will soon arrive the house has too many outside lights ill be spotted then what are you going to pittman hurried toward the nearest fir tree and started to climb the footsteps of his pursuers thudded rapidly closer he gripped a bough above him shoved his right shoe against a lower branch and hoisted himself upward along the trunk bark scraped his hands the fir tree smell of turpentine assaulted his nostrils he climbed faster i hear him across from the top of the wall pittman reached out along a branch let his legs fall away from the tree trunk and inched hand over hand toward the wall the branch dipped from his weight dangling he kept shifting along the bark cut deeper into his hands hes close where moisture dropped from the fir needles onto pittman even greater moisture dropped from the branch to which he clung water cascaded onto the ground there that tree pittmans shoes touched the top of the wall he swung his legs toward it felt a solid surface no razor wire or chunks of glass along the top and released his grip sprawling on the top of the wall the gunshot was deafening the muzzle flash startlingly bright a second shot was so dismaying that pittman acted without thinking flipping sideways off the top of the wall heart pounding he dangled the rough wall scraped against his overcoat he didnt know what was below him but he heard one of his pursuers trying to climb the tree another man shouted use the gate pittman let go his stomach swooped as he plummeted exhaling forcefully pittman struck the ground sooner than he anticipated the ground was covered with grass mushy from rain he bent his knees tucked in his elbows dropped and rolled trying desperately to minimize the impact that was the way a skydiver he had once interviewed had explained how parachutists landed when they were using conventional equipment bend tuck and roll pittman prayed it would work if he sprained an ankle or worse he would be helpless when his pursuers searched this side of the wall his only hope would be to hide but where as he had swung toward the top of the wall his impression of the dark area behind it had been of unnerving open space fortunately he had an alternative to being forced to try to hide using the momentum of his roll he surged to his feet his hands stung his knees felt sore but that discomfort was irrelevant what mattered was that his ankles supported him his legs didnt give out he hadnt sprained or broken anything on the other side of the barrier pittmans hunters cursed and ran noises in a tree suggested that one of them continued to climb toward the top of the wall his chest heaving pittman charged forward the murky lawn seemed to stretch on forever in contrast with the estate from which hed just escaped there werent any shrubs there were hardly any trees what the hell is this place it felt unnatural eerie it reminded him of a cemetery but in the darkness he didnt bump into any tombstones racing through the drizzle he noticed a light patch in the lawn ahead and used it as a destination at once the ground gave away a sharp slope that caused him to tumble in alarm falling rolling he came to a stop on his back the wind had been knocked from him he breathed heavily wiped wet sand from his face and stood sand that explained why this section of the ground had been pale but why would a tingle ran through him my god its a golf course thered been a sign when the taxi driver brought him into the subdivision saxon woods park and golf club im in the open if they start shooting again theres no cover then what are you hanging around for as he oriented himself making sure that he wasnt running back toward the wall he saw lights to his left specterlike they emerged from the wall pittman had heard one of his pursuers talk about a gate theyd reached it and come through his first instinct was to conclude that they had found flashlights somewhere probably from a shed near the gate but there was something about the lights the tingle that pittman had felt when he realized that he was on a golf course now became a cold rush of fear as he heard the sound of motors the lights were too big to come from flashlights and they were in pairs like headlights but pittmans hunters couldnt be using cars cars would be too heavy losing traction spinning their wheels until they got stuck in the soft wet grass besides the motors sounded too small and whiny to belong to cars jesus theyre using golf carts pittman realized his chest tightening whoever owns the estate has private carts and access to the course from the back of the property golf carts dont have headlights those are handheld spotlights the carts spread out the lights systematically covering various sections of the course as men shouted pittman spun away from the lights darted from the sand trap and scurried into the rainy darkness before jeremys cancer had been diagnosed pittman had been a determined jogger he had run a minimum of an hour each day and several hours on the weekend mostly using the jogging path along the upper east side next to the river he had lived on east seventieth at that time with ellen and jeremy and his view of exercise had been much the same as his habit of saving percent of his paycheck and making sure that jeremy took summer courses at his school even though the boys grades were superior and extra work wasnt necessary security planning for the future that was the key that was the secret with his son cheering and his wife doing her best to look dutifully enthusiastic pittman had managed to be among the middle group that finished the new york marathon one year then jeremy had gotten sick and jeremy had died and pittman and ellen had started arguing and ellen had left and ellen had remarried and pittman had started drinking heavily and pittman had suffered a nervous breakdown he hadnt run in over a year for that matter he hadnt done any exercise at all unless nervous pacing counted but now adrenaline spurred him and his body remembered it didnt have its onceexcellent tone it didnt have the strength that hed worked so hard to acquire but it still retained his technique the rhythm and length and heeltotoe pattern of his stride he was out of breath his muscles protested but he kept charging across the golf course responding to a pounding in his veins and a fire in his guts while behind him lights bobbed in the distance motors whined and men shouted pittmans effort was so excruciating that he cursed himself for ever having allowed himself to get out of shape then he cursed himself for having been so foolhardy as to get into this situation what the hell did you think you were doing following the ambulance all the way out here burt wouldnt have known if you hadnt bothered no but id have known i promised burt id do my best for eight more days what about breaking into that house do you call that standard journalistic procedure burt would have a fit if he knew you did that what was i supposed to do let the old man die as pittmans stiffening legs did their best to imitate the expert runners stride that had once been second nature to him he risked losing time to glance back at his pursuers wiping moisture from his eyes he saw the drizzlehaloed spotlights on the golf carts speeding toward him in the darkness or some of the carts all told there were five but only two were directly behind him the rest had split off one to the right the other to the left evidently following the perimeter of the golf course the third was speeding on a diagonal toward what pittman assumed was the far extreme of the course they want to encircle me pittman realized but in the darkness how can they be sure which way im going rain trickled down his neck beneath his collar he felt the hairs on his scalp rise when he suddenly understood how his pursuers were able to follow him his london fog overcoat it was sandcolored just as pittman had been able to see the light color of the sand trap against the darkness of the grass so his overcoat was as obvious to his pursuers forced to break stride running awkwardly pittman desperately worked at the belt on his overcoat untying it then fumbling at buttons one button didnt want to be released and pittman yanked at it popping it loose in a frenzy he had the coat open he jerked his arm from one sleeve he freed his other arm his suit coat had been somewhat dry but now drizzle soaked it pittmans first impulse was to throw the overcoat away his next impulse as he entered a clump of brush was to drape the coat over a bush to provide a target for the men chasing him that tactic wouldnt distract them for long though he knew and besides if when he escaped he would need the coat to help keep him warm the brushy area was too small to be a good hiding place so pittman fled it scratching his hands on bushes and continued charging across the murky golf course glancing desperately back over his shoulder he saw the glare of the lights on the carts he heard the increasingly loud whine of their engines rolling his overcoat into a ball and stuffing it under his suit jacket he strained his legs to their maximum one thing was in his favor he was wearing a dark blue suit in the rainy blackness he hoped he would blend with his surroundings unless the lights pick me up he thought ahead a section of the golf course assumed a different color a disturbing gray approaching it swiftly pittman realized that hed reached a pond the need to skirt it would force him to lose time no choice breathing hard he veered to the left but the wet slippery grass along the slope betrayed him his left foot jerked from under him he fell and almost tumbled into the freezing water before he clawed his fingers into the mushy grass and managed to stop himself rising frantically he remembered to keep his overcoat clutched beneath his suit jacket with an urgent glance backward he saw a beam of light shoot over the top of the slope down which hed rolled the whine of an engine was very close concentrating not to lose his balance again pittman scurried through the rainy darkness he followed the rim of the pond struggled up the opposite slope and lunged over the top just before he heard angry voices behind him something buzzed past his right ear it sounded like a hornet but pittman knew what it was a bullet another hornet buzzed past him no sound of shots his hunters must have put silencers on their handguns he scurried down a slope out of their line of fire to his right through the rain he saw lights trying to overtake him to his left he saw the same his legs were so fatigued they wanted to buckle his heaving lungs protested cant keep this up much longer he fought to muster energy have to keep going too late he saw the lightcolored patch ahead of him the grass dropped sharply unable to stop he hurtled out into space flailed and jolted down into another sand trap the impact dropped him to his knees he struggled upright feeling the heaviness of wet sand clinging to his trousers spotlights bobbed speeding nearer with a final burst of energy he struggled across the sand trap his shoes sank into the drizzlesoftened sand he left a deep wide trail jesus even if they dont have my overcoat as a target theyll know from my tracks which way i went when i reached the grass he thought tracks pittmans skin prickled as he realized that this might be his only chance to save himself the instant he raced out of the sand onto the grass he reversed his direction and hurried through the darkness along the edge of the sand trap toward the top of the slope from which he had leapt as he ran through the drizzle he yanked his balled overcoat from beneath his suit jacket the whine of an engine sounded terribly close spotlights bobbed above him he came to where the grass dropped sharply toward the sand careful not to disturb this section he eased over the edge and lay sideways where the sand met the almostvertical sharp downward angle of the earth there he spread his sandcolored overcoat across his head and suit jacket he felt its weight on his lower thighs almost covering his knees he bent his legs and drew them toward his body tucking them under the hem of the overcoat his breathing sounded hoarse he strained to control it please he kept thinking please with his overcoat covering his head he heard drizzle patter onto him he heard the whine of enginesclose the whine diminished abruptly as if the carts had come to a stop vapor from pittmans breath collected under the overcoat dank moisture dribbled along his chin the wet chill made him shiver although he compacted his muscles and struggled not to tremble cant let them notice me he shivered for another reason anticipating the impact of a bullet isnt that what you wanted if they shoot you theyll be doing you a favor but i want it to be my idea he silently prayed if only his overcoat blended with the sand if only the men stared straight ahead instead of looking down at there pittmans heartbeat lurched tracks in the sand toward that section of grass something made an electronic crackle a walkietalkie alpha to beta hes headed in your direction hes reached the northeast quadrant a garbled voice responded the walkietalkie made an electronic squawk the whine of the engines intensified beneath the smothering moistureladen overcoat pittman heard the carts speed away past the sand trap toward the continuation of the grass his clothes soaked from the wet sand he lay upon pittman waited not daring to move despite the stifling buildup of carbon dioxide beneath the overcoat he forced himself to continue to wait at last he relented slowly moving the coat as he inched it off his face inhaling the fresh cool air he squinted toward the darkness afraid that he would see a man above him grin and aim a pistol but he saw only the slope of the earth above him darkness and drizzle pelting his eyes after the cloying stale air beneath the coat the rain made him feel clean he eased upward came to a trembling crouch and saw the lights of the carts receding in the murky distance careful to bunch his overcoat beneath his suit coat he crept from the sand trap and headed in the direction from which the carts had come he was soaked chilled but for all his discomfort and apprehension a portion of his mind was swollen with exultation nonetheless he still had to get out of the area off this golf course away from the estate the carts might return at any time although his legs were unsteady he managed to lengthen his stride and increase its frequency enveloped by the night and the rain he almost faltered with increased dread when it occurred to him that without a way to keep his bearings he might wander in a circle until his pursuers came upon him immediately in the distance to his left he saw moving lights but not those on the carts these were larger brighter their beams probed deeper through the rain the headlights of a car or maybe a truck they moved parallel to him then disappeared a road two car trouble man look at you shiver the motel clerk said got soaked finding a pay phone to call a tow truck the garage says my car wont be ready till the afternoon i need a place to get dry i guess youre not from around here the clerk was paunchy in his forties he had thick red beard stubble and strained features from working all night pittman shook his head im on the road a lot selling college textbooks left new haven last night for a meeting in new york looks like youre not going to make it i didnt have to be at the meeting till monday figured id spend the weekend having a good time shit pittman gave the clerk his credit card and filled out the registration form making sure to claim a new haven address he felt strange lying but he knew he had to the clerk needed a reasonable explanation for pittmans drenched appearance and the truth certainly wasnt acceptable heres your card back heres your key pittman sneezed man you need to get out of those wet clothes thats all ive been thinking of the name had been appealing warm welcome motel pittman had found it among several other motels a half hour after hed hurried shivering from the golf course area houses had been dark streetlights widely separated whenever he saw headlights he had darted toward the shelter of bushes or a backyard before he could be seen hed had a vague idea of which way the thruway was fear had spurred him now as he locked the motel door behind him the last of his energy drained from him he sank into a lumpy chair and sipped the cardboard cup of bitter but wonderfully hot coffee that hed bought from a noisy machine at the end of the concreteblock hallway the rooms carpet was green and worn he didnt care the walls were an unappealing yellow he didnt care about that either or about the hollow beneath the dingy orange cover of the mattress on the bed all he cared about was heat need to get warm his teeth chattered need a hot bath he turned the rooms thermostat to seventyfive then stripped off his wet clothes after arranging his trousers shirt and suit coat on hangers he left the closet door open in hopes they would dry he put his soaked shoes near the baseboard radiator draped his socks and underwear over the back of a chair and twisted the hotwater faucet on the bathtub for an instant he was afraid that the water would be only tepid instead it sent steam billowing around him he leaned over the gushing tap luxuriating in the heat only when the tub was nearly full did he add any cold water just enough so he wouldnt scald himself as he settled into the exquisitely hot bath he slid down until the steaming water came up to his chin the tub was so full that water trickled into the overflow drain by shifting sideways he managed to tuck his knees under so he was almost completely submerged he exhaled with pleasure and felt heat penetrate his skin his muscles his bones dissipating the heavy chill that had gathered at his core gradually his arms and legs stopped quivering he closed his eyes and realized that he hadnt enjoyed a physical sensation so much since his mind balked but finally permitted the thought since the night jeremy had died he had felt so guilty being alive while jeremy was dead that he hadnt been able to tolerate even the simplest most basic of pleasures the taste of a good meal had become repugnantbecause jeremy would never again be able to enjoy that sensation the soothing feel of clean sheets the freshness of a morning breeze the comfort of sunlight streaming through a window any positive sensation was abhorrentbecause jeremy would never be able to share them and one of the sensations that had made pittman feel especially guilty was the warmth of a shower jeremy had enjoyed spending what had seemed to pittman before jeremy got sick an undue amount of time in the shower after jeremys funeral pittman had suddenly discovered that he felt repelled by the thought of a shower since he needed to clean himself he had moderated the problem by keeping the temperature of the water as neutral as he could manage just because he had to bathe didnt mean that he had to enjoy it now for the first time since jeremys death pittman was surprised to discover that he was allowing himself to experience a pleasurable sensation he told himself that the sensation was necessary that he absolutely needed to get warm after all he had once done a story about participants in a wilderness survival course and one of the dangers that the instructors had kept emphasizing was that of becoming wet and chilled and dying from hypothermia so yes he could grudgingly allow a positive sensation under this circumstance but the truth was his enjoyment wasnt just tolerated he relished it for the first time in longer than he cared to remember he appreciated the feelings of his body but thoughts of jeremy caused a black pall of gloom to sink over his mind again he found it bleakly ironic that despite his eagerness to commit suicide his escape from the estate had prompted him to endure such intense fear for his life you should have let them do you a favor and shoot you no pittman angrily echoed a thought from a few hours earlier it has to be my idea not theirs when i go out itll be my way at a time and place of my own choosing ive got my own deadline eight days from now and i damned well intend to stick to it not sooner his anger became melancholy as he remembered the reason that he hadnt already killed himself i promised burt for what burt did for jeremy then melancholy became confusion as thoughts about burt reminded pittman of why he had followed the ambulance he imagined the questions that burt would demand answers for why had millgate been taken from the hospital why had he been driven to the estate in scarsdale why had the guards at the estate not just pursued pittman but instead tried to kill him as soon as pittman was off the property the risk the guards thought he posed would have been at an end pittman could understand them wanting to capture him and turn him over to the police but to want to kill him something was very wrong after draining the tub and refilling it with more hot water pittman finally felt that the chill within him had been smothered he pulled the plug and got out of the tub to towel himself vigorously again he caught himself enjoying a sensation and checked the impulse after wrapping himself with a blanket he turned off the lights and peered past the blind on the rooms window it looked out onto the motels rainpuddled parking lot he saw a car come in and worried that it might be the police who alerted by the guards at the estate would be out looking for him but the car didnt have any dome lights on its roof and it wasnt marked pittman wondered then if the car might belong to the estate that this might be some of the guards searching the area for him talking to clerks at various motels only when he saw a woman get out of the car and enter a room on the other side of the parking lot did his tension ease the police at the golf course he hadnt heard any sirens did that mean the police had not been alerted he wondered how would the guards have explained shooting at a prowler after the prowler had reached a public area and the guards would they still be hunting him they might check the local motels sure but wasnt it more logical for them to assume that their quarry would want to get as far away as possible besides they dont know who i am or what i look like pittmans knees buckled from fatigue shivering he crawled into bed and gradually became warm again he told himself that he would sleep for a couple of hours burt usually got to the newspaper around eight pittman would call tell burt what had happened and get instructions id better tell the desk clerk to wake me around eight pittman thought in the dark he reached for the telephone but his arm felt weighted down he drifted pittman woke slowly groggily his eyelids not wanting to open at first he thought it was the bright sunlight through the rooms thin blind that had wakened him then he suspected it was the din of thruway traffic rattling the window sore from his exertion the night before he sat up and rubbed his legs finally he left the warmth of the bed and relieved himself in the bathroom when he returned to the bed wrapping a blanket around him he felt sufficiently awake to phone burt but when he reached toward the bedside phone he noticed the red numbers on the digital clock beside it jesus he thought straightening its not morning its friday afternoon i slept almost ten hours the discovery made him feel out of control as if hed lost somethingwhich he had one of his remaining days he hurriedly picked up the phone read a card next to it that told him to press for a longdistance call then touched the numbers for the chronicle the line made a faint crackling sound the phone at the other end rang and fifteen seconds later the newspapers receptionist transferred the call to burts office as usual burts crusty smokers voice was instantly recognizable he didnt need to announce as he always did yeah forsyth here its matt listen im sorry i didnt get in today something weird happened last night i was at i cant talk right now im in a meeting pittman heard a click as the call was interrupted what the pittman frowned and slowly set down the phone burts never that abrupt he thought not to me man he must really be pissed he figures i let him down by not coming in pittman picked up the phone again he couldnt tolerate the misunderstanding once more the receptionist transferred the call forsyth here this is matt look i said i was sorry i swear to you its not my fault ive got something i need to tell you about last night i dont have time for that im with some important people for a second time burt broke the connection pittmans head throbbed frowning harder he replaced the phone yeah hes pissed all right important people i get the point for letting him down hes telling me as far as hes concerned im not important pittman debated about calling a third time but reluctantly decided not to whatevers bugging him its obvious he isnt going to let me settle it over the phone troubled aching pittman stood and reached for his clothes they were damp but at least no longer soaked because he had hung his slacks shirt and suit coat on hangers there were less wrinkles than he feared another plus was that the mud on them had caked he was able to brush off most of it his overcoat was a mess however torn and grimy he crammed it into the wastebasket then he wet his rumpled sandy hair and combed it although he definitely needed a shave the motel didnt supply a shaving kit so that would have to wait hungry but in a hurry he remembered that hed seen a mcdonalds down the street no bags to pack all he had to do was grab his key and leave opening the door slightly he peered out to see if anyone was watching his room no one as far as he could tell as he crossed the parking lot toward the motels office he discovered that the air was chilly despite the bright sun his damp socks and underwear made him uncomfortable important people during the metro ride into the city pittman kept assessing what burt had told him the clackclackclack of the train on the rails became like a mantra and helped pittman to focus his concentration important people maybe burt had been telling the truth a week from today the chronicle would close its doors there had to be all kinds of complicated arrangements to make it was possible that the owner and the publisher and god knew who all were in burts office discussing the direction the newspaper should take in its final days but wouldnt people that important make burt go to their office rather than want to meet in his pittman reversed the direction of his thoughts and again suspected that burt was angry at him in rushhour traffic outside grand central station pittman couldnt find an empty cab so he decided to use the subway his intention had been to go to the chronicle but his watch now showed eight minutes after five the sun was low behind skyscrapers the air had turned cold and pittmans damp clothes made him shiver again burt wouldnt be at the office now anyway he thought hed be on his way to the bar where he always went after work im not going to sit in that bar and have my teeth chatter all the time im trying to explain what i need first are dry clothes pittman got out of the subway at union square still couldnt find an empty cab and walked all the way to his apartment on west twelfth street the air was colder the light paler as he hurried along he unlocked the door to the vestibule of his building then he unlocked the farther door that allowed him past the mailboxes into the groundfloor corridor of the building itself as usual the smell of cooking assailed him also as usual the elevator wheezed and creaked taking him to the third floor as usual too the television was blaring in the apartment next to his he shook his head in discouragement unlocked the door stepped in shut and locked the door and turned to discover a man sitting in his living room reading a magazine pittmans heartbeat faltered what the the man set down the magazine is your name matthew pittman what the hell do you think youre the man was in his late thirties thin he had short brown hair a slender face a sharp chin he wore a plain gray suit and shoes with thick soles im with the police department he opened a wallet to show his badge and id he stood his expression sour as if hed much sooner be doing something else detective mullen id like to ask you a few questions how did you get in here i asked the super to let me in pittman felt pressure in his chest you cant just you dont have a right to damn it have you got a warrant or something why have you done something that makes you think id need a warrant no i then why dont you save us both a lot of time sit down lets discuss a couple of things what things i still dont you look cold your clothes look like theyve been wet pittman hurriedly thought of an acceptable explanation yeah a waiter spilled water on my jacket and pants and the detective nodded same thing happened to me two weeks ago not water though linguini youd better change leave the door to your bedroom open a bit we can talk while you get dry clothes also you look like you could use a shave ive been trying to grow a beard pittman lied in the bedroom listening to the detectives voice through the slightly open door he nervously took off his clothes threw them in a hamper then grabbed fresh underwear and socks from his bureau drawer he had just put on a pair of brown slacks when he saw the detective standing at the door i wonder if you could tell me where you were last night feeling threatened his nipples shrinking pittman reached for a shirt i was home for a while then i went for a walk the detective opened the door wider making pittman feel even more threatened what time did you go for the walk eleven and you came back around one the detective raised his eyebrows kind of dangerous to be out walking that late ive never had any trouble youve been lucky anybody see you pittman almost mentioned the cook at the diner but then he realized that if the detective talked to the cook the cook would mention the box pittman had left and the detective might find the handgun pittmans permit allowed him to keep the only in his apartment it would look suspicious that he had hidden the weapon somewhere else nobody saw me too bad that makes it difficult for what look i dont like your barging in here and i dont like being questioned when i dont know what this is all about pittman couldnt hide his agitation whos your superior at your precinct whats his telephone number good idea i think we ought to talk to him matter of fact why dont we both go down and talk to him in person fine good after i phone my lawyer oh the detective said you think you need a lawyer now when the police start acting like the gestapo aw the detective shook his head now youve hurt my feelings put on your shoes get a coat lets take a ride not until you tell me whats going on pittman couldnt get enough air you didnt go for a walk last night you took a taxi up to an estate in scarsdale and broke in i did what thats crazy the detective reached into his suit coat pocket and brought out an envelope he squinted at pittman opened the envelope and removed a sheet of paper whats this a xerox of a check the detective said pittmans stomach cramped when he saw that it was a copy of the check he had written to the taxi driver the previous night how the hell had the police gotten it the detectives expression became more sour as he explained an ambulance driver heading from manhattan to the scarsdale estate last night says a taxi followed him all the way he got suspicious and wrote down the id number on the light on the taxis roof so after we were contacted about the breakin at the estate we tracked down the cabbie he says the guy who hired him to drive up to that estate wrote a check to pay for the ride this check with your signature at the bottom with your name and address printed at the top pittman stared at the copy of the check well are you going to admit it or are you going to make me go to the trouble of bringing you and the cabbie facetoface so he can identify you pittman exhaled tensely given what he intended to do seven days from now what difference did it make so i broke into a house to save an old mans life he thought is that so big a crime what am i trying to hide all the same he hesitated yes it was me there now dont you feel better but i can explain of course after i call my lawyer pittman passed the detective at the door to the bedroom and entered the living room heading for the telephone were not going to have to go through that are we the detective stalked after him this is a simple matter and i want to keep it simple thats why i want to call my lawyer so there arent any misunderstandings pittman picked up the phone im asking you not to do that the detective said i have just a few questions theres no need for an attorney when you were with the old man did he say anything pittman shook his head i dont understand did he say anything whats that go to do with so what if the detective stepped closer his face stern did the old man say anything gibberish tell me pittman continued to hold the phone it didnt make any sense it sounded like duncan something then something about snow then i dont know i think he said grollier the detectives features tightened did you tell anybody else anybody else what difference would wait a minute this doesnt feel right whats going on here let me see your identification i already showed you i want to see it again the detective shrugged this is all the identification i need the detective reached beneath his suit coat and pittman stiffened his pulse speeding at the sight of the gun the detective pulled out the guns barrel was unusually long pittman suddenly realized that it wasnt a barrel but a silencer attached to the barrel policemen didnt carry silencers you meddling shit you give me any more trouble and ill put a goddamn bullet up your nose who else did you tell the tip of the silencer snagged as the mans gaze flickered down toward his suit coat pittman reacted without thinking a reflexive response despite his selfdestructive intentions he had no control over his bodys need to defend itself against sudden fear startled in a frenzy he swung the phone with all his might cracking its plastic against the mans forehead the man lurched backward blood streaked his brow he cursed struggling to focus his vision raising the pistol terrified pittman struck again smashing the mans nose more blood flew the man fell backward he walloped onto a coffee table shattered its glass top crashed through and slammed against the floor his upturned head ramming against the metal rim of the table staring at the pistol in the mans hand pittman raised the phone to strike a third time only to discover that hed stretched the extension cord to its limit trembling he dropped the phone and searched desperately around for something else with which to hit the man he grabbed a lamp about to throw it down at the mans head when at once he realized that the man wasnt moving the mans eyes were open so was his mouth his head was propped against the far metal rim of the coffee table his legs bent at the knees hung over the near rim holding the lamp high ready to throw it pittman stepped closer the mans chest wasnt moving dear god hes dead time seemed to have accelerated simultaneously pittman felt caught between heartbeats as if time had been suspended for seconds that might have been minutes he continued to stare down at the man with the gun slowly he set the lamp back on its table he knelt beside the man his emotions in chaos how did i didnt hit him hard enough to christ he must have broken his neck when he smashed through the glass his head hid the metal side of the table then pittman noticed the blood pooling on the floor under the mana lot of it afraid that the man would spring into motion and aim the gun at him pittman touched the corpses arm and shifted the body he swallowed bile when he saw that a long shard of glass had been rammed into the mans back between his shoulder blades pittmans face felt clammy he was thirtyeight years old he had never been in the military apart from the previous night and the saturday seven years earlier when the two men had broken his jaw his only experience with violence had been through people he had interviewed who were acquainted with violence either as victims criminals or police officers and now he had killed a man appalled by the blood on the telephone he gingerly set it on its receptacle what am i going to abruptly he worried that somebody had heard the crash he swung toward the wall behind which the neighbors television blaredpeople laughing an announcer saying something about a trip to jamaica people applauding a game show he expected to hear urgent footsteps the neighbor pounding on the door instead what he heard was the tv announcer giving out a prize on the game show no matter the noise from the television his apartment seemed eerily quiet what if i was wrong and he really is a policeman breathing with effort pittman opened the mans suit coat and took out the police identification that the man had shown him a card next to the badge said that the detectives name was william mullen the photograph on the id matched the face of the dead man but as pittman examined it he was unnerved to discover that the photograph had been pasted over another photograph which didnt look anything like the corpse pittman checked the mans wallet and in addition to almost four hundred dollars he found a drivers license in the name of edward halloway residence in alexandria virginia pittman had never heard of any new york city policeman who lived several states away this definitely wasnt a cop what the hell was he then the phone rang pittman stared the phone rang a second time who would the phone rang a third time should i the phone rang a fourth time suppose its burt pittman picked it up listening he said nervously hello pause click jesus in a rush pittman entered his bedroom grabbed a brown sport coat and pulled his suitcase from his closet instantly he put the suitcase back and took out the gym bag he had used when he had still been a runner he had once interviewed a security specialist who was an expert in blending with a crowd one of the hard things the expert had said was to find something that would hold weapons or equipment but not be conspicuous a suitcase was too bulky and besides anybody who carried a suitcase into any public building other than a transportation terminal attracted attention conversely while a briefcase looked more natural especially if you were well dressed it wasnt big enough but a reasonably attractive gym bag was ideal enough people went to exercise after work that a gym bag appeared natural even if the person carrying it wore a suit although casual clothes were obviously better and a gym bag held a lot trembling pittman put a fresh pair of underwear and socks into the bag he shoved in an extra shirt a tie his black sweat suit his running shoes his electric razor a toothbrush toothpaste and shampoo what else this isnt summer camp youre going to you have to get out of here fast that phone call was probably from someone working with the gunman pittman hurried into the living room frowned down at the corpse and almost took the four hundred dollars from the dead mans wallet that would look great to the police after you killed him you thought why not steal from him too what about his gun what about it do i take it who do you think you are john wayne you know enough about guns to shoot yourself not anybody else as the phone started ringing again pittman grabbed his spare overcoat opened his apartment door peered out saw no one went into the dimly lit corridor and locked the door behind him in his apartment the phone kept ringing he hurried toward the elevator but the moment he reached it extending his right hand to press the down button not yet touching it he heard a buzz creaking the elevator began to rise from the ground floor pittman felt pressure behind his ears he headed down the stairs but froze as he heard footsteps scraping far below him coming up the concrete steps echoing louder as they ascended from the ground floor invisible arms seemed to pin his chest squeezing him one man in the elevator another on the stairs that would make sense no one could come down without their knowing pittman backed up straining to be silent again in the corridor he analyzed his options and crept up the stairs toward the next floor out of sight he heard the elevator stop and footsteps come out they hesitated in the corridor other footsteps those in the stairwell came up to the third floor and joined whoever had gotten out of the elevator no one spoke as both sets of footsteps proceeded along the corridor they stopped about where pittman judged his apartment would be he heard a knock then another he heard the scrape of metal that he recognized as the sound of lockpick tools a different kind of metallic sound might have been the click of a gun being cocked he heard a door being opened shit a man exclaimed as if hed seen the corpse in pittmans apartment immediately the footsteps went swiftly into a room the door was closed i cant stay here pittman thought they might search the building he swung toward the elevator door on the fourth floor and pressed the down button his hands shook as the elevator wheezed and groaned to his level part of him was desperate to flee down the stairs but what if the men came out and saw him this way hed be out of sight in the elevatorunless the men came out in the meantime and decided to use the elevator stopping it as it descended in which case hed be trapped in the cage with them but he had to take the risk suppose the men had left someone in the lobby pittman needed a way to get past and the elevator was it his face was slick with sweat as he got in the car and pressed the button for the basement as the car sank toward the third floor he imagined that he would hear a buzz that the car would stop that two men would get in he trembled watching the needle above the inside of the door point to then the needle began to point toward he exhaled sweat trickled down his chest under his shirt the needle pointed toward then b the car stopped the doors grated open he faced the musty shadows of the basement the moment he stepped out the elevator doors closed as he shifted past a furnace the elevator surprised him rising turning he watched the needle above the door the elevator stopped simultaneously via the stairwell he heard noises from the lobby footsteps voices see anybody no our guys just went up nobody came down not that i saw ive been here only five minutes somebody took the elevator to the basement basement what would anybody want down there a storage unit maybe check it out pittman hurried beyond the furnace in shadows he passed locked storage compartments he heard footsteps on the stairs behind him he came to the service door from the basement sweating more profusely he gently twisted the knob on the deadbolt lock desperate not to make noise the footsteps reached the bottom of the stairs pittman opened the door tensed from the squeak it made slipped out into the night shut the door and broke into a run the narrow alley only five feet wide led each way to twelfth street or past another apartment building to eleventh street reasoning that the men who were chasing him would have a car waiting in front of his building on twelfth street he darted past garbage cans toward eleventh street at the end a stout wooden door blocked his way clumsy with fright he twisted the knob on another dead bolt and tugged at the door flinching when he heard a noise far along the alley behind him he surged out onto eleventh street straining to adjust his eyes to the glare of headlights and streetlights breathing hard in panic he turned left and hurried past startled pedestrians his goal was farther west the din of traffic the safety of the congestion on seventh avenue and this time he did find an empty taxi burt forsyth wasnt married he considered his apartment a place only for changing his clothes sleeping and showering every night after work he followed the same routine several drinks and then dinner at bennies oldtime beefsteak tavern the regulars there were like a family to him the bar on east fiftieth street was out of tone with the expensive leathergoods store on its left and the designerdress store on its right it had garish neon lights in its windows and a sign bragging that the place had a bigscreen television as pittmans taxi pulled to a stop several customers were going in and out another taxi stopped to let someone off pittman studied the man then relaxed somewhat when the man went into the bar without looking in pittmans direction after using the last of his cash to pay the driver pittman glanced around felt somewhat assured that he hadnt been followed and hurried toward the entrance pittmans gym bag attracted no attention as he stood among patrons and scanned the crowded dimly lit noisy interior it was divided so that the beefsteak part of the bar was in a paneled section to the right a partition separated it from the serious drinking part of the establishment which was on the left there a long counter and several tables faced a bigscreen television that was always tuned to a sports channel pittman had been in the place a couple of times with burt and knew that burt preferred the counter but when he studied that area he didnt see burts distinctly rugged silhouette he stepped farther in working his way past two customers who were paying their bill at a cash register in front he craned his neck to check the busy tables but still saw no sign of burt pittman felt impatient he knew he had to get in touch with the police but his sense of danger at his apartment had prompted him to run once he escaped he had planned to use a pay phone to contact the police as soon as hed gotten in the taxi though hed said the first words that came into his mind bennies tavern he had to sort things out he had to talk to burt but burt wasnt in sight pittman tried to encourage himself with the thought that burt might have made an exception and chosen to eat in the restaurant part of the bar or maybe hes late maybe hes still coming maybe i havent missed him hurry the police will wonder why you didnt get in touch with them as soon as you escaped feeling a tightness in his chest pittman turned to make his way into the restaurant and caught a glimpse of a burly craggyfaced man in his fifties with a brush cut and bushy eyebrows the man wore a rumpled sport coat and was visible only for a moment as he passed customers and descended stairs built into the partition between the two sections of the building at the bottom of the hollowsounding wooden stairs pittman passed a coat room a pay phone and a door marked dolls he went into a door marked guys a thin man with a gray mustache was coming out of a toilet stall the man put on a blue suit coat and stepped next to a longhaired young man in a leather windbreaker at a row of sinks to wash his hands the burly man whom pittman had followed downstairs was standing to the left at a urinal his back to pittman burt the man looked over his shoulder and reacted with surprise a cigarette dangling from his mouth what are you doing here pittman walked toward him look i can explain why i wasnt at work today theres something i need to talk to you about believe me its serious the other men in the rest room listened with interest dont you realize it isnt safe burt said i tried to tell you on the phone today safe you sounded like you were giving me the brushoff a meeting important people sure urgent burt pulled up his zipper and pushed the urinals lever as water gushed into a drain he threw his cigarette into the urinal and pivoted for your information those important people were burt noticed the two men standing at the sinks watching him and gestured come on lets get out of here impatient pittman followed him out the door and along the hallway they stopped at its end a distance from the rest rooms and the stairs that led down burt whispered hoarsely those important people were the police what looking for you what havent you listened to the radio you didnt see the evening news i havent had time when i got back to my apartment a man look i dont know what you did last night but the cops think you broke into a house in scarsdale and murdered jonathan millgate what pittman stepped backward against the wall the man with the leather windbreaker came out of the mens room glanced curiously at pittman and burt then went up the stairs frustrated burt waited until the man disappeared look he said quietly sternly to pittman we cant talk here the police might be watching me in case you try to get in touch in fact i have a hunch one of thems at a table next to mine where then when can we talk meet me at eleven oclock madison square park the entrance on fifth avenue ill make sure im not followed damn it what did you get yourself into i want to know whats going on believe me burt youre not the only one pittman was so disoriented that only when he was out on the shadowy street did he realize that he should have asked burt to lend him some money the metro ride from scarsdale into manhattan and the taxi from his apartment to the restaurant had used all his cash he had his checkbook but he knew that the stores open at this hour would accept checks only for the amount of purchase that left pittman glanced nervously behind him saw no sign that anyone was following him and walked quickly toward fifth avenue there a few blocks south he came to the main office of the bank he used the automated teller machine was in an alcove to the left of the entrance he put his access card into the slot and waited for a message on the atms screen to ask him for his number to his surprise a different message appeared see bank officer the machine made a whirring sound it swallowed his card pittman gaped what the theres got to be some mistake why would the obvious dismaying answer occurred to him the police must have gotten a court order they froze my account burt was right havent you listened to the radio you didnt see the evening news burt had demanded pittman walked rapidly along a side street checking several taverns finding one that had a television behind the bar since the chronicle and all the other new york city newspapers came out in the morning they wouldnt have had enough time to run a story about anything that happened to jonathan millgate late last night the only ready source of news that pittman could think of was a cable channel like cnn he sat in a shadowy smokefilled corner of the tavern and in frustration watched the fourth round of a boxing match he fidgeted not sharing the enthusiasm of the other patrons in the bar about a sudden knockout come on he kept thinking somebody put on the news he almost risked drawing attention to himself by asking the man behind the bar to switch channels to cnn but just as pittman stood to approach the counter news came on after the fight and pittman was stunned to see his photograph on a screen behind the reporter the photo had been taken years earlier when pittman had had a mustache his features had been heavier not yet ravaged by grief nonetheless he immediately receded back into the shadows suicidal obituary writer kills ailing diplomat the reporter intoned obviously enjoying the lurid headline feeling his extremities turn cold as blood rushed to his stomach pittman listened in dismay the reporter qualified his story by frequently using the words alleged and possibly but his tone left no doubt that pittman was guilty according to the scarsdale police in cooperation with the manhattan homicide department pittmansuffering from a nervous breakdown as a consequence of his sons deathhad determined to commit suicide and had gone so far as to write his own obituary newswriters who had desks near pittman characterized him as being depressed and distracted he was said to be obsessed with jonathan millgate an obsession that had begun seven years earlier when pittman had become irrationally convinced that millgate was involved in a defenseindustry scandal pittman had stalked millgate so relentlessly for an interview that millgate had considered asking the police for a restraining order now in his weakened mental state pittman had again become fixated on millgate apparently enough to kill him as a prelude to pittmans suicide warned of the danger millgates aides had taken the precaution of moving the senior statesman from a new york hospital where he was recovering from a heart attack pittman had managed to follow millgate to an estate in scarsdale had broken into millgates room and had disconnected his lifesupport system killing him fingerprints on the outside door to millgates room as well as on millgates medical equipment proved that pittman had been inside a nurse had seen him flee from the old mans bedside a check that pittman had given to a new york city taxi driver who drove him to the estate had made it possible for the police to narrow their investigation to pittman as their main suspect pittman was still at large pittman stared at the television and strained to keep from shaking his sanity felt threatened despite the differences surely everyone in the tavern must know it was his photograph theyd just been shown he had to get onto the street before someone called the police the police pittman walked in alarmed confusion from the bar keeping his head low relieved that no one tried to stop him maybe im wrong maybe i ought to go to the police tell them theyre mistaken i tried to help millgate not kill him sure and what about the man you killed in your apartment if hes still there if his buddies havent moved him do you expect the police will take your word about what happened as soon as they get their hands on you theyll put you in jail is that so bad at least ill be safe the men at my apartment wont be able to get at me what makes you sure seven years ago two men broke your jaw while you and they were in custody in boston security might fail again and this time what happens to you could be lethal when pittman entered the diner he watched to see if anyone looked suspiciously toward him no one seemed to care either they hadnt seen the story about him on tv or else they didnt make the connection with him after all no one here knew him by name except for the cook who was usually on duty at this hour and the cook knew pittman only as matt how you doing matt the cook asked no show for several weeks and now youre back two nights in a row well get some weight back on you quick whatll it be tonight still dismayed that the police had arranged for his banks automated teller machine to seize his card pittman said im low on cash will you take a check for a meal youve always been good for it and an extra twenty dollars hey you dont appreciate my cooking that much sorry ten dollars the cook shook his head come on youre really that low worse than low youre breaking my heart the cook debated okay for you ill make an exception but dont let this get around our secret i appreciate this tony im starved give me a salad the meat loaf mashed potatoes plenty of gravy those peas and carrots a glass of milk and coffee coffee coffee then well talk about dessert yeah we will get some weight back on you you sure thats all one thing more what is it the box i gave you last night outside the diner pittman sought the cover of a nearby alley crouching in the darkness with his back to the street he opened the box took out the and the carton of ammunition and placed them in his gym bag he heard a threatening voice behind him what ya got in the bag man looking over his shoulder pittman saw a street kid tall broad shoulders steely eyes late teens stuff what stuff the kid flashed a longbladed knife this stuff pittman aimed the the kid put the knife away cool man damned good stuff he backed off hurrying down the street pittman put the gun back in the gym bag madison square park was the site of pittmans favorite steichen photograph an evocative earlytwentiethcentury depiction of the flatiron building where broadway intersects with fifth avenue the photograph showed a winter scene with snow falling on horse carriages and to the left taking up only part of the photograph but seeming to dominate the photo as much as the flatiron building did were the bare trees of madison square park pittman positioned himself on fifth avenue about where he assumed that steichen had stood with his tripoded camera although it was spring and not winter the trees were still not fully leafed and pittman used the night to imagine that hed been taken back in time that the muffled clop of horses hooves had replaced the busy roar of traffic he had gotten to the park a half hour early thered been no other place to go besides although the meal at the diner had given him back some energy he was still tired from the exertion of the previous night and the considerable walking hed done all day despite his fears his body felt more fit than it had in over a year his muscle aches were almost a pleasure even so he had pushed his body to its limit he needed to sit but not in plain view after briefly pretending that he was steichen he left where he thought that the great photographer had placed his camera and retreated toward the trees walkways and benches of the park at night he became only one of the parks many indistinct visitors most of them homeless lounging on the benches he thought and he waited on schedule at eleven oclock burt forsyth got out of a taxi on fifth avenue as the taxi drove away merging with the headlights of traffic burt paused just long enough to light a cigarette the glow from his lighter possibly intended as a beacon something to attract pittmans attention and help pittman recognize him then burt walked into the park passing the war memorial flagpole obviously pittman thought im supposed to go over to him he doesnt know where i am after staring behind burt to see if anyone was following pittman stood from his shadowobscured bench but as he approached burts expression intensified he shook his head slightly firmly in what seemed a warning he gestured unobtrusively ahead and continued past pittman pittman did his best not to call out to burt im supposed to follow is that it in case weve got company to be extracautious as casually as he could make it seem pittman took a path that ran parallel to the one burt had chosen burt crossed the park went up to twentysixth street and proceeded to the right along it following pittman walked by a white marble court building turned east onto twentysixth street ignored the darkened expensive shops on his right and concentrated on burt ahead of him halfway along the block burt abruptly stepped out of sight beneath a makeshift roof that protected the sidewalk in a construction area when pittman hurried to catch up to him he saw that burt was waiting in the shadows behind two dumpsters and a jungle of metal scaffolds pittman veered toward him i dont know what to do burt the television news makes me look like a maniac i told you it was bad what happened how did you get into this mess i didnt kill millgate then why were you seen running from his room theres an innocent explanation innocent your fingerprints are on his lifesupport system what were you doing in burt you have to believe me this is all a big mistake whatever caused millgates death i had nothing to do with it hey i believe you but im not the one you have to convince how will you explain to the police about a sudden shadow made burt turn from the scaffolding toward the sidewalk hearing a noise pittman glanced in that direction as well seeing a man loom into view the man was silhouetted by a streetlight so pittman couldnt see his face but he could see the oversized windbreaker the man wore the man made a gesture pulling something out no pittman stumbled back trapped he bumped against garbage cans cornered seeing the pistol the man was aiming pittman had no other defense except to raise his gym bag preparing to throw it when the man fired the pistols silencer reduced the sound of the shot so that it wasnt any louder than a fist against a pillow the bullet hit the gym bag bursting through missing pittman as he lost his balance falling among garbage cans striking concrete the gunman came into the shadows pittman stared up at him in panic expecting the next bullet to be between his eyes but a metallic clatter startled the gunman and made him swing toward burt who had stumbled against a section of scaffolding the gunman shot him in the chest gasping burt lurched back by then pittman was frantically yanking at the zipper on his gym bag as the gunman returned his attention to pittman burt collided against the bars of the scaffolding and rebounded off them pawing at the air involuntarily grabbing the first thing in front of him the gunman finding burts arms around his shoulders the gunman pulled them away spun and shot him again this time in the face pittman had the gym bag open the gunman pivoted toward him and raised the pistol pittman gripped the cocked it and pulled the trigger the unsilenced made a roar that seemed all the worse because it contrasted with the three previous muffled shots the roar felt like hands slamming against pittmans ears it echoed amplified by the narrow confines pittmans ears rang as he fired and fired again then he stopped because he didnt have a target the man was no longer there the confinement had helped pittmans aim the gunman was on his back blood spewing from his chest throat and left eye pittman retched tasting bile but he couldnt allow himself to give in burt he had to help burt he scrambled toward him felt for a pulse but he couldnt find one no burt despite the torturous ringing in his ears he suddenly heard shouting a siren in the distance he felt paralyzed with shock his eyes stung as he took one last look at his friend then with the siren wailing nearer his paralysis broke he rushed to grab the gym bag shoved the into it and charged away from the scaffolds as a woman screamed on the opposite side of the street pittman raced east along twentysixth street in the direction of park avenue god help me he kept thinking but he and god werent on the best of terms because god had allowed jeremy to die so pittman pleaded to the only element of an afterlife of which he was certain jeremy listen carefully please son please you have to help your father how long do i have before the police come after me pittman thought an inward voice urged him to run to keep running never to stop but another inward voice which reminded pittman of jeremy warned him that running would attract attention slow down act like nothings wrong behind him in the distance pittman heard sirens the police would find the bodies theyd talk to the woman who had screamed when she heard the shots and saw pittman scramble out of the construction area theyd start searching for a man with a gym bag whod run along twentysixth street toward park avenue get rid of the gym bag the inward voice said and again pittman thought it sounded remarkably like jeremy get rid of it but the bag has my clothes the gun hey what good will the clothes and the gun do you if youre in jail walking trying not to show his tension and his impulse to hurry pittman crossed park avenue on the other side along twentysixth street cars and pedestrians thinned he came to another construction area hearing more sirens he glanced around him saw no one looking in his direction and dropped the gym bag into a dumpster he turned south on lexington avenue sweating still forcing himself to walk slowly he skirted gramercy park which was locked for the night continuing south then heading west hoping he didnt attract attention he eventually came to union square park and was struck by how much his life had changed in the six hours since hed gotten off a subway here and had walked to his apartment but he couldnt go to his apartment now that was sure and he didnt know where else he could go the police would be watching friends he might ask for help hotels would be warned to watch for anyone using his credit card what the hell am i going to do hey whats all them sirens about a stoopshouldered beardstubbled man asked he was slumped on a metal bench holding what was obviously a pint of alcohol concealed in a paper bag his overcoat had no elbows his hair was mussed he had two missing front teeth pittman had the sense that the man who looked sixty was possibly thirty damned if i know exhausted pittman sat next to him the man didnt respond for a moment what the sirens huh you asked about the sirens what was causing them theyre disturbin my peace n quiet mine too hey i dint say you could sit there siren wailing dome lights flashing a police car raced around the park and sped north on broadway another one the man said disturbin my damn it youre still sittin there the man clutched his bottle my bench i dint say you could another police car wailed by take it easy pittman said yur tryin to steal my bench the man said louder i told you take it easy wheres a policeman ill pay rent whats at ill pay rent youre right this is your bench but ill pay to share it with you how does ten dollars sound ten and ill trade you my overcoat for yours the woman who had screamed when pittman scrambled from the bodies would tell the police that the man with the gym bag had been wearing a tan overcoat the coat that pittman wanted to trade for was dark blue trade i want to share the bench the man looked suspicious les see your money pittman gave him the tendollar bill hed gotten from the cook at the diner the last cash he had except for a few coins and the coat pittman traded with him the mans coat stank of perspiration pittman set it beside him switching his bottle from hand to hand the man struggled into the coat nice yep warm yep my lucky day the man squinted at pittman raised the bottle to his lips upended it drank the remainder of its contents and dropped the bottle behind him onto the grass goin for another bottle guard the bench itll be here when you get back damn well better be the man staggered from the park heading south on broadway as another police car wailed by pittman slumped lower on the bench hoping to blend with the parks other residents the nights chill in combination with the aftermath of adrenaline made him hug himself shivering urgent thoughts assaulted his mind burt had said he suspected a detective was watching him from a table in the restaurant maybe it wasnt a detective pittman thought maybe it was the gunman who followed burt from the restaurant hoping id be in touch with him but the gunman didnt need to kill burt burt wasnt a threat to him in the darkness burt wouldnt have been able to identify him pittman felt colder in the shadowy park he hugged himself harder the son of a bitch he didnt have to kill burt a movement to pittmans right distracted him still slumped on the bench he turned his head focusing sharply on two figures moving toward him they didnt wear uniforms they werent policemen unless they were working under cover but they didnt move with the authority of policemen they seemed to creep predators they must have seen me give money to the guy who was on this bench now they want money too pittman sat up the figures came closer if theres trouble ill attract the police pittman stood to walk away but the shambling figures reached him he braced himself for an attack goddamn it a slurred voice said git away from him hes mine i foun him hes rentin my bench the figures glared at the man in pittmans overcoat who was coming back with a bottle in a paper bag dint you hear me git the man fumbled in his grimy pants and pulled out a church keystyle bottle opener he jabbed its point at them move yur asses away from my bench s mine mine and his the sullen figures hesitated then shifted back toward the shadows from which they had risen bastards the man slumped onto the bench theyda taken my bench in a minute gotta keep watchin thats the truth the man drank from his bottle lie down what pittman asked suspiciously git some sleep you look beat pittman didnt move i wont let those bastards git to you i always stay up guardin my bench pittman woke with a start the shadows were gone the air was pale the sun not yet risen over the citys buildings traffic was sporadic as he became fully alert his memories from the previous night made him flinch he sat upright the man to whom hed given his trench coat was no longer on the bench but someone else wasa welldressed slender grayhaired man who wore spectacles pittman had the sense that the man who seemed to be in his fifties had nudged his knee did you sleep well skin prickling pittman had no idea if this was a policeman or a pervert he debated what to answer no not really thats understandable when i slept on a bench like this i always woke up with back trouble when you did before i reformed you look like youre recently down on your luck fairly good clothes but that overcoat where on earth did you get that overcoat pittman realized that the grungy blue coat was draped across his lap the man to whom hed given his own coat must have covered pittman when despite all his effort not to he drifted off to sleep that would have been about am i got it from a friend certainly well no doubt you wonder what im doing here pittman didnt respond my name is reverend thomas watley i come here every morning to see if the park has any new occupants the other residents are quite familiar with me in fact at the moment theyve gone to my church every morning at six a free although modest breakfast is available theres also a place to shower shave and relieve oneself would you care to join us pittman still didnt respond i do conduct a religious service but your attendance is not required if thats what worries you pittman kept staring well then the man shrugged i must get back to my guests he held out his hand at first pittman thought that the man wanted to shake hands but then he realized that the man was trying to give him something in case you decide not to join us heres five dollars i know it isnt much but sometimes it takes only a little boost to raise a person back to where he was remember whatever caused your downfall its not irremediable the problem can be solved reverend i very much doubt that pittman said bitterly oh unless you can raise the dead you lost your son ah the reverend shook his head you have my sincerest condolences there is no greater burden then what makes you think my problem can be solved this time it was the reverend who didnt respond thank you for the money reverend i can use it wearing the grungy blue coat pittman stooped his shoulders and tried to look as defeated as he felt making himself walk unsteadily up lexington avenue the sun rose above buildings traffic increased horns blared pittman wanted it to seem that he was oblivious to anything but objects along the sidewalk trying to appear off balance he turned from lexington onto twentysixth street he stooped and pretended to pick up a coin looked at his palm with satisfaction then put the pretend coin into his dingy coat he risked a glance ahead of him and saw some slight commotion in the next block between park avenue and madison near madison square park the dome lights on a stationary police car were flashing the bodies would have been removed by now the investigation of the crime scene would be concluding burt sickened by what had happened last night pittman continued to waver along twentysixth street when he came to some garbage cans he lifted their lids and snooped inside he moved on he came to other garbage cans and inspected them as well ignoring the smell then he came to a dumpster trying to look awkward he struggled up the side of the bin poked around in it clutched his gym bag lurched down and reversed his direction heading back toward lexington he was far enough away that the police would not have noticed him especially as disheveled as he looked after all he thought caustically the homeless are invisible about the only thing in his favor pittman decided was that it was saturday the man he needed to contact would more likely be at home than at work the trouble was that when pittman looked in a manhattan telephone directory he didnt find any listing for the name of the man he was looking for brian botulfson he called information and asked an operator to see if brian botulfson was listed in any of the other boroughs in brooklyn the operator wouldnt give pittman the address though forcing him to walk to the new york public library where he looked in the directory for brooklyn and found the address he wanted he could have phoned brian but one of the things hed learned early as a reporter was that while phone contact had the merit of efficiency it couldnt compare to an inperson interview the subject could get rid of you on the phone merely by hanging up but a facetoface meeting was often so intimidating that a subject would agree to talk pittman had met brian only a couple of times mostly in connection with brians arrest for using his computer to access top secret defense department files the last occasion had been seven years ago when brian had done pittman a favor obtaining jonathan millgates unlisted telephone numbers now pittman needed another favor but there was a chance that brian either wouldnt remember their previous conversations or wouldnt careat least on the phone the contact had to be oneonone pittman dumped his grungy coat in a waste can after using some of reverend watleys five dollars to buy orange juice and a danish from a sidewalk vendor he boarded a subway train for brooklyn took his electric razor from his gym bag made himself look as presentable as he could stared out the window and brooded the last time pittman had seen him brian botulfson lived in a rundown apartment building on the lower east side surrounded by expensive computer components that hid the cockroaches on the dingy walls botulfson had obviously enjoyed the glamorized image of an impoverished student but now his apartment building was quite respectableclean made of brick with large glinting windows in an attractive neighborhood the park slope section of brooklyn pittman nodded to a man coming out of the wellmaintained building then he climbed steps paused in the vestibule studied the names on the buzzer directory and pressed the button for b when he didnt get an answer he pressed again oneonone contact great but what if nobodys home damn it i came all this way for nothing he was about to press the button a third time when a nasally male voice spoke from the tinny microphone yes who is it brian pittman asked is that you who am i talking to matt pittman do you remember me brian when you had that trouble about hacking some years ago i did a couple of stories about you in the chronicle the intercom became silent brian what do you want to talk brian pittman liked to use a persons first name as often as seemed natural it established a bond quite a while since we saw each other i thought id catch up find out what youve been doing the intercom became silent again i need to talk to you about something brian what is it i feel a little awkward down here with my face against this intercom unlock the door will you brian id like to come up a further silence brian to pittmans relief he heard a buzzer at the side of the door electronically freeing its lock he quickly turned the knob pushed the glasspaneled door open and entered the buildings recently painted freshsmelling white lobby the comparison between this and pittmans own dingy apartment building was striking brian must have a job that paid well pittman decided an elevator took him to the fourth floor where he went to b heard a child crying beyond it and knocked even though brian was now expecting him ten seconds elapsed before the door was opened pittman was surprised by brians appearance seven years ago brian had preferred sneakers torn sweatshirts and jeans with the knees ripped out hed had two sharkstooth earrings his scraggly hair had hung down over his shoulders all in all hed looked more like a candidate for a heavymetal rock group than the computer fanatic he actually was now he wore black bass loafers gray slacks and a blue buttondown oxfordcloth shirt the earrings were gone as were the holes through which the jewelry had been attached his brown hair was cut so short that it didnt touch his ears he had widerimmed bifocal glasses his very conventional appearance drew attention to his short slight stature and his weak chin which a thin mustache did nothing to hide what do you want brian blocked the doorway pittman glanced past him and saw an infant in a high chair at a kitchen table is that your child brian things certainly have been happening youve got to fill me in pittman made a move to enter but brian didnt budge what do you want brian repeated brian this isnt very sociable of you i come all this way to see you and you dont even want to catch up on old times in addition to the cries from the infant pittman heard an announcer watching tv while you feed your baby the news brians expression was sober cnn ah brians expression became even more solemn so he knows pittman thought anything interesting seems to me i heard something about jonathan millgate that reminds me of seven years ago when you helped me get his unlisted telephone numbers brians eyes narrowed inwardly he seemed to flinch what do you want he asked a third time a favor why isnt it obvious why does anybody ask a favor i need help thats not what i meant why should i do you a favor thats a tough one brian i guess because youre a human being incidentally your childs starting to climb out of that high chair brian swung saw that the baby was in danger of falling and hurried to grab it the baby cried harder pittman stepped in and shut the door boy or girl hey i didnt say you could what have you got there a jar of apricot baby food let me help feed boy or girl boy but i didnt say you how old almost a year but wonderfullooking boy whats his name daniel now look i brian im in trouble okay from the expression in your eyes i think you know im in trouble i think you just heard something about it on cnn i bet you said to yourself no that cant be the same guy who interviewed me it cant be the same guy i did a favor for and got him jonathan millgates unlisted telephone numbers matthew pittman yeah that was his name and then all of a sudden here i am knocking on your door a lot to adjust to isnt it brian held the baby and looked nervous are you married brian wheres your shes gone for groceries well i look forward to meeting her pittman set down his gym bag i wasnt kidding let me help feed your son holding the baby brian stepped slightly backward brian i think you misunderstand im not here to make trouble all i need is a small favor and then im out of here suspicion fought with hope do what nice apartment love the plants clean roomy pittman opened a door and found what was obviously brians workroom ah i see you still keep up your interest in computers im a programmer for nintendo and how about hacking brian do you still do any of that that was years ago since i met gladys i wait a minute youre asking me to and then im gone brians cheeks quivered with tension nintendo would fire me if they found out i was hacking gladys would have my nuts they wouldnt know all i need is one piece of information brian then i promise im out of here with luck before gladys gets back the baby squirmed brian eased him into the high chair when he tried to spoon some of the pureed apricots into his mouth the baby knocked the spoon and sprayed apricots onto brians clean shirt here i was always good at this pittman made a face at the baby and immediately got its attention he crouched so that his eyes were even with the babys he leaned forward so that his nose touched the babys but he kept his eyes open noticing that the baby did the same he pulled back and opened his mouth the baby opened his mouth he spooned the apricots into his mouth how the hell did you do that brian asked strangers always make him cry but you i had lots of practice the baby reminded pittman of how jeremy had looked as a child he suddenly felt melancholy they say you killed him brian said millgate no that isnt true and a man in your apartment and your boss at the paper the man in my apartment pulled a gun on me we scuffled he fell and broke his neck as for my boss pittman hesitated his throat tight with grief no i didnt do anything to burt it was someone else and they say youre hysterical out of control that youre planning to kill yourself and you dont care who you take with you no that isnt true either brian depression overwhelmed him i dont want anybody to get hurt then youre not suicidal pittman looked at the baby well brian asked thats about the only thing that is true the kitchen became silent even the baby they say your son died pittman swallowed and avoided the issue i really need this favor brian im in a lot of trouble that i dont deserve and i want to set it right why i dont see why it should matter if youre planning to kill yourself yes ive been asking myself that a lot i thinkhe swallowed againits because all along i planned to go out cleanly but suddenly everything has gotten very messy feeling pressure in his throat pittman spooned more apricots into the babys mouth brian stared at him what the hell happened pittman frowned toward the floor then he told brian everything brian kept shaking his head alternately bewildered and dismayed this is i swear to you its the truth look you cant do anything about this on your own you have to go to the police tell them what you just told me if you have trouble believing me would they but you dont have a choice no i dont think the police could keep me safe man oh man do you realize what you sound like who was it said that paranoia was the only sane attitude to have these days brian looked appalled and you expect me to get me into some computer files that i otherwise wouldnt have access to like at my newspaper i have to show id and sign in to enter the building a guard or someone else would recognize me theyd call the police but i know the passwords that allow access from an outside telephone brian looked somewhat less threatened thats not hard to do in fact its almost a legitimate request under other circumstances it would be legal yes pittman had fed the baby and now was changing its diaper and thats all well theres something else i need to get into the computer system for the citys criminal records jesus isnt there a way to route the call through a system of longdistance relays so the call cant be traced before i get the information i need yes but pittman turned as someone opened the door the womana redhead severely thin with stern featureslooked alarmed at the sight of pittman holding the baby what are gladys this is a friend of mine brian said ed garner pittman said hoping that if he used a different name she wouldnt associate him with the photographs of him on cnn or in the newspapers gladys marched to a kitchen counter set down two bags of groceries and took possession of her baby her pinched expression suggested that she felt pittman wasnt worthy enough to have touched her offspring ed garner she squinted at brian you never mentioned him before well i we were buddies in college pittman said we loved to fool around with computers computers you werent a hacker i hope her voice had the grating sound of a knife being sharpened never had the nerve brian had too much nerve he went to prison for it her eyes glared anyway pittman said trying to change the subject i heard brian was living in this area ive got relatives not far from here so i figured id drop in brian was just about to show me some of the stuff hes doing for nintendo wrinkles developed between gladyss eyes werent you brian pittman said if thats all right gladys you can see the babys been fed and changed gladys narrowed her steely gaze at him just remember we have to be at my mothers in an hour i couldnt possibly forget brian and pittman went into the computer room brian shut the door he looked angrily at pittman pittman worried that the anger was directed at him then understood its true target he had an ally furious brian turned on the computer then locked a phone into a modem his cheeks were flushed which system do you want to access first your newspapers criminal records brian didnt react to the change in priorities instead he touched buttons on his telephone you know the criminalrecords number by heart pittman asked in amazement no this is a friend of mine i dont hack anymore but i keep in touch with friends who do this guys obsessed about eavesdropping on the police and he never talks on the phone i always have to go through his computer words appeared on brians computer screen you have reached the starship enterprise hes also crazy about star trek brian tapped letters on his keyboard mr spock to captain kirk spocks my code name brian said words appeared in response kirk here what is your password brian typed more letters tribbles new words appeared on the screen proceed mr spock brian typed top secret message from starfleet command fear that klingons may try to intercept transmission the response came quickly activate scrambler brian turned on a machine next to the phone scrambler activated for the next few minutes pittman watched with fascination as brian tapped his keyboard read and responded to queries on his screen and finally wrote down a series of numbers got it may you prosper spock to kirk out brian pressed other numbers on his telephone im routing this through fairbanks alaska and key west florida even then the call can be traced if the criminalrecords computer senses an intrusion ill have to unplug right away how will you know thatll tell me brian pointed to another machine beside the telephone he pressed more numbers and nodded toward the screen okay were in what do you want to know access the file for sean oreilly pittman spelled the name oreilly had been the master thief whom pittman had interviewed some years ago the tool knife with its lock picks that pittman had used to get into jonathan millgates room had been a gift from oreilly there brian said pittman read the screen earlier when he had tried to find brians name in the phone book he had also looked for oreillys with no success either oreilly was back in prison had moved to another area or yes pittman picked up a pencil and notepad according to oreillys file hed been released from prison three months previouslyon parolewhich meant that he was required to keep the authorities informed about where he was staying the address was on the lower east side pittman quickly wrote it down tore off the piece of paper and put it into his pocket now what other computer files do you want brian asked i thought so a steely voice said behind them pittman and brian spun toward the noise gladys must have been listening at the door she had thrown it open she stormed in i cant leave you alone for a minute you cant stay out of trouble trouble you are hacking whats the matter with you do you like prison so much that you want to go back there youre mistaken pittman said i was showing brian some work ive been doing get out of my house we accessed my files at dont lie to me your name isnt ed garner its matthew pittman cnn just did a story on you i recognized your picture gladys yanked the phone from the modem im calling the police as words vanished from the screen she raised the phone to her ear and pressed gladys brian objected from another room the baby started crying please pittman said gladys spoke to the phone my name is gladys botulfson i live at pittman pressed the disconnect button youre doing something stupid gladys i dont want any killer near my baby you dont understand they stared at each other the phone began to ring gladys flinched thatll be the police pittman said they have an automatic record of the phone number of anyone who calls them gladys tried to pry his hand from the disconnect button pittman used his other hand to grip her wrist dont do it think how would you like your babys father to go to prison again what the phone kept ringing aiding a fugitive pittman said helping him illegally access computer files brian could be put away until your baby starts high school gladyss eyes bulged the phone rang again pittman took the receiver away from her and lifted the disconnect button hello yes gladys botulfson lives here i know she called we were having a bit of a quarrel im afraid she here let me put her on pittman stared at her then handed her the phone gladys squinted toward the wailing baby then toward brian finally toward pittman her lips were so pursed that the skin around them was white she parted them this is gladys botulfson she said to the phone im sorry for troubling you what my husband says is true we were having a fight i thought id scare him if i called the police yes i understand its a serious offense to abuse the emergency number it wont happen again were calmer now no i dont need any help thank you gladys set down the phone she rubbed her wrist where pittman had gripped it her voice was disturbingly flat get out pittman picked up his gym bag brian thanks for letting me get into the newspapers computer files his look toward brian was direct and meaningful dont let her know what files we really accessed sure i wont tell you again gladys said a pleasure to meet you pittman left the apartment and shut the door behind him when he got in the elevator he could still hear gladyss loud accusing voice from behind brians door pittman had hoped to borrow money from brian but that had obviously been out of the question with a dollar bill a dime and a nickel in his pocket he proceeded dismally toward where he could catch the train back to manhattan although he didnt know why since he didnt have enough cash to buy a token the more he walked the more tired and hungry he became he felt defeated ahead cars at a funeral home caused him to suffer the depressing memory of jeremys funeralthe closed coffin jeremys photograph in front of it the mourners most of them classmates from jeremys school burt next to pittman and now burt was dead pittmans argument with his soontobe exwife its your fault shed insisted you should have taken him to the doctor sooner pittman recalled how after the funeral thered been a somber reception back at the morticians coffee and sandwiches final commiserations but pittman had been so choked with grief that he hadnt been able to force himself to respond to the condolences he had taken a sandwich that someone had given him but the rye bread and paperlike sliced turkey had stuck in his throat hed felt surrounded by a gray haze of depression a similar gray haze weighed upon him now instinctive fear had propelled him into motion adrenaline had fueled him the strength and endurance that adrenaline created had finally dwindled however in their place were lethargy and despair pittman didnt know if he could go on he told himself that hed been foolish to believe that he could disentangle himself from the mess that he had fallen into perhaps i should go to the police let them try to figure things out and if someone gets through police security to kill you what difference does it make im too tired to care you dont mean that dont i death would be welcome no youve got to keep trying a voice inside him said it sounded like jeremy how i dont even have enough money to take the train back to manhattan come on dad all those years of running dont tell me you dont have what it takes to do a little more walking it took three hours even though pittman had switched from his street shoes to the jogging shoes that hed put in his gym bag his feet ached and his leg muscles protested weak from exertion and hunger he reached grand street on manhattans lower east side looking for the address that hed gotten from sean oreillys computer file he studied the busy street wary of police surveillance after all gladys botulfson might have changed her mind if brian had said something to infuriate her further she might have decided to call the police and teach her husband a lesson of course the police wouldnt know where pittman had gone unless brian confessed which file he had accessed but would he or would brians anger toward gladys prompt him to defy her that wasnt the only thing that bothered him what if the address sean oreilly had given the authorities was out of date or else a lie suppose he wasnt there the latter worry intensified when pittman finally reached the address and discovered that it wasnt an apartment building but a restaurant instead a sign in the front window announcing paddys shit now what am i supposed to do needing to get off the street he did his best to hide his nervousness when unable to think of an alternative he entered the restaurant he barely noticed its irish decorgreen tablecloths shamrocks on the menus a large map of ireland on one wall what he did notice was the handful of lateafternoon customers most of them at the bar a few looked in his direction then returned their attention to their drinks pittman approached the barman who was muscular wore a green apron and stood behind the cash register whatll it be im looking for a friend of mine sean oreilly the barman used a towel to wipe the counter i heard he was staying at this address pittman said but this is a restaurant i dont see how what how did you get this address my parole officers the same as his look is sean around the man kept wiping the counter sean and i go back to when he was doing those publicservice announcements for the police department pittman said when he was telling people how to keep their homes safe from burglars so what do you want him for old times ive got some stories to tell him pittman drew his key chain from his pocket and held up the tool knife about this the bartender watched pittman remove the lockpick tools from the end of the knife the bartender relaxed youve got one of those too he smiled and pulled out a set of keys showing his own knife sean only gave these to guys he likes yeah sean stays here in a room upstairs at night he subs for me but is he around ought to be waking up around now he sure was drunk last night a half dozen people came into the restaurant looks like were getting busy the bartender poured tomato juice into a glass added tabasco sauce and dropped in a raw egg stairs through the door in back second floor the room at the end of the hall hell be needing this in a musty upstairs hallway that smelled of cabbage pittman knocked on the door when he didnt get an answer he knocked again this time he heard a groan his third knock caused a louder groan he tried the door it wasnt locked pushing it open he found a sparse room with its shades closed its lights off and sean oreilly sprawled on the floor the light the light sean groaned pittman thought that the dim light from the hallway must be hurting seans eyes he quickly shut the door in darkness he listened to sean keep moaning the light the light there isnt any pittman said ive gone blind cant see anything the light the light you mean you want me to turn the lights on blind gone blind pittman groped along the wall found a light switch and flicked it the unshielded yellow light that dangled from the ceiling gleamed and made sean start thrashing while he pawed at his face he wailed blind youre trying to make me blind oh for gods sake pittman thought he knelt and pulled one of seans hands away from his face exposing his left eye which was very bloodshot here drink this what something the bartender sent up sean clutched the glass and took several swallows then suddenly made a gagging sound what is it jesus mary and joseph theres no vodka in this sit up drink more of this after a struggle pittman managed to make sean empty the glass sean squirmed so that his back was against the side of the bed and scowled his short stature still reminded pittman of a jockey he was as thin as ever but alcohol had aged him putting gray in his hair and ravaging his face who are you a friend cant remember thats because you need something to eat couldnt keep it down pittman picked up the phone order something anyhow the cornedbeef sandwich and dill pickle that the bartender carried up were delicious pittman tried to savor them but his hunger couldnt be controlled he hadnt eaten anything since the orange juice and danish this morning taking huge bites he gulped the food down his empty plate depressed him from the bed sean looked horrified at pittmans appetite i think im going to throw up when sean came back pittman had finished the sandwich that the bartender had carried up for sean sean sat on the bed scowled at pittman and shook his head i still dont remember you gave me a crash course on how to break into houses doesnt ring a bell you said i was a natural still doesnt ring a wait a minute werent you a reporter pittman nodded i gave you pittman held up the tool knife sure thats who you are but ive graduated pittman said what do you mean pittman reached inside his gym bag took out a newspaper that hed bought on the way to the restaurant and tossed it over to sean the story under that colorful headline suicidal obit writer on killing rampage theres an alleged in there someplace but it doesnt feel sincere with a frown sean read the article from time to time he paused looked at pittman deepened the furrows in his brow and went back to reading the story finally he set down the newspaper it makes you sound very busy yeah all that killing its almost more work than one man can handle do i need to be afraid of you lets put it this way have i done anything to hurt you so far then you didnt do what the paper says pittman shook his head why did you come here because of all the criminals ive met youre the only one i trust what do you want the phone rang sean picked it up hello he listened intensely then straightened in alarm the police are coming up jesus they must have found out about the washing machines pittman didnt understand what sean was talking about sean scrambled toward the window jerked the curtains apart yanked the window up and scurried out onto a fire escape pittman heard heavy footsteps on the other side of the door he lunged to lock it fists pounded on it he grabbed his gym bag and darted toward the open window banging his shoulder as he squirmed out onto the fire escape he cursed and stared below toward where he assumed sean would be scurrying down the metal stairs instead what he saw were two policemen who stared up shouted and pointed footsteps clattered above him twisting craning his neck he saw sean rapidly climbing stairs toward the roof pittman got to his feet and charged up after him stop he heard a policeman yell from the alley below pittman kept racing upward stop the policeman yelled pittman climbed harder stop theyll shoot pittman thought but he didnt obey he reached the top leapt over a guardrail and scanned the rooftop for sean there the roofs of all the buildings on this block were connected and sean was sprinting past ventilation pipes and skylights toward a door on a roof near the end of the block his short legs moving in a blur wait sean pittman raced after him behind him he heard shoes scraping on the fire escape sean reached the door tugged at it and cursed when he discovered it was locked he was banging his shoulder against it cursing again when pittman caught up to him damn it i left my keys in my room i dont have my knife here breathing heavily pittman pulled out the knife sean had given him several years earlier with a smile then a desperate look beyond pittman toward two policemen who had just climbed onto the roof sean yanked the lockpick tools from the knife twisted and poked freed the lock with astonishing speed and jerked the door open as a policeman yelled sean and pittman darted through the doorway at once in the dim light of a stairwell sean locked the door behind them the washing machines they know about the washing machines sean blurted to himself who the hell told them about the washing machines fists pounded on the door sean raced down the stairs pittman followed who told them about the washing machines sean kept muttering or are they after me pittman wondered dont look behind you just keep walking toward the corner they rounded it so far so good sean said he hailed a taxi dont let the driver think youre in a rush he told pittman they got in lower broadway sean told the driver then started humming heres your knife back thanks im sorry i couldnt help pay for the taxi hey im not in jail thats payment enough they were in a loft on lower broadway the loft which seemed to have once been a warehouse had almost no furnishings and those were grouped closely together in the middle of what felt like a cavern although sparse the furnishings were expensivean italianmade leather sofa a large oriental rug a brass coffee table and matching lamp otherwise in the shadows beyond the pale light from the lamp there were crates stacked upon crates in every direction sean slumped on the sofa and sipped from a budweiser that hed taken from a refrigerator next to some of the crates what is this place pittman asked a little hideaway of mine you still havent told me what you want help how ive never been on the run before youre telling me you want advice last night i slept in a park its been two days since i bathed ive been scrounging food i can see how criminals on the run get caught they finally just get worn down then i take it you were smart enough not to try to get in touch with your family and friends my only excuse for a family is my exwife and i wouldnt ask her for anything pittman said as for my friends well i have to assume the police will be watching them in case i show up so you came to me i kept asking myself who i knew to get help from but who the police wouldnt know about then it occurred to meall the people i interviewed over the years some of them have the kind of expertise i need and the police would never think id go to them sean nodded in approval of pittmans reasoning but i dont know what advice i can give you theres a bathroom and a shower in back you can spend the night here for sure i am other than that there has to be something you can tell me if they catch you youve already got a brilliant defense oh whats that insanity sean said what all that business about your being suicidal i assume thats another exaggeration pittman didnt respond you mean its true sean asked in surprise pittman stared at his coke can your son died sean said and you fell apart thats right my sister died when i was twentyfive she was a year younger than me car accident sean said and i nearly drank myself to death god i loved her then you understand pittman said yes but its a little different now isnt it how do you mean when youre tired and hungry and scared i feel like im being selfish my son was wonderful and here im thinking about myself i dont presume to tell you how to grieve but i will tell you thisyou cant go wrong if you do what your son would have wanted you to do and right now hed have been telling you to look out for your ass the shower was primitive just a nozzle over a plastic stall with a drain in the concrete floor there wasnt any soap shampoo or a towel pittman was pleased that hed had the foresight to put a toilet kit in his gym bag he found two steel chairs that he put near the showers entrance draping his sport coat over one his slacks over the other there wasnt any door to the shower and after he came out to dry himself with his dirty shirt he discovered that as he had hoped the steam from the shower had taken some of the wrinkles out of his jacket and pants he put on fresh underwear and socks decided to save his remaining clean shirt by putting on his black cotton sweat suit and returned to sean among the crates sean had opened a cabinet revealing a television and was watching cnn they sure like you yeah pretty soon ill have my own series well sean said opening another beer from the newspaper and now this i have a pretty good idea of their side whats yours he put his feet on the coffee table for the second time that day pittman explained sean listened intently on occasion asked a question and tapped his fingers together when pittman finished congratulations why ive been a thief since i was twelve ive spent half my life in prison ive had to go underground three times because of a misunderstanding with the mob ive been married to four women two of them simultaneously but i have never ever had the distinction of being in as much trouble as you are and all this happened since two nights ago yes worthy of the guinness book of world records at least youre amused i can see i made a mistake coming to you not so fast who sent the gunman to your apartment i have no idea why would someone want to make it seem that you killed millgate i have no damn it dont you think youd better start having some ideas as near as i can tell from the moment you killed that man in your apartment accidentally im sure that makes a difference to him ever since then youve been running what else was i supposed to do you wasted time going to this computer expert why was it a waste of time because your only purpose was to find a way to get in touch with me why because you want advice on how to keep running sorry what in the first place you dont need that kind of advice youve been doing damned well on your own in the second place if all you do is keep running the only thing youll accomplish is to get tired then youll make a mistake and theyll grab you but theres no alternative isnt there reverse direction hunt instead of being hunted god knows youve got plenty of targets hunt thats easy enough for you to say well i didnt expect you to leap for joy at my advice from what youve told me it seems to me that youve been running away since your son died running from everything the suggestion that pittman was a coward made his face became hot with anger he wanted to get his hands on sean and punch the shit out of him touched a nerve did i pittman inhaled straining to calm himself i guess you dont like the advice im giving you sean said but its the only advice ive got im an expert ive been running from things all my life do what i say not what i do pittman stared then parted his lips in a bitter smile whats funny sean asked all this talk about running for twenty years i ran every day all that time where was i going to the finish line pal and if youre still thinking about killing yourself if i were you id want to go out a winner not a loser you can destroy yourselfthats your business but dont let the bastards do it for you pittman felt his face get hot again but this time it wasnt because he was angry at sean instead his fury was directed elsewhere bastards yes for a moment he didnt move or speak didnt breathe his powerful emotion held him in stasis then he squinted at sean when my son died he began to say then hesitated sean studied him obviously curious about what pittman intended to say when my son died i cant describe how angry i wasat the hospital at his doctors jeremys death wasnt their fault its just that i desperately needed somebody to be angry at if somebody had made a mistake then in a bizarre way jeremys death would have made sense medical carelessness the alternative is to accept that jeremy died because of a cosmic crapshoot that he was unlucky that he just happened to get a type of rare untreatable cancer that kind of thinkingtheres no pattern or point the universe is arbitrarycan drive a person crazy when i finally accepted that jeremys doctors werent to blame i still needed someone to be angry at so i chose god i screamed at god i hated him but eventually i realized that wasnt doing any good either because god wouldnt scream back how could i possibly hurt him what good is it to be angry if you cant punish what youre angry at my anger was useless it wasnt going to bring jeremy back thats when i decided to kill myself the reference caused seans gaze to narrow his expression somber anger pittmans jaw muscles hardened when i was with millgate he said something to me a name at least it sounded like a name duncan millgate said that several times then something about snow then a while later he said grollier i didnt know what he meant and i was too damned busy to ask him all i wanted was to put millgates oxygen prongs back into his nostrils and get out of there but the gunman who was waiting for me at my apartment sure thought it was important to find out if id repeated to anyone what millgate had said to me anger pittman stood stop running away hunt them yes when jeremy died my anger was useless but this time it wont be this time ive got a purpose this time i intend to find someone to blame three pittman stood across from the emergency entrance to the hospital it was shortly after midnight and the same as two nights earlier a drizzle created a misty halo around streetlights his mind continued to reel from the trauma that so much had happened to him in the brief time since he had last been here chilled by the rain he shoved his hands into the pockets of a woollined navy burberry overcoat that sean had pulled from a crate in his right pocket he touched the it was the only thing that he had taken from the gym bag which hed left with sean at the loft he peered up toward the pale light in the tenthfloor window of what had once been jeremys room determination overcame his weariness necessity insisted there were so many things he needed to learn and one of them was why millgates people had taken the old man from the hospital that night that was when everything had started after waiting for a gap in traffic pittman crossed toward the hospital at this late hour the front lobby was almost deserted the few people who were slumped in the imitation leather chairs in the lobby seemed to pay no attention as he headed toward the elevators nonetheless he felt exposed his nerves troubled him for another reason for he knew the memories he would have to fight when he got off the elevator near the intensivecare ward on the sixth floor he tried not to falter when he glanced toward the large area on his left the intensivecare waiting room a group of hauntedlooking men and women sat on uncomfortable metal chairs their faces haggard their eyes puffy struggling to remain awake waiting for news about their loved ones grimly recalling when he had been one of them pittman forced himself to concentrate on his purpose past the entrance to the childrens intensivecare ward he turned to the right and went down a short corridor to the door for adult intensive care he had never been in that area but he assumed that it wouldnt be much different from the childrens area indeed it was virtually identical after pulling the door open he faced a pungentsmelling brightly lit tenfootlong hallway at the end of which was a counter on the left and glass cabinets behind it the counter was covered with reports the cabinets filled with equipment and medicines amid the hiss wheeze beep and thump of lifesupport systems doctors and nurses moved purposefully in and out of rooms on the right and beyond the counter fifteen rooms all told in each of which a patient lay in urgent need pittman knew the required procedures automatically he turned toward a sink on the left of the door put his hands under a dispenser of disinfectant and waited while an electronic eye triggered the release of an acridsmelling red fluid he swabbed his hands thoroughly then put them beneath the tap where another electronic eye triggered the release of water a third electronic eye activated the hotair dispenser that dried his hands he reached for a white gown from a stack near the sink when a womans grating voice stopped him may i help you what are you doing here pittman looked a heavy set woman was marching down the hallway toward him she was in her middle forties had short gray hair that emphasized her strong scandinavian features and wore white shoes white pants and a white hospital top pittman couldnt tell if she was a doctor or a nurse but he understood hospital mentality if this woman was a nurse she wouldnt mind being called a doctor she would correct him of course but she wouldnt mind the error on the other hand if she was a doctor shed be furious to be called a nurse yes doctor im with the team investigating jonathan millgates death pittman opened a flipdown wallet and flashed fake police id that sean oreilly had given him the woman barely looked at the id again you people were here last night asking questions interrupting our schedule pittman noticed that the woman hadnt corrected him when he addressed her as doctor i apologize doctor but we have some important new information we have to check i need to speak with the nurse who was in charge of mr millgates care at the time he was taken from the hospital pittman tried not to show his tension pressured by time he couldnt be sure that millgates nurse would be working this weekend what he was counting on was that in a hospital conventional weekends didnt apply if each nurse took off saturday and sunday no one would be available to watch the patients so schedules were staggered some of the staff taking off monday and tuesday others wednesday and thursday et cetera conversely nurses tended to have the same shift for several weeks in a row seven to three three to eleven eleven to seven that was why pittman had waited until after midnightbecause he needed to speak with the nurse who had been present when at this time two nights ago millgate had been whisked away that would be jill the doctor said is she on duty tonight yes pittman didnt show his relief but shes too busy to talk to you right now i understand doctor the patients come first but i wouldnt be troubling you if this wasnt important when she takes a break do you think you could please wait outside mr detective logan when she has a moment ill ask jill to speak with you it took forty minutes leaning against the wall in the corridor outside the intensivecare ward pittman identified with the forlorn people in the waiting room his memory of the stress of that kind of waiting increased his own stress his brow was clammy by the time the door to intensive care was opened an attractive woman in her late twenties came out glanced around then approached him she was about five feet five and her loose white hospital uniform couldnt hide her athletic figure she had long straight blond hair a beguiling oval face and cheeks that were so aglow with health that she didnt need makeup detective logan yes im jill warren the nurse shook hands with him dr baker said you wanted to ask me some questions thats right i wonder could we go somewhere that isnt crowded theres a coffee machine on the floor below us near the elevator perhaps i can buy you a the floor below us you sound as if you know this hospital fairly well i used to come here a lot when my son was in intensive care pittman gestured toward the door to the childrens unit i hope hes all right now no he died oh jills voice dropped what did bone cancer ewings sarcoma oh her voice dropped lower i shouldnt have im sorry for you couldnt have known im not offended do you still want to buy me that cup of coffee definitely pittman walked with her to the elevator his tension lessened as they got in and the doors closed the worst risk hed taken in coming here was that the doctor who had seen him when millgate was removed from the hospital would be on duty recognize him and call the police now pittmans brow felt less clammy as he reached the lower floor which was deserted except for a janitor at the far end of the corridor using the last of his change he put coins in the machine how do you like your coffee with cream sugar decaffeinated actually id like tea jill reached past him pressing a button pittman couldnt help noticing the elegant shape of her hand the machine made a whirring sound jill turned to him what do you need to ask me steaming liquid poured into a cardboard cup i have to verify some information was mr millgate alert before his associates showed up and took him from the hospital associates is too kind a word thugs would be more like it even the doctor who insisted on removing him did millgate object i guess im not making your job easy i beg your pardon i got off the track right away i didnt answer your first question yes he was alert otherwiseto answer your second questionhe wouldnt have been able to object she sipped from the cardboard cup hows the tea scented hot water these hospital machines im used to it her smile was engaging why did millgate object he didnt want to be moved yes and no theres something about that night i still dont understand oh the men who came to get him insisted that he had to leave because thered been a story about him on the late news they told millgate they had to get him away before reporters showed up yes the story was about a confidential justice department report that somehow became public millgate was being investigated for being involved in a covert scheme to buy nuclear weapons from the former soviet union nuclear weapons but that isnt what they said in the newspapers jills eyes were such a pale blue they seemed almost translucent what who said the men who came to get millgate that night in the newspapers they said they took him away because they were afraid this obituary reporterwhats his name pittman matthew pittman yes in the newspapers they said they were afraid pittman would kill millgate if millgate stayed in the hospital where pittman could get at him but that night they never said a word about pittman all they seemed to care about was the news report that millgate was being investigated pittman felt tense again its like they changed their story jill said and millgate didnt think the news report about his being investigated was a goodenough reason to take him from the hospital not exactly pensive jill sipped her tea her solemn expression enhanced her features he was willing to go or to put it another way he was passive melancholy he didnt seem to care about leaving do whatever you want he kept saying it doesnt matter none of it does but dont take me yet thats what he was upset about not yet he kept saying wait for what a priest pittmans pulse sped as he remembered that at the scarsdale estate he had overheard two of the grand counselors talking with concern while he crouched on the roof of the garage priest an elderly mans brittle voice had said dont worry a second elderly voice had said i told you the priest never arrived jonathan never spoke to him even so its been taken care of the second voice had emphasized reminding pittman of the rattle of dead leaves its safe now secure tell me about him pittman said quickly the priest do you know his name millgate mentioned one priest a lot his name was father jill thought a moment dandridge father dandridge when millgate was brought to intensive care he was certain he was going to die he didnt have much strength but the few words he got out were always about this father dandridge millgate told business associates who were allowed to visit that they had to send for him later he accused them of not obeying in fact he accused his son of lying to him about sending for the priest theres a priest on duty at the hospital of course he came around to speak to millgate but it seems any priest wasnt good enough it had to be father dandridge i was on duty early thursday morning when millgate begged the hospital priest to phone father dandridge at his parish in boston i guess the hospital priest did what makes you think so about an hour after millgate was taken out of here thursday night a priest who called himself father dandridge came in to see him he was very upset about not being able to hear millgates confession he came from a parish in boston do you remember the name im afraid not pittmans spirit sank but you dont have to phone boston to talk to him jill said what do you mean father dandridge made a point of telling me that he wasnt returning to boston not until he had a chance to talk to millgate if i heard anything the priest said i was to call him at a rectory here in manhattan st josephs the priest said hed be staying for the weekend jill glanced at her watch look im sorry but ive been off the ward too long i have a patient whos due for his meds i understand thank you youve helped me more than you can imagine if theres anything else you need to know ill get back to you jill set down the cardboard cup and walked quickly toward the elevator it took about twenty seconds for the doors to open and as she waited facing the doors obviously aware that he watched her pittman was impressed that she didnt act selfconscious after she got in the elevator as the doors closed for a fraction of an instant she smiled at him then she was gone and the excitement that pittman felt about what he had learned was replaced by exhaustion that weighed so heavily his legs bent pittmans sudden weakness alarmed him lightheaded he feared that he would lose his balance he leaned against the coffee machine what did you expect he told himself the past two days youve had more exercise than youve had all year youve been running all over manhattan you got a few hours sleep on a park bench you havent had enough to eat youve been strung out from fear and adrenaline its a wonder you managed to stay on your feet as long as you have but i cant collapse not here not now why not he joked bitterly a hospitals a great place to collapse have to get back to sean have to go back to the loft but after pittman concentrated to steady himself and pushed away from the coffee machine he discovered that he wasnt steady at all his legs wavered more disturbingly his stomach felt queasy he gripped the wall afraid that the janitor at the end of the corridor would look in his direction see that he was in trouble and call for help have to get away from here sure and how far do you think youll get youre oozing sweat pal youre seeing gray if you go outside youre liable to collapse on the street after the police find you after they see the name on your credit card and find that in your coat pocket where then his bitter joke echoed in his mind a hospitals a great place to collapse as the elevator rose pittmans lightheadedness increased when the doors opened on the sixth floor he strained to look natural and walked toward the intensivecare area if jill warren came out or the female doctor hed spoken to earlier he doubted that hed have the strength to explain convincingly why he had returned but pittman didnt have another option the intensivecare waiting room was the only refuge he could think of that he knew he could get to its lights had been dimmed he veered left from the corridor passed several tautfaced people trying to doze on the uncomfortable chairs stepped over a man sleeping on the floor and came to a metal cabinet in back the cabinet contained hospital pillows and blankets pittman knew he had found out the hard way when jeremy had been rushed to intensive care and pittman had spent the first of many nights in the waiting room a staff member had told him about the pillows and blankets but had explained that usually the cabinet was kept locked then why store the pillows and blankets in the cabinet if people cant get to them pittman had complained because we dont want people sleeping here so you force them to stay awake in those metal chairs all night its a hospital rule tonight ill make an exception the staff member had unlocked the cabinet now pittman twisted the latch on the cabinet found that it was locked and angrily pulled out the tool knife sean oreilly had given him his hands trembled it took him longer than it normally would have but finally using the lock picks concealed in the knife he opened the cabinet dizzy nauseous he lay among others in the most murky corner of the waiting room a pillow beneath his head a blanket pulled over him despite the hard floor sleep had never come quicker or been more welcome as he drifted into unconsciousness he was dimly aware that others in the waiting room groped toward the pillows and blankets in the cabinet that he had deliberately left open he was disturbed only oncean elderly man waking a frail woman shes dead may nothin they could do daylight and voices woke him those whod remained all night in the waiting room were rousing themselves others whose friends or relatives had evidently just been admitted to intensive care were trying to acquaint themselves with their new surroundings pittman sat up wearily concentrated to clear his head and stood slowly with effort the combination of the hard floor and his previous days exertion made his muscles ache after he folded the blanket and put it and the pillow into the cabinet he draped his overcoat over an arm concealing the heavy bulge of the in his right pocket a hospital volunteer brought in a cart of coffee orange juice and doughnuts noticing a sign that said pay what you can pittman couldnt find any more change in his pockets sean oreilly had lent him twenty dollars and pittman guiltily put in one of those dollars drank two cups of orange juice ate two doughnuts and suddenly was afraid that he would throw up in a washroom down the hall he splashed cold water on his face looked at his pasty complexion in the mirror touched his beard stubble and felt demoralized how can i possibly keep going he thought the suicide that he had almost committed four nights earlier beckoned why bother trying im in so much trouble i can never get out of it he thought even if i do get out of it jeremy will still be dead whats the point nothings worth what im going through you cant let the bastards destroy you remember what you told yourselfit has to be your idea not theirs if you kill yourself now youll be giving them what they want youll be letting them win dont let the sons of bitches have that satisfaction a short drearylooking man whom pittman recognized from the waiting room came into the washroom took off his shirt chose the sink next to pittman opened a travel kit lathered his face and began to shave say you wouldnt have another one of those disposable razors would you pittman asked do what i did buddy go down to the shop in the lobby and buy one st josephs hadnt benefited from the renovation that thanks to an influx of yuppies during the eighties had taken place in other parts of soho although small the churchs architecture resembled a cathedral but its sandstone exterior was black with soot its stainedglass windows grimy its interior badly in need of painting pittman stood at the rear of the church smelled incense listened to an organ that sounded as if it needed repair and surveyed the impressive amount of worshipers who unmindful of the bleak surroundings had come for sunday mass the front of the church wasnt bleak though a golden chalice gleamed on the altar candles glowed a tall intense priest wearing a crimson vestment read from the gospel then delivered a sermon about trusting in god and not giving in to despair right pittman thought bleakly he sat in a pew in back and watched the continuation of the first mass hed attended in many years he had never gone to church on a regular basis but after jeremy had died his indifference had turned to rejection as a consequence he couldnt account for his impulse when the time came for communion and he followed parishioners toward the altar he told himself that he wanted to get a closer look at the priest for an assistant at the churchs rectory had told pittman that father dandridge would be conducting this particular mass coming near to him pittman saw that the priest was in his middle fifties and that his strong features had deep lines of strain he had a jagged scar across his chin and his left hand was welted from what looked like the consequence of a longago fire when pittman received communion the emptiness inside him felt immense the priest ended the mass go in peace not just yet pittman thought as the parishioners left he made his way toward the front of the church went through a door on the right and found himself in the sacristy the room next to the altar where objects needed for mass were customarily stored the priest was taking off his vestments setting them on a counter when he noticed pittman enter deliberate movements and cordlike sinews visible on the priests forearms suggested a man who kept his mind and body in condition and control he became still watching pittman approach may i help you the priest asked father dandridge thats correct i need to speak to you very well the priest waited as pittman hesitated the priest cocked his head you look nervous is this a personal matter something for confession no yes i mean it is personal but what i need to speak to you about pittman felt apprehensive about the reaction he would getis jonathan millgate the priests dark eyes assessed him yes i remember you from the mass the anguish on your face as you came up for communion as if the weight of the entire world were on your shoulders thats how it feels understandably if what the newspapers say about you is correct mr pittman panic it had never occurred to pittman that the priest would be able to identify him nerves quickening he swung toward the door about to flee no father dandridge said please dont go be calm something in the priests voice made pittman hesitate i give you my word father dandridge said you have nothing to fear from me pittmans stomach cramped how did you know who you are father dandridge gestured inadvertently drawing pittmans attention to his scarred left hand jonathan millgate and i had a special relationship it shouldnt be surprising that i would have read every newspaper article and watched every television report i could find to learn more about what happened to him i have studied your photograph many times i recognized you immediately pittman couldnt seem to get enough air its important that you believe this i didnt kill him important to me or you i tried to save him not harm him pittman was suddenly conscious of the amplifying echo in the small room he glanced nervously toward the archway that led to the altar father dandridge gazed in that direction as well the church was almost empty a few elderly men and women remained kneeling their heads bowed in prayer no one seems to have heard you father dandridge said but the next mass is scheduled to begin in half an hour the church will soon be full he pointed toward two men who entered at the back of the church is there somewhere we can talk i ask you again do you want confession what i want is what you promised at the end of the mass peace father dandridge intensified his gaze then nodded come with me the priest led the way toward a door at the back of the sacristy when he opened it pittman was amazed to look out toward a garden its wellkept appearance in contrast with the decay at the front of the church neatly mowed grass was flanked by blooming lilacs their fragrance wafting through the open door the rectangular area was enclosed by a high brick wall father dandridge motioned for pittman to precede him when pittman didnt respond the priest looked amused suspicious of me you dont want to turn your back on me how could i possibly hurt you lately people have been finding ways keeping his hand on the hidden in his overcoat pocket pittman glanced back through the arch toward the church which was rapidly being filled he followed the priest into the garden and shut the door the morning sun was warm and brilliant emphasizing the jagged white scar on father dandridges chin the priest sat on a metal bench the sound of the citys traffic seemed far away why should i believe that you didnt kill jonathan millgate because if i did i ought to be on the run why would i come to you father dandridge raised his shoulders perhaps youre as deranged as the news reports say perhaps you intend to kill me as well no i need your help and how could i possibly help you why would i want to help you in the news reports millgates people claim they took him from the hospital to protect him from me but thats not true pittman insisted the real reason they took him is they didnt want to expose him to reporters after the story broke about his supposed connection with trying to buy nuclear weapons from the former soviet union even if you can prove what you say i can its irrelevant to whether or not you killed him its very relevant look i followed him from the hospital yes but i wasnt stalking him i wanted to find out why hed been taken at the estate in scarsdale the nurse and doctor who were supposed to be caring for him left him alone he became disconnected from his lifesupport system i managed to get into his room and help him but a witness claims it happened the other way around that you cut off his oxygen and caused him to have a fatal heart attack a nurse came in when i was putting the oxygen prongs into millgates nostrils she heard millgate tell me something i think thats what all of this is about his people were afraid of reporters asking him questions but im a reporter and what millgate told me may have been exactly what they didnt want anybody to know they tried to stop me but i got away and father dandridge added so they decided to cut off jonathan millgates lifesupport system to let him die to prevent him from ever telling anyone else then they blamed his death on you so that even if you tried to use what you were told you wouldnt be believed thats right pittman said amazed thats the theory im trying to prove how did when you hear enough confessions you become proficient at anticipating this isnt confession what did jonathan millgate say to you pittmans energy dwindled discouragement overcoming him he rubbed the back of his neck thats the problem it doesnt seem that important in a way it doesnt even make sense but later a man tried to kill me at my apartment because of what millgate had told me now you tell me a mans name pittman shook his head in confusion and something about snow a name duncan grollier father dandridge concentrated assessing pittman jonathan millgate was perhaps the most despicable man i have ever met what but you said that the two of you were friends father dandridge smiled bitterly no i said that he and i had a special relationship i could never be his friend but i could pity him as much as i loathed his actions i could try to save his soul you see i was his confessor pittman straightened with surprise when you saw me in the sacristy you couldnt help noticing my scars im sorry i didnt mean to its quite all right theres no need to worry about my feelings im proud of these scars i earned them in combat during the vietnam war i was a chaplain in i corps a base i was assigned toclose to the demilitarized zonecame under siege bad weather kept reinforcements from being brought in we were under constant mortar bombardment of course as a noncombatant i wasnt allowed to use a weapon but i could care for the wounded i could crawl with food and water and ammunition i could give dying men the last sacrament the scar on my chin is from shrapnel the scars on my hand are from a fire i helped to put out when i say im proud of these scars its because they remind me of what a privilege it was to serve beside such brave men of two hundred only fifty survived by the time reinforcements were able to come none of those who died was older than twentyone and i blame jonathan millgate for those deaths just as i blame him for the entire fortyseven thousand men who died in battle in that war a hundred and fifty thousand men were wounded thousands of other lives were destroyed because of the psychological effects of the war and why because millgate and his four colleaguesthe priest twisted his lips in contemptthe socalled grand counselorsadvised the president and the nation that the domino theory was something worth dying for that if we didnt keep the communists out of vietnam the rest of southeast asia would fall to them a quarter of a century later communism is a crumbling philosophy and southeast asia is becoming ever more capitalistic even though south vietnam was taken over by the communists the war made no difference but jonathan millgate and the other grand counselors became obscenely rich because of their relationship with the arms industry that inevitably profited from the war the grand counselors insisted was necessary and now millgate was being investigated for a nuclear weapons scandal pittman said is that why he wanted so desperately to talk to you before he died his associates were determined to keep him away from you they felt you were a threat father dandridge squinted when i came back from vietnam i harassed jonathan millgate at every opportunity i organized demonstrations against him i tried to shame him in every way i could i believe i was one of the reasons he stopped being a diplomat and retired from public view of course he still manipulated government policy but at least he was forced to do it from comparative hiding then to my surprise six months ago he phoned me he asked permission to come and see me suspicious i agreed and when he arrived i discovered that he was having a crisis of conscience he wasnt a catholic but he felt a desperate need to bare his soul he wanted me to be his confessor his confessor after all the trouble youd made for him he wanted to confess to someone whom he could not intimidate but what was so important that he needed to confess father dandridge shook his head you know im bound at the risk of my soul never to reveal what i hear in confession pittman breathed out with effort then i came here for nothing duncan grollier are you sure thats the name you heard pittman nodded except what he mentioned duncan several times then snow then grollier could snow be someones last name i dont know but in this case grollier isnt its the name of the prep school millgate went to thats a matter of public record im not violating any confidence by telling you in conscience its all i can tell you but it ought to be enough what are you talking about enough i dont understand the bullet struck father dandridges right eye pittman was so startled by the sudden eruption of blood and jelly like tissue that he recoiled gasping at first he wasnt even sure what had happened then stumbling back he saw the spray of brain and blood that spewed onto the lawn from the rear of father dandridges head pittman wanted to scream but terror paralyzed his voice he bumped against a statue and flinched as a bullet blasted chunks from the stone although he hadnt heard any shots it seemed that the bullets were coming from the door through which he and father dandridge had entered the garden using the statue for cover pittman pulled the from his overcoat tried to control his trembling hands cocked the pistol and understood that hed be foolish to show himself in order to aim at the door the garden became eerily silent the gunman must have used a silencer pittman thought no one in the church knows what happened no one will send for help but another mass is due to start pittman realized when the priest enters the sacristy to put on his vestments hell see the gunman peering out toward this garden the priest will call for helpand be shot i cant let that happen i have to get out of here pittman heard a creaking noise as if the door to the garden was being opened wider his hands were slick with sweat he clutched the harder shoot but i dont have a target the noise will bring help not in time there werent any other doors out of the garden by the time pittman reached the brick wall and tried to climb it he knew hed be shot it may have been pittmans imagination but he thought he heard a footstep he glanced around in a frenzy his pulse raced he thought he heard another footstep past a lilac bush on his right he saw a groundlevel window that led to the churchs basement nauseated by fear he shot blindly from the side of the statue toward where he thought he had heard the footstep he lunged toward the opposite side of the statue and fired again and again this time showing himself but unable to aim steadily he saw a man dive behind the bench upon which father dandridge lay he saw another man duck back into the sacristy and he realized he had only four bullets left the way he was shaking he might use them all without hitting either gunman move firing again to cover himself he charged to his right toward the lilac bush and the window behind it chest heaving he hit the ground clawed toward the window and slammed his pistol at the glass breaking it the force made the window open it hadnt been secured as the window tilted inward on hinges pittman thrust himself through the opening he fell into darkness twisting plummeting with an impact that knocked his breath from him he landed on a bench then toppled painfully onto the floor he winced broken glass from the window impaled his left hand deep burning he pulled out the glass alarmed by the flow of blood and the searing pain scrambled desperately to his feet and ran from the open window a man shot into the dark room pittmans eyes adjusted to the shadows enough to see a doorway ahead he fired toward the window heard a moan jerked the door open and surged into a brightly lit room where he blinked in dismay at a group of women setting out pastries for what looked like a bake sale their mouths fell open in shock a woman dropped a cake a baby started wailing another woman shriekedbut not before pittman heard noises behind him the two men climbing down into the room get out of the way pittman ordered the women he raised his gun the sight of which made them scurry at once he slammed the door behind him saw that it didnt have a lock and grabbed one of the tables dragging it toward the door hoping to brace the door shut a shot from behind the door splintered wood pittman fired back only one more bullet as women screamed he raced toward stairs at the end of the large room above him he heard a commotion in the church he reached the stairs expecting the gunmen to knock the door open and fire at him but as he hurried up he risked a glance behind him and saw that the door remained closed too many witnesses theyre not taking chances theyre climbing out the window theyre going over the wall hearing numerous hurried footsteps at the top of the stairs pittman shoved the into his pocket frantic parishioners charged down the steps toward him a man with a gun down there pittman showed them the hand that hed cut on the broken glass in greater pain he clutched it trying to stop the flow of blood he shot me call the police a doctor i need a doctor sweating pittman pushed his way through the crowd the crowd began to panic what if he shoots someone else he might kill all of us abruptly reversing its direction the crowd charged up the stairs the press of bodies made pittman feel suffocated their force carried him up a door loomed someone banged it open the crowd surged into the street taking pittman with them a few seconds later he was enveloped by the confusion of hundreds of panicked churchgoers as a siren approached pittman shoved his bleeding hand into his overcoat pocket he stayed with a group of frightened men and women who hurried away by the time the flashing lights of the first police car arrived he was turning a corner hailing a taxi whats all the trouble down there the driver asked a shooting at a church god help us somebody better where do you want to go a damned good question pittman thought in desperation he told the driver the first nearby location he could think of washington square pittman hoped he seemed just one of many sundaymorning strollers in contrast with the weeks cool rainy weather the day was warm and bright joggers and bicyclists sped past street musicians and portrait painters indigents and street vendors near the washington arch students with new york university tshirts played with a frisbee while a beardstubbled man holding a bottle in a paper bag stumbled past them pittman didnt pay attention to any of it concealed in his overcoat pocket his hand continued to throb against a handkerchief that he had wrapped around it to staunch the flow of blood obviously he was hurt worse than hed thought he felt lightheaded again but this time he was sure it was from the blood hed lost he had to get to a hospital but a hospital wouldnt give him treatment unless he showed id and filled out an information form if the receptionist recognized his name or if the police alerted the hospitals to be on the lookout for someone with a bleeding hand no he had to find another way to get medical help and then what he kept insisting to himself where will you go after that father dandridge was supposed to have all your answers and now hes dead and you dont know anything more than when you started why did they kill him pittman thought urgently if they were after me why didnt they wait until i left the church because they wanted both of us they must have been watching him they were looking for any sign that he was going to act on what millgate had told him in earlier confessions and when i showed up they assumed we were working together but what did father dandridge know that was so important grollier the prep school millgate had attended it must have some significance damn it somebodys worried enough to kill anybody i come in touch with who might know anything about the thoughts that tortured millgate in his final hours final hours pittman suddenly knew where he had to go next detective logan he said to the intercom a buzzer sounded electronically unlocking the outside door pittman stepped through noting the attractive wood paneling in the upper west side apartment building he took the elevator to the fifth floor hed been worried that the womans phone number wouldnt be listed or that she wouldnt be home after he checked the phone book and came here as he knocked on the door he worried as well that she wouldnt be receptive but when she opened the door using her left hand to keep her housecoat securely fastened squinting at him through sleepy eyes she looked puzzled more than upset silhouetted by sunlight streaming through a living room window behind her jill warren murmured dont you know its the middle of the night that was something pittman had hoped forthat instead of going out to enjoy the day she would be home sleeping after she finished her night shift at the hospital sorry he said i didnt have a choice jill yawned reminding pittman of a kitten pawing at its face although her long blond hair was tangled and her face was puffy from just having been wakened pittman thought she was beautiful you need to ask me more questions a little more than that im afraid i dont understand i need help pittman withdrew his bloodstained hand from his overcoat pocket my god jills eyes came fully open hurry come in she gripped his arm guiding him through the doorway quickly closing it the kitchens this way i wondered why you looked so pale i thought maybe you hadnt gotten any sleep but here put your hand in the sink as pittman wavered she hurriedly brought a chair from the kitchen table and made him sit beside the sink while she pulled off his overcoat the concealed in its right pocket thunked against the chair and made jill frown look i know this is an imposition pittman said if im interrupting anything if someones here and nobody at the hospital pittman had noted that she wasnt wearing a wedding ring nonetheless hed been concerned that she might be living with someone her roommate might have gone out for the day to avoid making noise to let her sleep i live alone jill said this handkerchief is stuck to your wound im going to run cool water over it and peel it off how did you good its coming off does that hurt no sure thats why your face turned gray this looks like a cut broken glass deep you should have gone to the hospital instead of coming here your apartment was closer you need stitches no pittman said jill frowned at him then returned her attention to pittmans hand which do you object to the hospital or the stitches pittman didnt answer jill rinsed the crusted blood off the hand then directed a gentle flow of water into the cut keep your hand under the water i have to get bandages and disinfectant then she was gone pittman worried that she might decide to run from the apartment to his relief he heard her opening drawers in another room he stared at the blood welling from his hand the water diluting it pink fluid flowing down the drain weary he looked away feeling oddly at a distance as he scanned the small bright neatly arranged kitchen a pot holder in the shape of a cat seemed more amusing than it should have been your face is grayer jill said with concern hurrying back i cant imagine what youre smiling about do you feel delirious a little off balance for god sake dont fall off the chair jill put her arms around him leaning past him over the sink he felt her breasts against his back but was too tired to respond with anything but gratitude that she was taking care of him gently she washed his hand blotted it with a towel applied amber disinfectant to the cut put a dressing on a gauze pad and wrapped a bandage around the hand blood soaked through the first layer jill bandaged faster adding layer after layer youd better hope this stops the bleeding or youll be going to the hospital whether you like it or not she said pittman stared at the thick padding around his hand a portion of it turned pink but it didnt spread one more layer for good luck jill wrapped it again now lets get you into the living room and up on the sofa im fine pittman said i can do it myself yeah sure right jill lifted him putting an arm around him as his knees bent the sunlit living room turned shadowy for a moment then pittman was on the sofa lie down look i really am sorry put your feet on this pillow i want them higher than your head i wouldnt have come here if there was any other way to stop talking you sound out of breath lie still im going to get you some water pittman closed his eyes the next thing he knew jill was cradling his head helping him to drink if you dont feel queasy after this ill get you some juice do you think you could eat would you like something bland like toast eat you make it sound like a new idea the last time i you could say my meals have been irregular jill frowned harder your overcoats torn your pants have dirt on them as if youve been crawling on the ground whats going on how did you get hurt a broken window you look like youve been in a fight pittman didnt answer were not going to get anywhere if youre not honest jill said im taking a big chance by helping you i know youre not a policeman youre matthew pittman and the police are hunting you the shock of her statement brought pittman upright no jill said dont try to sit how long have you lie back down how long have i known since about thirty seconds after you started talking to me at the hospital dear god this time when pittman tried to sit up jill put a hand on his chest stay down i wasnt kidding if the bleeding doesnt stop youll have to go to a hospital pittman studied her and nodded adrenaline offset his lightheadedness matt what you called me matthew my friends call me matt does that mean im supposed to think of you as a friend hey its better than thinking of me as an enemy and youre not would you believe me if i said no its not as if you never lied to me before look i dont get it if you knew who i was at the hospital why didnt you call the police what makes you think i didnt what if i told you i played along with your charade because i was afraid of you you might have hurt me if i let on i knew who you really were did you phone the police you dont remember me do you jill asked remember where would we have im not surprised you were under a lot of stress about as much as anybody can take i still dont its only in the last six months that ive been working in adult intensive care pittman shook his head in confusion before that i worked in the childrens section i left because i couldnt stand seeing i was one of jeremys nurses pittman felt as if his stomach had turned to ice i was on duty the night jeremy died jill said in fact id been on duty all that week youd received permission to sit in a corner of the room and watch over him sometimes youd ask me about the meaning of some of the numbers on his lifesupport machines or youd get a look at his chart and ask me what some of the terms meant but you werent really seeing me your sole attention was toward jeremy you had a book with you and sometimes if everything was quiet youd read a page or two but then youd raise your eyes and study jeremy study his monitors study jeremy again i got the feeling that you were focusing all your will all your energy and prayers as if by concentrating you could transfer your strength to jeremy and cure him pittmans mouth felt suddenly dry thats what i thought dumb huh jills eyes glistened no it was one of the most moving things ive ever seen pittman tried to sit up groping for the glass of water on the table beside the sofa here let me help jill raised the glass to his lips why do you keep looking at me that way pittman asked i remember jill said how you helped take care of jeremy little things like dipping a washcloth into ice water and rubbing it over him to try to bring down his fever he was in a coma by then but all the while you washed him you were talking to him as if he could hear every word you said pittman squinted painfully remembering i was sure he could i thought if i got deep enough into his mind hed respond to what i was telling him and wake up jill nodded and then his feet began curling the doctor told you to massage them and his legs to try to keep jeremys muscles limber so they wouldnt atrophy sure pittman felt pressure in his throat and when his feet still kept curling i put his shoes on him for an hour then took them off then put them on in another hour after all when jeremy would finally come out of the coma when his cancer would finally be cured i wanted him to be able to walk normally jills blue eyes became intense i watched you every night of my shift all that week i couldnt get over your devotion in fact even though i was due for two days off i asked to stay on the case i was there when jeremy went into crisis when he had his heart attack pittman had trouble breathing so when i read the newspapers and learned all the murders you were supposed to have committed i didnt believe it jill said yes the newspapers theorized you were so overcome with grief that you were suicidal that you wanted to take other people with you but after watching you for a week in intensive care i knew you were so gentle you couldnt possibly inflict pain on anyone not deliberately perhaps on yourself but not on anyone else you must have been surprised when i showed up at the hospital i couldnt understand what was going on if you were suicidal and on a killing rampage why would you come to the intensivecare ward why would you pretend to be a detective and ask about jonathan millgates last night in the ward thats not how a guilty person would act but it is how a person whos been trapped would act in order to get answers to try to prove he didnt do what the police said he did i appreciate your trust hey im not gullible but i saw the way you suffered when your son died ive never seen anyone love anybody harder i thought maybe you had a break coming so you let me pretend i was a detective what was i supposed to do admit i knew who you were youd have panicked right now youd be in jail or dead a knock on the door made pittman flinch he frowned toward jill are you expecting anyone jill looked puzzled no did you lock the door after i came in of course this is new york again someone knocked pittman mustered the strength to stand bring my overcoat put those bandages under the sink in the kitchen as soon as im out of sight in the closet open the door but dont let on that im here the third knock was louder open up this is the police jill turned toward pittman the police he said maybe but maybe not dont tell them im here apprehension overcame his unsteadiness he took the overcoat jill gave him pretend you were sleeping but what if it is the police and they find you tell them i scared you into lying someone knocked even harder rattling the door jill raised her voice just a moment she looked at pittman he gently touched her arm you have to trust me please dont tell them im here as he hurried toward the closet he didnt let jill see the he took from his overcoat pocket heart pounding he entered stood between coats and closed the door waiting in darkness feeling smothered after a moment during which he assumed jill was hiding any further indication that he had come to the apartment pittman heard her put the chain on the main door then unlock the dead bolt he imagined her opening the door only to the slight limit of the chain peering through a gap in the doorway yes how can i help you what took you so long you woke me up i work nights i was sleeping let us in not until i see your id startled pittman heard a crash the sound of wood splintering the door being shoved open the chain being yanked out of the doorjamb heavy footsteps pounded into the hallway the door was slammed shut someone locked it hey what are you where is he lady who pittman who dont look so damn innocent we know he came up here one of our men was watching this place and called us after pittman went to the priest we figured he might be making the rounds to anybody else whod talked to millgate before he died and we were right i dont know what youre talking about i checked the bedroom another voice said nothing is there a back way out of here lady no one in the bathroom a third voice said answer me lady damn it is there a back way out of here youre hurting me hes not in this closet check the one in the hall where is he lady as jill screamed pittman heard footsteps approach the closet a heavy set man yanked the door open exhaled at the sight of pittman raised a pistol with a silencer and lurched back as pittman shot him the guns report was amplified so loudly by the confines of the closet that pittmans ears rang fiercely he surged from the closet and aimed the at two husky men in the living room one of whom was twisting jills arm so severely that shed sunk to her knees her face contorted with pain they both had silenced pistols but as they spun startled the frenzied look on pittmans face made them freeze raise your hands pittman screamed seeing the outraged expression on his face staring at thes barrel they obeyed jill fell away take it easy one man said the way youre shaking that gun might go off on its own right the other man said dont make it any worse for yourself were police officers in your dreams keep your hands up drop the guns behind you they seemed to calculate their chances do it pittman tensed his finger on thes trigger the guns thunked onto the floor pittman walked past jill picked up one of the silenced pistols and shook less violentlybecause after hed left the church there had been only one bullet left in the and he had used it on the man who had opened the closet door thered been no time to grab that mans pistol in order to catch the remaining gunmen off guard hed been forced to threaten them with an empty weapon first making sure to press the lever that closed thes ejection slide so they wouldnt realize the weapon was empty easing it shut so they wouldnt hear a noise the men had slammed and locked the main door after they entered now someone else was banging on the door a frail worried voice asking jill are you all right pittman frowned at her who is it the old man who lives next door tell him youre not dressed or else youd open the door tell him you had the tv too loud as jill moved down the hall pittman ordered the men open your jackets lift them by the shoulders two years ago hed done a story about training techniques at the police academy an instructor had invited him to participate in a session about subduing hostile prisoners he strained to remember what hed learned when the men lifted their jackets pittman walked around them he didnt see any other weapons that didnt mean there werent any however down on your knees listen pittman i guess you dont think id shoot you the same as i shot your buddy no im a believer then get down on your knees good now cross your ankles link your fingers behind your necks as the men assumed that awkward position jill returned did your neighbor believe you i think so jill said wonderful no he says when he heard the shot before he knocked on my door he called the police jesus pittman said youd better hurry put on some clothes we have to tie these men up and get out of here we you heard what they said after i went to the priest they figured i might go to anyone else who had talked to millgate before he died what priest the one you told me about father dandridge look i dont have time to explain the priest is dead they killed him and im afraid they think you know too much you might be next the police will protect me but these men said they were the police jill stared at the gunmen on the floor her eyes wide with understanding while she dressed quickly pittman used bandages and surgical tape to bind the gunmens arms and legs hearing police sirens he and jill ran nervously from her apartment neighbors frightened by the gunshot peered from partially open doors then slammed and locked the doors when they saw pittman charging along the hallway he reached the elevator but then thought better we might be trapped in there grabbing jills hand he rushed toward the stairs she resisted only a moment then hurried with him her apartment was on the fifth floor and they rapidly reached the third floor then the second on the ground floor they faltered hearing sirens approaching where does that door lead pittman breathed deeply pointing toward a door at the end of the corridor behind him it was the only one that didnt have a number on it it had a red light over it is that an exit yes but come on he tugged at jills sleeve and moved quicky along the hallway through the door and outside into the shadowy bottom of an air shaft garbage cans lined its walls its a dead end i tried to tell you jill turned to run back into her apartment building theres nowhere to what about that pittman pointed toward a door directly across from him he rushed over to it twisted its knob and groaned when he found that it was locked doing his best to control his shaky hands he pulled out his tool knife and used the lock picks exhaling with relief when he shoved the door open it led into a hallway in the apartment building behind jills the moment he and jill were inside he shut the door and turned the knob on the dead bolt by the time the police got it open he and jill would be out of the area as they hurried onto eightysixth street pittman imagined the police cars arriving at jills apartment building on eightyfifth street two blocks to the east was an entrance to central park jills casual clothessneakers jeans and a sweatermade it easy for her to run she clutched her purse close to her side at the hospital pittman had sensed from her comfortable graceful movements that she was an athlete and now her long legs stretched in an easy runners rhythm proving that hed been right they slowed briefly to avoid attracting attention then increased speed again after they entered central park racing east beyond the childrens playground then south past grownups playing baseball on the great lawn finally below the delacorte theater belvedere lake and belvedere castle they chose one of the many small trails that led through the trees in the section of the park known as the ramble it was almost two in the afternoon the sun continued to be strong for april and sweat beaded pittmans forehead as well as made his shirt cling to his chest while he and jill rounded a deserted section of boulders and gradually came to a stop in the distance there were other sirens leaning against a tree whose branches were green with budding leaves pittman tried to catch his breath i i dont think we were followed no this is all wrong what jills expression was stark im having second thoughts about this i shouldnt be here at my apartment i was scared and youre not scared now pittman asked in dismay those men breaking in when you shot one of them ive never seen anybody the way you were talking you confused me i think i should have waited for the police to come jill drew her fingers through her long blond hair you should have waited the police can help you theyd put me in jail id never get out alive have you any idea how paranoid you sound and apparently you think its normal for gunmen to break into your apartment im not being paranoid im being practical since thursday night everywhere ive gone people have been trying to kill me im not about to let the police put me in a cell where ill be an easy target but the police will think im involved in this you are involved those men would have killed you you cant depend on the police to keep you safe from them jill shook her head in bewilderment listen to me pittman said im trying to save your life my life wouldnt have needed to be saved if you hadnt come to my apartment the remark made pittman flinch as if hed been slapped although he heard children laughing on another trail the trail he was on was suddenly very silent youre right he said i made a mistake i shouldnt have said that im sorry pittman nodded i am too he walked away draped over his left arm was his overcoat heavy with his and one of the gunmens pistols with ammunition magazines from the others in his pockets hey where are you going pittman didnt answer wait but pittman didnt wait jill caught up to him i said i was sorry everything you said was true the odds are that those men would have left you alone if i hadnt shown up for certain father dandridge would still be alive if i hadnt gone to see him millgate might still be alive and my friend burt would be alive and no pay attention to me jill grabbed his shoulders and turned him none of this is your fault i apologize for blaming you for what happened at my apartment you meant no harm you only came there because you needed help pittman suddenly heard voices rapid footsteps what sounded like runners on the trail ahead he stepped to the side among bushes his hand on the pistol in his overcoat pocket jill crowded next to him three joggerstwo young men and a slender woman all wearing brightly colored spandex outfitshurried past talking to one another then the trail was quiet again youd be safer if you didnt stay with me pittman said maybe youre right phone the police tell them i forced you to go with me tell them youre afraid to show yourself because you think the men who broke into your apartment have friends wholl come after you you might even tell them im innocent not that theyll believe you no you wont tell them im innocent i wont tell them anything the more i think about it the more i have to agree with you the police would question me and let me go but id still be in danger or maybe i could convince them to put me in protective custody but for how long eventually id be on my own in danger again then what are you going to do stay with you me tell me how i can help the bank jill used citibank had a branch south of central park at fiftyfirst and fifth avenue as usual on a sunday afternoon the avenue wasnt busy making sure that passersby didnt overhear him pittman explained how the police had arranged for his banks automated teller machine to seize his card but they havent had time to do anything about your card whats the maximum the bank allows you to take out im not sure it could be as much as a thousand dollars that much pittman shook his head not that it does us any good i doubt youve got it in your account jill assumed an odd expression i might have well i know its a lot but this is an emergency please get as much as you can they entered the banks vestibule jill shoved her card into the machine and responded to the computer screens inquiries pressing buttons a minute and a half later she was stuffing a wad of twenties and tens into her purse dont forget your card pittman said and heres your transaction printout he glanced down wondering what information might be on it that someone could use if the printout had been left behind the printout indicated the remaining funds in the account and pittman abruptly understood the odd expression on jills face when hed asked her about the size of her account eightyseven thousand dollars and fortythree cents jill looked uncomfortable youve got a fortune in this account that printout is confidential her blue eyes flashed i couldnt help looking pittman said surely it occurred to you that i couldnt be living in a large upper west side apartment on a nurses salary pittman didnt answer you mean you had no idea i had money no how did my grandparents a trust fund some bonds just came due im deciding how to reinvest thats why theres so much money in the account pittman studied her with wonder is this going to be a problem hell no if youve got that much money how about treating a starving man to a decent meal the restauranton east seventyninth streetwas small and unassuming a linoleum floor plain booths red plastic tablecloths but the veal scallopini which pittman recommended was excellent and the modestly priced house burgundy was delicious a few tables had been set out on the sidewalk and pittman sat in the sunlight with jill enjoying the last of his salad thats your second helping jill said i didnt think youd ever get full i told you i was hungry this is the first decent meal ive had in quite a while mostly ive been eating on the run you didnt like the food its wonderful but the restaurant doesnt exactly announce itself how on earth did you ever find this place pittman bit into the final piece of garlic bread i used to live around here the memory made him solemn when i was married past tense jill set down her wineglass grief and connubial bliss dont seem to go together now i guess im the one whos snooping there isnt much to tell my wife was stronger than i was that doesnt mean she loved jeremy less but after he died i fell apart ellen didnt i think she was afraid i was going to be like that for the rest of my life shed lost her son and now she was losing i scared her one thing led to another she divorced me shes married again jill almost touched his hand im sorry pittman shrugged she was smart to get out i was going to be like that for the rest of my life last wednesday night i had a gun in my hand ready to and then the phone rang and the next thing jills eyes widened with concern you mean the newspapers werent exaggerating you have been feeling suicidal impulses thats a polite way to put it jills brow furrowed with greater concern i hope youre not going to try to be an amateur psychoanalyst pittman said ive heard all the arguments killing yourself wont bring jeremy back no shit but itll certainly end the pain and heres another old favorite if i kill myself ill be wasting the life that jeremy would have given anything to have the trouble is killing myself wouldnt be a waste my life isnt worth anything i know ive idealized jeremy i know that after his death ive made him smarter and more talented and funnier than he actually was but jeremy was smart and talented and funny i havent idealized him by much a straighta student a sense of humor that never failed to amaze me he had a droll way of seeing things he could make me laugh anytime he wanted and he was only fifteen the world would have been his instead he got cancer and no matter how hard the doctors and he fought it he died some gang member with a handgun is holding up a liquor store right now that scum is alive and my son is dead i cant stand living in a world where everything is out of balance that much i cant stand living in a world where everything i see is something jeremy will never see i cant stand remembering the pain on jeremys face as the cancer tortured him more and more each day i cant stand pittmans voice trailed off he realized that hed been speaking faster and louder that some of the customers in the restaurant were looking at him with concern that jill had leaned back as if overwhelmed by his emotion spreading his hands he mutely apologized no jill said i wont try to be an amateur psychoanalyst sometimes everything builds up inside me i say more than i mean to i understand youre very kind but you didnt need me to dump it all on you its not a question of being kind and you obviously needed to get it out of you its not though what out of me i think pittman glanced down at the table i think wed better change the subject jill folded her napkin neatly arranging the edges all right then tell me about what happened thursday night how you got into this yes pittman said his anger changing to confusion and the rest of it it took an hour this time pittman spoke discreetly keeping his voice low pausing when anyone walked by the conversation continued after jill paid the waiter and pittman strolled with her along seventyninth street a nightmare but i swear to god its all true pittman said theres got to be a way to make sense of it hey ive been trying my damnedest maybe youre too close maybe you need someone else to see it from a different angle lets think this through jill said we know millgates associates took him from the hospital because a reporter got his hands on a secret justice department report that implicated millgate in a covert attempt to buy nuclear weapons from the former soviet union millgates people were afraid of reporters showing up at the hospital and managing to question him they were also afraid of father dandridge pittman said more so millgates people were afraid of something millgate had told father dandridge in confession or of something millgate might have told father dandridge if the priest had been able to see him thursday night then you followed millgate to the estate in scarsdale you got into his room to help him but the nurse came in unexpectedly and saw you doing it she also heard millgate tell me something duncan something about snow then grollier pittman shook his head but father dandridge told me that grollier wasnt anyones last name it was the prep school millgate went to why would that be important enough to kill anybody they reached fifth avenue and pittman faltered whats the matter jill asked pittman stared to the right toward a crowd going up and down the steps of the metropolitan museum of art vendors buses and taxis contributed to the congestion in front several policemen on horseback maintained order i guess pittman said i feel exposed he glanced down at the weaponladen overcoat draped over his left arm and guided her back along seventyninth street i want to find out about grollier prep school how are you going to do that the only place i can think of with that information is the library or someone at a college but its sunday all those places are closed no there might be another way the freshly sandblasted apartment building at the end of east eightysecond street overlooked roosevelt drive and the east river pittman could hear the din of traffic from the thruway below as he and jill entered the shadows of the culdesac known as gracie terrace the time was almost five in the afternoon the temperature was rapidly cooling jill peered up at the attractive tall brick building you know someone who lives here someone i interviewed once pittman said when this started and i was trying to figure out how to get help i realized that over the years id interviewed people with all sorts of specialties that might be of use to me im sure the police are watching my friends and my exwife to see if i contact them but theyll never think about people ive met as a reporter nonetheless pittman felt nervous he quelled his emotion and stepped forward in the buildings shiny wellmaintained lobby a uniformed doorman greeted them may i help you professor folsom do you know if hes in he just got back from his afternoon walk is he expecting you pittman breathed easier he had been afraid that professor folsom might not live here anymore or worse that the elderly professor might have died please tell him im a reporter id like to talk to him about the walt whitman manuscript he discovered certainly sir they waited while the doorman walked toward a telephone on a counter at the side of the lobby whitman manuscript jill whispered what on earth does whitman have to do with the doorman came back professor folsom says hed be pleased to see you the doorman gave the apartment number and directed them past a fireplace toward an elevator in a corridor at the rear of the lobby thanks whitman jill repeated after they got in the elevator professor folsom is an expert on him he used to teach american literature at columbia university hes been retired for about fifteen years but age hasnt slowed him down he kept doing research and five years ago he came across a whitman manuscript or what he believes is a whitman manuscript in some papers he was examining there was a controversy about it was the manuscript authentic was it really a new whitman poem some scholars said no it seemed a good humaninterest story so i did an article about it folsoms quite a guy but wont he remember you wont he call the police why would he make the connection between a reporter who spoke to him five years ago and a man in the news this week besides he doesnt have a television and he thought it amusing that i was a newspaper reporter why he seldom reads newspapers but how does he get any news he doesnt hes a fanatic about history not current events hes also an expert in american education i doubt theres a college or prep school he doesnt know about the elevator stopped at the fifteenth floor and pittman knocked on folsoms door a tall slender stoopshouldered elderly man peered out he wore a brown herringbone sport coat a white shirt and a striped yellow tie his skin was pale his short beard and long hair were startlingly white his trifocal glasses had wide metal frames which only partially hid the deep wrinkles around his eyes professor my names peter logan this is my friend jill yes the doorman explained that you were a reporter professor folsoms voice was thin and gentle im doing a followup on the whitman manuscript you discovered at the time there was a controversy im curious how it was resolved you honestly believe your readers would care i care come in please i always enjoy talking about whitman as professor folsom led them across a foyer they passed an immaculately preserved walnut side table open doors on each side of the foyer showed similar wellcaredfor antiques thats quite a collection pittman said thank you they entered the living room and here there were even more antiques theyre exclusively american professor folsom explained with pleasure from the mid and late nineteenth century that secretary desk was owned by nathaniel hawthorne that hutch was emersons that rocking chair was melvilles when my wife was still alivehe glanced fondly toward a photograph of a pleasantlooking elderly woman on the wallwe made a hobby of collecting them nothing that was owned by whitman the old fox traveled lightly but i managed to find several items i keep them in my bedroom in fact the bed itself belonged to him professor folsom looked delighted with himself sit down would you like some tea tea would be nice jill said for the next half hour they discussed poetry and manuscripts with one of the most ingratiating people pittman had ever met in particular the old mans sense of peace was remarkable pittman felt envious remembering folsoms reference to his deceased wife he wondered how it was possible to reach such advanced years and not be worn down by despair at last he was ready to ask his crucial question as he and jill stood and prepared to leave he said thank you professor youve been very kind i appreciate your time not at all i hardly get any visitors especially since my wife died shes the one kept me active and of course students dont come to visit as they once did i wonder if you could answer something else for me i have a friend whos looking for a good prep school for his son wants him to be on track for harvard or yale my friend was thinking perhaps of grollier grollier academy in vermont well if your friend isnt wealthy and doesnt have a pedigree hell be disappointed its that exclusive jill asked its entire student body is fewer than three hundred it accepts only about seventy boys as new students each year and those slots are usually reserved when each student is born the room board and tuition is fifty thousand dollars a year and of course parents are expected to contribute generously to the academys activities thats too rich for my friend pittman said professor folsom nodded i dont approve of education based on wealth and privilege mind you the education the academy provides is excellent too restrained and conservative for my taste but excellent nonetheless restrained conservative the curriculum doesnt allow for individual temperaments instead of allowing the student to grow into his education the education is imposed upon him latin greek world history with an emphasis on britain philosophy particularly the ancients political science european literature again emphasizing britain very little american literature perhaps thats why my enthusiasm is restrained economics algebra calculus and of course athletics the boy who goes to grollier academy and doesnt embrace athletics in particular football and rowingteam sportswill soon find himself rejected by the other students jill asked and by the school professor folsom said looking older tired the purpose of grollier academy is to create establishment team players after all noncomformist behavior isnt considered a virtue among patrician society the elite favor caution and consensus intellectually and physically the students of grollier academy undergo disciplines that cause them to think and behave like members of the special society theyre intended to represent it sounds like programming pittman said in a sense of course all education is professor folsom said and grolliers preparation is solid various graduates have distinguished themselves he mentioned several ambassadors senators and governors as well as a president of the united states and that doesnt include numerous major financiers i believe jonathan millgate went there pittman said yes grolliers alumni include diplomats as well eustace gable anthony lloyd the names were totally unexpected pittman felt shocked eustace gable anthony lloyd advisers to various presidents over the course of their careers they achieved so many diplomatic accomplishments that eventually they became known as the grand counselors pittman tried to restrain his agitation what a remarkable school for a particular type of patrician student outside the apartment building the shadows were thicker cooler shivering but not from the temperature pittman walked to the end of the culdesac and went up steps to a promenade that overlooked the east river grollier academy not just jonathan millgate but eustace gable and anthony lloyd the grand counselors jill said pittman turned i had no idea do you suppose the others went there as wellwinston sloane and victor standish but even if they did what would that prove yes pittmans forehead throbbed whats so important about grollier academy that the other grand counselors were willing to kill millgate and blame me for his murder and kill father dandridge and all to prevent anyone from knowing why millgate was fixated on his prep school or maybe were completely wrong it could be millgate was in fact rambling no pittman said emphatically i cant believe that if i did id be lost id have to give up i wouldnt know how to keep going he shivered again and put on his overcoat feeling the weight of the gun in each pocket repelled by the conditions of his life even as it is what now what are we going to do about you itll soon be dark you cant go back to your apartment and you cant use your credit card to rent a room the name on your card would help the men looking for you find where youre staying where were you going to spend the night pittman didnt reply the other nights jill asked where a park bench and the floor of the intensivecare waiting room dear god maybe the police arent such a bad idea call them maybe they can protect you but for how long i told you id be terrified that theyd let down their guard no im staying with you jill said in the long run im not sure that would be smart but in the short run its the option that scares me the least besides theres something you still havent figured out about me jill said you mean in addition to the fact that you have money the moneys part of it i dont have to work for a living the point is im a nurse because i want to be because i need to be and right now yes my conscience wouldnt bear what might happen to you if you fail you need help pittmans chest became tight with emotion he touched her arm thank you hey if i dont hang around whos going to change the bandage on your hand pittman smiled you ought to do that more often jill said selfconscious pittman felt his smile lose its strength jill glanced toward east end avenue id better find a pay phone and tell the hospital that i wont be coming to work theyll still have time to get a replacement but after she made the call and stepped from the booth jill looked perplexed whats wrong my supervisor in intensive careshe said the police had been in touch with her they must have checked your apartment and connected you with the hospital but she said somebody else called her as well one of my friends telling her i was all right but that i wouldnt be coming in what friend a man pittmans muscles contracted millgates people trying to cover everything if you did show up at the hospital tonight you would never have gotten to the sixth floor but your supervisor wouldnt be worried enough to call the police when you didnt show upbecause your friend told her you were okay now im really scared and we still havent solved our problem where are you going to stay ive got a better idea what lets keep moving jill said all night wed collapse not necessarily you need to go to the library but it wont be open until tomorrow right pittman was mystified well theyve got libraries in other cities instead of waiting until tomorrow lets use the time well be able to sleep on the train train i take the overnight when i go skiing there pittman continued to look perplexed vermont pittman suddenly tensely understood a chill swept through him yes where professor folsom told us it was grollier academy vermont four a sleeper car wasnt available not that it made a differencepittman was so exhausted that he was ready to sleep anywhere shortly after the train left penn station he and jill ate sandwiches and coffee that she had bought in the terminal she had also been the one who bought the tickets he didnt want anyone to get a close look at him for the same reason he chose a seat against a window in an area that had few passengers the photo of him that the newspapers and television were using didnt show him as he now looked still he had to be careful soon the rhythmic clackclackclack of wheels on rails became hypnotic pittman glanced toward the other passengers in the halffull car assuring himself that they showed no interest in him then he peered toward the lights in buildings the train was passing his eyelids felt heavy he leaned against the gym baghed retrieved it from sean oreillys loftand started to ask jill how long the trip would take but his eyelids kept sinking and he never got the question out wake up he felt someone nudging him its time to wake up slowly he opened his eyes jill was sitting next to him her hand on his shoulder her face was washed her hair was combed she looked remarkably alert not to mention attractive for so early in the morning guess what she asked you snore sorry no problem you must be exhausted ive never seen anyone sleep so deeply in such uncomfortable conditions compared to a park bench this is the ritz do you remember switching trains pittman shook his head the car was almost deserted no one was close enough to overhear them you do a convincing job of sleepwalking jill said if we hadnt had to board another train i bet you wouldnt even have gotten up to go to the bathroom pittman gradually straightened from where hed been scrunched down on the seat his back hurt where are we a few miles outside montpelier vermont jill raised the shade on the window although the sun was barely up pittman squinted painfully at a line of pine trees that suddenly gave way revealing cattle on a sloping pasture across a narrow valley low wooded mountains still had occasional patches of snow on them what time is sixfifteen i dont suppose theres any coffee left from last night youre dreaming in that case wake me when this is over come on jill said straighten yourself up when this train stops i want to hit the ground running are you always this energetic so early in the morning only when im terrified besides when youre used to working the night shift this is late afternoon not morning not for me pittmans eyes felt gritty as if sand had been thrown into them let me whisper something that might get you going it better be good breakfast and im paying youre going to have to since i dont have any cash but ill say thisyou do have a way with words montpelier sounds french the first settlers in this area were french and this is the capital of vermont pittman sat with jill at a restaurant table that gave them a window view of new england buildings along a picturesque street it doesnt feel as if many people live here fewer than ten thousand but then only about six hundred thousand people live in the entire state a good place to hide out or to send students to a school thats isolated enough that they wont be contaminated by the outside world while theyre being taught to be aristocrats pittman sipped his coffee do i detect a little anger more than a little my parents tried to raise me that wayto think of myself as better than ordinary people theyre still horrified that im a nurse all those sick people all that blood i get the feeling your background involves a lot more money than in polite society this isnt talked about i was never good at manners millions pittman blinked and set down his coffee cup i dont know how much jill said my parents wont discuss it were having a difference of opinion about how i should conduct my future theyve been trying to punish me by threatening to disinherit me so thats what you meant about the trust fund from your grandparents theyre the ones who earned it they could handle it without being jerks but my parents think the money gives them some kind of divine right to look down on people yes you are angry i told you i want to help people not ignore them or take advantage of them anyway my grandparents anticipated all this and let me be independent by establishing the trust fund for me we have a similar attitude when i was a reporter was you still are no im an obituary writer but there was a time before jeremy died before i fell apart the stories i loved doing the best were the ones that involved exposing the corruption of selfimportant members of the establishment especially in the government it gave me a special pleasure to help drag them down and force them to experience what life is like for all of us ordinary bastards of the world drag aristocrats like jonathan millgate down i sure tried my damnedest be careful if you talk like that to the wrong person you could be providing a motive for why you might have wanted to the next obvious wordskill himnever came out abruptly jill stopped talking as the waitress set down their orders grapefruit english muffins and yogurt for jill hash browns eggs and bacon for pittman youll never get back into shape if you keep eating that way jill said at least i ordered wholewheat toast besides ive been using a lot of energy lately right youre not in enough dangeryouve got to order a death sentence for breakfast hey im trying to eat jill chuckled then glanced around at the warm dark tone of the wood in the rustically decorated room ill be right back what is it somebody just left a newspaper usa today she looked eager to read it but once she returned to their table and studied the front page she murmured suddenly im not hungry anymore bad as the waitress seated a man and a woman at the table next to them jill handed him the newspaper some things are better left unsaid pittman scanned the story becoming more and more disheartened the crazed obituary writers murder spree continued bold letters announced pittman was being blamed for killing father dandridge he was also being charged for shooting a man who with two associates had supposedly been sent to jills apartment by jonathan millgates son to pass on his thanks for the skillful attention she had given his father while in intensive care in addition pittman was suspected of abducting jill it keeps getting worse pittman said maybe i ought to just hang myself and be done with it dont say that not even as a joke pittman thought about itthe thing is it was a jokeabout suicide im amazed a couple of days ago i wouldnt have been able to do that jill looked at him harder maybe some good will come out of this pittman gestured toward the newspaper at the moment it doesnt look that way wed better leave weve got plenty to do find the library right pittman stood theres a reference series most libraries have the dictionary of american biography it lists the background including education for almost every intellectually famous person in the united states itll tell me if all the grand counselors went to grollier then maybe the librarian will be able to help with something else whats that how to find grollier academy four hundred dollars jill shook her head skeptical i know im not crazy about it either but i think this is the best deal were going to get pittman said every other used car on the lot costs more than the cash we have the car salesman gangly wearing a bow tie watched with interest from the window of his office as pittman and jill circled the gray plymouth duster the twodoor sedan had what was once considered to be a sporty outline but the rust on the rear fenders and the cracks in the vinyl top were evidence of the hard use that the vehicle had received then lets forget about paying cash jill said ill write him a check and get something decent cant pittman recalled an interview he had once conducted with a private detective who was an expert in tracing fugitives an outofstate check the salesman will probably decide to call your bank to see if the check is good the police will have put the bank on alert about reporting any attempt to get money from your account my guess is that the grand counselors will have used their influence to get the same information they would all know where to focus their search its the same reason we cant rent a car to do that we need to use your or my credit card the moment either name is in the computer were blown the grand counselors would immediately figure out why were in vermont theyd have men waiting for us by the time we showed up at grollier academy four hundred dollars jill bleakly surveyed the rusted automobile i know its a fortune when the only money at our disposal is a thousand but we dont have an option at least we bargained the salesman down from four hundred and fifty but can we be certain the car wont break down when we drive it off the lot well the best thing i can tell you is this car has a chrysler slantsix engine its almost indestructible i didnt realize you knew about auto mechanics i dont then how i once did a story about usedcar lots and ways to tell if the buyer was getting cheated remarkable im beginning to realize youre the sum of all the interviews you conducted something like that and if we buy this heap you think well be getting a good deal only if the salesman gives us a free tank of gas as they headed northwest from montpelier past the mountains that flanked route the duster performed better than pittman expected its slantsix engine sounding powerful and smooth because his bandaged left hand made it awkward for him to steer jill did the driving she opened her window whoever owned this car sure liked cigars on the positive side the seat covers dont look bad which is more than i can say about me id better get presentable for when we arrive at grollier he took the batterypowered razor from his gym bag and while he shaved he stared at the wooded peaks the map the usedcar salesman gave us says this range is called the green mountains an odd name for a place known for skiing i told you the french were the first settlers here analyze the name of the state vermont is another way of saying mont vert green mountain it seems so peaceful here what could there possibly be about grollier academy thats so terrifying to the grand counselors at the library the dictionary of american biography sure wasnt much help jill said professor folsom was right eustace gable and anthony lloyd went to grollier the same as jonathan millgate but the other two grand counselors dont have any mention of grollier in the entries about them that still doesnt prove anything does it mean they didnt actually go there or is it that they dont want to advertise as the duster rounded a curve revealing a meadow flanked by spruce trees wooded peaks looming above them pittman was so preoccupied he barely noticed the vista maybe they realized that it wasnt in their best interests for it to be known that they all went to the same prep school why would that hurt them too blatantly chummy the general public might catch on about one of the federal governments nasty secrets how inbred it is certain prep schools for the elite prepare the cream of the future establishment to go to ivy league colleges that future establishment graduates from those colleges and heads toward washington there they dominate various branches of the government the cia is tight with yale for example the state department used to be dominated by people from harvard clintons administration has a close relationship with yale law school but it gets more specific ivy league colleges have secret societies and the most prestigiousskull and bones for exampleare almost exclusively for members of the establishment a president appoints his classmates his fellow society members they become ambassadors or serve on the cabinet or as his advisers you know the storythe president goes out of office and his appointees move into the private sector where as members of the boards of various corporations they use their influence in washington to manipulate government regulations or else they form their own consultation businesses and cater to foreign clients who pay them extremely well to use their powerful contacts thats the reason i wanted to bring millgate down to my level because he was in thick with the weapons manufacturers he advocated military involvement in korea vietnam panama and iraq to name the most famous instances but the question is was that for the good of the country and the world or was it for the good of the weapons manufacturers and millgates swiss bank account on the most basic level one of the reasons theres so much corruption in the government is that few politicians and diplomats have the courage to question the behavior of a former classmate and club member good old soandso made a mistake by accepting bribes but hes not really a bad guy why turn him in and make trouble for him some social commitments are more important than representing the american people did you ever hear about bohemian grove no jill looked puzzled its another secret society a malesonly club the main purpose of which is a summer outing that takes place each year in a compound in the woods of northern california its members are among the most powerful men in the united states senators cabinet members major financiers and corporate executives every republican president since nixon has been a member the members are allowed to bring equally powerful guests from foreign countries and what do all these influential men do they get drunk sing campfire songs put on skits and have pissing contests a boys camp for grownups jill said right and when the festivities are over when all those men go back to their powerful occupations is it likely that any of them would ever accuse any othersthey pissed against trees together at campof improper professional conduct no way the ultimate consequence of bohemian grove is to make it seem in terribly bad taste for power brokers to accuse one another of being unethical and thats just one example of how club rules are more important than societys rules the whole damned thing stinks except for the drone of the dusters engine the car became silent jill steered around another curve passing cattle near a stream in another valley at last she spoke now that youve got that off your chest do you feel better no my father went to yale he was a member of skull and bones i wasnt trying to be personal but its true my father works in international commodities because he belonged to skull and bones he seems to have more influence than his competitors hes able to call in better favors then imagine the influence the grand counselors have pittman said advisers to presidents from truman on ambassadors members of the cabinet at one time or another three of them were secretary of state two of them were secretary of defense several were chiefs of staff and national security advisers not to mention ambassador to the united nations nato great britain the ussr saudi arabia west germany et cetera never elected always appointed with influence since the second world war a government within the government when their power wasnt officially granted to them by the white houseduring the kennedy and carter years for examplethey still managed to maintain their influence indirectly by creating foreign policy as members of think tanks like the council on foreign relations the rand corporation and the rockefeller foundation three of the grand counselors went to harvard two went to yale and at least three of them maybe all of them went to the same prep school but one of them felt so troubled by that prep school he wanted to confess something about it on his deathbed and the others were prepared to do anything to stop him at a scenic town called bolton they turned north off route following a narrow winding road that took them through a long valley filled with meadows alternating with sections of pine trees if the librarian in montpelier knew what she was talking about jill said there ought to be a village up ahead pittman squinted through the windshield wishing he had sunglasses there just above that break in the trees see it a church steeple good were right on schedule the steeple was brilliant white and as they entered the village they saw that not only the church but every building in town was the same radiant color the village green seemed even more green by contrast for a moment even allowing for telephone poles and other evidence of modern technology pittman had the sense that hed been transported back in time that he was in a slower more peaceful century then the village was behind them and as jill drove next to a brisk stream filled with snowmelt pittman felt a sudden apprehension he opened his gym bag and took out the which hed reloaded with ammunition from the container he had stored in the bag remembering a detail from a story hed written about undercover police officers he put the behind his back beneath his belt at the base of his spine it felt uncomfortable but that didnt matter he knew that his sport coat would conceal it far better than if he carried it in his overcoat pocket where it would form a drooping conspicuous bulge he would have to get used to the feel of metal against his back last wednesday night i had the barrel of that gun in my mouth he thought and now he opened jills purse hey what do you think youre doing seeing if this fits he reached into the gym bag again and pulled out the other pistol the one he had taken from the gunman in jills apartment the gun was almost the same size as the colt but its caliber was smaller a mm beretta you dont expect me to carry that jill protested i dont even know how to use it nor did i until a couple of days ago learn as you need tothats my motto jills purse was a shoulder bag made of leather fits perfectly pittman said im telling you im not going to the first thing you need to know about this gun pittman said is that the ammunition is stored in this springloaded deviceits called a magazinethats inserted into the bottom of the grip are you serious jill squinted as the duster emerged from a covered bridge into dazzling sunlight have you any idea how many people in critical condition because of gunshot wounds ive had to try to keep alive in intensive care i dont want to know anything about that gun i dont want it in my purse i dont want to have anything to do with it pittman studied her then peered ahead the first turn on the right past the bridge i know its on the sheet of directions the librarian gave us i remember what she said i was just trying to be helpful look im sorry i dont mean to be snappy its just you scared me with that business about the gun jills voice was unsteady for a while there when we were on the train i was able to forget how serious this is i wish i wasnt doing this then turn around pittman said what well go back to montpelier and put you on the train back to new york ill go out to the academy on my own put me on the what good would that do nothings changed those men are still after me i cant go back to my apartment youve convinced me that the police wouldnt be able to protect me forever i certainly cant depend on my parents to get me through this theyre probably being watched as for my friends i dont want to put them in danger being with you is the safest place i can think of and thats not saying much but its all ive got ive already fed a round into the firing chamber to shoot this gun you dont need to cock it all you have to do is pull the trigger theres the gate pittman pointed toward a large elegant sign that read grollier academy i love its motto pittman said to lead is to serve they veered from the road following a paved lane up a treed incline a white wooden fence had an open gate they passed a small building that reminded pittman of a sentry box at the entrance to a military base but no one was there and pittman assumed that the building was for deliveries at the top of the incline the view was spectacular enough to make jill stop driving on each side fir trees stretched along a ridge rising toward mountains but directly ahead and below the trees had been cleared replaced by an impressive expanse of grassland in the valley there were stables horses in a pasture an equestrian ring and a polo field adjacent were several football fields in the distance an ovalshaped lake glinted with the reflection of sunlight and pittman remembered the importance that professor folsom had said the school placed on team rowing but pittmans attention was mostly directed toward the buildings in the center of the valley a traditional whitesteepled church an imposing pillared building that was probably the schools administration center fifteen other structures made of brick covered with ivy dormitories and classroom buildings pittman said solid efficient functional what the establishment considers roughing it jill looked puzzled you really have a problem about privileged society to rephrase will rogers i never met a rich person i liked im rich but you dont act rich i had an older brother pittman said jill looked as if she didnt understand the jump in topics his name was bobby he taught me how to ride a bicycle how to throw a baseball when i came home with a black eye from a fight in the school yard he showed me how to box there wasnt anything bobby couldnt do he was my idol god how i loved him you keep using the past tense he died in vietnam oh im sorry he didnt want to go pittman said he didnt believe the war was right but my parents didnt have any money and bobby didnt have the means to go to college and he couldnt get a draft deferment i remember him cursing about how all the rich kids got deferments but he couldnt all of his letters mentioned the same thinghow everybody in his unit was part of the disestablishment of course bobby used cruder terms he kept writing about a premonition he had about how he was sure he wouldnt be coming back well he was right friendly fire killed him i used to go to the cemetery every day to visit him i remember thinking how easy it was for rich people to start wars when their children wouldnt have to fight later after i saved enough money from working on construction to go to college i realized something elsethose rich people got richer because of the wars they started thats why i became a journalist to go after those bastards to get even for my brother im sorry jill repeated so am i pittman stared down at his bandaged hand i apologize i didnt mean for all that to come out jill touched his arm the buildings were situated along a square that reminded pittman of a parade ground pavement flanked each side of the square and jill almost parked there until she saw a lot next to what appeared to be the administration building fifteen other cars were already parked there pittman got out of the duster conscious of the under his sport coat it dismally occurred to him that one mark of how far he had come since his suicide attempt wednesday night was that he thought of being armed as ordinary jill locked the car and came around to join him her sneakers jeans and sweater were in a small suitcase in the backseat the brown pumps sandcolored aline skirt forest green jacket and yellow blouse that shed bought in montpelier fit her perfectly pittman still wasnt used to seeing her in clothes that werent casual and loose the lines of her legs were as elegant as those of her throat ready jill inhaled nervously and nodded securing the strap of her purse to her shoulder its heavy just try to forget a weapons in there easy advice from you i still dont see why it couldnt stay in the car because things keep turning out differently from the way i expected they walked from the parking lot and watched as the square which had been deserted except for a few groundskeepers suddenly filled with hurrying students a few seconds after a bell rang in several of the buildings wearing uniforms of gray slacks navy blazers and white shirts with red striped ties the boys moved with brisk determination from what seemed to be classroom buildings crossing toward a larger building opposite the church fire drill jill glanced at her watch noon lunchtime a boy of about fifteen stopped before them like the others he had brightly polished black shoes and neatly cut short hair his gaze was direct his voice confident his posture straight may i help you sir we were wondering where the school library is pittman said the boy pointed to pittmans left in building four sir would you like to see mr bennett mr bennett the academys director no there isnt any need to bother him thank you for your help youre welcome sir the boy turned and continued quickly toward the building the other students were entering on the opposite side of the square although they hurried they managed to look like gentlemen hell be a credit to washington insiders pittman said he and jill walked in the direction the young man had indicated reached a brick building with the number above its entrance and left the noons intense sunlight entering a cool welllit stairwell that smelled sweetly of wax steps led down and up the building was eerily silent i doubt very much that a library would be in the basement jill said too much danger of moisture getting into the books nodding in agreement his footsteps echoing pittman went up to the first floor a hallway had several doors on each side many of the doors were open in one study desks were equipped with computers in another the desks had tape players and earphones probably for language study as pittman approached a third door an elderly man came out holding a key about to close the door he wore the same uniform that the students had been wearing short and somewhat heavy he looked to be about sixty with a saltandpepper mustache and receding gray hair he peered over his glasses toward pittman and jill i was just going to lunch may i help you we were told that the library is in this building thats correct the man cleared his throat is that where you keep old yearbooks things like that pittman asked they would be in our archival section the man squinted i dont believe ive met you before why exactly would you need to know my name is peter logan im a freelance journalist and ive decided to write the book i always promised myself i would book about grollier academy a great many distinguished public servants have graduated from this school you could say that weve had more than our share but i strongly suspect that they wouldnt want their privacy invaded that isnt what i had in mind grollier academy itself that would be my emphasis i thought it would be an example to other schools if i wrote about the superior methods of this one this countrys in a crisis if our educational system isnt changed im worried about our future we need a model and i cant think of a better one than grollier the man scrunched his eyebrows together and nodded there is no better preparatory education in america what sort of research did you intend to do well for starters mr caradine im chief librarian naturally ill devote a considerable portion of the book to grolliers educational theory but ill also need to supply a historical perspective when the academy was founded by whom how it grew the famous students who passed through here so for starters i thought that a general immersion in your archives would be helpful the yearbooks for example their photographs will show how the campus changed over the years and i might discover that grollier had many more famous graduates than i was aware of i want to skim the surface so to speak before i plunge into the depths a sensible method the archives are caradine glanced at his watch im sorry i have a lunch meeting with the library committee and im already late im afraid i cant show you through the archives if you come back at one oclock the head of the refectory will im sure be pleased to provide you with lunch thanks mr caradine but my assistant and i had a late breakfast and to tell the truth im anxious to get started perhaps you could let us into the archives and we can familiarize ourselves with the research materials while youre at your meeting i had hoped not to inconvenience you im sure you have better things to do than watch us read journals caradine glanced at his watch again i really have to be at very well i dont see the harm the archives are on the next level the first door on your right at the top of the stairs i appreciate this mr caradine if youll unlock the door well do our best not to trouble you for a while just go up caradine started past them toward the stairs the door isnt locked almost none of the doors at grollier are locked this is a school for gentlemen we depend on the honor system in its entire onehundredandthirtyyear history there has never been an instance of thievery on this campus exactly what i was getting at earlier this school is a model ill be sure to put what you just told me into my book caradine nodded fidgeting with his hands saying im terribly late he hurried down the stairs and left the building the door thunked shut pittman listened to its echo turned to jill and gestured toward the stairs that led upward i hope hes a slow eater at the top of the stairs the first door on the right had a frosted glass window pittman turned the knob briefly worrying that caradine had been mistaken about the doors being unlocked but the knob turned freely and with relief pittman entered the room he faced an area that was larger than he had expected shelves lined all the walls and in library fashion filled the middle area various boxes ledgers and books were on the shelves several windows provided adequate light jill shut the door and looked around why dont you check the shelves against that wall ill check these for the next five minutes they searched here jill said pittman came over stooping toward where jill pointed at lower shelves he found several rows of thin oversized volumes all bound in black leather their spines stamped with gold numbers that indicated years arranged chronologically beginning with i thought caradine said the school went back a hundred and thirty years pittman said where are the other yearbooks maybe the school only started the tradition at the turn of the century pittman shrugged maybe millgate was eighty assuming he graduated when he was eighteen his last semester at grollier would have been the spring of jill said how on earth did you do that so fast ive always been good with numbers all my money you know jill said joking to break the tension of course millgate might have graduated when he was seventeen and the other grand counselors arent all millgates age lets try a few years in each direction to fine with me jill said ill take up to you take the rest theres a table over here sitting opposite each other they stacked the yearbooks and began to read at least the students are presented in alphabetical order thatll save time jill said pittman turned a page we know that millgate eustace gable and anthony lloyd went to school here the other grand counselors are winston sloane and victor standish but we also have to look for someone else who duncan the way millgate said the name it had the same intensity as when he said grollier i have to believe the two are connected the trouble is duncan can be a first name as well as a last which means well have to check every students name in all these books jill frowned toward the stack how large a student body did professor folsom say grollier had three hundred at one time weve got a lot of names to read they turned pages intently dead pittman murmured jill looked at him puzzled old photographs always give me a chill he said i know what you mean most of these students are dead by now but here they are in their prime pittman thought of how he coveted every photograph of his dead son his mouth felt dry eustace gable jill said found him nineteen twentynine a freshman yes i found him as a senior in heres anthony lloyd nineteen thirtythree a senior pittman said ive got him as a freshman in and heres millgate but that doesnt do us any good we already knew they went to school here hey jill said got another one who winston sloane a freshman nineteen twentynine so i was right he did go to school here but the son of a bitch didnt include that in biographical facts he gave to researchers he wanted it off the record got another one jill said excitedly victor standish every damned one of them we dont need the other books jill said the names are repeated from year to year they entered in and graduated in but what about duncan i didnt come across even one student with a first or last name of duncan what was millgate trying to tell me whats the connection between a shadow loomed beyond the doors opaque glass window although pittman wasnt looking in that direction he sensed the brooding presence and turned just as the door came open the stranger who entered took long forceful steps he wore the gray slacks navy blazer and red striped tie that were grolliers uniform he was tall rigidly straight in his fifties with a pointed jaw a slender patrician nose and an imperious gaze would you mind telling me what youre doing pittman stood why yes im planning to write a book about your school and you didnt answer my question what are you doing pittman looked at jill in feigned confusion research at the moment were looking at yearbooks without permission mr caradine the librarian said we could mr caradine doesnt have the authority to give you permission perhaps you could tell me who the mans eyes flashed only i can im the academys headmaster ah mr bennett pittman remembered the name that the boy outside had mentioned we wanted to speak with you but since it was lunchtime and you werent in your office we thought wed come over here in the meanwhile it wouldnt have done you any good there are procedures that must be followed letters to be submitted applications to be filed letters applications but you just said that youre the only one who can give permission for i said im the academys headmaster i have a board of supervisors who must be consulted about the sort of breach of privacy youre suggesting but my book would be for the benefit of im afraid i must ask you to leave if he cuts off one more of my sentences pittman thought whatever you want pittman said im sorry for the misunderstanding perhaps we could go back to your office and discuss the problem yes there is a misunderstanding but not the one you suspect i did not mean leave this room i meant leave the campus bennett glared toward pittman pointing toward the open door very well pittman worked to control himself he was suddenly conscious that jill stood next to him ill write you a letter explaining what i want i doubt that the letter will accomplish anything i see good day good day friendly place jill drove from the parking lot yeah ive been kicked out of a lot of spots but never a prep school jill followed the paved section that flanked the square passed several classroom buildings and the administration building then headed along the lane through the valley is he still watching pittman turned to look in front of the library building i can feel him glaring all the way from here mr personality jill steered past the stables then reached open grassland the lane began to rise what touched him off do you think hes really annoyed that we didnt ask permission from him instead of the librarian something tells me it wouldnt have done any good if wed gone to see him first this way at least we got into the archives looks like weve got company i see it in the rearview mirror a brown station wagon leaving the school millgates people jill tensed what if they were waiting in case we came here i think theyd have moved against us before now unless they didnt want to cause trouble at the school all those kids too many witnesses maybe a few miles down the road theyll catch up to us and jill crested the hill the lane sloped sharply toward the building that reminded pittman of a sentrys station he lifted the back of his sports coat and pulled the from behind his back what are you doing jill asked nervously just in case pittman said at once jill was past the small building driving through the open gate reaching the country road no dont turn left go the other way pittman said but left takes us back toward montpelier thats the way theyll expect us to go if millgates people are in that station wagon for now they cant see us from the other side of the hill jill veered right tires squealing onto the narrow country road she stepped on the accelerator so hard that pittman was pressed against the back of his seat he gripped the dashboard as she swung around a curve pine trees lined the road take it easy theres nothing wrong with my driving thats not what i meant youre doing great but i want to get off the road look for athere between those trees faster than pittman expected jill stamped on the brake twisted the steering wheel and jolted off the road onto a semiovergrown wheelrutted lane that disappeared among pine trees sunlight became shadows as the duster scraped past bushes the impact of lurching over a rock slammed pittman harder against the seat he stared through the rear window were hidden from the road stop the moment jill did pittman shoved his drivers door open and hurried out stooping doing his best not to expose himself he chose an angle through the pine trees that would lead him back to the curve in the road sensing that he was close he slowed stepped carefully over a log and crept among undergrowth immediately he came into sunlight and sank to the ground seeing the road across from him to his right was the open gate that led to the academy beyond it the station wagon came rapidly into sight at the top of the wooded hill as it sped down toward the gate pittman saw two husky men in the vehicle they didnt look happy but to pittmans surprise the station wagon didnt pull out onto the road and speed toward montpelier in pursuit of the duster instead it skidded to a stop at the gate the two men got out angrily swung the gate shut and secured a chain and lock to it with the gate fully in view pittman noticed a sign that he hadnt been able to see before no trespassing violators will be prosecuted i bet they will pittman thought as the two men stalked back to the station wagon slammed their doors shut behind them and drove back up the hill disappearing over it toward the school pittman waited to make sure that no one else was coming then slowly stood as he turned toward the forest he saw jill rise from bushes not far behind him i dont get it she said if they were millgates people wouldnt they have followed us maybe they were ordered not to leave the campus pittman entered the cover of the trees or maybe thats just grolliers physical education staff jill said the football coach the rowing instructor bennett might have told them to make sure we were off the property and if we werent to give us some physical incentive pittman stepped over another log until reinforcements arrive bennett was testier than he needed to be someone might have warned him to be suspicious of visitors and now hell make some phone calls right pittman said but maybe theyll think weve really gone we havent jill frowned you mean you dont plan to go back to montpelier where would we go from there ahead through the shadows of the trees pittman saw the gray duster what other leads do we have but what else can we do here we found out that no one named duncan first or last name went to school with the grand counselors millgate must have been rambling duncan and grollier have nothing to do with each other no i have to be sure pittman reached the duster and leaned against its side im going back tonight as pittman climbed the slats in the chesthigh wooden fence a quarter moon in a cloudless sky provided sufficient illumination he dropped to the other side and entered the darkness of trees he wore sneakers and the dark sweat suit he had stored in his gym bag in addition he wore a black wool cap jacket and gloves that he had bought along with the knapsack in a village ten miles farther along the road from the school the jacket had roomy pockets one of which contained his the other a small flashlight he crept through the trees and soon emerged again into moonlight crouching on an open ridge staring down a grassy slope toward the murky silhouettes of grolliers buildings the time was almost midnight and lights were off in every structure except the administration building exterior lights illuminated the square and the front of every building there wasnt any sign of activity nonetheless pittman waited thinking sensing the weather report on the car radio had predicted a low of thirtyfive degrees and pittman believed it seeing frost come out of his mouth he shivered but only partially from the temperature mostly from fear he couldnt help contrasting how he had felt the night he entered the estate in scarsdale with how he felt now back then hed been nervous but fatalistic what did a man about to commit suicide have to lose but now yes pittman asked himself what about now youre scared which means you do have something to lose are you suddenly afraid of dying why jill the thought came unexpectedly what are you hoping for hope pittman realized that the word hadnt been part of his vocabulary in quite a while and with hope came fear he started down the grassy slope the night was silent making him conscious of a subtle breeze his jogging shoes became wet chilling his feet with moisture from the grass he ignored the sensation concentrating on the shadows of the equestrian ring that he passed and then the football field the buildings of the school were outlined against the mountains hed done enough newspaper stories about the military to be aware that someone with a snipers rifle and a nightscope would have no trouble seeing him in the dark and killing him with each step that brought him closer and with each second of awareness that he hadnt been shot he gained confidence maybe the school is safe he thought maybe it wont be as difficult as i feared a horse whinnied from somewhere behind him and he froze selfconscious worried that the noise would attract someones attention the second time the horse whinnied pittman became mobile again hurrying forward reaching the shadows at the back of one of the buildings the night became quiet once more moving as rapidly as caution would allow he skirted the perimeter of other buildings taking care to avoid spotlights when he came to the side of the square that was opposite the ridge from where he had entered he pressed himself against a classroom building intensified his senses and concentrated on every detail in the darkness around him the fact that hed gotten this close continued to encourage him but fear persisted in making him tremble and he knew he couldnt take anything for granted mustering his determination he crept from the side of the classroom building and reached the library building he didnt dare go to the front and expose himself to the spotlights instead he approached the back door turned the knob and discovered that the door was locked remembering how the librarian had bragged that the schools successful honor system made it unnecessary for doors to be locked pittman realized the degree to which he and jill had made the academys headmaster nervous almost certainly bennett had been warned to watch out for strangers but why pittman thought what are millgates people trying to hide earlier when hed been in the library building pittman hadnt seen any indication of a security system at least that was one thing he didnt have to worry about as he took out his tool knife and used its lock picks the scrape of metal made him wince it seemed terribly amplified certain to draw someones attention nonetheless he kept working freeing one pin then another continuing to apply pressure to the cylinder suddenly feeling it turn as the locks bolt slipped free pittman turned the knob worrying that someone might be waiting for him on the other side he drew his pistol lunged through the opening aimed toward the darkness with his right hand and quickly used his bandaged hand to shut the door he listened the echoes of his rapid entrance diminished enveloped by silence he held his breath straining to see in the darkness on guard for the slightest sound a minute passed and in contrast with the chill he had felt outside his body now streamed sweat he locked the door behind him felt his way upstairs to the main floor listened crept up to the second floor listened again and approached the door to the archives its opaque window revealed a hint of moonlight glowing into the room it too was locked but this time he wasnt surprised quickly he freed the bolt on this door as well he entered cautiously shut the door behind him crouched and waited if gunmen were in here they had ample opportunity to move against him after thirty seconds he decided to take the risk first he twisted the dead bolts knob locking the door behind him then he crossed to the windows and pulled down blinds finally he crept toward the middle shelves turned on his flashlight made sure that its modest beam was aimed toward the floor where it wouldnt cast a glow on the windows and reached for the yearbooks that he and jill had examined that afternoon the gap on the shelf dismayed him the yearbooks from to were gone hoping that they might still be on the desk where he and jill had left them he spun but the flashlight revealed that the table was bare bennett must have taken them away jesus what am i going to do pittman thought sweat continued to stream from him he shut off his flashlight and slumped on the floor propping his back against a shelf check the other yearbooks he told himself look at why whats the point the grand counselors had graduated by then well what other choice do you have maybe there are other records earlier when pittman and jill had searched the room they had concentrated on finding the most obvious research toolthe yearbooks pittman hadnt paid much attention to binders and boxes many of them were labeled sem rep followed by sequential overlapping numbers et ceteraand the pressure of a time limit had prevented him from investigating the contents now with no alternative he roused himself stood turned on his flashlight and approached other shelves in the room the box he opened chosen at random contained neatly arranged smaller boxes each of which held a roll of microfilm it occurred to pittman that sem rep possibly meant semester report and that the numbers referred to the fall and spring sessions of each school yearthe fall of for example and the spring of the next school year would begin in the fall of and continue to the spring of thus the overlapping numbers over the years the accumulation of documents had become difficult to store not to mention a fire hazard so the pages had been transferred to microfilm convenient for the school but a major frustration for pittman what am i supposed to do steal the rolls for the years the grand counselors attended grollier i still wouldnt be able to read them unless you take them to a library that has a microfilm reader but the rolls i steal might not have the information i need i cant leave here until wait a minute there wouldnt be microfilm if there wasnt a pittman recalled from his previous visit that a bulky object covered by a cloth had stood on a table in a corner to the right of the door its shape was distinctive he shifted toward it pulled off the cloth and found as he had hoped a microfilm reader when he turned it on he didnt know which made him more nervousthe hum of the machines fan or the glow on its screen he went back to the boxes checked labels and sorted among rolls of microfilm soon finding one for he attached it to the spools on the machine wound the microfilm past the machines light and its magnifying lens and studied what appeared on the screen what he squinted at was a class list and final grades for students in ancient history i none of the grand counselors names was on the list he spooled forward through individual reports about various students reached classical literature i and again was frustrated to discover that none of the grand counselors had been in that course at this rate itll take me hours to read the entire roll theres got to be a more efficient way to ancient history i classical literature i the numeric designation implied that there were later sections of those courses pittman thoughtii iii maybe iv heat rushed into his stomach as he understood grollier was a fouryear prep school the grand counselors had been juniors in they would be in the class reports for juniors threequarters through the roll pittman swiftly turned the roll forward ignoring classes marked ii reaching iii and immediately slowing he found a course in british history in which all the grand counselors were registered and had received top grades he found a number of other coursesbritish literature european history greek philosophy and latinin which the grand counselors had also been registered and received top grades but in none of those classes did he find anyone named duncan he spooled onward to a course in political science and immediately his attention was engaged while the other courses had contained numerous students this course contained only sixthe five grand counselors plus a student named derrick meecham pittman hesitated when he and jill had separated the yearbooks hers had been for his for as he had learned the grand counselors had graduated in but it now seemed to him that when he had concentrated on the m category looking for millgates name he hadnt come across any reference for a student named meecham in the yearbook he knew he could be wrong all the same he spooled forward to the spring semester for that course and now he frowned with puzzlement the roster had dropped from six names to five derrick meecham was no longer enrolled why had meecham gotten sick his grade from the previous semester had been an a so he couldnt have found the course so difficult that hed dropped it besides pittman had the suspicion that at grollier students didnt have the option of dropping courses rather grollier dropped students then why pittman thought again he became more convinced that his memory hadnt failed him that derrick meecham had in fact not been in the yearbook for the following year pittman rubbed the back of his neck his gaze wandered to the bottom of the screen where the courses instructor had signed the grade report and suddenly he felt as if he had touched an exposed electrical wire for the instructors ornate signature seemed to come into focus pittman tried to control his breathing as he stared at the name duncan kline jesus pittman thought duncan hadnt been a student hed been a teacher that was the connection with grollier duncan kline had been millgates teacher all of them he had taught all the grand counselors a noise made pittman stiffen despite the whir of the fan on the microfilm machine he heard footsteps on the stairs beyond the door angry voices rapidly approached startled he shut off the machine cant believe you didnt leave someone on guard but the two of them left i made sure the voices became louder were they followed to the edge of campus stupid its a good thing we flew up here the outside door was still locked that proves the records are safe it proves nothing lights came on in the hallway outside the door their illumination glowed through the opaque window the shadows of men loomed beyond it i took the yearbooks they were looking at but what else might they have come back to look at someone tried to turn the knob on the door its locked yes i secured that door as well i told you no ones been here just get out your key and unlock the damned door pittmans chest cramped he couldnt get enough air in desperation he swung toward the murky room trying to figure out where he could hide how he could stop the men from finding him but he remembered how the room had looked during daylight thered been no other door there was nothing to hide behind if he tried to conceal himself beneath a table hed be found at once the only option was the windows as he heard a key scraping in the lock a voice saying come on hurry pittman rushed to a window raised its blind freed its lock and shoved the window upward stop one of the voices in the hallway said i heard something somebodys in there bennetts unmistakable nasally voice said what are you doing with those guns get out of the way pittman shoved his head out the window staring down he had hoped that there might be something beneath the window to break his fall but at the bottom of the twostory drop there was nothing except a flower garden when i throw the door open you go first duck to the left petell go straight ahead ill take the right pittman studied the leafless ivy that clung to the side of the building the vines felt dry and brittle nonetheless he had to take the chance he squirmed out the window clung to the ivy and began to climb down hoping that there werent other men outside in the darkness on three pittman climbed down faster the ivy to which he clung made a crunching noise and began to separate from the bricks and mortar above him he heard a crash the door being thrust open simultaneously the ivy fully separated from the wall as pittman dropped his stomach soaring his hands scrabbled against the wall clawing for a grip on other strands of ivy the fingers on his bandaged left hand were awkward but those on his right hand snagged onto vines at once those strands snapped free from the wall and he dropped farther grabbing still other ivy jolting onto the ground falling backward desperately bending his knees rolling there a man yelled from the window above him pittman scrambled to his feet and raced toward the cover of the rear of the next building something kicked up grass next to him he heard the muffled fistintoapillow report from a soundsuppressed gunshot adrenaline made his stomach seem on fire needing to discourage them from shooting again he spun raised his and fired in the silence of the night the roar of the shot was deafening his bullet struck the upper part of the window shattering glass jesus get down outside he cant go far on foot stop him pittman fired again not expecting to hit anybody but wanting anxiously to make a commotion the more confusion the better already lights were going on in dormitory windows he raced past bushes rounded the back corner of the next building and tried to orient himself in the darkness how the hell do i get out of here he left the cover of the building running toward the murky open meadow a bullet whizzed past him from behind he ran harder suddenly a shadow darted to his left someone running parallel to him he fired in response another bullet whizzed past from his left a car engine roared headlights gleamed speeding toward the meadow ahead of him with no other direction available pittman veered sharply to his right he zigzagged and veered again as a third bullet parted air near his head in the darkness hed become disoriented dismayed he found that he was running back toward the school the rear of the buildings was still in shadow but the commotion was causing more lights to come on all the time feeling boxed in he took the only course available charged up to the back door of the nearest building prayed that its lock hadnt been engaged yanked at the door and felt a surge of hope as it opened he darted in shut and locked the door felt the impact of a bullet against it and turned to sprint along a hallway but hed bought only a few moments of protection when he showed himself outside the front of the building cant hide in here theyll search until they what am i going to do this building was evidently a dormitory he heard students on the upper floors their voices distressed witnesses need more witnesses need more commotion he swung toward a firealarm switch behind a glass plate and hammered the butt of his against the glass the plate shattered with surprising ease trembling he reached in past shards and pulled the switch the alarm was shrill reverberating off walls causing picture frames to tremble despite its intensity pittman sensed the greater commotion on the floors above him urgent footsteps frightened voices a lot of them a welter of shadows in the stairway became students in pajamas scurrying to get outside pittman hid his weapon and waved his right arm in fierce encouragement as if he was their benefactor his only interest their safety hurry up the place is on fire the students surged past and pittman went with them storming into the arc lights that blazed in the night he saw gunmen to his right but knew that they didnt dare shoot with so many students in the way and as the students dispersed in turmoil pittman darted toward the next building on the left lunging inside there he again broke the glass that shielded the firealarm switch activating the alarm wincing from the ferocity of the noise he rushed back in the direction he had come toward the front door theyll expect me to go out the back theyll try to cut me off some of them coming through here while the others wait in the darkness behind the building he pressed himself against the wall next to the front door and at once it was banged open gunmen charging into the building in the same instant students came scurrying down the stairwell amid the confusion as the gunmen and the students collided and tried to pass one another pittman scrambled out the front door students swirling around him but instead of continuing the pattern hed established to race toward the next building on this side of the square he took what he felt was his best chance and sprinted directly across the square veering among students who milled sleepily their bare feet obviously cold frost coming out of their mouths in the glare from the arc lights he heard the fire alarms and students swarming out of adjacent buildings and gunmen shouting chasing him even allowing for his being out of condition he didnt think hed ever run so fast his jogging shoes hit the ground perfectly his legs stretched his sweat suit clung to his movements as it had so many mornings when he had gone jogging before heading to workbefore jeremy had gotten sick he felt as if his increasing effort was the distillation of every race he had ever entered every marathon he had ever endured inhaling deep lungfuls of air pumping his legs faster stretching them farther he surged between buildings on the opposite side of the square and kept racing into the darkness behind them this was the direction from which he had initially come down off the ridge and across the meadow approaching the campus in a frenzy of exertion he managed to increase speed spurred by the buzz of another bullet parting air near his side theyve crossed the square he thought they saw where i went and followed me from the square he heard the roar of cars theyll soon drive behind these buildings theres no way i can outrun he changed direction just in time almost banging into the side of a building his eyes stung by the glare of the arc lights in the square were only now adjusting to the darkness and in confusion he took a moment to realize that hed reached the stables men shouted behind him a bullet struck the stone side of the building pittman whirled went down on his left knee propped his right arm on his other knee to steady his trembling aim and fired toward the men pursuing him they cursed and dove to the ground a car fishtailed around a building its headlights blazing and pittman fired toward them missing the headlights but shattering the windshield immediately he ducked back knowing that the muzzle flashes from his pistol had made him a target more bullets struck the side of the building splintering stone from somewhere on the other side horses whinnied in panic pittman swung around a corner approaching them he reached a fence and opened its gate scrambling back as horses charged through escaping into the night the more confusion the better he had to keep distracting his pursuers then racing across the horse pen toward the opposite fence he heard the roar of the cars speeding toward the stables have to get ahead of them a horse had stopped on the other side of the fence with no other choice pittman clambered onto the rails hed once written a story about the stables near central park hed taken a few lessons his instructor had emphasized when afraid of falling keep your legs squeezed as tightly as you can around the horses sides and clamp your arms around the horses neck pittman did exactly that now leaping off the fence landing on the horse startling it clinging as it reared but he was prepared and the horse wasnt compacting his muscles in desperation he managed to stay on and now the horse wasnt rearing it was galloping hoping to throw off its burden pittman clung harder jolted by the horses rapid hoofbeats he leaned so severely forward clutching the horses bobbing neck that he didnt think he provided a silhouette for the gunmen from behind the headlights of several rapidly approaching cars lit up the meadow around and ahead of him the roar of the engines and the noise of the galloping horse were too great for pittman to be able to hear if bullets whizzed past him but he had to assume that his pursuers were shooting at him and he furiously hoped that the uneven meadow its bumps and rises and dips would throw off the gunmens aim in the darkness without warning the horse changed direction unprepared pittman felt his grip slipping his body shifting to the right about to topple he clamped his legs so tightly around the horse that the pain of the effort made him wince his rigid arms completely encircled the horses neck the cars sped nearer bumping across the meadow their headlights bobbing gleaming as the horse changed direction again but this time pittman anticipated and although his body shifted he felt in control he was wrong deeper shadows loomed before him suddenly illuminated by the headlights the forest seemed to materialize out of nothing a wall of trees and bushes forming an apparently unbreachable barrier that so startled the horse it reared up at the same time twisting sideways and pittmans grip was finally jerked free as the horses front hoofs landed heavily and the animal twisted again more sharply to avoid colliding with the trees pittman flew in the opposite direction frantically praying that the horse wouldnt kick backward he struck the ground flipped and rolled the wind knocked out of him the pistol in his jacket pocket slamming against his ribs he rolled farther urgently trying to avoid the panicked horse to save himself from being trampled immediately the horse galloped away and pittman faced the headlights speeding toward him he stumbled to his feet struggled to breathe and lurched toward bushes stooping to conceal himself bullets snapped twigs and shredded bark from trees he crouched lower hurrying among the thickly needled branches of pine trees bullets walloped into trees and sliced needles that fell upon him hearing car doors being opened he spun saw the headlights through the trees and fired surprising himself that he actually shattered one of the lights at once his pistol no longer worked in dismay he pulled the trigger nothing happened the felt off balance in his hand its slide remained back its firing chamber open heart sinking he understood he had used all his ammunition he had more in his jacket pocket but his pursuers were so close that there wasnt time for him to reload and he didnt have confidence in his ability to remove the pistols magazine and refill it in the dark not while men were shooting at him not while he was on the run which he immediately began doing scurrying uphill through the murky forest several times he bumped painfully against trees in the darkness he failed to see deadfalls and stumps and tripped losing his balance hitting the ground each time he ignored his pain and surged upward moving faster harder spurred by the noises of gunmen chasing him flashlights blazed men shouted pittman strained to figure out where he was he had entered on this side of the valleythat much he was sure of but there the trees had stopped on a ridge giving way to grassland that sloped toward the meadow here the trees were at the bottom of the slope in which direction was the grassy hill he had to find it he had to get to that ridge because past the trees and the fence beyond it jill was waiting with the car i hear him over there spread out pittman raised his right arm to shield his eyes from needled branches enveloped by darkness he climbed with less energy his legs weary his lungs protesting he kept angling to the right choosing that direction arbitrarily needing some direction hoping to reach the grassy slope without warning he broke free nearly falling on the open hill hurry got to reach the top before theyre out of the trees before they see me his only advantage was that he was no longer making noise snapping branches crashing through bushes scraping past trees but the gunmen were definitely making noise pittman could hear them charging through the underbrush behind him and responding to an intense flood of adrenaline he braced his legs took a deep breath then struggled up the slope its incline becoming steeper its wet grass slippery briefly his senses failed him the next thing he realized he was lumbering over the top of the ridge men were yelling below him their flashlights silhouetting him and then he was past the ridgeline entering more trees colliding with the fence clutching it gasping here a man yelled behind him flashlight bobbing pittman strained to climb the wooden fence dropped to the other side and staggered ahead enveloped again by trees jill his voice was hoarse his words forced jill its me its matt hes not far ahead a man yelled jill where are you i cant see you its me its matt flashlights reached the fence their beams stabbing into the darkness revealing pittman among the trees a bullet nicked his jacket another singed his hair gunshots roared among the trees pittman didnt understand his pursuers had been using silencers why would they have taken them off why would they want to make noise they didnt they hadnt the gunshots came from ahead of him the men were sprawling on the ground behind the fence yelling to one another to turn off their flashlights to stop making themselves targets bullets struck the fence the shots continued from ahead of pittman im here jill screamed pittman saw the muzzle flashes from the pistol she fired i see you stay down she yelled pittman dropped to his hands and knees scurrying among bushes reaching her hurry get in the car he opened the passenger door and flinched as the interior light came on revealing him after diving in he slammed the door shut and watched in amazement as jillwho was already in the car and had been firing through her open windowturned the ignition key stomped the accelerator and rocketed from a gap in the trees onto the narrow winding country road thank god thank god was all he could say the words came out between his urgent attempts to breathe his chest heaving falling his body shaking as sweat streamed off his face and soaked his clothes the duster skidded around a sharp corner expertly controlling the car jill immediately increased speed the cars headlights revealed the twists and turns of the treeflanked twolane road quickly pittman turned to see if headlights followed them not yet jill said they have to go back and use the lane from the school the gates two miles away by the time they get onto this road she reached another straightaway and again increased speed thank god pittman continued to murmur when i didnt see you when i yelled but you didnt answer i didnt know what to do i heard shooting from the school then something that sounded like fire alarms yes pittman caught his breath explaining i heard car engines jill said then there was shooting among the trees and suddenly you came over the fence stumbling toward me yelling the flashlights behind you those men chasing you all i could think of was that i had to distract them you told me that to fire the pistol i didnt need to cock it i only had to pull the trigger i didnt bother trying to aim i just leaned out the car window pointed the gun up and started shooting my god it holds a lot of bullets fifteen and it jerks and my ears are ringing from the noise when i saw where you were i pointed the gun away from you and aimed toward the fence she braked steered sharply around a curve and pressed harder on the accelerator pittman shook his head in amazement where did you learn to drive like my fathers a nut about porsches one of the few fatherdaughter things he ever did was teach me about racing if this car had a clutch and a standard shift i could really show you about gaining speed around curves pittmans hands wouldnt stop shaking and youre bleeding jill said what theres blood smeared on your face your hands and your clothes you must have scraped yourself on that wall or running through those trees or else say it i hope you werent hit no i dont feel any pain jill stared ahead speeding under a covered bridge i said i dont feel any pain thats not always a good sign what do you mean sometimes a wound traumatizes nerves in the area and stops them from sending messages shaking worse pittman felt along his legs his torso his arms everything seems to be all right surprising himself he yawned and realized that hed been doing so for quite a while whats wrong with me im worried i might have been shot and yet i cant stop yawning shock the adrenalines wearing off your bodys telling you it needs a long rest but i dont feel sleepy right jill turned on the cars heater pittman yawned again just to humor me jill said why dont you crawl in the backseat stretch out as best you can and close your eyes for a while the backseat that reminds me with difficulty pittman squirmed into the darkness of the backseat and zipped open his gym bag what are you doing jill asked reloading hand me your pistol ive got other magazines from the gunmen who were at your apartment id better reload yours too jill muttered something i didnt hear you guns i swore id never touch one of the damned things now here i the dusters slantsix engine roared as jill drove faster the silence woke him pittman blinked disoriented realized that he was slumped in the cars backseat and squinted ahead toward jill behind the steering wheel the sky was gray with false dawn the car was stopped where are we groggy he sat up and winced from stiffness a motel in greenfield massachusetts thats about ten miles south of vermont and a hundred and fifty miles from the school that ought to be far enough to keep them from finding us jill hesitated for now you must be exhausted i shouldnt be normally id be getting off my shift at the hospital in an hour id work out eat a light dinner watch something i taped on the vcr and go to sleep around noon but this isnt normally no kidding youd better stay in the car while i see if the desk clerk will accept cash to rent a room with that dried blood on you youre not exactly presentable ill tell the clerk we were visiting relatives in waterford connecticut we thought we could drive all night and get home but finally were exhausted jill got out of the car went into the motels office and returned with a key the room was on the bottom level in back of the motel a location jill had requested telling the clerk they didnt want to be disturbed by morning traffic no one was around when she unlocked the door and pittman followed her in they set the gym bag and small suitcase on the floor assessing the unit it was plain but clean its air stale but not offensive i asked for a nonsmokers room jill locked the door the clerk assured me the television works theres no one in the rooms on either side of us so we wont be disturbed that way either twin beds pittman said lucky yeah sex was the last thing on pittmans mind nonetheless he felt selfconscious youd better get in the bathroom and take your clothes off we have to find out how badly you were injured jill reached into pittmans gym bag and pulled out a firstaid kit that theyd bought along with the flashlight and pittmans wool coat the day before i bet you were a drill sergeant on the ward dont tell me youre going to get modest on me jill looked amused i didnt say i was going into the bathroom with you close the door undress rinse the blood off and after you get a towel around you ill check you out for sure ill have to change the bandage on your hand i bet you loved poking big needles into your patients pittman went into the bathroom and feeling a strain on his right side removed his clothes and youd better not use the shower jills voice came muffled from the opposite side of the door you might get weak and lose your balance sit in the tub he examined himself i can tell you right now there arent any holes in me but ive got a nasty bruise along my right ribs soak in the tub ill be back in a minute where are you going theres an allnight convenience store across the street im going to see what theyve got to eat orange juice doughnuts and skim milk pittman discovered when he finished his second bath the first had been pink from the dried blood hed rinsed off he came out of the steaming bathroom feeling awkward knowing he looked embarrassed holding a towel around his hips im surprised jill said given everything youve been doingsleeping on park benches pretending to be a policemanyou didnt strike me as the bashful type pittman saw a blanket on a metal shelf outside the bathroom and pulled it down before you cover yourself i need to look at that bruise on your ribs jill drew a finger along it ouch ouch grownups dont say ouch little kids say ouch does this rib hurt for christ sake yes now thats what big kids say inhale exhale does the pain get worse no she thought about it an x ray would tell for sure but i doubt any ribs are broken not that it matters why the treatment for broken ribs is the same as for bruised onesnothing you dont put on a cast for broken ribs these days you dont even get taped what you get is a warning not to exert yourself and not to bump your ribs against anything swell the miracles of modern medicine the cut on your hand those scratches and scrapes those i can do something about after putting on antibiotic cream and rebandaging pittmans left hand jill began applying disinfectant to portions of his face are you hungry yes but i wish youd brought some coffee along with the doughnuts orange juice and milk after the adrenaline rush you just went through havent you had enough chemical stimulation for a while i get the feeling you dont do much without thinking of the chemical effect on your body pittman said better living through proper diet in that case im surprised you bought doughnuts its the only thing remotely acceptable the store had beef jerky was out of the question i hate skim milk give it a chance youll learn to like it then even two percent tastes awfully rich if we stay together i suppose im going to have to learn to like it jill looked strangely at him whats the matter pittman asked nothing tell me what is it you were talking about if we stay together under better circumstances id like that jill said pittman felt himself blush its my turn for that bath looking as selfconscious as pittman had earlier jill picked up her suitcase and went inside turn on cnn she suggested before closing the door see if theres anything about us pittman didnt move for a moment thinking about what she had said about staying together six days ago hed been eager to die jill finished a glass of orange juice and pointed toward the news report on cnn nothing about what happened at the school im not surprised you think they didnt link it to us no im sure they did pittman said then im also sure that some very powerful people squashed the story they dont want any attention whatsoever directed toward that school yes jill said i see what you mean all those establishment parents they dont want anything to sully the reputation of the prep school their sons graduate from for that matter the alumni dont want grollier to be associated with breakins and shooting either far too vulgar maybe more than that pittman said maybe what were trying to learn is serious enough to destroy the school jill turned quickly toward him her gaze intense yes that would explain a lot duncan kline one of the men who taught the grand counselors and derrick meecham the student who dropped his class with them or got sick and had to leave school jill said but never came back to grollier the following year the year he would have graduated i wonder how do we find out about duncan kline and derrick meecham im sure as hell not going back to grollier after a moment jill said i have an idea a minute ago we were talking about grolliers alumni yes grolliers students are all targeted for ivy league colleges in particular harvard yale and princeton if we assume that derrick meecham finally graduated from a prep school similar to grollier then its also logical to assume that he went to one of the ivy league colleges jill said the registrars office for each school can tell us if meecham went to any of them but that wont help us what we really want to know is where meecham is now the university organizations that keep track of the current addresses of graduates are the alumni foundations pittman said exactly the groups that are always asking graduates for big bucks to support their alma mater my father graduated from yale hes one of the biggest donators to its athletic program the alumni foundation is on the phone to him all the time sucking up to him offering special tickets inviting him to exclusive athletic banquets wanting more money believe me for his daughter theyll do whatever i want and if derrick meecham didnt go to yale ill ask them to contact the alumni foundations at the other ivy league colleges fine ray fine jill said to the telephone her blue eyes gleamed with intensity yes my fathers feeling well too oh that sure we have disagreements from time to time we always patch them up were getting along fine concentrating she drew a hand through her long straight blond hair as a matter of fact i think i might drive up and see him this weekend from one of the twin beds pittman watched her she was wrapped in a blanket sitting on the desk that supported the phone a digital clock next to her showed am he and jill had gotten four hours sleep which wasnt nearly enough his sore body and raw eyes told him but there wasnt time to rest longer the call had to be made they had to keep moving the reason im calling ray is id appreciate it if you did me a favor jill said to the telephone its easy and it wont cost you money she laughed great i knew youd feel that way ill be sure to tell my father that you helped me out what id like you to do is check your computer files for an alumnus named derrick meecham what class im not sure some time in the thirties yes that does go a way back is it a problem one of my elderly patients is terminal he wants to tie up some loose ends and evidently theres something he wants to tell this derrick meecham i guess they havent seen each other in fifty years dont ask me why its important to him but i feel sorry for the old guy and id like to do him a favor yeah im a softy on the ward theyre always kidding me aboutwhat you must have a hell of a computer system just a minute while i write down that address the phone number wonderful ive got it thanks ray i really appreciate this ill be sure to tell my father you bet and you take care of yourself too jill set down the phone and looked at pittman boston pittman studied a map hed found in the bedside table thats only a hundred miles away it looks like if we take route two we can be there in a couple of hours matt whats wrong suppose meecham cant help us pittman didnt answer suppose he cant jill repeated dont think like that pittman said we need to believe that he will help us otherwise we wont be able to keep going jill studied him your determination surprises me why a man whos planning to kill himself normally doesnt worry about the future about staying alive survival thats not what this is about oh you sure as hell could have fooled me what is it about a week ago i was sitting in my bathtub with a gun in my mouth jill wasnt prepared for the change of subject the stark sentence shocked her i had settled all of my affairs every debt i owed had been repaid every favor returned everything was in order i wasnt beholden to anyone i intended to leave this world with every loose end tied then my phone rang and a friend i thought i was even with asked me to do him a favor he had done so much for my son that i couldnt possibly refuse him now i have another debt to whom jill asked you what are you talking about its my fault that youre involved in this if i hadnt gone to your apartment i have to make sure youre safe holding the blanket tightly around her jill walked over to him she touched his shoulder thank you pittman shrugged selfconscious and if youre successful jill asked pittman didnt know what to answer then what jill asked do you still plan to kill yourself pittman looked away five they took longer than they had anticipated route was under construction it ended well before boston and they were forced to take an indirect route using south then east into the city arriving only in late afternoon pittmans bandaged left hand felt less awkward he did the driving this time letting jill nap in the backseat until he stopped at a rest area just outside the city she sat up stretched and yawned these are your old stomping grounds pittman said do you think you can find the address sure no problem you dont need to look at a map derrick meecham must have a lot of money this address is in beacon hill its a couple of blocks from where my parents live rush hour slowed their progress even more but finally shortly after six jill steered from the massachusetts turnpike onto columbus avenue from there to charles street through boston common and then into the historic exclusive district of beacon hill pittman studied a narrow treelined cobblestoned street on one side a spiked wroughtiron fence enclosed a small park while on the other side nineteenthcentury brick town houses cast shadows from the lowering sun jill turned a corner and here gated driveways separated some of the mansions through the metal bars pittman saw courtyards gardens and carriage houses converted into garages and this is where you were raised when i wasnt at private schools jill said its beautiful it can also be a trap thats why i moved away to real life at the moment id prefer to escape from real life ahead a mercedes pulled away from a line of cars parked at the curb and jill eased into the space when she got out she straightened her tan skirt and put on her green blazer do i look presentable lovely just remember when we knock on the door whoever opens it is going to make an instantaneous judgment about us based on how neatly and acceptably we dress pittman reached into the car took his tie from his gym bag and put it on he hoped his shirt wasnt too wrinkled his slacks and sport coat were as clean as he could make them if i understand your logic pittman said id better not identify myself as a reporter jill nodded the kind of wealth were dealing with is extremely classconscious the press is definitely considered beneath them then what angle are we going to use what i tried at grollier that im writing a book about the academy better yet youre a history professor whos writing a book about the academy academics have privilege they went up a half dozen stone steps to a large polished weathered oak door it probably dates back to the early s jill said pittman grasped an iron knocker and tapped it against a metal plate secured to the door they waited pittman knocked again maybe no ones home i dont see any lights in the windows jill said maybe theyve gone out to dinner jill shook her head any respectable boston brahmin doesnt go out to dinner this early besides meechams elderly i doubt he strays far from home pittman raised his hand to knock on the door again but he was interrupted as he heard a lock being freed the knob was twisted the door came slowly open revealing a short fraillooking whitehaired woman who wore a tasteful highcollared blue dress that had long sleeves and a hem that almost covered the support hose on her swollen calves and ankles she had liver spots on her deeply creased skin she opened the door only partially squinting through her thick glasses at pittman and jill yes do i know you her voice was tremulous no maam pittman said my name is peter logan im a history professor from across the river he referred to harvard i apologize if this is an inconvenient time for me to be calling but i was wondering if i could speak to your husband about a book that im writing history professor book my husband yes maam im doing research about some american educational institutions the classic ones and im hoping that your husband can answer some questions that occurred to me questions my husband pittmans stomach sank she keeps repeating what i say turning my statements into questions were wasting our time he thought shes senile she doesnt have the faintest idea of what im talking about the woman raised her head i dont know what questions you have in mind but im afraid my husband cant answer them he died a year ago the shock of what she said and the lucidity with which she said it made pittman realize that hed severely misjudged her oh he was too surprised to know what to say he knew he should have considered the possibility that meecham would be dead by now but the fact that the grand counselors except for millgate were still alive had made pittman hope that those associated with the counselors would still be alive as well im terribly sorry he said the alumni association at yale told me that derrick meecham lived here i assumed that their records were up to date they are the womans voice became more tremulous i dont understand derrick meecham does live here forgive us maam jill said we still dont understand my son mother a mans refined voice said from inside the house i thought we agreed that you had to save your energy theres no need for you to answer the door that is fredericks responsibility where is he by the way the door came all the way open and pittman faced a distinguishedlooking man in his early fifties the man had a broad forehead graying hair steady eyes and the solid expression of someone used to giving orders and expecting them to be obeyed his threepiece gray pinstriped suit was the most perfectly tailored that pittman had ever seen yes may i help you the man asked without enthusiasm this man is a professor the elderly woman said peter logan pittman added i teach history at harvard ive made a mistake im afraid i wanted to speak with your father but as ive just learned he passed on i didnt mean to intrude speak to my father what about im doing research on the history of grollier academy the man didnt react for a moment didnt blink didnt seem to breathe grollier its had such a major influence on american government i thought it was time to investigate what makes it unique oh its unique all right cars drove by on the street the sun dipped lower casting shadows the man continued to stare at pittman then his chest moved come in professor im sorry could you repeat your name logan peter logan this is my wife rebecca shes a historian also derrick meecham the man offered his hand once more saying without enthusiasm come in the man locked the door and led the way escorting his mother along a wide woodpaneled corridor that had landscape paintings forests and farmhouses on the walls the frames looked old enough to be from the nineteenth century they passed a brightly polished maple staircase its banister beautifully carved at the end of the corridor lights glowed in several rooms from one of which a tall man wearing a white jacket appeared where have you been frederick meecham asked i found my mother answering the door i thought she was upstairs the man in the white jacket said i apologize sir i didnt hear the door i was down in the wine cellar looking for the rothschild you requested did you find it yes sir the yes sir good mother why dont you rest until dinner frederick will take you up to your room perhaps you can watch one of your television shows meechams tone implied that he himself did not watch television victory garden is about to begin mrs meecham frederick said yes the elderly woman said with enthusiasm allowing herself to be escorted into a small elevator as the cage rumbled and rose meecham turned to pittman and jill in here please they entered one of the many rooms that flanked the wide corridor there were bookcases with leatherbound volumes on them mostly law books the furniture was subdued correct and pittman assumed more expensive than he would have dreamed an oriental rug stopped three feet short of the walls on each side revealing a rich oak floor meecham gestured sit down may i have frederick get you anything pittman and jill each took a chair across from where meecham stood by the fireplace thank you no pittman said i was just about to have a cocktail meecham said his hospitality surprising pittman i dont get it pittman thought he was ready to give us the bums rush until i mentioned grollier now he invites us in and wants us to have cocktails either he needs the drink which it doesnt look like or else he hopes a little booze might get us to talk more candidly than we normally would have a cocktail would be nice jill said whatever youre having vodka martinis that would be fine meecham walked to the door opened it spoke to someone then shut the door again and sat on a chippendale chair next to the fireplace he looked steadily at jill and then pittman grollier academy thats right your father went there i believe pittman said oh indeed he did but i dont quite understand of all the students who went to grollier why would you have chosen my father for an interview because he was a classmate of the socalled grand counselors jonathan millgate eustace gable anthony lloyd meechams features hardened i know who the grand counselors are my father had no relationship with them after he left grollier but evidently he was close to them at the time meecham spoke quickly what makes you think that in his junior year your father enrolled in a course in political science the number of students was quite small only six the five grand counselors and my father it was the first time that meecham had volunteered any information pittman tried not to look surprised yes jill said naturally in so close an environment especially on the subject of political science your father would have heard ideas exchanged that might have explained the direction the grand counselors took in their political careers meecham studied them my father never discussed that with me the room became silent meecham was through volunteering information then perhaps he said something about the grand counselors themselves pittman said some kind of reminiscence when he read about them in the newspapers something that would give insight into their formative ideas he never discussed that with me either meecham said flatly no comment at all when he read about something controversial that they did only that hed gone to school with them yes meecham had definitely stopped volunteering information the room became silent again someone knocked on the door frederick came in carrying a tray that held glasses and a martini pitcher frederick we wont have time for cocktails after all i just remembered that the san francisco office is going to be phoning me in five minutes meecham said frederick paused where he was about to set the tray on a sideboard meecham stood approaching pittman and jill i dont like conducting business in the evening thats probably why i forgot about the telephone call let me escort you to the door i regret i couldnt be of more help but my father was a private man he seldom talked to me about personal matters grollier was a long time ago pittman stood as well one last question i wonder if you have any idea why your father didnt graduate from grollier meecham whose gaze had been steady blinked twice he dropped out of the political science course that he was taking with the grand counselors pittman said and then he stopped attending grollier altogether ive changed my mind frederick meecham said the san francisco office can talk to me tomorrow when the phone rings tell them im unavailable very good sir please serve the martinis certainly sir meecham sat again looking uncomfortable pittman and jill lowered themselves back into their chairs frederick poured the martinis and brought a tray to each of them offering a choice of olives or pearl onions pittman sipped enjoying the cold smooth taste suddenly realizing how little alcohol he had had to drink since hed followed millgate to the scarsdale estate five nights earlier prior to then hed been really putting it away guzzling it he hadnt been able to face the dayand especially the nightswithout it he had needed to distance himself from reality now he couldnt allow anything to keep him from facing reality the situation became awkward no one said anything waiting for frederick to leave as the door was finally closed meecham said an edge in his voice what do you really want just what we told youto know your fathers attitude toward grollier and the grand counselors pittman said if youre aware that my father never graduated from grollier that he dropped out in his junior year and went to another school it must be obvious to you that he had ambivalent feelings did he ever say anything about one of his teachers duncan kline meechams gaze became piercingly direct this has nothing to do with a book about education i beg your pardon youre not here because youre doing a history of grollier meecham stood abruptly you know about grollier you keep talking around the subject hinting about it but you know i dont understand pittman said otherwise you wouldnt have mentioned duncan kline he taught the political science class that your father dropped out of the man was perverted pittman had taken a sip from his martini surprised by meechams comment he swallowed hard perverted you mean you actually dont know meecham looked threatened as if hed let down his defenses we know something happened there pittman said something traumatic enough to make jonathan millgate obsessed about it even all these years later on his deathbed i cant speak for jonathan millgate all i know is what my father told me when i suggested that i send my own boys to grollier it was one of the few times he ever showed open emotion he told me that under no circumstances was i to send his grandsons there i was to send them to a decent school a place like groton from where my father had eventually graduated and then gone to yale but why did he dislike grollier so much jill asked meecham scowled at the floor debating with himself maybe its time he looked up maybe grollier hasnt changed someone should have done something long ago to make sure it stopped to make sure what stopped meecham nervously tapped his fingers against his martini glass this is all off the record if thats the way you want it its the way it has to be meecham seemed to struggle with himself in order to say the words duncan kline was a pedophile pittman stared after further painful hesitation meecham continued a boys prep school was a perfect environment for him from what my father told me i gather that duncan kline was a brilliant instructor quick amusing encouraging the sort of charismatic figure who attracts the brightest of students apparently he was also an athlete particularly when it came to rowing his policy was to assess each incoming class to select the most promising boys a very small group a half dozen or so and then to nurture them throughout their four years at grollier i suspect that he also chose them on the basis of how emotionally distant they were from their parents how keenly they needed a substitute father certainly my father was never close to his father duncan kline encouraged them to take small private seminars from him he trained them to be oarsmen and to outdistance the best official grollier team he gradually became more and more intimate with them until by their junior year as i said one group from each incoming class that way as one group graduated and went on to college another was there to take that groups place pittman felt sick his face tight with emotion meecham took a long sip from his martini my father rejected klines advances kline backed off but soon he came back and persisted in making advances this time when my father rejected him kline was either so indignant or else frightened of being exposed that he made academic life intolerable for my father giving him impossible assignments ridiculing him at every opportunity my fathers grades declined so did his morale and his health apparently he had some kind of collapse at home during the easter break of his junior year he never went back to grollier pittman couldnt keep dismay from his voice but didnt your fathers parents do anything about duncan kline do what meecham shook his head puzzled what would you have had them do they should have reported kline to the authorities they should have reported the whole mess to the headmaster of the school meecham looked at pittman as if hed gone insane reported you obviously dont grasp the situation this happened in the early s the time was repressive i assure you that topics such as child molestation were definitely not considered fit for conversation not in polite society that type of sordidness existed everyone tacitly knew that but surely it didnt occur often and when it did it happened to other people lesser people unrefined crass people who were economic and moral inferiors dear lord pittman said meecham looked more disturbed as he took another long sip from his martini that was the prevailing opinion of the time grollier boasts governors senators congressmen even a president of the united states among its distinguished alumni for a student to claim that sexual abuse occurred on a regular basis at that school would have been unthinkable so many reputations would have been at stake that the authorities would never have treated the charge seriously they would have been forced to conclude that the student was grievously mistaken that he was making such an outrageous accusation because he needed to blame someone for his poor grades as a matter of fact when my father told his father what was happening at grollier his father slapped him called him a liar and told him never to repeat such filth again pittman was astonished so my father kept it a secret and never told another person until i suggested to him that grollier might be a good prep school for my sons but surely the other students would have supported your fathers claim pittman said would they have or would their parents ever have allowed them to be subjected to questions of such a gross nature i wonder in any case its a moot issue the matter never got that far her blue eyes intense jill leaned forward are we to assume that duncan kline made advances to the grand counselors also that those advances were accepted meecham stared at his martini glass they were duncan klines chosen few and they did continue to take his seminars by the time my father told me thismy sons went to prep school in the midseventiesit was too late to do anything about kline himself he died in the early fifties by then hed retired from grollier and had a place here in boston my father said that one of the happiest days of his life was when he read klines obituary believe me my father had very few happy days meecham finished his martini and frowned toward the pitcher as if he could use another drink i dont know what youve set out to prove but if there were other instructors like kline at grollier and if their counterparts still teach there and if your book exposes them weve both done some good suspecting something pittman asked would you be willing to be quoted meecham reacted sharply of course not do you think id want that kind of public attention i told you before this conversation is strictly off the record im just pointing you in the right direction surely someone else would be willing to substantiate what ive told you ask the grand counselors meecham looked bitterly amused see how willing theyd be to go on record when jonathan millgate was in intensive care he told his nurse duncan the snow grollier what do you suppose he meant by the reference to snow i have no idea certainly my father never mentioned anything that linked duncan kline with snow its a slang expression forcould it be a reference to cocaine again i have no idea was that expression even used back in the early thirties would someone as distinguished as jonathan millgate reduce himself to that type of language pittman shrugged in discouragement then turned hearing a knock on the door frederick stepped in mr meecham two policemen are at the door pittman felt a hot rush of adrenaline meecham looked surprised policemen detectives frederick said they want to know if youve had any contact with someone named matthew pittman hes traveling with a woman and fredericks gaze settled on pittman and jill meecham frowned where does that door lead pittman stood unexpectedly and crossed the room toward a door in a wall that faced the rear of the house the door was the only other way out of the room and since pittman had no intention of using the door through which frederick had come of going out to the corridor where the detectives might see him he had to take this route he heard jills footsteps behind him what do you think youre doing meecham demanded by then pittman had pulled the door open and was lunging into a narrow hallway jill hurrying to follow pittmans breathing quickened stop meecham said on the left pittman passed the entrance to the mansions kitchen he had a glimpse of a male cook in a white uniform who opened his mouth in surprise then pittman flanked rapidly by jill was out of sight running farther down the hallway reaching a door the window of which revealed a cobblestone courtyard pittman jerked the door open and felt pressure in his chest as he realized that the dusky courtyard was bordered by a high barred gate an even higher wall and a carriage house turned into a garage well never get out of here dismayed he swung to look behind him frederick appeared at the opposite end of the hallway the cook appeared at the entrance to the kitchen heavy footsteps pounded toward the hallway from the front of the house to the right of the door stairs led upward pittman suddenly thought of a way to escape and charged up tugging jill behind him at a landing the stairs veered up on another angle and pittman bounded higher reaching a hallway on an upper level of the house closed doors lined the hallway meecham was making indignant demands to someone downstairs he flinched as a door came open across from him meechams elderly mother appeared deceptively frail so much noise i can barely hear the television pittman made a soothing gesture mrs meecham does your bedroom have a lock of course it has a lock doesnt every bedroom have a lock do you think i want people barging in on me what are you doing up here thanks pittman hurried with jill who didnt understand what pittman was doing you cant go in there mrs meecham said pittman slammed and locked the door from a television in the corner of the wellappointed lacecurtained room complete with a fourposter bed the opening theme music for a nature program almost obscured mrs meechams feeble pounding on the door jill swung toward pittman what are we doing in here a look of sudden understanding crossed her face as pittman rushed toward a window it faced the back of the house above the peaked roof of the garage pittman opened it come on inexplicably jill seemed frozen whats wrong jill stared toward the door she turned her head and stared at pittman come on pittman said at once jill became animated taking off her pumps of all the times to be wearing a skirt the hem tore as she raised her legs and climbed out the window the pounding on the bedroom door became louder angry male voices were on the other side the door shuddered as if shoulders were being heaved against it wincing from pain in his injured ribs pittman squirmed out the open window after jill the garage roof sloped down on each side and pittman tried to stay balanced while running along the peak behind him something crashed in the bedroom jill reached the end of the roof and jumped down onto something appearing to run on the shadowy air as she disappeared around the corner of another house when pittman came to the end of the garage he saw that what jill had jumped down onto was the footwide top of the high wall that enclosed the courtyard that wall continued to the left bordering the courtyards of other houses bisecting the block hearing a shout behind him pittman climbed down as well and followed her breathing so deeply and quickly that his lungs felt on fire then he too was out of sight from the window he concentrated not to topple from the wall as he hurried after jill who clutched her shoes in one hand her purse in the other and scrambled in bare feet across the peak of another carriage house turned into a garage a shingle gave way beneath jill skittering off the roof clattering onto cobblestones she fell on her shoulder beginning to roll pittman grabbed her arm she dropped her shoes which hit the cobblestones next to the shingle pittman charged ahead with jill and halted unexpectedly the wall didnt continue beyond the garage the courtyard was framed only by buildings below them a red jaguar was parked outside the garage pittman jumped down onto the car feeling the roof protest but hold jill didnt need encouragement she leapt down after him the metal so smoothly waxed that her bare feet nearly slid out from under her pittman clutched her kept her from falling held her arms lowered her toward the cobblestones then jumped down next to her the jaguars owner must have been planning to leave soon the gate to the street was open racing along the driveway they reached a narrow quiet treelined twilit street around the corner from meechams address their gray duster was parked three spaces to their left drive jill threw him the keys then climbed into the backseat ducking below the windows as pittman sped away from the curb he heard her rummaging in the back what are you doing she was scrunched down out of sight fumbling with something jill what are you getting out of this damned skirt and into my jeans this skirt is ripped up to my backside if im going to be arrested theres no way its going to be with my underwear showing pittman couldnt help it he was frightened and he couldnt catch his breath but she sounded so embarrassed he started laughing ive had it with skirts and those useless pumps she said i dont care who i have to make an impression on all this running from now on its sneakers a sweater and jeans and how the hell did the police know we were at meechams who could have pittman stared grimly ahead yes thats really been bothering me he concentrated who wait a minute i think itheres only one person who had that information the man i phoned at the alumni association yes this evening he must have called my father to suck up to him by bragging how hed done me a favor thats got to be it your father knows that the police are looking for you as soon as he heard from the alumni association he phoned the police and sent them to the address the man gave you weve got to be more careful pittman steered onto charles street trying to keep his speed down not to be conspicuous as other cars switched on their headlights so did he exactly pittman said more careful what were you doing back there i told you putting on my jeans no i mean back at the house in the bedroom you looked as if you werent going to leave with me jill didnt respond dont tell me thats true pittman said you actually thought about staying behind for a second jill hesitated i told myself i cant keep running forever the police dont want me its millgates people who want to kill me i thought i could end it right there i could stay behind and give myself up explain to the police why ive been running make them understand youre innocent yeah sure i bet that would have been good for a few laughs at the precinct although pittman could understand jills motives the thought that she would have left him caused his stomach to harden so what made you keep going why didnt you stay the story you told me about how youd been arrested when you were trying to get an interview with millgate seven years ago thats right two prisoners probably working for millgate beat me up while i was in a holding cell the police werent quick enough to help you jill said or maybe the guards were bribed to take a long coffee break pittman continued to feel bitter that she might have left him theres no way the authorities could guarantee your safety so thats why you came with me your common sense took over you listened to your survival instincts no jill said selfpreservation no thats not why i came with you it had nothing to do with worrying whether the police could protect me then i was worried about you i couldnt imagine what youd be like on your own hey i could have managed you dont realize how vulnerable you are no kidding every time somebody shoots at me i get the idea emotionally vulnerable last wednesday you were going to do the shooting i dont need to be reminded it would have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble jill squirmed from the back into the passenger seat you just proved my point i think the only reason youve managed to get this far is you had somebody cheering for you ive never met anybody more lonely why would you want to keep going if you didnt have anything to live for anybody to care pittman felt as if ice had been placed on his chest unable to speak he drove through the shadows of boston common reaching columbus avenue using the reverse of the route jill had taken the reason i decided to stay with you jill said is that i didnt want to be apart from you pittman had trouble speaking you sure did a lot of thinking in a couple of seconds ive been thinking about this for a while jill said i want to see how we get along when life gets normal if pittman said if it ever does get normal if we can ever get through this this is a new feeling for me jill said it kind of snuck up on me when you introduced me as your wife what i liked it pittman was so amazed that he couldnt react for a moment he reached over touching her hand a car horn blared behind him as he steered from traffic and stopped at the curb his throat feeling tighter he studied jill her beguiling oval face her long cornsilk hair her sapphire eyes glinting from the reflection of passing headlights he leaned close and gently kissed her the softness of her lips making him tingle when she put her arms around his neck he felt ripples of sensation the kiss went on and on she parted her lips he tasted her he felt a swirling sensation and slowly leaned back pleasantly out of breath studying her more intensely i didnt think id ever feel this way again youve got a lot of good feelings to catch up on jill said pittman kissed her again this time with a hunger that startled him shaking he had to stop my hearts beating so fast i know jill said i feel lightheaded another car horn blared passing them pittman turned to look out his side window where hed stopped was in a no parking zone the last thing we need is a traffic ticket he pulled from the curb immediately he noticed a police car at the corner of the next street he tried to keep his speed constant to peer straight ahead it seemed to take him forever to pass the cruiser in his rearview mirror he saw the police car move forwardnot in his direction but along the continuation of the side street he loosened his tight grip on the steering wheel his brow felt clammy he was more afraid than usual where are we going pittman shook his head squinting at the painful glare of headlights on the crowded massachusetts turnpike for several minutes hed been pensively quiet trying to adjustas he assumed jill wasto the powerful change in their relationship were heading out of boston but where were going i have no idea i dont know what to do next weve learned a lot but we really havent learned anything i cant believe that millgates people would want to kill us because wed found out what happened to him in prep school suppose he wasnt molested the circumstantial evidence indicates no what i mean is suppose hed been willing jill said maybe millgates people believe that the old mans reputation would have been ruined if you think thats what his people were afraid of well he confessed something to you about grollier and they killed him for it then you had to be stopped and me because they have to believe youve told me what you know killed him to protect his reputation i just cant theres something more pittman said i dont think weve learned the whole truth yet maybe the other grand counselors are trying to protect their reputations they dont want anyone to know what happened to them at grollier but what exactly and how do we prove it jill asked she rubbed her forehead i cant think anymore if i dont get something to eat glancing ahead she pointed to the right toward a truck stop off the turnpike sodium arc lamps glaring in the darkness my stomachs rumbling too pittman followed an exit ramp into the bright eerie yellow light of the gas stationrestaurant where he parked several slots away from a row of eighteenwheel rigs after they got out of the car and joined each other in front pittman hugged her what are we going to do she pressed the side of her face against his shoulder where do we go for answers were just tired pittman stroked her hair then kissed her once we get something to eat and some rest hand in hand they walked toward the brightly lit entrance to the restaurant other cars were pulling in wary pittman watched a van stop ahead of them the driver had his window down the vans radio was blaring an announcer reading the news i guess im needlessly jumpy everybody looks suspicious to me pittman said he made sure that he was between jill and the van when they came abreast of the drivers door the beefy man behind the steering wheel was talking loudly to someone else but the radio was even louder than his gruff tone pittman turned toward the van my god whats the matter the news the radio in that van didnt you hear it no anthony lloyd one of the grand counselors hes dead dismayed pittman ran with jill back to the duster inside he turned on the radio and switched stations cursing impatiently at callin shows and countrywestern programs there must be a news station somewhere he turned on the cars engine afraid he would weaken the battery while he switched stations ten minutes later an onthehalfhour news report came on anthony lloyd onetime ambassador to the united nations the former ussr and britain past secretary of state as well as past secretary of defense died this evening at his home near washington a solemnvoiced male reporter said one of a legendary group of five diplomats whose careers spanned global events from the second world war to the present lloyd was frequently describedalong with his associatesas a grand counselor to quote the reaction of harold fisk current secretary of state anthony lloyd had an immeasurable influence on american foreign policy for the past fifty years his wisdom will be sorely missed while the cause of death has not yet been determined it is rumored that lloydaged eightydied from a stroke the result of strain brought on by the recent apparent murder of his colleague jonathan millgate another of the grand counselors authorities are still looking for matthew pittman the former reporter allegedly responsible for millgates death the news report changed to other topics and pittman shut off the radio in silence he continued to stare at the dashboard died from a stroke jill asked or was he murdered too its a wonder they didnt blame his death on me as well in a way they did jill said their story is that the first death caused the second died from strain pittman bit his lip thinking he turned to jill or from guilt from worry maybe somethings happening to all of them maybe the grand counselors arent as strong as they thought what are you getting at well have to eat on the road and take turns sleeping while the other drives weve got a lot of miles to cover shortly before am in dim morning light pittman parked near the wellmaintained apartment building in park slope in brooklyn traffic increased people walked by going to work i just hope she hasnt left yet if she has we could end up sitting here all day thinking shes still in the apartment pittman used his electric razor to shave youre certain she works outside the home if youd ever met gladys youd know shed definitely prefer to be away while her husband works at home and takes care of the baby he sipped tepid coffee from a styrofoam cup do we have any more of that danish left jill glanced around peered at her styrofoam cup of stale coffee on the dashboard and grimaced i cant believe im doing this to myself i hardly ever drink coffee and now im guzzling it yesterday morning i was eating doughnuts last night chili and french fries now its the gooiest danish i ever and i cant get enough of it after years of eating right im selfdestructing there pittman gestured thats gladys a prim sourfaced woman stepped out of the apartment building tightened a scarf around her head and walked determinedly along the street looks like she runs a tight ship jill said talking to her makes you think of mutiny but we wont have to talk to her right pittman got out of the car they walked toward the apartment building in the vestibule pittman faced a row of intercom buttons and pretended to study the name below each button as if looking for one in particular but what he really did was wait for the man and woman leaving the building to get out of his sight in time for him to grab the door as it swung shut before it could lock itself he reopened it and walked through with jill heading toward the elevator when the door to b opened in response to the knock brian botulfsonwho still wore his pajamas had rumpled hair and looked exhaustedslumped his shoulders with discouragement the moment he saw pittman aw no give me a break not you the last thing i need is how are you brian pittman asked cheerily how have you been doing since i saw you last in the background pittman heard an infant crying harshly not the usual baby cry but a hurt cry a sick cry pittman remembered it well from when jeremy had been an infant uhoh sounds like youve been up all night pittman entered hey you cant pittman shut the door and locked it you dont seem very happy to see me brian the last time you were here i got in so much trouble with if gladys was here but she isnt we waited until she left jill was preoccupied by the cries from the baby boy or girl boy he doesnt sound well has he got a fever i think so brian said you didnt check his temperature jill asked i didnt have time i was too busy getting him clean after he threw up seems like you could use some help wheres your thermometer let me see the baby supplies you got pittman raised his hands almost forgot brian this is my friend jill hello brian im a nurse i used to work in pediatrics ill take good care of your son the thermometer on his bedside table brian pointed as jill went toward a room to the left of the kitchen pittman said see its your lucky day yeah i feel lucky all to hell look youve got to stop coming here the police are searching for you no kidding i cant get involved in this i cant i wont come around again i swear brian scouts honor thats what you said the last time ah but i didnt swear on scouts honor brian groaned if the police find out im a dangerous criminal tell them i terrified you so much you had

doing id be an accessory then were in agreement i dont want you to know what im doing either but if you refuse to help me if i get caught ill convince the police that you are an accessory pittman lied dont think like that id go to prison again and imagine what gladys would say on the other hand i never turn against my friends brian the quicker we do this the quicker im out of here i want you to give me a crash course in hacking jill leaned out from the babys room his fevers a hundred and one is that bad brian asked nervously it isnt good but i think i can lower it by the way brian those childrens aspirins are a nono for a babys fever they can cause a serious condition called reyes syndrome have you got any tylenol see pittman said in good hands now come on brian pay us for the house call show me how to do a little hacking or well hang around the house until gladys comes home brian turned pale what programs do you want to get into unlisted telephone numbers and the addresses that go with them what city i dont want to tell you brian youre going to have to show me how to get in without knowing what city i want then youre going to sit in a corner while i play with your computer i feel like crying will the baby be all right pittman drove from the apartment building as long as brian keeps giving him a childrens dose of tylenol on schedule and liquids a sponge bath doesnt hurt i told him to get the baby to a doctor if the fever gets worse or the vomiting persists cute kid i think hell be okay and maybe brian will get some sleep tonight unless gladys decides to make trouble did he let you have what you wanted pittman held up a sheet of paper i learned from the mistake we made with the guy from the alumni association dont let anybody know our next move brian showed me how to get unlisted phone numbers and addresses but he doesnt know whose or what city washington pittman nodded the grand counselors pittman nodded again long drive we cant fly youd have to use a check or a credit card to buy our tickets your name would get in the computer the police will be looking for it weve got to keep driving you really know how to show a girl a good time i think ill pull a blanket over my head and assume a fetal position good idea get some more rest you too well need it if were going to try to get close to the grand counselors not just yet but i thought you said we were going to washington right but i need to see somebody else there who a man i interviewed a long time ago it was after dark when they reached washingtons beltway headed south on i then west on to massachusetts avenue despite his exhaustion pittman managed to drive skillfully through the dense traffic you seem to know your way around the city jill said when i was working on the national affairs desk i spent a lot of time down here pittman rounded dupont circle and took p street west into georgetown reminds me of beacon hill jill said i suppose pittman glanced at the narrow wooded street the paving was cobblestone ahead it changed to red brick federal and victorian mansions were squeezed next to one another never been here never been to any place in washington new york was about as far from my parents as i felt i needed to get georgetowns the oldest and wealthiest district in the city the remaining grand counselors live here pittman shook his head this is too ordinary for them they live on estates in virginia then who did you come here to see a man who hates them pittman headed south on wisconsin avenue headlights and streetlights made him squint the guy ive been trying to phone every time we stopped along the road bradford denning hes elderly now but in his prime he was a career diplomat a mover and shaker in the state department during the truman administration according to him he would eventually have become secretary of state what happened that he didnt the grand counselors they didnt like him being in competition with them so they got him out of their way how on earth did they manage that to hear denning tell itthis was during the mccarthy witchhunt erathey spread persistent rumors that denning was soft on communism in the early fifties that would have ruined a diplomat it certainly ruined denning he found it impossible to undo the damage was given less and less responsibility in the state department and finally had to resign he claims that his isnt the only career the grand counselors ruined by claiming that somebody was a communist sympathizer the grand counselors then ingratiated themselves with the incoming eisenhower administration replaced the diplomats theyd attacked and went on to control the highest diplomatic offices that lasted until when the democrats regained the white house with kennedy kennedy wanted to work with friends and family rather than career diplomats for three years the grand counselors stood on the sidelines but after kennedy was assassinated johnson who had disliked kennedy was eager to assert himself by getting kennedys people out of the state department and the white house staff he welcomed the grand counselors back into diplomatic power for the second time in their careers they had managed the trick of being accepted by different political parties in fact by then they seemed to transcend the twoparty system so that when nixon and the republicans came back into power at the end of the sixties the grand counselors had no difficulty in continuing to maintain their influence so it went in periods of intense international strain various later presidents continued to ask for their advice and denning had what to most people would have seemed a productive life he taught college wrote for political journals contributed editorial columns to the new york times and the washington post but he always felt cheated and he never forgave the grand counselors in fact he devoted most of his spare time to researching a book about them an expose of their ruthlessness is that how you know about him because of the book no the book was never published near the end of his research his house caught fire all his notes were destroyed after that he was a defeated man seven years ago when i was preparing to write a story about millgate one of the few people who agreed to talk to me told me about denning i came down here to washington to see him but hed been drinking and what he had to say was all innuendohed once had proof he insisted but it went up in the fireand i finally realized i couldnt quote him i never wrote the story anyhow after i was arrested and my jaw was broken by those two prisoners in jail my editor assigned me to something else driving pittman brooded thinking of his reassignment had reminded him of burt forsyth not only his editor but his closest friend the fight in the construction area off twentysixth street was brutally vivid in pittmans memory burt stepping back as the gunman came into the shadows the gunman shooting at pittman then at burt grief felt like arms around his chest squeezing him breathless they didnt need to kill burt he thought the bastards you look awfully angry jill said dont you think ive got reason to be without a doubt but its surprising how so when you came to my apartment sunday the emotion you communicated was desperation your motive was passivea reaction to being threatened but angers an active emotion its let me ask you a question if somehow a truce could be arranged and the police wouldnt be after you and the grand counselors would leave you alone would you walk away after everything those bastards have put me through no way jill studied him yes youve definitely changed you have no idea how much this is wednesday remember a week ago tonight i was ready to kill myself jill didnt react just kept staring at him say something i keep forgetting how deeply upset you were jill said still am none of this changes my grief for jeremy yes youll continue to grieve for the rest of your life thats right but if you wanted to die as much as you say you did why didnt you let the grand counselors do the job for you no in the last week something happened to you to make you want the rest of your life to go on as long as possible you jill touched his shoulder with affection but youd been on the run for a couple of days before you showed up at my apartment you had plenty of opportunity to give in to your despair you know what i think pittman didnt answer fear made you feel alive again while weve been driving you told me how you sometimes have the sense that jeremys with you that he talks to you pittman nodded you think its foolish to believe that on the contrary ill go you one better i think jeremys been pushing you into fighting back i think he wants you to decide to live for something pittmans voice was husky with emotion that would be nice to believe his throat ached as he squinted ahead toward the bright lights and congested traffic in the area of wisconsin avenue and m street jill sounded puzzled whats the problem ahead an accident affected by the intensity of what theyd been discussing pittman was grateful to change the subject no its always this crowded wisconsin avenue and m street are where the action is in georgetownbars restaurants nightclubs shops selling everything you can imagine as long as its expensive denning lives around here not at all he couldnt possibly afford it he lives on his college pension which isnt very much no when i finally got in touch with him on the phone i told him i was a journalist doing a story on anthony lloyds death i told him so many diplomats and politicians were canonizing lloyd that i thought a dissenting opinion would give my story depth i asked him if i could take him to dinner he was more than happy to accept he said he planned to go to a memorial service for anthony lloydpittman hesitatedand then sit down to eat a big meal with me to celebrate the restaurant il trovatore was spacious and soothingly lit the tables far enough apart that politicians and personalities could discuss delicate topics without being easily overheard as pittman walked in with jill he glanced to the right toward the bar and recognized a wellknown senator a network news anchorman was eating dinner with an importantlooking man at a table to the left from somewhere a piano was playing soft jazz the clink of silverware against plates and the murmur of voices blended with the subtle level of the music cloaking individual conversations yes sir the maitre d had pinched nostrils wore a white dinner jacket and looked disapprovingly at jills sweater jeans and sneakers we have a reservation in bradford dennings name pittman had phoned to make the reservation during one of their stops along the interstate en route to washington the maitre d glanced at a list of names yes mr denning has already arrived hes been seated at the table good but the maitre d continued to look with disapproval at jills clothing if theres a problem with the restaurants dress code pittman discreetly handed the maitre d twenty dollars from their diminishing supply of cash no problem at all sir come this way the maitre d led them toward the back of the restaurant where a short thin elderly but intense man was seated alone in a booth the man had sparse white hair that contrasted with the fierce brown of his eyes and the red of his cheeks he wore a gray suit that was somewhat out of date he was drinking whiskey on ice a second lowball glass empty had been placed to the side here you are sir the maitre d told pittman thank you enjoy pittman turned to the man in the booth bradford denning lester king thats right because the police now knew that pittman was using the pseudonym peter logan he had decided that the change was necessary he was nervously aware that he risked being recognized by denning but he had to take the chance he and denning had met only once before seven years ago and denning had been so drunk that pittman didnt think it likely he would remember that longago evening this is my assistant jennifer a pleasure keeping a careful grip on his whiskey glass denning half got out of his seat in a polite gesture of greeting please theres no need to be formal jill sat next to him pittman took the seat across from him its kind of you to agree to join us kind denning found the comment amusing i havent been able to afford to eat in a place like this since too long im glad you approve of my choice it reminds me of another italian restaurant that used to be up the street what was it called denning sipped from his whiskey and shook his head cant remember this was back in the fifties elegant used to eat there all the time everybody who mattered did he finished the whiskey of course its out of business now they come and they go he squinted like people by the way i hope you dont mind he gestured toward the empty glasses i got here a little early and started ahead of you why would i mind youre our guest as i said im grateful that you could join us its not every day that someone pays for me to celebrate the death of an enemy denning motioned for a waiter to come over two enemies im still not finished celebrating millgates death he nodded to the waiter bring two more of these jack daniels not so much ice this time certainly sir and for your friends heineken pittman said your house chardonnay jill said may i tell you about our specials so you can think about them while youre enjoying your cocktails later denning said therell be plenty of time for that were not hungry yet very good sir as the waiter left pittman wondered if dennings haughty takecharge manner typified his diplomatic style when he was in the state department if so gossip spread by the grand counselors might not have been the only reason he was forced to resign two down denning said three to go i intend to drink a cocktail for every one of those sons of bitches a liquid prayer that the other threell be dead soon too pittman noticed that dennings voice had a subtle slur your attitude toward the grand counselors is well known obviously you still havent stopped hating them never do you mind if we talk before we eat about them dennings emphasis implied numerous obscenities thats why i came here you wanted something compromising to offset the righteous bullshit people are saying about millgate and lloyd ill give it to you ill give you plenty pittman took out a pen and a notepad maintaining the pretense that he was writing a newspaper story whats the worst thing you can say about them they burned my house excuse me pittman had expected more of the unsubstantiated charges that he had heard from denning seven years earlier but this was a new accusation denning frowned at him you look familiar have we met before not that im aware of pittman said tensing you remind me of washington can be a small town maybe we ran into each other at a diplomatic reception or i havent been invited to a diplomatic reception in thirtyfive years denning said bitterly they burned your house i was writing an expose about them they must have found out they set fire to my house and destroyed my research but can you prove that jill asked of course not theyre too clever to leave evidence then can you tell us what you were going to expose they murdered hundreds of thousands of people this is as bad as the last time pittman thought hes going to rant and rave and i wont learn anything hundreds of thousands denning scowled at pittman again are you certain we havent met before yes pittman tried to assure himself that he didnt look the same as when he had first met denning he strained to hope that denning wouldnt make the connection denning brightened as the waiter set down their drinks cheers the three of them raised their glasses to that bastard eustace gable and the rest of them denning took a deep swallow of jack daniels he must have been drinking this hard for many years pittman thought otherwise as old as he is he wouldnt have a tolerance for this much alcohol you said they murdered hundreds of thousands of people in korea in vietnam to make themselves important they never cared about those countries they never cared about rebuilding europe after the war the marshall plan and all that they cared about themselves mccarthy hes rambling pittman thought in despair damn it we came all this way for nothing pittmans side ached from when hed injured it escaping from grollier academy his legs back and neck ached from having spent nearly twentyfour hours in the car he was tired and desperate and he wanted to lean across the table grab dennings suit coat and shake him until he made sense what about mccarthy jill asked you mean back in the early fifties joe mccarthy the anticommunist witchhunter thats how the bastards got me out of the state department they convinced everybody i was red were you denning laughed to himself yes what not cardcarrying a sympathizer pittman tried not to show his surprise seven years earlier denning hadnt given so much as a hint that the grand counselors might have been correct if id stayed on track if the grand counselors hadnt gotten rid of me if id managed to become secretary of state it was too late to do anything about korea but maybe i could have stopped vietnam hey so what if i thought the soviets had points in their favor did that make me a criminal i wasnt going to sell out our country but i could have done my damnedest to make sure we didnt nearly destroy ourselves because of vietnam pittman listened more intensely i had an older brother who died in vietnam then you know what im talking about spell it out pittman said the grand counselors based their careers on taking a hard line against communism after the second world war they helped formulate the marshall plan to rebuild europe but exclude the soviets and they helped formulate the truman doctrinethat america had an obligation to defend the world against the soviets of course i fought them on their antisoviet bias but i lost thats when they began thinking of me as an enemy in it was partly because of their urging that we sent troops into south korea to stop the north korean invasion to stop the spread of communism what was eventually called the domino theory never believed in it i didnt think we had any business being over there and history proves i was right we didnt make a difference so i fought them about going into korea and i lost then i fought them about several other issues to do with the soviets i didnt believe it was wise to bully the soviets with our atomic weapons capability for example i was sure it would lead to a deadly arms race i was right on that score as well but millgate and the others prevailed by theyd made everybody believe i was soft on communism i was out the heightening of the cold war during the fiftiesthey had plenty to do with that the vietnam warthey had even more to do with that because of them hundreds of thousands died and all the while they were in deep with the arms manufacturers they let their bank accounts determine foreign policy the accusation about kickbacks was the same one that denning had made seven years earlier it was what pittman had been investigating back then the reason he had gone to denning in the first place but denning hadnt been able to provide substantiation for the charges perhaps he could now im sure you already know this pittman said a little less than a week ago the night jonathan millgate was taken from the hospital someone leaked a secret justice department report that millgate was suspected of being involved in buying nuclear weapons from the former soviet union another illegal arms deal denning smiled bitterly you cant teach an old dog new tricks do you have anything that would prove your accusations not after the fire pittman shook his head in frustration unable to think of another way he decided to go directly to the primary question that hed come here to ask but the waiters sudden reappearance at their booth made him stop are you ready to hear about our specials for tonight the waiter asked didnt i tell you to wait awhile denning complained were not hungry yet very good sir the waiter said dourly and left pittman noticed that denning raised his cocktail glass then seemed to make a decision and set it down without drinking lets talk about another matter pittman said have you ever heard of someone named duncan kline denning studied him his elderly face developing lines of strain who duncan kline are you sure we havent met before denning asked unexpectedly pittman tried not to look worried quite sure then maybe its something in the news talking about millgate lloyd and the others makes me associate you with damn it pittman thought i was wrong he doesnt remember me from seven years ago i dont have to worry about that no what i have to worry about is something worse when millgate died denning would have devoured every speck of news on the subject needing to gloat he would have read and reread every story hes seen my photograph dozens of times but because im using a different name and i look different than i looked seven years ago he hasnt realized who i am but im afraid he will and whatll happen when he does i dont know how to explain it pittman said duncan kline jill interrupted obviously wanting to distract denning and get the conversation back where they wanted denning gave pittman one more puzzled look then turned to jill frowning in concentration i cant say the name is familiar perhaps if i had a context he was a teacher at grollier academy thats the prep school the grand counselors attended he was their main instructor ah denning said then the name is familiar no but odd what as i get older events from thirty and forty years ago can be vivid and yet i have trouble remembering things that happened last month forty years ago nineteen fiftytwo the summer july i remember so well because that was the turning point in my life the republicans had their convention that month eisenhower was nominated to run for president in fact he won the nomination on the first ballot eisenhower and nixon given the national mood it was obvious to me that eisenhower would defeat stevenson in the upcoming election evidently it was even more obvious to millgate and the others immediately after the convention they intensified their efforts to ingratiate themselves with those republicans who mattered its a measure of their ability to manipulate that they succeeded convincingly crossing the line from democrat to republican pittman noticed that dennings cheeks had become more flushed with agitation that a film of glistening sweat had formed on his upper lip denning picked up a glass not his whiskey glass but instead one filled with water he sipped quickly and continued july of was also the month in which they brought their campaign against me to its peak i was so thoroughly branded as a communist sympathizer that i became ineffectual as a diplomat denning squinted at pittman in selfdefense i spent most of my time keeping myself informed about everything millgate and the others did i had to be on the alert against their next offensive and thats when i noticed that something had made them slightly panicky a man had arrived at the state department near the end of july i never saw him but i was given a description of him a man with a deeply tanned face and a solid frame big shoulders an athletic appearance but a man who had gray hair and seemed to be in his sixties my informant told me that for all the signs that the man was physical and preferred the outdoors he had a refined almost effete manner a patrician pseudobritish accent he asked to see jonathan millgate well of course you dont just walk into the state department and expect to be allowed to see one of the deputy secretaries without an appointment the visitor gave his name and millgates assistant put it at the bottom of a long list in frustration the visitor then asked to see anthony lloyd same reaction with greater frustration the visitor asked to see eustace gable winston sloane victor standish all the grand counselors pittman said the same reaction in each case the visitors name was put at the end of a long list at that the visitor lost his patience stopped asking to see them and demanded to see them for a moment it appeared that a security officer would have to be summoned but instead millgate heard the commotion came out of his office and well according to my informant millgate turned pale his usual domineering manner disintegrated he immediately ushered the visitor into his office told his assistant to cancel his next appointment then sent for anthony lloyd and the rest of them most unusual i have never forgotten the incident it has puzzled me to this day ive always suspected that if i had understood the subtext of the event i would have had ammunition with which to defend myself was the visitors name duncan kline pittman asked i remember some things so vividly and unfortunately my memory for names the fire destroyed my records i dont recall then why would you have told us about this because i do recall managing to learn the visitors connection with millgate and the others he had been one of their teachers at their prep school then it was duncan kline jill said the big shoulders you mentioned kline was an expert rower its the kind of build that a rower would why is duncan kline so important to you denning frowned and wiped sweat from his upper lip someone else i interviewed mentioned him pittman said the implication is that there may have been a secret about kline that would have threatened the grand counselors reputations if it were known what type of secret dennings gaze was disturbing thats what were trying to find out were reasonably certain that as teenagers at grollier academy all the grand counselors were sexually molested by duncan kline denning slammed a hand on the table if id known that i might have been able to fight back to defend myself against them in what way jill asked how could being victims of a child molester have hurt their careers wouldnt it have made people feel compassion in the fifties take my word there wasnt a lot of compassion going around during the mccarthy period guilt by association but what if millgate and the others werent victims what if they consented in the political climate of the fifties they would have been dismissed from the state department at once denning breathed rapidly did you ever hear even a hint that no but theres someone who dennings hands shook someone pittman leaned forward i dont understand who what are you talking about nothing i meant there must be someone who could prove it denning spoke with effort are you feeling all right jill asked fine im fine denning swallowed deeply from his glass of water perhaps you can help us with something else pittman said apparently one of the last things jonathan millgate said was duncan the snow does the reference to snow make any sense to you none whatsoever even supposing that the incident was traumatic enough he paused for breath traumatic enough for millgate to refer to it when he was close to death are you sure you feel all right mr denning the teacher who showed up at the state department and startled millgate arrived in the summer not the winter the snow i have no idea what it means i wish i did anything to punish them the waiter reappeared at the booth for our specials tonight i dont have an appetite denning groped to stand i dont feel well jill hurried to stand allowing him to lurch from the booth all this excitement millgate then lloyd too much excitement too many questions do you need a doctor pittman asked quickly no can we give you a ride home no agitated denning wiped his face with a handkerchief im fine i can manage by myself he stumbled past the waiter almost bumped into another waiter carrying a tray of food then veered past crowded tables pittman and jill tried to go after him but a group being seated blocked their way for a moment past a woman in an evening dress pittman saw denning reach the front lobby then the group was out of the way and pittman and jill hurried toward the front exit on the busy sidewalk outside the restaurant amid the noise of traffic and the glare of headlights as well as streetlights pittman studied the pedestrians to his left then those to the right while jill studied the opposite side of the street what the hell was that about pittman asked i was hoping youd know he looked as if he might be ill but or maybe what he said was truethat the conversation overexcited him the thing is whats he going to do about it where was he going in such a rush come on lets split up and see if we can find him there they are a man said accusingly behind them when pittman turned he saw their waiter and the maitre d glowering at them from the restaurants open door we needed to see if our friend was all right pittman said the maitre d fumed this is what happens when i make an exception to our dress code we were coming back certainly but in case youre detained im sure you wont mind paying for your cocktails before you look for your friend jill run down to the corner on the right pittman said maybe youll see him on the next street if we get separated ill meet you at the car how much do we owe pittman quickly asked the maitre d four jack daniels a heineken and i dont need it itemized just tell me how much twentyeight dollars pittman shoved thirty dollars at the waiter seriously depleting their money supply and hurried in the opposite direction from jill wincing from cramps in his legs after having been in the car for so long at the corner to the left of the restaurant he gazed intensely toward pedestrians on the next street immediately he straightened at the sight of denning a quarter of the way along the block lurching from between parked cars to hail a taxi the elderly man looked more agitated as he got into the taxi blurting instructions to the driver before he closed the door pittman ran to try to reach the taxi but it pulled away and at once pittman raced back toward jill his cramped legs protesting i didnt see him jill was waiting where theyd parked the car across the street from the restaurant i did hurry get in pittman started the engine and steered impatiently from the curb narrowly missing a bmw a horn sounded behind him he ignored it and turned left reaching the street where hed seen denning get into the taxi where do you suppose hes going jill asked i dont know but this is a oneway street headed north denning wouldnt have waited until he was around the corner before he hailed a taxi unless he intended to go in this direction theres a good chance that the taxi is still on this street youve already passed two taxis how will you know which one is dennings i got the license number pittman kept driving i dont see damn it do you suppose we lost him there yes thats the taxi pittman immediately hung back keeping a reasonable distance between his car and the taxi so the driver wouldnt realize he was being followed fifteen seconds after he obeyed the speed limit a police car passed them its your lucky night jill said i wish i felt lucky where on earth is he going back to where he lives in the heart of georgetown no way he doesnt have enough money elegant town houses gave way to mansions pittman followed the taxi turning left onto a street paved with worn bricks streetcar tracks embedded in them the taxi stopped in front of one of the few mansions set back from the street the brightly lit building was on top of a slight hill and had a large landscaped yard its shrubs enclosed by a waisthigh wroughtiron fence denning got out of the taxi and hurried up concrete steps toward a spacious porch its pillars reminding pittman of a greek temple i wonder who lives here pittman said and why was he in such a rush to get here they watched denning knock repeatedly on the mansions front door a uniformed male servant opened it denning gestured talking insistently the servant turned to request instructions from someone inside then allowed denning to enter now what jill asked im tired of sitting in this damned car lets make a house call six the uniformed male servant opened the door in response to pittmans knock yes sir he was middleaged and somewhat portly so much unexpected activity evidently puzzled him a minute ago a man named bradford denning came here pittman said yes sir the servant looked more puzzled did he mention that he was expecting us no sir the servants brow developed deep furrows well were with him its important that we see him george a woman asked from inside who is it someone who claims to be with your visitor maam pittman peered inside toward a tall slender woman in her late fifties her hair was short and frosted she wore a scoopnecked designer dress made of silk the blue of which brought out the sparkle in her diamond earrings although attractive her features had the severe tightskinagainstprominentcheekbones look of someone whod had numerous facelifts the woman stepped forward her high heels clicking on the mirrorlike finish of the vestibules hardwood floor you know bradford we were supposed to have dinner with him tonight the last time we saw him he didnt look well jill said is he all right actually he looks dreadful the womans expression became tighter but he didnt mention anything about you pittman tried to remember the false names hed given to denning tell him its lester king and jennifer dont listen to them vivian denning appeared suddenly at a doorway on the left with a wrinkled handkerchief he continued to wipe glistening sweat off his face theyre reporters the womans gaze darkened her voice deepening with disapproval oh but were not here to make trouble jill said quickly were here to help how we suspect bradford denning came here to tell you what we spoke to him about earlier you might want to get the story directly from the source the womans severe face didnt develop lines of emotion instead suspicion and confusion were communicated by the rigid tilt of her head and the hardness of her gaze come in no vivian denning said the woman ignored him its all right come in thank you pittman said but if it turns out that you are here to make trouble ill have george summon the police the threat caused a further surge of adrenaline to roil pittmans stomach he fought not to show his concern as the servant shut the door behind them the woman led pittman and jill toward denning they went through the doorway on the left pittman had expected antiques and a colonial atmosphere on the contrary the large room was furnished in a glinting glassandchrome modern style abstract expressionist paintings hung on the walls splotches of colors communicating a welter of emotions pittman thought he recognized a jackson pollock may i offer you anything the woman asked no thank you jack daniels denning said bradford you reeked of alcohol when you arrived you know how i feel about overindulgence youve had enough denning continued to wipe his flushed glistening face since none of the rest of us wants anything why dont we sit down and discuss why the three of you came here yes pittman said id like to hear bradfords version of the conversation we had with him if thats all right with you mrs page the name meant nothing to pittman his lack of appreciation must have shown on his face mrs page is one of washingtons leading socialites denning said his boastful tone suggesting that he thought he gained stature by knowing her obviously our guests still dont recognize the name mrs page said or else they have the wisdom not to be impressed by society her lips formed a tight bitter smile but perhaps another name will be significant to them its the only reason bradford ever comes to see me so i assume that your visit has some connection with it im eustace gables daughter the womans announcement that she was a daughter of one of the grand counselors was so surprising that pittman inhaled sharply he sensed jill become tense beside him i didnt realize pittman said obviously but now that you know do you intend to continue the conversation thats up to you mrs page jill said some of what we need to talk about may be indelicate pittman frowned toward denning wondering why the man had felt compelled to come here was dennings claim to hate the grand counselors merely a ploy that allowed him to gain the confidence of their enemies was denning a spy for the grand counselors and the first person hed decided to report to was eustace gables daughter when it comes to my father mrs page said every subject is indelicate im not sure i follow you pittman said ill speak freely if you speak freely still confused pittman nodded i hate my father again pittman was caught off guard loathe him mrs page continued if it was in my power to hurt him truly and seriously hurt him destroy him i wouldnt hesitate for a second hes repugnant the ferocity in her eyes was appalling is that clear have i communicated my attitude perfectly i assume that what you and bradford spoke about tonight is something that he believes i can use as a weapon against my father mrs page said thats why i invited you in am i correct do you have biases as a reporter do you regard my father as an adversary pittman nodded again not sure whether he was being set up good mrs page turned to denning bradford im disappointed in you if you felt that these people could help me why did you tell me to turn them away did you want all the credit is that it after so many years are you still behaving as if youre in the state department denning fidgeted and didnt answer despite mrs pages earlier invitation to sit they had all remained standing now pittman eased down onto an unusuallooking chair that had severe angles and edges and was made from wood embedded in shiny metal it reminded him of experimental furniture that he had seen in new york at the museum of modern art unexpectedly he found that the chair was comfortable the others sat also how did pittman felt awkward not sure how to ask the question what made you speak directly my father taught me always to get to the point mrs page said bitterly why do i hate my father he killed my mother pittman was conscious of his heart beating since youve started tell them vivian denning said tell them everything mrs page narrowed her eyes and shook her head its not something that outsiders can regard with sympathy perhaps you see a house of this magnitudemy mothers was even more grandand you ask yourself how can anyone possibly be unhappy living in such luxury someone working on the assembly line at an automobile factory in detroit would be more than pleased to trade places but every circumstance has its unique liability my mother was beautiful she came from a traditional southern family that still remembered and retained affectations of genteel society from before the civil war in that world a woman wasnt meant to do anything my mother was taught that she gained her value simply by existing she was raised as if she were an orchid to be admired then she met my father on one of the last ocean cruises to europe before the outbreak of the second world war the surroundings were romantic she foolishly fell in love with him the match was approved they were married and to her surprise she discovered that she was indeed expected to do somethingto be perfect in every regard to give the most perfect dinner parties to provide the most perfect conversation to be perfectly dressed to create the most perfect impression mrs pages voice quavered she hesitated then continued again that hypothetical factory worker i mentioned wouldnt have any sympathy for a society woman who claimed to be suffering while living in splendor but what if that factory worker had a foreman who criticized every task he did day after day month after month year after year what if that foreman had a way of getting into the workers heart of making every insult feel like the cut of a knife the workers nerves would be affected his dignity would be wounded his spirit would be destroyed oh you might say that the worker would have the option of resigning and finding another job but what if that option wasnt available to him what if he had to endure that foremans abuse forever mrs page swallowed dryly my father is the cruelest man i have ever encountered his need to dominate was so excessive that he browbeat my mother at every opportunity he ridiculed he demeaned he degraded i grew up in constant terror of him nothing i could do was good enough for him and certainly nothing my mother could do was good enough i used to cry myself to sleep out of pity for my mother divorce for a career diplomat with immense ambitions in those days unthinkable my mother raised the subject only once and my fathers reaction so terrified her that she never mentioned it again mrs page thought for a long moment her perfectly poised shoulders weakened so my mother began to drink neither my father nor i realized that she had a problem with alcohol until her addiction was far advanced at the start she evidently did most of her drinking when my father was out of the house and i was at school she drank vodka so the alcohol would be less detectable on her breath a vicious cycle developed her drinking impaired her ability to strive for the perfect standards that my father required dinner parties werent organized to his satisfaction my mothers behavior became indifferent she no longer helped organize let alone appeared at required society charity events at diplomatic receptions she showed the boredom shed been hiding naturally my father criticized her the more he criticized the more she drank and that of course further affected her performance causing him to be more furious with her and in turn causing her to drink more eventually my mothers slurred speech gave her away in the days before the wives of public figures had the courage to admit their problems with alcohol and other substances this had the capacity to be a major scandal for a man of my fathers strict standards and boundless ambitions the situation was horrifying not because my mother had a problem but because she had given him a problem she couldnt be allowed to embarrass him and compromise his image the first thing he did was search the house and find every bottle that she had hidden the second thing he did was hire someone whose sole responsibility was to make sure that my mother didnt get near alcohol the tactics worked but they didnt achieve what my father intended my mother didnt return to her former ways and strive to match his image of perfection instead with no escape feeling even more repressed my mother had a nervous breakdown this was equally horrifying to my father if the diplomatic community discovered that his wife was emotionally and mentally unstable he feared that he would be tainted he worried that his colleagues would feel he was too distracted to perform his duties to the maximum his career would be ruined after my mother managed to break out of the house and caused what my father called a drunken scene at a nearby tavern he decided to remove her from washington in those days there wasnt any such thing as the betty ford clinic of course or its equivalentplaces where a problem could be dealt with openly and thoroughly but there were clinics of a different sort where problems that the wealthy had were treated with utmost discretion my mothers alcoholism the instability caused by her nervous breakdown these were addressed through drug therapysedatives it was felt that my mother needed a rest you see fatigue had to be the cause of her problems after all no woman with my mothers advantages of wealth and prestige could possibly be unhappy for three months as a consequence of the sedatives she was in a stupor little better than a sleepwalker she needed help to go to the bathroom she didnt recognize me when i came to visit when the clinic decided that the alcohol was fully out of her system gradually the sedatives were taken away she came home she seemed to be more satisfied then one day she disappeared after a frantic search the servants found my mother drunk collapsed mumbling next to the furnace in the basement after that my fathers attitude became quite different the excuse hed given washington society for my mothers threemonth absence her stay in the clinic was that she had been visiting relatives in europe now he concocted a different excuse this was during july of he rented a summer estate on cape hatteras he sent away all the servants he bought my mother several cases of vodka to this day i vividly remember the sneering tone with which he told her you want to avoid responsibilities you want to have a drink now and then here youre on vacation he poured her a drink poured her another and another when the supply of vodka diminished he bought more he made sure that her glass was always full if she appeared to be losing her taste for it he would berate and humiliate her until she again felt the urge to drink sometimes in the night i would hear noises and sneak from my room to discover that my mother was sprawled in the bathroom where she had vomited my father would be kneeling beside her calling her disgusting names pouring vodka down her throat when my father realized that i was noticing too much he arranged for me to visit his parents at their summer estate on marthas vineyard i hated to be near him but i was afraid for my mother and i begged not to go mrs page had been staring toward a violently colored abstract expressionist painting across from her all the while she spoke in a monotone her flat bleak voice communicating no hint of the intense turmoil that her eyes indicated she was feeling now she paused her normally rigid shoulders drooping as she turned her attention to pittman and jill i never saw my mother again she was dead by the end of the summer i was told that the medical examiners explanation for the cause of death was alcohol poisoning my father talked to me in detail about what had happened he tried to make me interpret what i had seen in such a way that his behavior was understandable your mother had a greater problem than you can imagine he said i encouraged her habit because i hoped that if she got sick enough she would stop drinking i made her drink after shed vomited in the hopes that she would associate nausea with alcohol my father hired an expert on alcoholism who claimed to have advised my father to try this approach the room became silent pittman spoke softly im very sorry mrs page didnt reply but theres something i dont understand pittman said and what is that if your father was afraid of scandal because of your mothers alcoholism if he tried to hide it initially why did he suddenly change his attitude and cause her death especially in that particular way that certainly would have attracted attention and caused a scandal my father is an immensely devious man he came to realize that if he made himself appear the victim he would gain his colleagues sympathy he told them that the problem had been going on for quite a while that he had done everything possible for her that his life had been a nightmare he pretended to be inconsolable distraught from the effort of having tried to control her all summer hed done everything possible he kept insisting and the diplomatic community believed him then in his greatest piece of hypocrisy he created the impression that with great pain he was overcoming his grief to devote himself to his profession each day his colleagues admired him for his strength his reputation grew he became ambassador to great britain and after that ambassador to the soviet union and eventually of course secretary of state but i know him for what he is he killed my mother and ill never forgive him because we both hated him vivian and i joined forces denning said in an effort to help her i managed to obtain a copy of the medical examiners report vivians father had lied to her the cause of death was alcohol poisoning in tandem with the use of seconal seconal jill straightened but thats a tranquilizer mrs page nodded the type of sedative that my mother was given while she was away for three months in the clinic wait a minute pittman said are you suggesting that your mother wasnt dying fast enough to suit your father so he helped her along by adding sleeping pills to the vodka that is correct mrs page tightened her lips either way its murder jill said but the second way using the sleeping pills might be easier to prove mrs page shook her head my father somehow discovered that id read the medical examiners report he anticipated my accusation and confessed that there was a secret he hadnt been able to bring himself to tell me he said that when my mother was in the clinic she had apparently stolen a container of the tranquilizers that she was being given the containerwith a label that indicated where she had obtained themwas discovered after her death the night she died she had swallowed so many of the seconal capsules that he had no other choice except to conclude she had committed suicide pittmans stomach soured you believe he was lying jill said what i believe makes no difference proof is what matters and there is no way to discount my fathers story i want to destroy him not throw my own integrity into question unless i have indisputable evidence he will simply use the reports from the mental hospital and the medical examiner to disparage my claims any further accusations i make wont be treated seriously i will have only one chance for most of my life i have struggled to find a way to punish him for what he did to my mother with no success and now as other grand counselorsshe said the words with contempthave died i am forced to consider the possibility that my father is old enough that he too might die before i succeed in punishing him denning stood thats why i came here tonight i may have found a way mrs page focused her intense gaze upon him theres a chance we can prove that your father and the others may have allowed their sexual orientation to compromise their work sexual orientation were they homosexuals it never occurred to me until my discussion with these reporters tonight did you ever have any suspicion that mrs page widened her eyes the sound that came from her throat made pittmans skin prickle at first he feared that mrs page was choking on something then as the sound became louder he recognized it for what it was laughter fullthroated contemptuous laughter bradford you are a fool is that what you rushed here to tell me even if my father had engaged in homosexual conduct what use would that be to me you keep behaving as if youre still in the state department in the late forties and early fifties socially those were the dark ages bradford these days only religious fanatics care if a person is a homosexual it seems as if celebrities are standing in line waiting to proclaim that they are gay diplomats arent celebrities bradford said indignantly of late some behave as if they are that isnt the point what one does in private is no longer a matter upon which ones reputation is judged its how one performs ones public duties that matters to accuse my father and the others of being homosexuals would serve no other purpose than to make me look bigoted its a distasteful pointless charge but what if their sexual orientation compromised them in some way denning insisted in the fifties it would have been a serious charge what if they were blackmailed by whom the soviets if so the attempt at extortion didnt work no diplomatic group was harder on the soviets than my father and his associates and on anyone suspected of being sympathetic to the soviets you above all should appreciate that dennings face became redder but even if i thought that it was a ruinous matter to accuse someone of being a homosexual mrs page said i wouldnt make that accusation against my father why not because my father is an asexual being in his prime he had no interest in sex of any kind my mother once confided to me that the only time theyd engaged in what my mother called the marital act was the night i was conceived im convinced that he was too worried about his career to risk taking on a mistressand given the repressive nature of the s and s he wouldnt have risked consorting with men his ambition was all he cared about that was his mistress henry kissinger said it best for all men like my father power is the ultimate aphrodisiac mrs page glared at pittman and jill surely you know how valueless it would be to attack my father on the basis of sexual conduct yes pittman said all the same theres something that makes him feel vulnerable we know the grand counselors have a secret that theyre prepared to do anything to keep hidden a secret about the prep school they went to grollier academy thats another matter i wanted to tell you vivian denning said its been suggested that one of their teachers made advances to them but this is the same subject we just dismissed mrs page said sharply it goes beyond that pittman said were not sure in what way but mrs page did you ever hear anything about a man named duncan kline jill asked duncan kline mrs page cocked her head searching her memory no i dont believe so he taught your father and their friends at grollier academy denning interrupted a man who was probably duncan kline showed up at the state department in the summer of your father and the others were shocked by his arrival they met him behind closed doors reacting as if to a grave situation what type of grave situation i dont know but i thought that you might mrs page concentrated tightening the alreadytight skin on her face not if its about grollier academy my father was extremely loyal to the school throughout his career he contributed generously to the alumni fund when did you say this man came to see my father the summer of that was an important year for my father i remember his mood well after eisenhower was nominated at the republican convention that summer my father was convinced that he would win against stevenson i already explained that to these reporters denning said mrs page glared let me finish my father and the others focused all of their energy on ingratiating themselves with eisenhowers people and then of course eisenhower won in november having declared their loyalty before eisenhowers victory my father and his friends had an advantage throughout november and december up to the inauguration in january they increased their attempts to impress eisenhower the tactic succeeded and made possible their various promotions within a few years the group controlled every major diplomatic position within the government it was the beginning of the myth about the grand counselors thats whygiven the importance of their need to impress eisenhower after the november electioni was surprised that they took time off to go to a december reunion at grollier academy its a measure of how much affection they felt for the school obviously if they were sexually molested there as students they wouldnt have wanted to go back unless they consented to duncan klines advances denning insisted bradford i refuse to hear any more of these sexual accusations mrs page said theyre a waste of time to consider my father is so skilled a diplomat that if anyone accused him of this type of activity at his prep school he would turn it to his advantage and make himself appear a victim of a molester hed attract sympathy not blame thats what we told bradford earlier tonight jill said but there is some kind of secret that the grand counselors are determined to go to any lengths to hide and it has something to do with that school any lengths to hide mrs page sounded pensive how do you know this jill hesitated pittman answered for her reliable sources weve interviewed who im not at liberty to reveal their names pittman said they spoke to us on condition of anonymity mrs page gestured in frustration then theyre useless to you and to me how can i add to what you know and how can it help me punish my father if i dont understand the connection that your sources have with him does the expression the snow mean anything to you pittman asked one of the last things jonathan millgate said was duncan the snow before he was murdered mrs page said pittman nodded waiting no mrs page said i havent the least idea what jonathan millgate would have been talking about she studied pittman jill and denning and thats all these are the important subjects that you came here to tell me this evening has been worthless millgate denning said unexpectedly they looked at him in surprise i beg your pardon mrs page said millgate denning stared at pittman you mentioned jonathan millgate bradford have you lost your senses mrs page asked denning suddenly pointed at pittman now i remember where ive seen you before pittman felt a chill your name isnt lester king or whatever you said it was its matthew pittman i met you several years ago ive seen your photograph a dozen times in the newspaper but you had a mustache andyoure the man the police want for killing jonathan millgate bradford this is outrageous do you realize what youre saying mrs page demanded im telling you this is the man denning said do you have a newspaper ill prove it to you ill show you the photographs this man killed jonathan millgate dont be absurd pittman said if i killed him what would i be doing here the door opened the uniformed servant appeared his brow deeply furrowed mrs page i heard loud voices is anything wrong george phone the police denning said the police sir george looked puzzled glancing toward mrs page for an explanation bradford what do you think youre doing mrs page demanded hurry before he kills all of us pittman stood making denning cower bradford id stop drinking if i were you it affects your behavior and your judgment he turned to mrs page i regret that this happened were sorry for the inconvenience thanks for agreeing to talk with us jill stood as well we appreciate your time pittman shifted toward the doorway with bradford in this condition obviously its pointless for us to continue this conversation mrs page looked bewildered good evening pittman said and thanks again call the police george denning insisted before they get away no mrs page said i dont understand this at all bradford what on earth has gotten into you pittman and jill passed the servant left the room crossed the shiny hardwood floor of the vestibule and opened the door to the porch its pillars casting shadows from lights among shrubs wed better hurry jill said in the cool night air she and pittman started down the brick steps from the porch about to reach the murky area beyond the lights on the lawn when pittman faltered touching jills arm more trouble jill tensed seeing what he meant our car it was parked in front of the mansion revealed by streetlights two ruggedlooking men in windbreakers were staring at the front license plate on the duster pittman backed up they must have been watching the house why would they jill retreated quickly up the steps toward the porch at once she realized eustace gable knows his daughter is a threat he must have arranged for the house to be watched in case we came here and the vermont license plates on our car pittman said theyre probably the only ones on the street they connect us with our visit to grollier academy as pittman and jill hurried toward the mansions front door one of the men shouted hey pittman turned seeing the man point at him simultaneously pittman saw a dark oldsmobile appear beyond the cars parked in front of the house it skidded to a stop men scrambled out pittman gripped the doorknob praying that the servant hadnt locked the door after theyd left exhaling with relief when he made the knob turn he shoved the door open lunged inside behind jill slammed the door and locked it the noise caused startled voices in the room to the left as pittman swung toward that doorway the servant loomed into view mrs page and denning behind him what are you doing mrs page asked why did you come back im afraid we brought you trouble pittman said there isnt time to explain we have to figure out how to six of them jill stared past the lace curtain of a high narrow window next to the front door six mrs page veered past denning and the servant i dont know what youre theyre coming up the sidewalk jill said pittman stepped closer to mrs page youre in danger whats in back how do we get out of here danger dennings voice shook theyre separating jill strained to look out the window two in front two going along each side of the house mrs page those men are from your father pittman said my the two in front just pulled out handguns jill said mrs page i think they intend to kill all of us pittman said theyll make it look as if i did it kill us mrs page looked horrorstricken why because your fathers afraid of what you might have told me we have to get out of here some of them will go to the back jill said theyve got the house sealed off my father would never try to kill me he killed your mother didnt he why wouldnt he kill you mrs pages eyes widened with shocked understanding the two in front are coming toward the porch jill said pittman turned to the servant did you do what denning wanted and call the police no mrs page told me not to then youd better call them now there isnt time denning whined the police wont get here before glass shattered at the back of the house denning whirled toward the sound pittman reached beneath his sport coat and pulled out the the sight of which made dennings face become the color of cement from the porch someone tried to turn the doorknob jill pittman warned get back she hurried toward pittman as he told the servant switch off the lights in the hallway the vestibule became dim illuminated only by lamps in the room that they had left more glass shattered at the back of the house jill if anybody tries to come through that door do you think you can use the gun in your purse im so scared but can you yes if i have to good pittman rushed from the vestibule toward the rear of the house find a place to hide he heard jill saying the car mrs page said at the rear of the house pittman crouched in shadows clutching his concentrating to hear the sounds of someone climbing through a window yes the car denning said from the porch shoulders slammed against the front door the car forget it jill said some of those men are outside in the back theyll shoot us if we try to get to the garage you dont understand mrs page said its in the basement shoulders kept slamming against the front door what are you talking about the basement jill sounded hoarse her throat dry from fear whats a car doing in the basement what good would from a room at the back of the house pittman heard footsteps scraping on broken glass he clutched his pistol tighter aiming the garage is down there mrs page said the garage is under the house if we get to the car well be safe no jill said well be trapped if we try to drive away theyll shoot through the windows and doors and why must you be so stupid listen to me listen to what im telling you pittman heard mrs pages highheeled shoes on the vestibules hardwood floor a door opened echoing stop jill said down here mrs page insisted im going with you denning said a mans footsteps scurried across the vestibule joining the urgent rapping sound of highheeled shoes descending stairs wait for me the servant quickly followed matt jill shouted from the back of the mansion pittman heard other footsteps scraping on broken glass a shadow moved pittman fired his ears ringing from thes fierce blast the recoil threw him off balance from the darkness at the back of the house he saw what seemed to be a spark simultaneously he felt more than heard a bullet strike the wall next to him for a frenzied moment he feared that the blast from his had deafened him in a greater frenzy he realized that he hadnt heard the shot from the back of the house because the gunman had used a silencer the ringing in pittmans ears had obscured the muffled spit he fired again squirming backward flinching from the impact of four soundless bullets striking the wall where hed been crouching matt jill screamed we dont have a chance pittman thought scurrying faster backward we cant possibly kill all six of them jill come on where the basement as jill rushed past him hurrying down the stairs that the others had used pittman fired once more toward the back of the house spun and fired toward the front door then charged into the stairwell and slammed the door shut not that the closed door would do him any good he suddenly realized it did have a lock but the knob for the bolt was on the opposite side he couldnt possibly keep the gunmen from coming through fear made him nauseous lights in the stairwell revealed stone steps that led to a concrete floor jill had already reached the bottom pittman backed down aiming toward the closed door he saw the knob being turned and fired his ears ringing worse as the powerful bullet splintered the door walloping through a man on the other side screaming the two men at the front door had been a diversion pittman thought they had pounded on the door to drive everyone toward the back of the house where the men whod broken in waited with silenced pistols the slight commotion at the front probably hadnt attracted much attention from the street the silenced pistols couldnt be heard outside the mansion no one knows whats happening in here pittman thought the servant was supposed to have phoned the police but pittman hadnt seen him do it had the servant been distracted by fear nobody realizes we need help were trapped down here the only way someone outside can know were in danger is the blast from pittmans that could be heard outside as he continued to stare up toward the door to the basement he saw the knob being turned and he fired again his ears suffering from the pistols torturous blast the confines of the basement magnifying the roar someone outside is bound to hear pittman told himself although the ringing in his ears was excruciating he prepared to fire yet again but suddenly a warning instinct told him that he was almost out of ammunition how many times had he fired he strained to remember six he had only one round left if they try to rush us jill he thought she hasnt fired yet her pistols still fully loaded he spun toward her wanting to trade weapons and froze in surprise at the sight of the car in the basement its length and height were totally unexpected it was a silver rollsroyce its paint and chrome gleaming from obvious daily care someone had backed it in a pulley in the ceiling led to a garage door that could be raised electronically pittmans surprise was offset by dismay when he saw how panicked mrs page denning and the servant were they had scurried into the car slamming the doors evidently locking them jill was straining to open the drivers door while mrs page struggled to shove a key into the cars ignition switch mrs page unlock the door let me in jills shout was muffled by the ringing in pittmans ears pittman redirected his attention toward the door at the top of the stairs again the knob turned again he fired the ejection slide on top of his pistol stayed back indicating that the weapon was empty no he shoved the into his coat pocket and ran toward jill i need your gun she was so preoccupied pounding on the drivers door trying to get into the rollsroyce that she didnt seem to notice when pittman took the pistol it held more ammunition than the as a consequence pittman felt briefly confident but then he realized that he was still trapped if mrs page started the car opened the automatic garage door and sped away it wasnt possible for jill and himself to defend themselves against six gunmen the door at the top of the stairs opened slightly pittman fired the recoil from the mm less violent than that from the it was obvious what the gunmen were doingholding back staying on either side of the door taunting pittman by moving it trying to entice him into wasting all his ammunition sickeningly his heartbeat surged as he wondered why the police hadnt arrived surely a neighbor must have heard the shots and phoned for help why were the police taking so long jill kept pounding on the drivers door let me in abruptly mrs page pushed a button that caused the locks to disengage making a thunking sound she opened the door i cant get the car to start my father owns one of these let me try move over jill shoved at her squirming behind the steering wheel pittman ran to the car and saw that denning was scrunched next to mrs page and jill he yanked opened the passenger door dragged denning out and shoved him into the backseat with the servant as pittman dove into the back with them he yelled to jill lets get the hell out of here jill slammed her door and turned the ignition key it doesnt work try again it doesnt want to turn all the way pittman scurried from the car and aimed toward the stairs hurry the key jill said this isnt the right key hands shaking she sorted through other keys on a ring even with his protesting ears pittman heard sounds on the stairs shadows then shoes came rapidly into view he fired splinters from concrete spattered the shoes the gunmen scrambled back out of sight jill shouted got it the rollsroyces engine roared hurry pittman fired once more at the stairs and dove back into the car lock all the doors jill pressed a button that engaged the locks she pressed another button with a rumble the garage door began to rise pittman glanced in dismay through the cars rear window the gunmen were charging down the stairs theyll shoot out the windows pittman yelled stay down they cant mrs page shouted a bullet struck the rear window ricocheting my husband was afraid of terrorists what jill revved the rollsroyce speeding forward as the garage door rose above the hood with a crunch the cars roof struck the rising garage door but the rolls kept hurtling from the garage it soared up an incline and jounced down onto ground level through the windshield pittman saw three of the gunmen crouched in a shadowy lane behind the house they were waiting aiming toward the car he couldnt hear the shots from their silenced weapons but the upward jerk of the pistols showed that the gunmen were firing bullets struck and deflected off the hood and the windshield what the the windows are bulletproof mrs page said the whole car is thats what ive been trying to tell you jill swerved increasing speed veering past the gunmen who now fired at the side of the car pittman felt the vibrating impact of the eerily muffled bullets hitting the rolls jill struggled with the steering wheel this thing handles like its a tank at the time i thought my late husband was insane to want an armored car a gunman appeared ahead of them firing directly at the windshield diving for cover as jill sped past she swerved from the narrow treelined lane and reached the side of the house aiming the rolls along the brick driveway toward the street there hadnt been time to turn on the headlights but the glare of lights in the shubbery at the front combined with the glow of streetlights showing that the dark oldsmobile the gunmen had arrived in was parked directly in front of the exit from the driveway there wasnt any way past it other cars were parked everywhere along the curb preventing the rolls from veering off the driveway across the sidewalk and onto the street brace yourselves jill tightened her grip on the steering wheel directing the rolls toward the front fender of the oldsmobile blocking the driveway i hope this is a tank in the backseat preparing himself for the collision pittman felt the rolls increase speed the oldsmobile grew alarmingly seeming to fill the windshield the rolls struck it with such force that the oldsmobile jerked sideways pittman felt as if his chest had been punched his head snapped back next to him denning slammed onto the floor as the rolls kept heaving forward ramming the oldsmobile farther sideways the servant groaned in the front seat mrs page shoved her hands against the dashboard to absorb the shock even though pittmans ears kept ringing he couldnt help hearing the crunch of metal and the crash of glass the oldsmobile had been jolted sufficiently sideways that the rolls slammed past it scraping an infiniti parked at the curb but hurtling forward reaching the street and streaking across it jill stamped the brake pedal but the heavily armored car barely slowed jill swung the steering wheel to avoid the cars parked on the opposite side of the street but the rollsnever meant to be so heavyresponded sluggishly one of the cars across the street seemed suddenly huge the rolls struck it more glass shattering metal crumbling the rolls rebounded its distinctive winged woman hood ornament and thickly slatted shiny grill falling onto the pavement from the backseat jolted by the two collisions pittman watched jill in dismay as she tugged the cars gearshift into reverse and stared behind her working the steering wheel she tried to maneuver the car so that it wasnt positioned diagonally across the street blocking both lanes too late pittman was suddenly knocked sideways by the jolt of another collision a car coming along the street hadnt been able to stop in time to avoid hitting the rolls headlights glaring a car coming in the opposite direction squealed to a stop before it struck the other side of the rolls no pittman thought were boxed in drivers got out of the cars alarmed by the din of the multiple collisions men and women hurried out of houses on both sides of the street pedestrians watched in shock the sidewalks became rapidly crowded horns blaring cars lined up in each direction blocked by the accidents what are we going to do denning whimpered one things sure were not going anywhere in the rolls jill said get out of the car pittman said theyll shoot us the servant said we cant stay here hurry everybody out pittman helped denning rise from where hed been thrown to the floor are you all right mrs page what about you pittman shoved his door open mrs page i asked if youre all right stunned slumped in the front seat mrs page groaned jill leaned over examining her outside the car pittman rushed forward and opened the passenger door how is she the drivers of the cars that blocked the rolls crowded toward pittman what the hell did you think you were doing a man yelled you came out of nowhere shes shaken up jill said but i dont see any bleeding we have to get away from here denning wailed pittman spun to study the driveway next to the mansion past the commotion of numerous onlookers he saw solemnfaced men wearing windbreakers running down the shadowy driveway dispersing into the crowd jesus buddy a bystander said stumbling back in terror pointing toward pittmans right hand pittman didnt understand why the man behaved as he did then squinting down at his right hand pittman saw that he still clutched the pistol he had taken from jill the panicked man whod seen the pistol bumped against the driver of one of the cars that had struck the rolls now the driver too saw the pistol and reacted the way the first man had stumbling to get away jesus hes got a gun somebody yelled a woman screamed the crowd around pittman bumped into one another in a frenzied effort to get away from the gun pittman kept darting his gaze past them toward the driveway and sidewalk at mrs pages mansion the solemnfaced men wearing windbreakers were no longer in view he scanned the panicked bystanders afraid that the gunmen might be using them for cover stalking nearer shes all right jill said abruptly behind him pittman spun seeing mrs page next to jill lets get out of here denning yelled the duster pittman ran toward the front of the mansion where he had parked it he pulled out his car keys and unlocked the drivers door frantically opened it then pulled the passenger seat forward wishing that the duster had four doors denning scurried into the front jill and the servant helped mrs page into the back throwing pittmans gym bag and jills suitcase onto the floor pittman pushed the passenger seat back into place hurried behind the steering wheel slammed his door started the car and sped away from the curb in the opposite lane ten cars were backed up headlights gleaming drivers and passengers leaning out in confusion but pittmans lane was completely empty the rolls and the car that had hit it blocking traffic behind him stay down pittman yelled to jill and the others if those gunmen are still in the area he sped through a murky intersection steered sharply to avoid a pedestrian shuddered and turned on his headlights in the sudden glare flatfaced brick town houses with cars parked along curbs were a blur on either side of the duster we got lucky denning blurted the crowd scared them away maybe pittman said what do you mean maybe denning peered behind him i dont see any headlights no ones following us i agree with you i think we got away pittman said at least for now what i meant was im not sure they were scared by the crowd denning shook his head in confusion i have a hunch that if it suited their purposes pittman said theyd have shot us right there in the street in the dark and the panic whod be able to identify them then why didnt they tires protesting pittman swerved the duster around a corner speeding south on thirtyfourth street slow down he warned himself you cant let the police stop you sweating he reduced speed and blended with traffic you didnt answer my question denning complained if you dont think they were frightened by the crowd why didnt they shoot us when we got out of the rolls what do you mean it didnt suit their purpose the idea wasnt just to kill us all pittman said youre right i am matthew pittman the police want me for murdering jonathan millgate but i swear to you i didnt do anything to him if anything i was trying to help him pittman explained what had happened at the scarsdale estate ive been on the run ever since what millgate told me is dangerous enough to all of them that theyre desperate to kill me before i figure out what it means driving pittman stared nervously ahead seeing the lights and traffic of pennsylvania avenue to prevent me from finding out they also killed several people i went to for information they made it look as if i had killed those people thats why the newspapers create the impression im on a homicidal rampage but i havent killed anyone no thats wrong i have to be totally honest with you god help me i did kill i had to defend myself against a man in my apartment against a man who tried to shoot me on a street in manhattan and against a man who threatened jill in her apartment thats my real name jill told mrs page those men think i know something too but the rest of us mrs page said why would they want to those men work for your father and presumably the other grand counselors pittman said he reached pennsylvania avenue and turned to the right onto brightly lit m street traffic was dense your father knows how much you hate him he knows you want to destroy him youre a logical person for us to go to and ask for help denning objected you werent aware of her if it hadnt been for me but eustace gable doesnt know that pittman said what he does know is that im a former reporter he might have been afraid that id use my sources to learn about mrs page and go to herwhich is exactly what happened tonight my guess is he had a man watching the house in case we showed up when we did the man telephoned for help ahead pittman saw the gleaming lights of francis scott key bridge and steered left onto it following traffic across the potomac into virginia im supposed to be on a killing spree some kind of vendetta against the grand counselors theyd have made it seem that id killed you why would i have done it who knows the authorities think im insane after all maybe because i couldnt find eustace gable i vented my rage on his daughter but eustace gable was worried about his daughter he sent men to see if she was safe they caught me after id killed her shots were exchanged jill and i didnt survive end of story end of the threat to the grand counselors and with no one to prove otherwise the police would have gone along with that explanation the police mrs page said we have to go to the police you can pittman said i think theyll listen to you with your money and prestige theyll do their best to protect you but your father will do everything in his power to discredit you to make people think youre insane which is more acceptable to the authorities that im a maniac or that your distinguished father was so determined to keep a secret that he didnt care if his daughter was killed my distinguished father mrs page said with disgust and theres always a risk that your father will arrange to have an accident happen to you while youre in protective custody pittman said seven years ago jonathan millgate arranged to have the boston police arrest me for suspicion of burglary while i was investigating him two men working for him broke my jaw while i was in jail thats why we havent given ourselves up jill said if matt surrenders to the police and tries to tell his story he doesnt think hell be safe he wont be believed the evidence is against me my chances are a whole lot better if i stay free and do what i can to prove im innocent how mrs page asked ive been thinking about that but i cant do it alone will you help tell me what you need im still figuring out all the details but i know this much right now at your house people saw the gun in my hand they saw us put you in our car theyll almost certainly have seen our vermont license plates what happened can be interpreted as a kidnapping the police will be looking for us and theyll be counting on our vermont license plates to make it easy for them across the potomac opposite washington pittman drove along fort myer drive in rosslyn virginia i need to find a nice big bar with a crowded parking lot yes denning said i could use a stiff drink thats not exactly what i had in mind pittman said i want to steal somebodys virginia license plates after theyre on were going to a pay phone i want you to call your father mrs page there are several things i want you to say to him but i dont have his private number he refuses to give it to me no problem ive got the number pittman said you do how someone i once interviewed gave it to me the phone booth was outside a brightly lit convenience store pittman parked with other cars in front and as people went in and out of the store he remained in the duster coaching mrs page on what he wanted her to say can you remember all that do you think you can do it im going to enjoy this mrs page answered grimly the tautness of her face emphasized by shadows in the car its exactly what i want to say to him i hope im not misleading you you understand that this can put you in danger im already in danger i need to protect myself but i dont see why we have to use a pay phone why cant we rent a hotel room and use its phone wed be more comfortable if your fathers as obsessed about security as i think he is hell have equipment to trace the phone calls he receives its not that hard to do anymore look at caller id it can be done instantly pittman said in that case hed send men to the hotel our room would be a trap of course mrs page said i should have thought but you thought of it denning told pittman pittman rubbed his brow troubled the precaution just seemed obvious to me he was beginning to realize that he had a talent for being on the run his head throbbed as he wondered what else he didnt know about himself jill came back from the store handing pittman coins from a fivedollar bill that she had changed well soon be out of cash i know thanks for the coins he pointed whats in the paper bag coffee and doughnuts for everybody youll never eat right again i just hope i get the chance to try pittman touched her hand then turned to mrs page so what do you think are you ready good lets do it he escorted mrs page to the phone booth which was situated where they wouldnt be disturbed a distance from the stores entrance he pulled out a sheet of paper with the list of telephone numbers that hed gotten from brian botulfsons computer after putting coins into the box he pressed the buttons for eustace gables home and handed mrs page the telephone she stood in the booth and glared through the glass wall before her as if she was seeing her father in a moment she said eustace gable oh in this case i think hell want to be disturbed tell him its his loving daughter mrs page tapped her pointed fingernails impatiently against the glass of the phone booth well hello father dear i knew youd be concerned so i thought id call to tell you that in spite of the goons who came to my house im safe she laughed bitterly what goons the ones you hired to kill me of course stop dont insult my intelligence do you actually expect me to believe your denials i know ive disappointed you in a number of ways not the least of which is that im not perfect but you can take pride in this you did not raise an idiot i know whats happening father and im going to do everything in my power to guarantee that youre stopped what am i talking about duncan kline father whats the matter all of a sudden you dont seem to have anything to say when i was young you always interrupted everything i tried to tell you now youre finally listening my my duncan kline father grollier academy the snow you murdered jonathan millgate to keep it a secret but im going to let your secret out and damn you i hope you spend the rest of your life suffering for what you did to mother mrs page set the telephone on its receptacle stared at it exhaled and turned to pittman that was extremely satisfying youll have plenty of other chances i want to put pressure on your father on all of them pittman said but right now we need to get back to the car and drive out of this areain case your father did trace the call twenty seconds later pittman watched the lights of the convenience store recede in his rearview mirror well drive for a couple of miles then use another pay phone right now its my turn to make a call jill said to winston sloane i cant wait it feels so good to be confronting them at last it was pittmans turn he stopped the car at a phone booth on the edge of a shopping malls deserted parking lot in fairfax virginia standing in the booths light he studied the list of phone numbers put coins in the box and pressed numbers the phone on the other end rang only once before a man answered his deep voice somewhat strained standish residence i need to speak to him the voice hesitated whos calling please just put him on im certain hes still awake because im certain he just received calls from eustace gable or winston sloane probably both of them how do you know that sir it wasnt the type of question that pittman expected a servant to ask just as the voice had hesitated a short while earlier now pittman hesitated his plan depended in part on the likelihood that the grand counselors would feel pressured by the phone calls that they would contact one another and feel even more pressure when they learned that each had been called in a similar manner but by different people the message to them was clear you failed to keep your secret more and more people know what you did in the past and what youve done to hide it with luck the grand counselors would overreact make mistakes and the deep strained voice interrupted pittmans thoughts sir are you still there i asked how did you know that mr standish received telephone calls from eustace gable and winston sloane because i want to talk to him about the same matter they wanted to talk to him about pittman said and what is that the voice sounded more strained look im tired of this tell him duncan kline grollier academy tell him he can talk to me about it or he can talk to the police im afraid i dont understand duncan kline grollier academy in the background on the other end of the line pittman heard other voices the sound of people moving around what the hells going on pittman thought who am i speaking to the voice insisted i get the feeling youre not a servant mr standish wont speak with you unless he knows whos calling if i could have your name in the background pittman heard a man call out lieutenant youre with the police pittman said the police sir what makes you think that all i need is your name and ill ask mr standish if damn it whats happened nothing sir of course thats why youre having a police convention at his house just a few guests stop the bullshit i assume youre trying to trace this call dont bother im going to hang up if you dont answer my questions whats happened im afraid theres been an accident the voice on the phone said victor standish is dead jill leaned forward startled as pittman drove quickly from the pay phone in the shopping malls deserted parking lot how mrs page asked in astonishment the policeman wouldnt say pittman merged with traffic on old lee highway im surprised he told me even that much obviously he hoped to keep me on the line until he had the number i was calling from and could send a cruiser there behind him pittman heard a fastapproaching siren he peered tensely toward his rearview mirror and saw the flashing lights of a police car speeding through the glare of traffic maybe i didnt hang up soon enough the cruiser switched lanes taking advantage of a break in traffic increasing speed unexpectedly it veered off the highway pittmans cramped hands were sweaty slicking the steering wheel i think ive had enough adrenaline for one night im glad to hear im not the only one who feels exhausted mrs page said i could use a chance to lie down isnt it wonderful denning exclaimed what three dead two to go denning said gleefully theyre dropping like flies vivian its everything i dreamed of theyre finally getting what they deserve stop he blurted to pittman we have to find another pay phone pittman didnt know how to respond to dennings outburst do what i tell you denning insisted there at that service station quickly pull over puzzled compelled by dennings emotion pittman obeyed he stopped the duster next to the air pump at the side of the gas station confused he stood with the others next to the phone booth as denning made his call answering your own phone these days are you eustace feeling that nervous are you an old enemy im calling to tell you how pleased i am to hear that victor standish died tonight thrilled ecstatic the bastard deserved it so do you its enough to make me believe in god tell me eustace do you suppose victors death had anything to do with your secret when people learn about duncan kline youll be ruined youll die in disgrace ill dance on your grave you son of a bitch denning slammed down the phone his eyes fierce his frenzied expression made stark by the harsh fluorescent lights that glared from the gas stations large window the attendant came out wiping grease from his hands need some gas pittman was so gripped by the hateful expression on dennings face that it took him a moment to respond to the attendant no we just needed to use the phone your friend doesnt look well youre right pittman said he doesnt pittman was alarmed by dennings sudden pallor need some rest dennings knees bent pittman grabbed him too much has been happening denning said need to lie down oh god should i call an ambulance the attendant asked no pittmans urgent thoughts were complicated he wanted to make sure that denning was all right at the same time he needed to get away from the gas station in case gable had managed a trace on dennings call and sent men here my friends a nurse well get him into the car shell check him if i have to ill take him to a doctor they rushed to put denning into the backseat the next thing pittman was behind the steering wheel he slammed the door started the duster and steered back into traffic how is he in the backseat jill was examining him his pulse is rapid but weak unsteady what does that mean is he having a heart attack i dont know he says he isnt having sharp pains in his chest or down his left arm its more like a hand on his chest sounds like angina if i had some instruments a bloodpressure cuff i could i dont think you should take any chances get him to a hospital they sat in the emergency waiting room squinting from the stark reflection of strong lights off white walls pittman squirmed on a metal chair his bruised side aching his legs continuing to feel stiff from having spent so much time in the car next to him mrs page looked considerably older her taut face almost skeletal from fatigue pittman scanned the haggard faces of other people waiting for word about patients it occurred to him that under different circumstances being in a hospital would have intensified his preoccupation with jeremys death but now so much had happened there was so much for him to brood about jeremy was only part of the welter of thoughts and feelings that he endured he was amazed that he did not see this as a betrayal of jeremy if jeremy wasnt constantly in his thoughts that had nothing to do with a reduction of love for his dead son he realized rather it meant that he knew he couldnt grieve if he was dead in contrast with his morass of despair a week ago he understood that his primary responsibility was to remain aliveto keep jeremys memory alive to continue loving him he had to do everything to survive jill was coming through a swinging door beside the nurses station her jeans and sweater looked rumpled her blue eyes were glazed with weariness as she tugged fingers through her long blond hair and came over any news pittman asked theyre still doing tests but so far it doesnt look as if he had a coronary jill slumped in the chair beside him for the moment the theory is exhaustion the doctor wants to keep him overnight for observation hell be safe here no one will think to look for him in a fairfax hospital provided he keeps his mouth shut oh i think he feels helpless enough that he wont want to make more phone calls he wont advertise where he is mrs page roused herself her voice dry but hes not the only one whos exhausted she turned to her servant george youve been good to stay with me i think however that its time you looked after yourself you need to rest your family will be wondering where you are call them and reassure them then go home george hesitated do you think thats wise maam to go home the men looking for you might be watching where i live they might interrogate me to find out where you are but you wont know where ive gone mrs page said george has a point pittman said even if he doesnt know where you are theyd still have to torture him to find that out hed be in danger the same as the rest of us id like to come along maam from the looks of things you need my help more than ever the holiday inn was west of fairfax off route pittman chose it because it was close to where the two remaining grand counselors had their estates for a moment hed been confused about how he was going to pay for the rooms he and jill had very little money left he couldnt use his or jills credit card similarly the group couldnt use mrs pagesher name was familiar in the washington area and was almost certain to attract attention the police and eustace gable would have alerted the credit card companies stressing that they needed to be informed if and where anyone used her card the difficulty had appeared insurmountable until pittman realized that the one person most likely to be invisible was mrs pages servant it would take the police and the remaining grand counselors quite a while to discover georges name in the meantime the group absolutely needed to rest they waited in the shadows of a parking lot while george went into the motels brightly lit lobby and made the arrangements the rooms were on the outside on the second floor in back and after pittman trudged up a flight of concrete steps an arm around jill he turned to mrs page and george it isnt a good idea to be in one place too long we ought to be out of here by seven tomorrow morning mrs page looked surprised by the schedule obviously not used to getting up that early but she didnt say a word only braced her shoulders and nodded remember we cant make any phone calls from here pittman said this time both george and mrs page nodded sleep well pittman added how i wish mrs page said after watching george and mrs page go into their rooms pittman unlocked the one he and jill had requested they carried in the gym bag and suitcase set them on the carpeted floor then shut and locked the door not bothering to examine the clean and functional room instead they turned to each other studied each others weary features and tenderly embraced they held each other for what seemed a long time as tired as he was pittman felt as if he could stand and hold jill all night long but then his knees became unsteady taking jills hand he sat with her on the side of the bed the worst part is that im actually beginning to think we can get out of this he said to hope the last time i hoped for something really hoped with all my heart it didnt work out jill stroked the side of his face well get out of this itll happen well make it happen sure but pittmans tone was less than positive he kissed her softly on the cheek then stood and removed his sport coat his which he hadnt had time to reload was in his gym bag but the mm that he had taken from jill was wedged behind his belt at his spine with relief he pulled it free and set it on the counter that supported the television his back hurt from where the sharp edges of the weapon had pressed into his skin jill pointed toward the television maybe we should have a look at cnn there might be some news about what happened to victor standish good idea pittman turned on the set inspected a list of television stations that was taped to the top and used the remote control to switch to cnn he watched thirty seconds of a story about a child being rescued from a well that boy looks as dirty as i feel jill said how would you like to use the shower first you certainly know the right things to say after briefly rubbing pittmans back jill took some things from her suitcase and went into the bathroom pittman listened to the scrape of shower curtain hooks the spray of water into the hollowsounding tub he took his and its box of ammunition from his gym bag returned to the bed and reloaded the pistol continuing to watch cnn an announcer summarized the days stock market activity a commercial followed then there was a story about a seventyyearold woman who was getting a phd in political science humaninterest stuff pittman told himself glancing at his watch almost midnight the hard news wont come on until the top of the hour he took off his shoes and kneaded his stockinged feet against the carpet feeling his rigid soles begin to relax he must have dozed off the next thing he knew he was on his back on the bed and jill was gently nudging him uh sorry to wake you jill tightened the towel wrapped around her but i think youll be a lot happier if you shower before you go to sleep if i dont fall asleep under the water and drown for the first time in a long while jills blue eyes twinkled want some help its a tempting offer but i bet wed slip in the tub and crack our heads you sure are having visions of doom wonder why pittman mustered the energy to stand grabbed his gym bag and went into the bathroom he tried to remember the last time hed been clean the sharp hot water lancing at him was exquisite shampooing his hair he felt as if he could never equal this luxury for a moment he remembered how he had hated the comfort of a shower after jeremys death exhausted he shut out the thought allowing the shower to relax him at last after hed toweled himself until his skin felt pleasantly irritated he brushed his teeth wrapped the remaining dry towel around him and stepped out of the bathroom after the steam in the bathroom the comparatively cool air of the bedroom made his bare chest tingle unexpectedly selfconsciousness replaced his weariness he was suddenly very aware that the room had only one bed that jill was sitting up in it pillows propped behind her covers pulled up to her bare shoulders and that she looked selfconscious also her gaze flicked nervously from him to the droning television set anything on the news pittman tried to sound casual she shook her head nothing about standish nothing about us no pittman approached the bed and jill visibly tensed are you okay fine she stared at the television youre sure why wouldnt i be fine pittman sat on his side of the bed hey come on talk to me i if we cant be honest with each other i guarantee well never survive this i made a mistake before you went into the shower jill said oh pittman shook his head in confusion what was that i joked about going in with you to help you shower yes i remember so what bad joke why i dont want to be a tease i dont want to lead you on im confused youre not the only one jill said the television kept droning pittman vaguely understood that the announcer was talking about an economic conference that was taking place in geneva but he didnt take his gaze off jill in boston we said certain things to each other i love you pittman felt as if he was being choked i dont say that easily i treat those words very seriously to me theyre a commitment i couldnt agree more then you regret making the commitment is that it pittman asked it was a mistake you confused depending on each other under stress with being in love you want to correct the misunderstanding you want to set the record straight no not at all then i really dont i dont want to take anything back i love you jill said ive never been more certain of anything in my life then whats the problem he managed to ask when he touched her shoulder he felt her sinews harden this room this bed her voice dropped i told you i dont want to be a tease ah i think im beginning to understand this is about whether or not to have sex with disturbing intensity jill focused her eyes upon him youre tired pittman said i understand pittman had never been looked at so directly everythings been happening too fast jill said its okay really pittman said no pressure i figured things would happen when they were supposed to you mean that when pittman nodded jill visibly relaxed making love shouldnt be an obligation pittman said it shouldnt be something you feel you have to do because the circumstances put pressure on you well wait when were both relaxed when the time feels right you want to know how confused i am pittman didnt understand she took his hand and immediately he did understand he leaned toward her as she raised herself up toward him his blanket fell at the same time the sheets that covered her slipped away their lips touched their bodies pressed against one another feeling her smooth breasts against his skin pittman thought that his heart had never pounded so hard and fast at once he didnt think about anything except how much he loved her much later when time began again pittman became conscious that he lay beside her that his arms were around her and hers around him that his love gave him a reason to live his buoyant mood was canceled as a mans voice made him frown the television yes jill murmured we forgot to turn it off thats not what i mean pittman sat up abruptly listen its about victor standish his heart pounded fast again but this time making him nauseous with shock as he stared toward the chaotic scene of an ambulance and police cars in front of a mansion emergency lights flashing while policemen made way for attendants bringing out a body bag on a gurney a somber announcer was saying verified that the distinguished diplomat victor standish died from a selfinflicted gunshot wound seven no matter how desperately pittman wanted to he couldnt sleep the shock of learning about standishs suicide kept him and jill awake watching cnn for further details until after am a summary of standishs long distinguished career was punctuated by photographs of him and the other grand counselors first as robust steelyeyed ambitiouslooking young men later as elderly icons of diplomacy standing with boltstraight dignity despite their frail bodies some of them bald others with wispy white hair their faces wrinkled skin drooping from their necks but their eyes communicating as much ambition as ever when it became clear that the report wouldnt be updated until the morning pittman reluctantly turned off the television in the darkness of the hotel room he lay tensely in bed his eyes open directed toward the murky ceiling beside him jills eventual slow shallow breathing made him think that at least she had finally managed to shut off her mind and get some rest but pittman couldnt stop the announcers words from echoing through his frantic memory died from a selfinflicted gunshot wound the suicide was totally alien to pittmans expectation he strained to analyze the implications the grand counselors had killed one of their own jonathan millgate in an effort to keep him from revealing information about them the coverup which had involved using pittman as a scapegoat had gotten so out of hand that another grand counselor anthony lloyd had died from a stroke now a third grand counselor victor standish had shot himself presumably because of fear earlier denning had said gleefully three dead two to go but pittman didnt share dennings manic enthusiasm true pittman was encouraged that a fissure of weakness had developed in what he had assumed was an armorlike resolution among the grand counselors but if the tension was affecting them so extremely there was every danger that the remaining two grand counselors eustace gable and winston sloane would succumb to age and desperation damn it pittman thought i have to do something soon when he and jill had arrived in washington that evening one of his primary emotions had been rage the urge to get even with the grand counselors for what they had done to him but his encounter with bradford denning had made him realize the consequences of rage the emotion had so distorted dennings approach to life that he had wasted his life indeed tonight he had worked himself into such a frenzy that his rage had nearly killed him as pittman continued to lie wearily rigidly on the bed in the dark hotel room it occurred to him that dennings rage and the grand counselors fear were mirror images that denning and the grand counselors were unwittingly destroying themselves because of their obsession with the past but not me pittman thought what im doing isnt a disguised version of a death wish it isnt a version of the suicide i attempted a week ago indeed he was struck by the irony that suicide which had seemed reasonable and inevitable to him now was shocking when someone else committed it i want to live oh god how i want to live i never believed id feel that way again pittmans thoughts were suddenly interrupted as he felt jill move beside him surprising him she sat up he was able to see her shadowy silhouette in the darkness what did you say she asked nothing sure you did you were mumbling mumbling i thought you were asleep i thought you were asleep cant me either what were you mumbling something about you want to live i must have been thinking out loud well i applaud your motive in a week youve certainly come a long way from putting a pistol into your mouth to wanting to live i was thinking about denning yes we ought to phone the hospital and find out how he is i was thinking how thrilled he was to know that three of the grand counselors were dead thats what put him in the hospital exactly and theres no guarantee that the two remaining grand counselors wont wind up in the hospital or worse because of this also i was thinking that i might as well be dead if eustace gable and winston sloane dont survive because in that case i wont have any way to prove that im innocent everythings happening so fast i dont know if ive got enough time i have to what i used to be a reporter its what i do bestinterviewing people i think its the only way to save us shortly after dawn feeling a chill in the air seeing vapor come out of his mouth pittman parked next to a pay phone outside a coffee shop sparse traffic sounded eerie as he got out of the car jill following and stepped into the booth after studying the list of telephone numbers that he had used last night he put coins in the box and pressed numbers a male voice with the haughty obsequiousness of a servant to the powerful and rich answered after two rings mr gables residence put him on who may i say is calling sir youre supposed to say its too early to disturb him i beg your pardon sir its barely six in the morning but you didnt take long to answer the phone its like youve been on duty for quite a while are things a little frantic over there i really dont know what youre implying sir if you wish to speak with mr gable youre going to have to tell me who you are the man hes been trying to have killed the line became silent go ahead pittman said let him know as you wish sir pittman waited looking at jill whose lovely face normally glowed with health but now was wan from stress and fatigue thirty seconds later a mans voice aged and frail like wind through dead leaves came on the line eustace gable here matthew pittman again the line became silent yes gable sounded as if he was having trouble breathing ive been reading about you in the newspapers you dont seem surprised that im calling at my age im not surprised by anything gable said however i dont understand the way you identified yourself to my assistant i can see where it might be confusing depending on how many other people youre trying to have killed gable stifled a cough i dont know what youre talking about not over the phone at least i can understand that its what id expect from a diplomat famous for conducting secret meetings all the same i do think we ought to talk dont you perhaps but how if not on the phone in person oh given that you murdered my friend and colleague im not certain that id feel safe in your presence the feelings mutual but as you know i didnt murder him you did honestly mr pittman first you fantasize that im trying to have you killed now youre fantasizing that i killed my friend no one else is on this line so you can save the disinformation i always assume that someone else is on the line does that prevent you from negotiating gable stifled another cough im proud to say that in my entire career i have never turned down a request to negotiate then listen obviously things have gotten way out of hand you never expected me to stay alive this long you never expected so many other people to become involved the only sound was gables labored breathing youve destroyed my life pittman said but i know enough to be able to destroy yours lets call it a stalemate i think its in our mutual best interests if i disappear with a retirement fund a million dollars and a passport that gives me a safe name thats a substantial retirement fund but thats my price also a safe passport for jill warren passports are difficult not with your contacts in the state department think about it i disappear your coverup works no more problems for you if i agree to the meeting you propose i want it completely understood that i dont admit any involvement in your false accusations about coverups and murders were discussing hypothetical matters whatever makes you feel good mr gable ill need time to consider the implications and ive been on this line too long ill call back at ten am mrs page opened the door the moment pittman knocked on it her designer dress was wrinkled and looked out of place in a motel early in the morning otherwise she appeared alert and determined her skintucked face severe with intensity did you watch the morning news about standishs suicide pittman nodded he was always the weakest of the five my father was the strongest we have to keep putting pressure on him this morning i started again how mrs page asked quickly pittman explained be careful my father is a master of manipulation and arrogant about it im counting on that pittman said im hoping that its inconceivable to him that someone could outmanipulate him but can you youre taking a tremendous risk if i could think of another way id do it we cant just hide we have to keep pushing them we have to go back to washington ive got several stops to make in particular i need to see two other people i once interviewed who a security expert and a weapons specialist ill explain as we drive but what if they remember you mrs page asked if they connect you with the newspaper stories and television reports i interviewed them at least five years ago i was heavier i had a mustache theres a good chance they wont recognize me but even if the risk was greater id still have to take it i cant make this plan work without their help as they spoke pittman walked to the next door and knocked on it when george came out they went down concrete steps to where jill was waiting at the car give me your room keys ill leave them at the desk and check everybody out george said fine well meet you at the restaurant down the street jill said restaurant mrs page looked horrified thats not a restaurant okay its a roy rogers think of it as a broadening experience were so pressed for time well have to eat takeout as we drive time yes we have to make time for something else mrs page insisted we have to see about bradford we have to go to the hospital amid the drone of fluorescent lights and the pungent odor of antiseptics pittman frowned in response to jills frown as she came back from speaking to a nurse at the counter outside the cardiaccare unit whats the matter pittmans hands suddenly felt cold dont tell me he died hes gone mrs page stepped forward ashen he is dead i mean he literally isnt here hes gone he left jill said the nurse looked in on him at five am his bed was empty hed pulled an iv needle from his arm hed turned off his heart monitor so it wouldnt sound a warning when he pulled the sensor pads from his chest his clothes were in a cupboard in his room he put them on and snuck out of the hospital its a wonder he had the strength pittman said what the hell did he think he was doing george shook his head last night it was exhaustion but if hes not careful hell give himself a heart attack obviously he believes the risk is worth it jill said to get back at them the remaining two grand counselors i cant imagine anything else that would have made him act so obsessively damn it now weve got a wild card out there pittman said hes so out of control he scares me god knows what he might do to interfere with our plan but we cant let him worry us mrs page said we have to go ahead why are you looking at me like that pittman stepped forward mrs page how are your connections with the washington post do you think you can get someone in the obituary department to do us a favor eight hours later in midafternoon pittman was back in fairfax virginia quickly passing through it taking west then north toward eustace gables estate during his second telephone call to gable which pittman had made exactly at ten as promised using a pay phone in washington gable had given him instructions how to get to the estate as pittman drove toward the rendezvous squinting from the sun he glanced toward his rearview mirror and was reassured to see that despite congested traffic the gray ford van remained behind him jill visible behind the steering wheel the van and the equipment inside it had been rented using georges credit card and pittman thought morbidly that george certainly deserved a bonus the trick being for all of them to stay alive so he could receive it pittman passed farms and strips of woods the sunlight making them seem golden and he prayed that he would have a chance to see them again to see jill again he thought about jeremy and as much as he missed his son he felt strangely close to him as if jeremy were with him helping him give me strength son as instructed pittman came to a signevergreen country clubthen headed to the left trees casting shadows from the sun a mile later he went right along an oaklined gravel road this time when he glanced toward his rearview mirror he saw jill stopping the van parking it among bushes at the side of the gravel road she was doing what they had agreed upon nonetheless he wished she didnt have to until now he hadnt felt alone he rounded a curve and proceeded up a gentle rise flanked by aprillush fields and he couldnt help contrasting his increasing fear with the peaceful setting more he couldnt help contrasting his apprehension as he approached gables estate with the indifference to his safety that he had felt a week earlier when he had snuck into the estate in scarsdale to find out why jonathan millgate had been removed from the hospital back then pittmans only motive had been to get a story for burt forsyth to relieve his obligations to his friend obsessed with the need to commit suicide pittman had felt liberated from apprehension as he had crept through the rainy darkness circling the scarsdale mansion finding millgate surrounded by a nurse a doctor and the grand counselors in a makeshift hospital room off a deck above the fivestall garage the effort had been easy the sense of danger nonexistent because pittman hadnt cared what might happen to him prepared to kill himself he had felt immune to any risks not anymore at wide intervals mansions were set back from the road white wooden fences enclosed horses ahead on the left pittman saw a high stone wall he came to a closed metal gate and stopped within view of a security camera mounted to the left on top of the wall as instructed he leaned out his drivers window so that the camera could have a good look at him immediately the gate whirred open pittman drove through checking his rearview mirror noting that the gate closed behind him while he followed a paved lane through spacious grassland the lane went over a hill and on the other side snuggled into the slope just below the crest on the right was a distinctive sprawling onestory complex that reminded pittman of homes designed by frank lloyd wright the main impression was of limestone terraces and beams and the way it conformed to the landscape aided by plentiful trees and shrubbery would make it invisible from the golf course below pittman guessed from the moment that the gate had opened allowing him onto the estate pittman had noted the absence of guards to anyone who might be watching from the road there was nothing out of the ordinary to all appearances pittman was an unremarkable visitor who knew eustace gable well enough that the gate had been opened without delay the closer pittman came to the house taking a downward curve in the lane proceeding to the right passing fir trees the more pittman was struck by the lack of activity on the property given the size of the estate he would have expected gardeners at least maintenance personnel someone to take care of the horses that came into view below him in a paddock next to a long low stable rimmed by more fir trees and made from limestone matching the house but the place seemed deserted there werent any cars which presumably had been placed in a garage on the opposite side of the house perhaps the lack of guards was intended to make him feel unthreatened pittman thought to encourage him not to change his mind to lure him into a trap but if the purpose was to lull him the opposite effect had been achieved instead of lowering his defenses the eerie solitude intensified pittmans apprehension sending warning signals throughout his body compacting his muscles he reached a circular driveway in front of the house stopped the car and got out surveying the apparently deserted area he heard water trickling from somewhere presumably a fountain he heard a breeze whispering through the fir trees a horse whinnied a door opened and pittman who had glanced toward the stable on the slope below him whirled toward the house an elderly man narrowfaced with white hair spectacles and wrinklepinched features stepped from a polished wooden doorway onto a stone terrace tall and slender he wore a dark blue threepiece suit that conformed to his rigidly straight posture pittman recognized him from photographs and the incident at the scarsdale estate eustace gable four pm precisely i admire punctuality even at a distance it was obvious that gables chest heaved we have much to discuss come in mr pittman pittman took one last look around and seeing no threat climbed steps to the terrace he frowned when gable offered his hand this wont do mr pittman rudeness is a poor way to begin a negotiation im not used to civility from people who want to have me killed the formalities matter gable said even when negotiating with the most bitter enemy it is essential to be respectful and courteous sure right but it sounds like hypocrisy to me gable coughed raising a handkerchief to his mouth the ripple of pain that crossed his wrinkled features made pittman realize how much effort it took for the old man to stand as straight as he did to maintain the diplomatic bearing that had made him famous in his prime composing himself gable again held out his hand ritual controls emotion it encourages order is that what you told yourself when you arranged for jonathan millgate to be murdered gables expression hardened his wrinkles becoming like cracks in the deep grain of weathered wood and burt forsyth pittman said and father dandridge i wouldnt call their murders controlling emotion and encouraging order gable inhaled with effort order dictates necessity im still waiting pittman finally shook his hand with exaggerated indifference but the slight gleam in gables wizened eyes told pittman that the old man thought he had won an advantage gable gestured for pittman to enter the house pittmans unease deepened he almost turned away wanting to get back to the car to drive from the estate as fast as he could but he told himself that if gable meant to have him killed here an expert marksman with a snipers rifle could have done it easily when pittman was in the open climbing the steps to the terrace in front of the house the plan he thought i have to go through with it i cant keep running ive used up nearly all my resources this might be the only chance i get you know my terms pittman said ah but you havent heard mine gables thin lips formed a grimace that may have been a smile after you his veins swelling from increased pressure pittman entered the house hearing gable shut the door behind him pittman noted that the inside had walls and beamed ceilings made from various tropical woods of varying colors mahogany and teak among others the lighting system was recessed but remarkably bright the temperature was unusually warm passing a thermostat in a stonefloored corridor pittman saw that it was set at eighty degrees even on the coldest winter day he would have considered that temperature excessive but given that this was a mild day in late april pittman had to conclude that gable was using the heat to combat his evident illness similarly the bright lights suggested that gables vision might be fading to pittmans fear and anger the unexpected emotion of pity was added and pittman urgently subdued it knowing that gable would take every advantage he could for all pittman knew the bright lights and the excessive temperature were part of a carefully designed stage setting that would allow gable to manipulate him proceeding along the hallway heading left the direction that gable indicated pittman listened to the old mans labored footsteps an open door led to a spacious room with a walllength window that provided a view of the ponds and sand traps of the golf course at the bottom of the slope but pittmans attention was primarily directed toward two men who waited for him one of them he recognized a gauntcheeked elderly man sitting nervously on a sofa had a neatly trimmed white mustache wore a dark threepiece suit almost identical to gables and was recognizable from photographs particularly because of a distinctive cleft in his chin that had deepened with age the other remaining grand counselor winston sloane the second man was in his thirties six feet tall well built with strong features emphasized by his short haircut his gray suit looked less carefully tailored than gables and sloanes indeed the jacket seemed slightly too large and had a bulge on the left side as pittman studied the man who stood in the middle of the room it occurred to him that he knew this man also or at least had seen him before last night the man had been with the group who had attacked mrs pages house pittman turned to gable i didnt know that we wouldnt be alone it doesnt do to negotiate unless all interested parties are in attendance may i present my colleaguewinston sloane with effort sloane tried to stand no need pittman said gable pointed toward the second man and this is my assistant mr webley pittman nodded giving no indication that he recognized the man im sure you wont mind if mr webley performs a security check gable continued for a moment pittman wasnt sure what gable was talking about youre saying you want this man to search me were here on good faith there shouldnt be any need for weapons then why is your assistant armed webleys eyes narrowed because his duties require him to be armed i do hope this isnt going to be a problem gable said pittman raised his arms webley reached for something on a chair behind him and came over with a handheld metal detector tracing its wand along the contours of pittmans body it beeped when it came to the base of pittmans spine webley groped behind the sport coat and removed pittmans gable made a tsking sound how can we negotiate on a basis of trust when you bring a weapon to our meeting force of habit for the last week ive gotten used to needing protection perhaps after this afternoon you wont need it anymore i certainly hope so webley continued to scan pittmans body with the metal detector it beeped several more times keys and coins his belt buckle a pen webley told gable examine the pen check him thoroughly be certain that he isnt wearing a microphone webley did so nothing unusual very well be seated mr pittman lets discuss your proposal why winston sloane asked i dont see what purpose this socalled negotiation will serve our best course is to telephone the police and have this man arrested for murdering jonathan a week ago i would have agreed with you gable said in fact i did agree we all agreed he cleared his throat and turned to pittman as you must have concluded by now our original intention was to blame you for what we were forced to do to jonathan your history of animosity toward jonathan and your suicidal impulses made you an excellent candidate no one would believe your denial for which you would have no proof not that we wanted you to have a chance to deny anything we made arrangements to have you killed before the police could take you into custody the man in my apartment pittman said gable nodded we bribed a policeman to let our own man take his place and wait there sloanes cheeks became alarmingly flushed youre telling him too much not at all gable said if were to accomplish anything we have to be candid correct mr pittman thats why im here to be candid to find a way out of this precisely what i dont understand pittman said is why you needed to blame anyone for jonathan millgates death he was old he was sick he was on oxygen if youd taken away his lifesupport system let him die and then hooked him up to the support system again his death would have seemed natural no one would have been the wiser thats what i wanted sloane insisted his cheeks even redder and at the start you were right gable said patiently try to remember the sequence as jonathans health dwindled he became more afraid of dying hed been flirting with religion for the past several years that priest that damnable priest i never understood jonathans attitude toward father dandridge the priest hounded us during the vietnam years he organized demonstrations and called press conferences to criticize every policy we made about vietnam it was because of father dandridge that jonathan left public life the priests interference made it impossible for jonathan to function effectively in the government and yet two decades later jonathan asked the priest to be his personal confessor father dandridge felt that jonathan millgate needed a confessor who wouldnt be intimidated by him a spiritual adviser who would stand up to him about ultimate matters pittman said gables gaze turned cold ultimate matters i forgot that you spoke to the priest briefly i was there when you had him killed he shouldnt have gotten involved he shouldnt have made trouble he would never have revealed what he heard in confession pittman said so you claim but in my career i have known diplomats who conveyed all sorts of confidential information to trusted associates only to have that information repeated back to them by third parties god only knows what jonathan had already confessed to the priest but i know for certain that what he intended to tell the priest on his deathbed would have been ruinous i was visiting him in the hospital and all he could do was keep telling me that he had to see father dandridge he had to clear his conscience he had to save his soul gable said the last word with contempt then the justice department leaked its report that it was investigating rumors about a covert plan to buy nuclear weapons from the former ussr jonathan was implicated as having acted as an intermediary intermediary stop hiding behind words what you mean is millgate was functioning as an arms dealer pittman said with disgust the worst kind of arms what possible reason could justify the safety of the world gable said indignantly yeah right thats the excuse you and your buddies always came up with the safety of the world it doesnt matter how selfserving the idea is you always justify yourselves by saying its good for everybody are you so naive as to think that the fall of communism and the dissolution of the ussr mean the end of a threat from that region of course not pittman answered the bloodbath in bosnia shows that any damned thing can happen over there after decades of being repressed the provinces of the former ussr might all go in the opposite extreme soon they might all be out of control with access to nuclear weapons about which neither the former government nor the disbanding military is responsible gable gestured for emphasis if a new government a rogue government comes into power theres a very real danger that those nuclear weapons will be used to allow that new government to consolidate its power whats unscrupulous about trying to stop that from happening the way you put it nothing but ive been a reporter too long not to be able to read between the lines what are you talking about the justice departments accusation was specific jonathan millgate was implicated in buying nuclear weapons not paying to have them destroyed in russia nothing wrong about that but buying them what the hell was he going to do with them once he owned them bring them all the way to the united states to have them destroyed sounds a lot more expensive than it needs to be not to mention dangerous all those warheads being moved around and whos paying for these nuclear weapons anyhow the us government not damned likely it would be political suicide for anyone in the government to get involved in such an outrageous scheme so youve got two problems how to pay for the weapons and what to do with the weapons once you own them those problems bothered me ever since i heard that millgate was under suspicion and then the solution came to me of course the way you get rid of the nuclear weapons enables you to pay for them in the first placeyou sell them to someone else gable squinted im impressed mr pittman the compliment doesnt sound sincere but i am impressed you see to the heart of the issue you understand the brilliance of the operation brilliance pittman asked in disbelief the threat of the nuclear weapons in the former ussr is eliminated gable said righteously at the same time its possible to maintain the balance of power in other troubled regions for example its no secret that north korea has been working furiously to develop a nuclear capability what do you think will happen when its nuclear weapons are functional itll control southeast asia but if south korea also gains nuclear capability therell be a stalemate theyll balance each other wrong theyll destroy each other and maybe get the rest of the world involved pittman said not necessarily the emotional strain of the conversation was having an evident effect on gable his breathing was more labored his posture less erect he lowered his voice to save the world sometimes risks have to be taken and bank accounts fattened you hypocrite you and your friends pretended to be selfless public servants and all along from the forties onward from the postwar antisoviet policy to the irancontra armsdealing scandal youve been making a fortune in kickbacks from the weapons industry how much money did you earn arranging to use american funds to arm iraq so it would act as a counterweight against iran and then we went to war against iraq and you received kickbacks from the arms industry because you recommended that war anger made gable regain his rigid posture i refuse to discuss the nuances of foreign policy with a mere reporter you are not privy to classified information you are not in a position to judge the delicacy of various negotiations that i have successfully concluded for the good of the united states and the world right the old excuse theres always secret information that justifies becoming rich by starting more wars and selling more weapons these matters are beyond your understanding gable said you are here for one purpose onlyto try to settle our differences to undo the disastrous effects of your blundering into matters that do not concern you after the leak implicating jonathan in the purchase of russias nuclear weapons it was only a matter of hours perhaps minutes before reporters would have shown up at the hospital in hopes that jonathan would be strong enough to make a statement we had to get jonathan out of the hospital to keep him from telling reporters what he intended to tell the priest you were there when my men took him from the hospital you followed them to scarsdale damn it what were you doing in his room if only you hadnt gone into his room his iv tubes had slipped out his oxygen prongs werent attached to him he was having some kind of seizure i was sure he was going to die that was the idea gable said with barely subdued irritation my colleagues and i said goodbye to him everyone except his nurse and doctor left the room they removed his life supports then they left he was supposed to die but you had to get into the room and reattach the supports and he finally had a chance to confess if the nurse hadnt come back into the room at that moment we never would have known that jonathan had betrayed us if only wed stopped right there sloane said we couldnt gable said because as far as we knew this mangable pointed toward pittmansaw our first attempt to kill jonathan and this mangable pointed harder toward pittmanhad information that could ruin us one of our security team riding in the escort car noticed a taxi following the ambulance as soon as he reached the estate and told me about the taxi i sent him to locate it before it disappeared from the area the drivers passenger was gone but the driver could identify the passenger because of a check that the passenger had written to cover the expense of the ride imagine our concern mr pittman when we researched your background and discovered that you were a reporter what were we to do allow you to write a story about our attempt to kill our friend and about the information he revealed to you certainly not but we did have another option our investigation revealed that youd harassed jonathan seven years ago that you were currently having an emotional collapse it wasnt any effort to make it seem that you killed jonathan we had the check youd given to the taxi driver we had your fingerprints on the door to jonathans room and on his lifesupport equipment in a twisted personal vendetta you killed jonathan then continued with your plans to kill yourself and when your men caught me they were going to help me along gable spread his hands unless the police caught you first in which case i had the resources to arrange for you to commit suicide in jail youre awfully confident that you can manipulate the system to make it do anything you want im a diplomat i helped design the system i guarantee that the plan would have worked then why didnt it gable glanced at the floor well pittman asked i congratulate you youre far more resourceful than your profile led me to believe if you werent so resourceful i wouldnt have agreed to this conversation i assure you for a man determined to commit suicide you have a remarkable talent for survival you see i changed my mind gable looked puzzled i dont want to kill myself any longer because of you explain what you did to me made me so afraid that i had to ask myself if i was so eager to die why was i running why not let you do the job for me i rationalized by telling myself that i wanted my death to be my idea not yours but the truth is you forced me to reconsider where i was in my life i love my dead son i miss him desperately but you distracted me enough that i think i can accept my grief now rather than fight it gable studied him as if he had no understanding of the emotions pittman referred to at last he sighed it would have been so much easier if my men had been able to shoot you when you were running from the scarsdale estate sloane fidgeted first jonathan then anthony now victor no more i want this settled i want it stopped thats why were here gable said to settle things throughout the man known as mr webley stood against the wall to pittmans right watching the group holding pittmans for a negotiation to be successful gable said each side must have something to gain so tell me mr pittman what do we gain in exchange for the million dollars and the two passports that you gain security peace of mind all very well desirable conditions but vague how exactly are you going to give us security and peace of mind by disappearing be specific ill make it look as if i carried through on my intention to commit suicide ill do it in such a way that my body cant be identified again be specific i thought perhaps id arrange for your men to trap me on one of your yachts id blow it and myself up my body would never be found presumably sharks and other scavengers would have eaten what was left of me of course i wouldnt actually have been on the yacht but your men having watched the explosion from another yacht would testify that theyd seen me go aboard sloanes voice trembled with enthusiasm it might work one of my yachts gable squinted you imagine expensive ways to disappear another factor that makes it convincing given the magnitude of your property loss the police wouldnt think that you were involved he has a point sloane said quickly gable scowled at his fellow grand counselor then redirected his calculating gaze at pittman forgive my colleagues outbursts hes forgotten one of the primary rules of negotiation never let your opponent know your actual opinion of his argument i thought we were here to be candid pittman said then why havent you yourself been completely open you expect me to believe that after you pretend to commit suicide youll disappear forever and well have nothing to fear from you thats right pittman lied what guarantees do we have i told you i want to live i dont want to be hunted anymore i want to be left alone under an assumed name yes with ms warren yes perhaps in mexico perhaps farther south in a country where the economy is such that a million dollars is worth considerably more yes and after the barrage of telephone calls last night gable asked with irritation how do you intend to protect us from the other people whothanks to youhave acquired knowledge of our private affairs your daughter for example in particular those phone calls were staged to get your attention pittman said to put pressure on you so youd agree to this meeting to make you want to end this before it spreads any farther the truth is your daughter doesnt know anything for certain if you agree to my terms ill go back to her and from somewhere in the house a phone rang the faint sound echoing pittman glanced past webley toward the hall as the phone rang a second time its not important gable said the fax machine in my home office is on a line thats separate from the main telephone line thats what you heard the fax machine two rings and it answered pittman nodded if you agree to my terms ill go back to your daughter and behave irrationally enough that shell lose faith in my credibility my apparent suicide will make her even more skeptical about me shell be forced to conclude that her accusations based on what i told her are the nonsense you say they are i like it sloane said eagerly it makes sense it can get us out of the mess were in winston gables aged eyes flashed your persistent outbursts force me to violate protocol i have never before done this in a negotiation but you leave me no choice i must ask you not to interrupt me again but winston gables chest heaved the effort of emotion having an obvious weakening effect on him sloane looked abashed and lowered his gaze toward his hands gables breath rate subsided he composed himself and studied pittman frowning so you restricted the information that you gave to my daughter thats right gable shook his head in disagreement i suddenly have doubts about you doubts to enlist my daughters aid it isnt logical that you would have held back to make your strongest case you would have told her everything you know im beginning to worry that all of this has been needless what exactly do you know what are we buying what precisely is worth one million dollars and two passports duncan kline was an instructor at grollier academy gable raised his bushy white eyebrows and gestured for pittman to continue he liked to gather the brightest students around him pittman said he persuaded them to join him in small study groups he nurtured them of course nurturing is something that a good teacher does automatically but good teachers dont molest their students pittman said gables face became rigid his wrinkles deepening duncan kline carefully prepared his few chosen students pittman said it took time and devotion painstaking kindness and delicate reassurance at last he made himself so necessary in their lives so essential to their emotional wellbeing that they found themselves incapable of resisting his advances you and the other grand counselors all of you were molested by him its affected you ever since gable kept staring his wrinkled features reminding pittman of a crust of mud that was cracking molested gable asked you honestly think id go to all this trouble to hide the fact that we were molested as students at grollier which we were by the way gable raised his face to the beamed ceiling and burst out laughing his feeble adams apple bobbing his bony throat sounding as if gravel were stuck in it at once he seemed to strangle on his laughter in pain he lowered his face tugged out his handkerchief and coughed repeatedly into it his pale face turned red from effort the spasms slowly subsided of course we were molested he swallowed and put away his handkerchief if you revealed that information i could easily turn it to my advantage eliciting sympathy from the media in america today there is no such thing as shame only prurience and pity you know nothing that threatens me mr pittman youre wasting my time you didnt let me finish oh are you suggesting that you have information of more substance to share with us pittmans chest ached swollen with pressure his heart pumped faster he had hoped that gable would take for granted that pittman had discovered his secret an open discussion in which gable revealed details that he assumed were shared knowledge had been part of pittmans strategy what he hadnt counted on was that gable the lifelong negotiator wasnt about to acknowledge any information unless pittman volunteered it first sweat rolled down pittmans back paradoxically cold the sweat stuck his clothes to his skin making him shiver although he fought not to show it okay he told himself nervously you came here because you felt your best weapon was your ability to interview somebody well its time to prove how good you are lets see you interview a worldclass negotiator he turned toward the walllength window straining to concentrate composing his thoughts sunlight gleamed into the room making him squint nonetheless he was able to focus on the fir trees beyond the window amazingly green and clear preciously beautiful given his proximity to death at the bottom of the wooded slope beyond the house distant golfers took advantage of the pleasant april day a man in a golf cart drove past a sand trap toward where his ball had landed near the wall that separated gables estate from the golf course pittman stared at the sand trap and again he couldnt help being aware of the bitter irony that a week ago his nightmare had begun near a golf course and now was about to end near another one mr pittman gable said if you have substantive information to share with us do so otherwise im afraid that mr webley will have to ensure that you never share anything with anyone again continuing to squint pittman turned to gable youre sweating the grand counselor said look at your forehead its pouring off you surely youre not nervous in a negotiation you should never allow your emotions to show certainly i never do its the temperature in this room its too hot in here pittman wiped his forehead my doctor has given me instructions that the temperature must be kept at eighty to remedy a mild health problem of mine take off your sport coat if the temperature is making you uncomfortable youre wearing a sweater also im fine pittman refocused his attention concentrating on the view through the window the man in the golf cart had disappeared behind the wall at the bottom of the slope that fax the one that arrived a few minutes ago what about it gable asked pittman looked directly into gables steel gray eyes it was for me gable didnt respond immediately for you what does he mean winston sloane asked ignoring his colleague gable told pittman thats absurd why would anyone send a fax to you here how could anyone do that the fax number is confidential the same as your telephone number is confidential pittman said but i arranged for your daughter to phone you last night and for jill to phone your confidential number winston and then we phoned victor standishs confidential number too late in that case hed already blown his brains out because he couldnt stand hiding the secret you shared but if i had no trouble using my contacts to learn those numbers i assure you it was just as easy for me to find out your fax number the message is duncan klines obituary im sure well all find it interesting gable frowned with suspicion mr webley see that my visitor remains exactly where he is while i get the fax message from my office webley raised pittmans dont worry he isnt going anywhere pittman watched gable stand with difficulty and proceed from the room his back as regally straight as he could make it gable disappeared down a corridor pittman was uncomfortably aware of more sweat slicking his brow his anxiety combined with the heat in the room made him nauseous avoiding webleys intense gaze and sloanes nervous expression pittman turned again toward the walllength window it took him a moment to adjust his vision to the painful glare of the sun the fir trees were even more beautiful the green of the spring grass was made exquisite by his terror in the distance golfers passed trees near a pond abruptly a motion caught pittmans attention at the bottom of the slope on gables estate close to the wall this side of the wall the man whod driven the golf cart toward the opposite side of the wall was now in view climbing the slope toward gables mansion pittman didnt know how he had gotten over the wall but it was the same man pittman could tell because the man in the golf cart had worn a white cap and a red windbreaker the same as this man despite the sheltering cap it was now possible to see that the man was elderly but he moved with slow determination climbing holding something in his right hand and as he trudged higher beginning to show the physical cost of his effort just before pine trees obscured him pittman realized with hastily subdued shock that he recognized the grimacing elderly man pittman had bought a drink for him last night hed followed him to mrs pages mansion hed taken him to a hospital when the elderly man collapsed bradford denning this morning denning had snuck from the hospitals cardiac ward and now he looked totally deranged as he stumbled into view again leaving the fir trees struggling higher toward the house with equal shock pittman distinguished the object in dennings right handa pistol held rigidly to his side no pittman thought if gable sees him if webley notices theyll decide that ive tricked them that i cant be trusted that everythings out of control the moment they realize dennings armed theyll shoot him and then theyll finish me the echo of faltering footsteps on a stone floor alerted pittman he straightened turned from the window hoped that no one else had seen what he had and directed his full attention to eustace gable who entered the room looking considerably frailer and older than when he had left ashen the grand counselor regarded the single sheet of fax paper that he had brought from his office how did you obtain this the old man asked pittman didnt answer gable assumed as imperious a stance as he could manage answer me how did you obtain this not knowing the substance of the message knowing only that it was what he had asked mrs page using her contacts at the washington post to send to him pittman hoped that he sounded convincingly casual surely you havent forgotten that lately my assignment has been obituaries pittman stood approached gable and attempted to take the fax from gables rigid grip gable resisted damn it if i dont get a chance to read this pittman thought in hidden panic unexpectedly gable released his grasp as if hed seen it numerous times pittman glanced offhandedly down at the text it was from the obituary page of the boston globe december the death notice for duncan kline pittmans temples throbbed sickening him im sure it was a difficult matter for you to decidewhether to arrange for a small discreet notice about duncan klines passing or whether to allow the larger obituary that one might expect for a remarkable teacher who had taught many remarkable students in the first case duncan klines former colleagues and students might have been suspicious about the indignity of giving him only a few words they might have sought out more information but in the second case they might have unwittingly learned too much if the circumstances of his death were elaborated as it is you struck a prudent compromise the room became deathly silent thinking with furious speed pittman imagined bradford denning struggling higher up the slope the old man would not yet be close enough to be a danger but pittman had been disturbed by his resolve he remembered how denning had pressed his left hand to his pained chest while his right hand clutched his pistol the obituary tells you nothing gable said its been a matter of public record for more than forty years if there was anything incriminating in it someone would have discovered it long ago pittman raised his voice but only if someone knew what to look for the faster his heart rushed the more his lungs felt starved for oxygen his reporters instincts had seized him propelling his thoughts thrusting them against one another linking what he already knew with what he had just now discovered making startling connections duncan kline died in pittman said that was the year he suddenly appeared at the state department demanding to see all of you july eisenhower had won the republican nomination for president all of you were busy ruining the reputations of your competitors while you prepared to jump ship from a democratic administration to one that you were sure would be republican your conservative antisoviet attitudes were in tune with the times the future was yours then kline showed up and he scared the hell out of you didnt he as yet pittman had no idea why the grand counselors had been afraid of kline but the intensity with which they listened to pittmans insistence that they had indeed been afraid of kline gave pittman the incentive to follow that line of argument you thought youd buried him in your past pittman said but suddenly there he was making a very public appearance and yes he scared the hell out of you in fact he scared you so much that in the midst of your determined efforts to convince eisenhower and his people to bring you on board you took time outall of youto go to a reunion at grollier that was in december kline must have put a lot of pressure on you since july when he showed up at the state department finally you had no choice you all went back to the reunion at grollier because it was natural for kline to be there as well it wouldnt have seemed unusual for you and kline to be seen together while you tried to settle your differences without attracting attention pittmans nervous system was in overdrive as he studied winston sloanes reactions the old mans facial muscles tightening in a stressful acknowledgment of what pittman was saying for his part eustace gables expression provided no indication as to whether pittman was guessing correctly duncan kline had retired from teaching pittman continued he was living in boston but this obituary says he died at a cottage he owned in the berkshire hills i dont need to remind you theyre in western massachusetts just south of vermont in december why the hell would an elderly man who lived in boston want to be at a cottage in the mountains during winter under the circumstances the best reason i can think of is that he made the relatively short drive to the cottage after he attended the reunion at grollier because his business with all of you wasnt finished because you needed an isolated place where he and you could continue discussing your differences pittman stopped needing to control his breathing hoping that his inward frenzy wasnt betraying him as frightened as he was he felt elated that neither gable nor sloane contradicted what he had said imagining bradford denning climbing the slope outside not daring to risk a glance toward the window to see how close denning had staggered to the mansion pittman shifted toward a wall of bookshelves at the side of the room desperate to prevent his audience from facing the window and seeing what was happening outside pittman pointed toward a section of the obituary he held duncan kline was english he came to the united states in the early s after teaching for a time at cambridge pittmans stomach tensed as he made another connection british if only id known earlier that kline was british that he came from cambridge im sure it must have been quite a coup for an anglophile school like grollier to have acquired an instructor from cambridge as one of its faculty members ironic isnt it over the years grolliers students have gone on to be congressmen senators governors even a president not to mention distinguished diplomats such as yourselves but for all its effect on the american political system the schools philosophical ties have always been to britain and europe ive seen the transcripts of the seminars you took from him klines specialty was history political science winston sloanes face turned gray pittman continued so a political theorist from cambridge bonded with five special students and trained them for their exceptional diplomatic careers the five of you provided the philosophical underpinnings for almost every administration since truman the theories duncan kline instilled in you no when we were young maybe winston sloane objected but we never carried through on duncans theories winston enough gable said but listen to what hes saying this is exactly what we feared hell destroy our reputations we were never communists and that was it what pittman had fervently hoped that one of the grand counselors would unwittingly volunteer information had finally happened the word communists seemed to echo eerily at once the room became disturbingly silent just as everyone in it seemed frozen in place slowly eustace gable took out his handkerchief he coughed into it in pain winston sloane peered down at his gnarled hands evidently ashamed of his lapse realizing how severely hed declined from having once been a great negotiator renowned for keeping his counsel for his part webley showed no reaction he just kept pointing the at pittman gable cleared his throat and put away his handkerchief despite his problems of health and age he looked so dignified that he might have been conducting a meeting in the white house complete your thought mr pittman in the russian revolution electrified antiestablishment british intellectuals liberal faculty members at british universities especially at cambridge became enchanted with socialist theory the eventual results of that enchantment were the british spy ringsformer students whod been recruited by their professors at cambridgeworking for the soviets to undermine england and the united states guy burgess donald maclean kim philby in fact now that i think of it burgess and maclean defected to russia in philby was suspected of having warned them that they were about to be arrested as spies the next year duncan kline made his threatening appearance outside your offices at the state department i guess you could say that he was more advanced than philby and the others after all philby had been converted in the thirties whereas kline had become a communist sympathizer a decade earlier in the twenties he must have been an exceptional seducersexually politically and after all you and your friends were so young so impressionable you graduated from grollier in you attended college some of you at harvard others at yale meanwhile the depression worsened klines communist theories presumably continued to be fascinating to you given the chaos of the country but eventually you stayed loyal to the capitalist tradition did it finally occur to you that if you followed klines theories and undermined the establishment youd be undermining yourselves inasmuch as you were the next leaders of the establishment pittman stared at gable and sloane but neither man responded i think youre opportunists pittman said if communism had taken control of the united states youd have insinuated yourselves into the highest levels of the new system but once the second world war started communism lost its limited appeal here the soviets appeared to be as huge a threat as the nazis so you insinuated yourselves into the upper echelons of the state department there you not only jettisoned your former communist attitudes you also gained more power by eliminating your competitors claiming that they were communist sympathizers pittman thought nervously of bradford denning clutching his pistol struggling up the slope past fir trees toward the mansion in the anticommunist mccarthy hysteria of the early fifties you built your careers on the sabotaged careers of other diplomats then duncan kline showed up and threatened to ruin everything what did he do hold you up for blackmail unless you paid him to be quiet hed reveal that you were as vulnerable as the men you accused of being communists is that it the room became so still that pittman could feel blood pounding behind his eardrums eustace gable forlornly shook his wizened head his tone was a blend of discouragement and disappointment you know far more than i expected the old man exhaled wearily youve demonstrated remarkable journalistic skills thats why i permitted you to come hereso that i could judge the extent of your knowledge but youre wrong i dont think so duncan didnt attempt to blackmail us he didnt want money gable said then what did he want for us to be true to the principles hed taught us he was appalled that wed formulated such stern government policies against the soviet union he wanted us to undo those policies and recommend cooperation between the two countries it was nonsense of course the soviets had been made out to be such monsters that there wasnt any way to change americas official attitude toward them any politician or diplomat who tried would be committing professional suicide no the only way to build a career was to be more antisoviet than anyone else and after all your careers mattered more than anything pittman said of course you cant accomplish anything if youre out of the loop so you balanced duncan kline against your careers and killed him gable said pittman tensed his instincts warning him it wasnt gables habit to reveal information why was he doing so now to hide his unease pittman frowned toward the obituary he held it says here that duncan kline died from exposure during a winter storm dear god pittman thought he finally understood involuntarily he murmured the snow thats right mr pittman the snow duncan was an alcoholic when we met him at his cabin he refused to be budged by our arguments he insisted that if we didnt soften our policy toward the soviet union he would expose us as former communist sympathizers a blizzard was forecast it was late afternoon but the snow was falling thickly enough already that we couldnt see the lake behind duncans cabin hed been drinking to excess before we arrived at the cabin he drank heavily all the while we tried to reason with him i suspect that if hed been sober we might have had more patience with him as it was we used the alcohol to kill him we encouraged him to keep drinking pretending to drink with him waiting for him to collapse or so we hoped i have to give duncan credit after a while even as drunk as he was he finally suspected that something was wrong he stopped drinking no amount of encouragement would persuade him to swallow the scotch we poured for him in the end we had to force him and i have to give duncan credit for something elseall those years of rowing had made him extremely strong drunk and in his sixties he put up quite a struggle but he wasnt any match for the five of us you helped hold his arms didnt you winston we poured the scotch down his throat oh yes we did he vomited but we kept pouring pittman listened repelled the scene that gable described reminded pittman of the way in which gable had murdered his wife at last after he was unconscious we picked him up carried him outside and left him in a snowbank gable said his former students and faculty members knew how extreme his alcohol problem was they thought that the reference to exposure was discreet since privately many of them were able to learn the true nature of his death or what they thought was the true naturethat hed wandered drunkenly outside in his shirt sleeves and passed out in the snowstorm no one ever discovered that we had helped duncan along we removed all evidence that wed been in the cabin we got in our cars and drove away the snow filled our tire tracks a relative of his became worried when duncan didnt return to boston after the reunion at grollier the state police were sent to the cabin where they saw duncans car searched and found his bare foot sticking out from under a snowdrift an animal had tugged off his shoe and eaten his toes and almost forty years later jonathan millgate began having nightmares about what youd done pittman said jonathan was always the most delicate among us gable said strange during the vietnam war he could recommend destroying villages suspected of ties with the communists he knew full well that everyone in those villages would be killed and yet he never lost a moments sleep over them but about that time his favorite dog had to be destroyed because it was suffering from kidney disease he wept about that dog for a week he had it buried with a stone marker in his backyard i once saw him out there talking to the gravestone and that was two years after the fact i think that he could have adjusted to what we did to duncan a bloodless death falling ever deeply asleep with snow for a pillow the corpse preserved in the cold if only the animal hadnt eaten duncans toes the mutilation took control of jonathans imagination yes he did have nightmares although i assumed that after a time the nightmares stopped however a few years ago i was surprised to say the least when he began referring to them again the soviet union had collapsed instead of being jubilant jonathan reacted by saying that the fall of communism only proved that duncans death had been needless the logic eluded me but the threat didnt when jonathan began pouring his tortured soul out to father dandridge i felt very threatened indeed so you killed him and here we are pittman said trying to come to terms with your secrets was it really worth it everything you did to me the people who died because of the coverup youre elderly youre infirm the odds are that you would have died long before the investigation led to a trial gable rubbed his emaciated chin and assessed pittman with eyes that seemed a thousand years old you still dont understand with all that youve been through and with all that weve discussed this afternoon you still somehow fail to understand of course id be dead before the matter even got as far as a grand jury i dont care about being punished indeed as far as im concerned i did nothing for which i deserve to be punished what i care about is my reputation i wont have a lifetime of devoted public service dragged into the gutter and judged by commoners because i eliminated a child molester a drunkard and a communist duncan kline was evil as a youth i didnt think so of course i admired him but eventually i realized how despicable he was his death was no loss to humanity my reputation is worth a hundred thousand duncan klines the good i have done for this country is a legacy that i refuse to allow to be smeared because of a desperate act of necessity that protected my career your career precisely gable said nothing else matters im afraid that i brought you here under false pretenses the million dollars the two passports i regret to say that i never intended to provide them i wanted to discover what you knew quite a lot it turns out but without proof its all theory youre hardly a threat to my security but you are very much a threat to my reputation winstons behavior this afternoon shows that he too is a threat to my reputation he cant guard his tongue fortunately both problems have a common solution mr webley yes sir webley proceeded toward pittman and stopped behind him pittmans bowels turned cold when he heard the hammer on his being cocked no the barrel of the suddenly appeared beside him the shot assaulted his eardrums across the room winston sloane gasped jerking back blood erupting from his chest and from behind him spattering the sofa upon which he sat the old man shuddered then collapsed as if he were made of brittle sticks that could no longer support one another his head drooped tilting his balance sending his body sprawling onto the floor pittman was sure he heard bones scraping together the shocked expression on pittmans face communicated the question he was too horrified to ask why i told you i need to eliminate problems gable said mr webley the gunman stepped from behind pittman and walked toward the entrance to the room he stopped turned set the on a table and pulled a different pistol from beneath his suit coat perhaps youre beginning to understand gable told pittman terrified pittman wanted to run but webley blocked the way out the instant pittman moved he knew hed be killed his only defense was to keep talking you expect the police to believe that i came in here pulled a gun shot sloane and then was shot by your bodyguard of course the belongs to you after all mr webley will wipe his fingerprints from it place the weapon in your hand and fire it so that nitrate powder is on your fingers the physical evidence will match what we insist happened but the plan wont work nonsense your motive has already been established thats not what i mean pittmans voice was hoarse with fear he stared at the pistol webley aimed at him the plan wont work because this conversation is being overheard and recorded gables wrinklerimmed eyes narrowed creating more wrinkles what you were right to be suspicious pittman said i did come here wearing a microphone mr webley you saw me search him thoroughly hes clean theres no microphone then shoot him wait pittmans knees shook so badly that he didnt know if he could support himself listen to me when you searched me you missed something i said shoot him mr webley but webley hesitated my gun pittman said the before i came here i went to a man i interviewed five years ago hes a specialist in security in electronic eavesdropping he didnt recognize me and he didnt ask any questions when i said i wanted to buy a miniature microphonetransmitter that could be concealed in the handle of a i knew the gun was the first thing youd take from me i was counting on the fact that youd be so pleased to get it away from me you wouldnt stop to realize it might be another kind of threat you checked my pen webley but you didnt think to check the gun webley grabbed the off the table and pressed the button that released the pistols ammunition magazine from its handle pittman kept talking nauseous from fear i have a friend waiting in a van parked in the area its loaded with electronic equipment shes been recording everything we said shes also been rebroadcasting the conversation directing it to the fairfax police her signal is designed to block out normal police transmissions for the last hour the only thing the police station and all the police cars in fairfax have been able to hear is our conversation mr gable you just told several hundred police officers that you killed duncan kline jonathan millgate burt forsyth and father dandridge if id had time id have gotten you to admit that you also killed your wife webley gables outrage made his aged voice amazingly strong jesus hes right here it is webley looked pale as he held up a bulletshaped object that was obviously intended for another purpose damn you gable shouted at pittman ill wait in line thanks youre damned already kill him gable roared toward webley but do what i say mr gable theres no point webley said isnt there no one subjects me to ridicule spittle erupted from gables mouth hes ruined my reputation gables face assumed the color of a dirty sidewalk as webley continued to hesitate gable stalked toward him took the gun from his hand aimed at pittman no pittman screamed and fired the bullet struck pittmans chest he groaned in anguish as he felt its slamming impact it lifted him off his feet at the same time that it jolted him backward in excruciating pain he struck the floor cracking his head graying out for a moment regaining consciousness struggling to breathe from where he lay his chest heaving spastically he watched in panic as gable coughed faltered then lurched toward him gables shriveled face towered above him the pistol was aimed toward pittmans forehead paralyzed from shock pittman couldnt even scream in protest as gables finger tightened on the trigger the roar of the gunshot made pittman flinch but it didnt come from the pistol in gables hand rather it came from behind pittman from the direction of the walllength window as glass shattered and gunshots kept roaring gables face bursting into crimson his chest shuddering obscene red flower patterns appearing on it five shots six gable lurched against a chair the pistol fell from his hand clattering onto the floor a bullet struck his windpipe blood gushing and suddenly gable no longer had the stature of a diplomat but the gangly awkwardness of a corpse toppling onto the floor through gaps in the window that had been shattered by gunshots pittman heard denning shout in triumph dennings grotesquely manic face was framed by a jagged hole in the window the old mans skin seemed to have shrunk clinging to his cheekbones making his face like a grinning skull hearing a noise from the other side of the room pittman twisted in pain and saw webley stand from behind a chair where he had taken cover he raised the aiming toward denning the pistol that had fallen from gables hand lay on the floor next to pittman sweating wanting to vomit mustering resolve pittman reached grasped the weapon and fired repeatedly at webley too dazed to know if he was hitting his target merely pulling the trigger again and again jerking from the recoil concentrating not to lose his grip on the pistol and then the gun wouldnt fire anymore and it was too heavy to be held any longer anyhow and pittman dropped it his chest seized by agonizing pain he waited for webley to retaliate no response he listened for a sound from webleys direction nothing he fought to raise himself squinting past gables corpse still seeing no sign of webley what difference does it make pittman thought if i didnt kill him im finished but he had to know he squirmed higher clutching a chair peering over it seeing webley lying motionless in a pool of blood pittmans painful elation lasted only a second as he heard a groan from beyond the shattered window his chest protesting from the effort he turned and saw denning clutch his own chest the old mans elated grin had become a scowl his eyes which a moment ago had been bright with victory were now dark with terror and bewilderment he dropped his pistol he sagged against the windowsill he slumped from view by the time pittman staggered to the window denning was already dead collapsed in a flower garden his eyes and mouth open his arms and legs trembling then no longer trembling assuming a terrible stillness pittman shook his head in the distance he heard a siren another siren quickly joined it the wails became louder speeding nearer bracing himself against a chair pittman peered down fumbling to open his sport coat the bullet that had struck his chest protruded partly from his sweater when gable had commented that the two garments were the reason pittman reacted badly to the eightydegree temperature in the room pittman had been afraid that gable would become suspicious about the sweater after all the sweater was the reason pittman had needed to contact someone else he had once interviewed before he came to the mansion to confront gable the person hed gone to see was a security expert the sweater was a bulletresistant vest whose stateoftheart design made it look like ordinary clothing im the sum of all the people i ever interviewed pittman thought morosely as he stared again out the shattered window toward dennings corpse he turned away the effort of breathing made him wince the security expert had explained that the woven fibers of the bulletresistant vest could stop most projectiles but that it offered no protection against the force of their impact bruises and injured ribs were sometimes unavoidable i believe it pittman thought holding himself i feel like ive been kicked by a horse the sirens joined by others sped nearer and louder pittman staggered across the living room passing gables corpse then sloanes then webleys the stench of cordite and death was cloying he had to get outside he had to breathe fresh air he stumbled along the stonefloored hallway his legs weak from the effects of fear as he reached for the main door he heard tires squealing on the paved driveway outside he opened the door and lurched onto the terrace breathing sweet cool air policemen scrambled from cruisers weapons drawn they didnt bother slamming their car doors they were too busy racing toward pittman he lifted his arms not wanting them to think he was a threat but then he saw jill among them racing even harder to reach him shouting his name and he knew that for now at least he didnt have to be afraid he held her clinging to her oblivious to the pressure against his injured chest she was sobbing and he held her tighter never wanting to let her go i love you i was so afraid that id lose you she said not today pittman kissed her thank god not today epilogue love is an act of faith pittman thought people get sick and die or they die in traffic accidents or they eat food that hasnt been properly cooked and they get salmonella and they die or they fall from a ladder and break their necks or they get tired of you and they dont want to see you anymore and they dont answer your phone calls or they divorce you there were so many ways to be tortured by love indeed eventually all love even the truest and most faithful doomed the lover to agonizing lossbecause of death love required so much optimism so much trust in the future a practical person might say that the possible immediate benefits did not compensate for the ultimate painful result a cautious person might deny his or her feelings closet the temptation to love smother it and go through life in a safe emotionless vacuum but not me pittman thought if love requires faith im a believer these thoughts occurred to him as he held jills hand and walked between rows of tombstones toward his beloved sons grave it was thursday again a week after the events that had taken place at eustace gables mansion and two weeks after pittman had tried to save jonathan millgates life at the scarsdale estate following the arrival of the police and the discovery of the corpses in gables bloodspattered living room pittman and jill had been held in custody but as pittman had hoped the damning conversation that had been broadcast to the police was his salvation after he and jill had been questioned at length after mrs page corroborated those portions of their story about which she had personal experience after the police in boston and new york verified other details with help from the vermont state police who went to grollier academy pittman and jill were eventually released now in new york they stopped before jeremys grave and the warm sunshinefilled spring afternoon made pittmans heart ache worse from love for his absent son it was terrible that jeremy would never again see and experience weather so beautiful pittman put his arm around jill drawing comfort from her while he studied the amazingly green grass that covered jeremys grave as his tear ducts stung his eyes he was reminded of something that walt whitman had written that grass was the hair of graves jeremys hair the only hair he has now except that isnt true pittman thought a hundred years ago maybe when coffins were made of wood and werent surrounded by a concrete sleeve and lid in the old days the coffin and the body would decompose become one with the earth and generate new life now the way bodies are hygienically sealed within the earth death is truly lifeless pittman thought if his exwife had agreed with pittmans wishes their sons body would have been cremated his ashes lovingly scattered in a meadow where wildflowers could bloom from him but pittmans exwife had insisted so strongly and pittman had been so emotionally disabled jeremys body had been disposed of in a traditional manner and the sterility of it made pittman want to cry the thought of death which for the past year had preoccupied him now weighed heavier on his mind since his escape from the scarsdale estate he had seen his best friend killed and father dandridge and that didnt include several men whom he himself had killed and it certainly didnt include the slaughter at gables mansion the more pittman brooded about it the more he wondered if the other grand counselorsanthony lloyd dead from a stroke victor standish dead from suicideshould also be included and of course jonathan millgate i set out to do an obituary on a man who wasnt dead pittman thought in the process i inadvertently ended up causing the death of that man and of all his associates the grand counselors were evil of that pittman had no doubt but they would have died soon anyway he told himself and maybe that would have been better than exposing their obscene secret and causing so many other deaths along the way would any of this have happened pittman wondered if he hadnt believed that the public truly had a right to know about the abuses of power if hed been less determined he would never have gone after jonathan millgate seven years previously burt would never have chosen him to go after millgate again two weeks ago do i bear some responsibility for what happened pittman couldnt believe that no i was right to go after them he told himself with force those bastards did think they were above everyone they didnt care who suffered and died as long as their careers prospered they deserved to be punishednot killed too easy for them but exposed condemned ridiculed in the old days they would have been put in a cage in the town square and people would have spat upon them and maybe other diplomats would have been discouraged from abusing power this what if type of thinking this if only secondguessing had been typical of pittmans mindset after jeremys death he had kept imagining an alternate reality in which if only this or that had happened everything would have turned out for the best but the if only hadnt happened if only wasnt the case reality was the case and reality was painful as a consequence he had not been prepared for the love that he had found in jill he held her close to him he treasured her yes love was doomed to end in pain he thought but in the meantime it was an anodyne against other kinds of pain the tragic imperfections of life he still could not adjust to the realization of how close he had come to killing himself two weeks earlier he had been in such black despair because of grief the pain had been intolerable now grief still weighed upon him unrelieved by the tears that streamed down his cheeks as he blinked through them at jeremys sunbathed grave but he had been shocked into dealing with the present rather than dwelling on the past and with jill beside him to share the weight of his grief he knew that he could now persist just as he would gladly share the weight of whatever despair would eventually seize her and to be sure a few good things had happened the day after the massacre at gables mansion the newspaper for which pittman had worked and which had been scheduled to go out of business had found a financial white knight willing to keep it in business the dying paper had been reborn and the publicity that pittmans story had received had prompted the papers new owner to rehire pittman as a lead reporterin exchange for an exclusive series about what had happened to him and what he had discovered about the grand counselors although his prestigious new position didnt matter to him as much as the chance to continue telling the truth about the abuses of power if only jeremy was alive to cheer me on pittman thought if only but if only was to look backward and at the moment watching jeremys grave tightening his arm around jill he knew that he had an obligation to himself and jill to look to the future an act of faith pittman thought he turned to jill who wiped his eyes and kissed him im sorry youre hurting she told him hey im alive youre here with me his voice broke tears dont always mean a persons sad
