by the sword mercedes lackey book one kerowyns ride one blessedlook out everyone turned and stared at kero and at the boy about to lose the towering platter of bread the racket of pots and voices stopped and kerowyns voice rang out in the silence like a trumpet call but no one answered this call to arms they all seemed confused or frozen with indecision the scullion staggered two more steps forward the edible sculpture two clumsy obese breaddeer a stag and a reclining doe began sliding from the oversized serving dish he was attempting to carry alone idiots kerowyn swore again this time with an oath her mother would have blanched to hear but it seemed as if she was the only one with the will or brains to act she sprinted across the slickly damp floor of the kitchen and caught the edge of the platter just as the enormous subtlety of sweet eggglazed dough started to head for the flagstones the lumpy mountain stopped just short of the carved display plates edge she held it steady while young derk sweating profusely regained his breath and his balance and took the burden of twenty pounds of sweet raisinstudded bread back from her he got the thing properly settled on his shoulder and headed for the great hall to place it before the wedding party kero listened for a moment then heard the shouts and applause from beyond the kitchen door as the bread sculpture appeared the clamor in the kitchen resumed kero licked sweat from her upper lip and sighed she would have liked to have staggered backward and leaned against the wall to catch her breath but she didnt dare take the time not at this point in the serving the moment she paused there would undoubtedly be three more near disasters if she took her attention away from the preparations the tightlyplanned schedule would fall apart she knew very well she really shouldnt be here she probably should have been out there with the rest of the guests playing keep lady that was what would have been proper to the six hells with proper if father wants this feast to be a success i have to be in here not playing the lady the kitchen was as hot as any one of the six hells and crowded with twice the number of people it was intended to hold the cook an immense man with the build of a wrestler and his young helpers were all squeezed in behind one side of a huge table running the entire length of the kitchen normally they worked on both sides but tonight the servers were running relay with platters and bowls on the other side and may the gods help anyone in the way kero chivvied her recruited corps of horsegrooms out the door they were a lot more used to being served from the beer pitchers they were carrying than doing the serving themselves then she spotted something out of the corner of her eye and paused long enough to snatch up a wooden spoon she used it to reach across the expanse of scarred wooden tabletop and whack one of the pages on the knuckles she got him to rights too trying to steal a fingerful of icing from the wedding cake standing in magnificent isolation on the end of the table butted up against the wall the boy yelped and jumped back colliding with one of the cooks helpers and earning himself a black look and another whack with a spoon leave that be perry she scolded brandishing the spoon at him thats for after the ceremony and dont you forget it you can eat yourself sick on the scraps tomorrow for all i care but you leave it alone tonight or more than your knuckles will be hurting i promise you the shockhaired boy whined a halfhearted apology and started to sulk to stave off a sullen fit she shoved a handful of trencher slabs across the table at him and told him to go see that the minstrels were fed some day spoiled brat i wish fatherd send him back to his doting mama a cats more use than he is especially when everybodys too busy to keep an eye on him fortunately all perry had to do was show up with the slabs of trencher bread and the minstrels would see to their own feeding kero hadnt met a songster yet that didnt know how to help himself at a feast the first meat course was over time for the vegetable pies and the dishes strawhaired ami had been plunging into her tub with frantic haste were done just in time kero sent the next lot in laden with heavy pies and stacks of bowls just as the remains of the venison and the poor hacked up bits of the breaddeer came in its a good thing that monstrosity didnt hit the ground she reflected soberly snagging perry as he slouched in behind the servers and sending him back out again with towels for the wedding guests to wipe their greasy fingers what with diernas family device being the red deer and all her people would have taken that as a bad omen for sure there was no subtlety for this course thank all the gods and goddesses not that father didnt want one more dough sculpture this time a rampant stagas a testament to my darling brothers virility no doubt its a good thing cook had a fit over all the nonsense that was already going to wind up being crammed into the oven there was a momentary lull as the last of the emptied dishes arrived and the last of the servers staggered out and everyone in the kitchen took a moment to sag over a table or against the wall fanning overheated faces kero thought longingly of the cool night air just beyond the thick planks of the door at her back but her fathers seneschal poked his nose in the doorway and she pushed away from the worn wood with a suppressed sigh any complaints so far she asked him her voice clear and carrying above the murmur of the helpers and the roar of the fire under the ovens just that the service is slow seneschal wendar replied mopping his bald head with his sleeve audrias teeth child how do you stand it in here you could bake the next course on the counters kero shrugged because i dont have a choice im used to it i suppose ive been here since before dawn anyway you know ive supervised everything since before mother died the simple words only called up a dull ache now that priest had been right damn him time did make sorrow fade at least it had for her time and being too busy to breathe im sorry i cant do much about the service she continued keeping an ear cocked for the sounds of the servers returning theres only so much stableboys and hireswords can learn about the servers art in a couple of candlemarks i know that my dear the seneschal a thin tiredlooking man who had been the scribe and accountant with rathgars old mercenary company laid a fatherly hand on her arm and she resisted the urge to shrug it off i think youre doing remarkably well better than i would have and i mean that sincerely i cant imagine how youve managed all this with as little help as youve had because father was too tightfisted to hire extra help for me and too full of pride to settle for anything less than a princely wedding feast lord orsen brodey consented to this marriage lord orsen brodey must be shown that we re no jumpedup barbarians even if rathgars daughter has to spend the entire feast in the kitchen with the hirelings she felt her cheeks and ears flush with anger it wasnt fair it wasntnot that she really wanted to be out in the great hall either showing off for potential suitors and their lordfathers bad enough that rathgar never thought of her worse that hed think of her only in terms of being marriage bait which he would if he ever thought past lordans marriage lordans far more important marriage after all he was the male and the heir kero was only a girl kero set her jaw and tried to look cheerful or at least indifferent but something of her resentment must have penetrated the careful mask of calm and competence she was trying to cultivate wendar patted her arm again and looked distressed i wish i could help he said unhappily i told your father three years ago whenwhen when mother died kero said shortly he coughed uh indeed i told him that you needed a housekeeper but he wouldnt hear of ft he said you were already doing very well and you didnt need any help kero clenched her teeth then relaxed with an effort somehow that doesnt surprise me father she clamped her lips tight on what she was going to say it wouldnt do any good it wouldnt change anything but the sentence went on inside her head father never really notices anything about me so long as i stay out of sight his dinner arrives on time and the keep doesnt smell like a stable i suppose if anyone had mentioned that a fourteenyearold girl shouldnt be forced into the job of keep lady alone hed have said that the girls in his village were married and mothers by fourteen never mind that the most any of them had to manage alone was a tworoom cottage and a flock of sheep and usually didnt like even that she sighed and finished her sentence in a way that wouldnt put more strain on wendar than he was already coping with father had other things to worry about and so do you wendar youve got a hall full of guests out there and no one keeping an eye on the servitors wendar swore and hurried back toward the door into the great hall just as the wave of servants returned with the dirty dishes from the last course wendar sidestepped the rush and dodged between two of them and through the doorway stuffed pigeons were next a course that required nothing more than the bread trenchers that would give the kitchen staff enough time to clean the platters now being brought in before the fish course of eel pies was served a full high feast and who was it had to figure out how our little backwoods keep could come up with enough courses to satisfy the requirements me of course tubs full of eel in the garden for days the moat stocked with fish in a netpen crates of pigeons and hens driving us all crazy lets not talk about the rest of the livestock kero rubbed her arms and rerolled the sleeves of her flourcovered homespun shirt a little higher damn these skirts breeches would be easier the helpers get to wear breeches so why cant i she wondered if dierna had any notion of how much work a high feast was she ought to shed been trained by the sisters of agnethain fact shed been sent to the sisters cloister at the ripe age of eight so she ought to have had time to learn the womanly arts dierna ought to have had proper instruction in those womanly arts too as well as the art of being womanly whatever that meant unlike kero as rathgar was so prone to remind her whenever she failed to live up to his notion of womanly selective memory she told herself bitterly he keeps forgetting that he was the one who decided he couldnt do without me wheatcrowned agnetha was rathgars idea of the appropriate sort of deity for a lady to worshipunlike wild horsetaming agnira keros favorite there was a shrine to agnetha in the keep chapel though the other aspects of the ladytrine were only represented by little basreliefs carved into the pedestal of agnethas statue there in the heart of the chapel agnetha smiled with honeyed sweetness over her twin babies her wheat sheaves at her feet her cloak of fruitladen vines around her her distaff dangling from her belt of flowers sheep gazing up at her adoringly while on the pedestal alternating snowflakes and hoofprints were all there was to show of the other two aspects agnoma and agnira rathgar approved of agnetha occasionally waxing maudlin over his somewhat sketchy devotion when in his cups well after the feast the wedding and the monthlong bridal moon kero could probably give up the keys of the keep to dierna that would bring an end to the farce of pretending to enjoy being mewed up in the kitchen stillroom or bower day after endlessly boring day dierna was pliant enough to satisfy both rathgar and his son and she seemed competent when kero had taken her on a quick tour when the girl first arrived kero shook herself out of her reverie as the servitors appeared with platters piled high with soaked trencher bread she had them dump the bread into sacks waiting for distribution to the poor time for the bowls and eelpies cook was headandshoulders deep into the oven removing the next subtlety and kero overheard one of his assistants giving orders for the pies to be carried out first hold it right there she snapped freezing the servants where they stood she stalked to the table plain brown linen skirts flaring and countermanded the order physically taking a pie away from one poor confused lad and shoving a pile of clean bowls into his hands instead the harried young man didnt care all he wanted was someone to give him the right thing to carry in and tell him what he was to do with it kero repeated the instructions shed given them all for the soup course as she passed out further piles of bowls one bowl for every two guests put the bowl between them when youve finished placing the bread go to the sideboard get trencher bread give each guest a trencher then come back and get a pie it made a kind of chant as she repeated herself for each servingman outside wendar would be directing the men to their tables no matter that theyd been going to the same places all night by now they were tired and numb with the noise and the work and all they were thinking of was when the feast could be over so they could eat and drink themselves into a celebratory stupor dierna was probably beginning to wilt under all this by now that much kero didnt envy her when the older girl had taken her on that round of the keep duties shed been a little shyand kero knew very well how sheltered the girls trained by the sisters tended to be not ignorant no the sisters made certain their charges were welleducated in the realities of life as well as domestic skills but perhaps that was the problem dierna was like a young squire who has watched swordwork all his young life and only now at fifteen was going to pick up a blade she knew what was supposed to happen but was unprepared for the reality of the situation the first of the servitors returned for his pie and kero made certain he didnt take it without a towel wrapped about his hands she wondered as she passed out towels and pies in a seemingly endless stream what rathgar would do or say the first time dinner was inedible or there were no clean shirts for him probably nothing or else hed find a way to blame kero what is wrong with the man she asked herself in frustration for the thousandth time im doing the best that i can with what he allows me it wouldnt be so bad if he didnt pick faults that no one else cares about maybe if id talked him round to doing without me and gone to the cloister she watched the cook prepare the next subtlety an enormous copy of the keep itself complete with edible landscaping and made sure that two men were assigned to carry it out the mingled odors of meat and fish and fowl werent at all appetizing right now in fact they made her stomach churn when this was all over the most shed want would be bread and cheese and maybe a little cider or maybe the problem that made her stomach churn was the thought of what could have happened if shed actually gone to the cloisters while not mages the sisters had a reputation for being able to uncover things people would rather have been left secret what if kero had gone and the reputation was more than just kitchen gossip what if the sisters had found her out father has had plenty to say about grandmother the old witch was the most civil thing hes ever called her what if hed found out he had a young witch of his own hed have birthed a litter of kittens thats what hed have done then disowned me its bad enough that i ride better than lordan and train my own beasts its worse that i hunt stag and boar with the men its worse when i wear lordans castoffs to ride but if he ever found out about my apparently being witchborn i think hed throw me out of the keep the mingled cooking odors still werent making her in the least hungry she helped cook decorate the next course with sprigs of watercress and other herbs chewed a sprig of mint to cool her mouth and told her upset stomach to settle itself what if never changes anything she reminded herself he never did more than play with the idea and he didnt want to take the chance that wendar couldnt handle things after all the only thing wendar has ever done was keep track of the books and manage the estate theres more to managing a keep than doing the accounts she set sprigs of cress with exaggerated care come to think of it wendar may have discouraged father in the first place from sending me away i suppose i cant blame him he has more than enough to do without having to run the keep too that may be why father kept saying that it wasnt convenient for me to go why did mother have to die anyway she thought in sudden anger why should i have been left with all this on my hands for a moment she was actually angry at lenorethen guilt for thinking that way made her flush and she hid her confused blushes by getting a drink from the bucket of clean drinking water in the corner of the kitchen farthest from the ovens she stared down into the bucket for a moment unhappy and disturbed why am i thinking things like that its wrong mother didnt mean to die like that it wasnt her fault and she did the best she could to get me ready when she knew she wasnt going to get better she couldnt have known father wouldnt hire anyone to help me and i guess its just as well i didnt end up with the sisters and for more reasons than having witchblood they probably wouldnt have approved of me either hunting and hawking like a boy out riding all the time at least at home ive had chances to get away and enjoy myself at the cloister id never have gotten out agnethas sheaveshow can anybody stand this without going mad kitchen to bower bower to stillroom stillroom back to kitchen potting preserving and drying then spinning and weaving and sewing running after the servants like a telltale making sure everybody does his job scrubbing and dusting and laundry polishing and mending cooking and cooking and cooking brewing and baking at least at home i can run outside and take a ride whenever it gets to be too much there was a sudden stillness beyond the kitchen door and something about the silence made kero raise her head and glance sharply at the open doorway then the screaming began for one moment she assumed that the disturbance was just something theyd all anticipated but hoped to avoid this could be an old feud erupting into new violence rathgar had after all invited many of his neighbors including men who had longstanding disagreements with each other though not with rathgar himself that was why all weapons were forbidden in the hall and not especially welcome within the keep walls except for rathgars men of course no one would have felt safe guarded by men armed only with flower garlands and headless pikes rathgar had anticipated that too much drink might awaken old grievances or create new ones and rouse tempers to blows but after that fleeting thought kero somehow knew that this was something far more serious than a simple quarrel between two hottempered men new grievance or old rathgar could handle either of those and the noise was increasing not abating and that same nebulous instinct told her that shed better not go see what was wrong in person she braced herself against the wall with one hand a hand of cold fear between her shoulder blades and she realized that it was time to try something she had seldom dared attempt inside the keep she closed her eyes and opened her mind to the thoughts of those around her the walls she had forged about her mind had been wrought painfully over the years and she didnt drop them lightly especially with so many people about at first she had thought she was going mad with grief over her mothers death but chance reading had shown her otherwise her grandmother the sorceress kethry had left several books with lenore and after her mothers death these had been given to kero along with lenores other personal possessions kero had never known what had prompted her to pick out that particular book but she had blessed the choice as goddesssent the book had proved to her that the voices she had been hearing were really the strongest thoughts of those around her more importantly to a confused young girl the book had taught her how to block those voices out but now she was going to have to remove those comforting barriers for at least a moment the clamor that flooded into her skull wasnt precisely painful but it was disorienting and exactly like being in a tiny room filled with twice the number of screaming shouting people it was intended to hold steady onits just like being in the kitchen her stomach lurched and she clutched the wall behind her as dizzy as if shed been spun around like one of lordans old toy tops pain and fear made those thoughts pouring into her mind incoherent she got brief glimpses of armed men strangers in no lords colorsmen who were filthy ragged and yet wellarmed and armored she was halfaware of the servants babbling with terror streaming through the door opposite her but most of her mind was caught up in the tangled mental panic outside that door and now she was seeing things too and she nearly threw up the strangers were making a slaughterhouse of the great hall cutting down not only those who resisted but those who were simply in their way their minds seized on hers and held it she struggled to free herself from the confusion wrenching her mind out of the desperate unconscious clutching of theirsand suddenly her thoughts brushed against something something horrible there were no words for what she felt at that moment as time stood frozen for her and she knew how a hunted rabbit must view a great slavering hound whatever this was it was cold if a thought could be cold cold as the slimy leeches living in the swampy fen below the cattle pastures there was something sly about it and filthynot a physical filth but a feeling that the mind behind these thoughts would never be contented with pleasures most folk considered normal kero couldnt quite decipher them either what she experienced was similar to what she had heard as her ability first appearedas if she were listening to someone speaking too quietly for the exact words to be made out there was only a sense of speech not the meaning but worst of all that brief brush created a change in those notquitereadable thoughts as if she had alerted the owner of the thoughts that heor sheor itwas being observed the back of her neck crawled and gooseflesh rose on her arms as the thoughts took on a new sharpedged urgency propelled by fear she managed to tear her mind away and slammed the doors in the walls of her protections closed she opened her eyes sick and sweating with fear to discover that far less time had passed than she imagined the servants were still clogging the doorway and the screaming from beyond had only increased for an instant all she wanted to do was to scream and cower with the rest of themor even faint as some of the kitchen girls had already done sprawling unnoticed beneath the table at that moment something as hard and impassive as the walls around her mind rose up to cut off her emotions suddenly she could think calmly the door to the back courtif they come in behind us well be trapped freed from the paralysis of fear she ran to the back door of the kitchen slammed it shut and dropped the iron bar of the nightlock into place across it the noise behind her was so overwhelming that the sound of the heavy bar dropping into the supports was completely swallowed up in the general chaos she whirled stood on her tiptoes to see over the mob crowding between her and the door and looked frantically for two peoplewendar and the cook wendars balding head appeared in a clear spot for a moment next to the table and she spotted the cook burly arm upraised and brandishing a poker beside him cook was snouting something but she couldnt even hear his voice above the others wendar served with father and cook takes no nonsense from anyonein fact cook looks like hes ready to lead a charge back in there she dove into the press of bodies and struggled across the kitchen elbowing and punching her way past hysterical servants who seemed to have no more sense left in them than frightened sheep as she dragged a last wailing girl out of her way by the back of her rough leather bodice kero got wendars attention by the simple expedient of grabbing his collar and dragging herself to him or more specifically to the vicinity of his ear weve got to stop them at the door she screamed hardly able to hear herself we can hold them there but if they get in here theyll kill us all most likely wendar didnt have any better idea of who they were than kero did but at least he saw the sense of her words immediately he turned and reached across the table for cooks shirt satisfied that he would handle the rest kero looked for weapons snatched up a heavy round pot lid and the longest meat knife within reach and ran for the door she reached it not a moment top soon there was no warning that the invaders had found the halfhidden stair to the kitchen he was just there a squat broad shadow in the doorway sword negligently stuck through his belt plainly expecting no resistance he paused for a moment and squinted into the brightlylit kitchen then he saw her and grinned reaching for her kero had no time to think training took over as wit failed thiss no dance lesson girl she could hear the armsmasters bellow in the back of her mind even as she slashed for the mans unprotected eyes thiss fightin o th dirtiesty hit yer man now an hit im sos e knows es friggin well been hit armsmaster dent could have been dismissed for teaching kero anything besides archery and well he knew it hed done his best to discourage her when she presented herself beside lordan for training it was only when he caught her clumsily trying blows against the pells with a practice blade too long and heavy for her and realized that rathgar would assume hed been training kero anyway if her father ever found her out there himself that he made a bargain with her in return for a reluctant promise never to touch a longer weapon he promised to teach her knifefighting he hadnt been happy about it but kero had made it very clear that it was the only way to keep her out of the armory and the practice ground knifework was as dent put it the dirtiest lowest form of combat and figuring that if she ever really needed that training it would be a case of desperation he had taught her every trick hed learned in a lifetime of street scuffling by some miracle knifework was also the only form of combat suited for the close confines of the kitchen doorway the only kind of situation where a knifefighter would be at an advantage against a swordsman in the back of her mind kero thanked whatever deity had inspired that bargain with dent and slashed again at the mans face when he evaded the wicked edge of her blade with a startled oath he reached for his own weapon hampered by the wall at his side and the stairs at his back further hampered when the quillons caught on his illkept armor then she was no longer alone cook and wendar were beside her cook armed with a spit as long as her arm in one hand and a cleaver in the other and wendar with a pot over his bald head like an oddlyshaped helm with the even longer spit used when they roasted whole pigs and calves cook stabbed at him with the wicked point of the spit and the man dodged away moving into wendars reach wendar brought the heavy castiron rod down on the mans head and caved his helm in completely the brigand fell backward but another took his place now there were more men piling down the staircase how many kero couldnt tell one of them dragged the first out of the way and the man on the stairs pulled him into darkness but the three defenders had the doorway blocked against all comers with kero going low wendar high and the cook holding the middle and protecting them both with keros pot lid then one of the young squires began lobbing ladles of hot turnips over their heads and into the faces of their opponents using the ladle like a catapult the stairs were already slippery that made them worse and no one fights well with scalding vegetables being flung in his eyes the invaders slashed and stabbed but with caution more of the servants took heart at least kero assumed they did because suddenly the doorway was abristle with knives and pokers to either side of her at that the bandits pulled back retreating up the staircase slipping and sliding on the stones it looked to kero as if more than one of them was marked and burned or bleeding it was as if she stood outside of herself a casual observer her heart was pounding in her ears yet she felt strangely calm a cluster of three of the raiders stood just out of turnipreach halfway down the staircase staring down at the defenders of the kitchen it was rather hard to see them the press of bodies in the doorway blocked the light coming from the kitchen and they themselves blotted out most of the light from above kero wished she could see their faces and shifted uneasily from her right foot to her left if they get a log from upstairs and rush us with it they could break through us she realized agnira please dont let them think of that the men seemed to be arguing among themselves kero squinted against the darkness and strained her ears but could hear nothing but the screaming from the hall beyond one of them gestured angrily in keros direction but the other two shook their heads then pulled at his arm the argumentative one shook the other mans hand off and started down the staircase he was big and very well armored with a heavy wooden shield kero shuddered as she realized that he could rush them behind that shield and give his comrades the chance to get by the bottleneck of the doorway it looked as if he had figured that out too but someone behind wendar threw a carving knife at him it was a lucky shotit thunked pointfirst into the mans buckler buried itself in the wood and remained there quivering the brigand started stumbling backward up one step and swore an unintelligible oath and he gave in to the urgings of his companions following them back up the staircase leaving the kitchen to its defenders now it was wendars turn to curse and attempt to follow panic seized her throat as she realized what he was trying to do dear goddesskero grabbed his right arm as he charged past her and hung on hampering him long enough for cook to seize his left and prevent him from charging up the staircase after their attackers stop it she shrieked more than a touch of hysteria in her voice stop it wendar you cant possibly do any good up there you arent even armed that stopped him and he stared down at the sooty greasy spit in his hands and swore oaths that made her ears burn but at least he didnt try to charge after the enemy again the table cook said which was all the direction they needed as one they turned back into the kitchen and with the help of the rest of the besieged hauled the massive table into place across the doorway turning it on its side making it into a sturdy barricade that would protect them even if the bandits charged them with a makeshift battering ram then having done all they could do they waited two kero crouched in the lee of the overturned table and tried to keep from thinking about her folk in the hall above tried to keep her heart from pounding through her chest tried to keep fear at bay for now that she was no longer fighting it came back fourfold tried not to cry there are trained fighters up there nothing you can do will make any difference for them they can take care of themselves armed or not the servants were watching her her cook and wendar she could read it in their faces in their wide eyes and trembling hands if any of the three leaders broke if any of them showed any signs of the terror kero was doing her best to keep bottled inside the rest of the besieged would panic she clutched her improvised weapons her hands somehow remaining steady but she wished she dared hide her head in her arms to block out the horrible sounds from above she wanted to scream or weep or both her throat ached her stomach was in knots why did i ever think those tales of fighting were exciting blessed trine whats going on up there are we winning or losing how could we be winning no one up there is armed wendar didnt even twitch all of his concentration was focused on the staircasehe stared up at the flickering light at the top of the stairs going alternately white and red with rage kero wished she knew what he was listening for if this wasnt hell it was close enough it seemed like an eternity later that the sounds of fighting stoppedthere was a moment of terrible silence then the wailing began thats it wendar said and vaulted over the barricade this time no one tried to stop him kero couldnt help herself she followed at his heels her skirt caught on the leg of the table as she scrambled over it she stumbled into the wall and jerked it loose tearing a rent as long as her arm in it wendar was already out of sight and she scrambled on hands and knees up the turnipslimed stairs pulling herself erect just short of the top and discovering with dull surprise that she was still holding the knife and pot lid she peered out cautiously around the edge of the door frame and her heart stopped blade and lid dropped from her benumbed hands and clattered down the stairs behind her as she stumbled forward into a scene beyond her worst nightmares someone grabbed her wrist as she staggered past wendar she realized after a moment the seneschal pulled her roughly down beside him where he knelt at the side of a man so battered and bloodcovered she didnt recognize him then he moaned and opened his eyes and she knew dent agnira bless shed helped to bind wounds many times before some of them as bad as any of these when hunters ran afoul of wolf or boarher hands knew what to do and they did it while her mind spun in little aimless circles until she was dizzy the bloodthere was just so much of it dent died under her hands but there were others too many others she moved from one to the next like a sleepwalker binding their wounds sometimes with strips from her ripped skirts sometimes with whatever else came to hand some like dent died as she tried to save them the others the lucky ones often fainted or were already unconscious by the time she found them the less fortunate screamed their agony until their throats were so raw they couldnt even whisper the hall was a bloodspattered shambles furniture overturned food trampled underfootand everywhere the women some huddled in on themselves were unable to speak eyes wide and blank with shock others shrieking wailing or sobbing silently beside their dead and wounded of all that host of guests only a handful remained calm working whitelipped and grimfaced as kero worked trying to snatch a few more lives back from lady death one ironspined woman patted keros shoulder absently as she hurried by eyes already fixed on the armsman laid out on the floor beyond the girl with a start of surprise kero recognized the granitefaced matriarch of the dunwythie family a woman whod never even nodded in keros direction before this not that it mattered nothing mattered except to stop the blood ease the pain straighten the broken limbs there wasnt a whole unwounded manatarms in the keep there wasnt an unwounded male except those few menservants whod fled to the kitchen anyone who had resisted had been killed out of hand there were young boys and women numbered among the dead and woundedsome of the dead still clutching the makeshift weaponry with which they had fought back kero had long since passed beyond mere numbness into a kind of stupor her hands bloodied to the elbow continued to work without her conscious direction her legs aching and weary carried her stumbling from one body to the next nothing broke the spell of insensibility holding heruntil the sound of her own name caught her attention then she felt someone shaking her and looked up as reality intruded into the void where her mind had gone those hands had pulled her reluctantly back to the here and now she blinked two of diernas cousins were tugging at her arms one on either side weeping and babbling at her she couldnt make out what they wanted they were absolutely incoherent with hysteria they pulled her toward the dais where the high table had been sobbing but before they had dragged her more than a few steps she heard a young male voice she knew as well as her own raised in shrill curses she pulled loose from them and half ran half staggered toward the little knot of people clustered about one particular body the voice cursed again then howled just as she reached them and pulled someonecookaway from the figure stretched out on the floor it was her brother lordan young face twisted with pain eyes staring without sense in them ranting and wailing as wendar bound up a terrible wound in his side the seneschal looked up as kero dropped to her knees beside him and then looked back to his work its not a gutstab he said around clenched teeth it missed the stomach and the lungs kelles only knows how but whether hell livethat i cant tell you without a healer he didnt have to finish the sentence kero knew very well what his chances were without the help of magic or a healers touch the wound itself probably wouldnt kill him but blood loss and infection might very well there was nothing she could do for him that wendar hadnt already taken care of she felt oddly helpless angry at her own helplessness wanting to do something and knowing there was nothing productive to be done she got slowly to her feet to hover just on the edge of the little group trying to think of anything that might increase lordans chances im of no use hereshe hated thishated being so completely out of control so afraid that her teeth chattered unless she clamped her jaw tight she looked out over the hall and saw that the last of the wounded were being tended to the dead being carried out the women too hysterical or paralyzed to do anything being herded over to one side of the hall by a group made up of the old woman who did the keeps laundry and some of the dairymaids fathershe suddenly thought wheres father she peered around the group caring for lordan looking for rathgarand only then saw the battered body laid out on the table half covered with a pall made up of a tablecovering as if already lying in state oddly enough seeing him dead wasnt a shock she wondered if shed been expecting this from the moment she first looked into the hall she knew what must have happened rathgar would have charged the brigands barehanded and emptyheaded the moment they invaded his hall pure rage overwhelming any thoughts of caution she closed her eyes and tried to summon up a dutiful tear from eyes dry with shock but all that would come was mere anger and exasperation you were a mercenary father she thought angrily at the quiet form you knew better you could have ordered the armsmen to play rearguard and gotten everyone down into the kitchen before they really swarmed the placebut you had to defend your damned keep personally didnt you you didnt think once about anything but that did you even think about getting your poor little daughterinlaw out of harms way she looked around for dierna expecting her to be among the hysterical or the halfmad and didnt see her not anywhere thinking for a moment that the girl might be hiding behind a chair or cowering in someones arms kero turned to one of diernas two cousins who had caught up with her and were clinging to each other in limp confusion where is she kero demanded if shes hurt her family will never forgive us part of her calculated their reactions as coolly as a moneychanger counted coins theyll demand satisfactionnever mind father died and lordan may not live out the night theyll want blood price and after this disaster we wont have it the girls stared at her blankly she grabbed the nearest and shook her savagely your cousin girl where is she wheres dierna the girl just stared and stammered she shook the little fool until her teeth rattled trying to pry some sense out of her but got nothing from her or her sister but tears and wailing disgusted she held the girl erect between her two strong hands and contemplated trying to slap a little sense into her shes taken croaked a painhoarsened voice from below and to the right of her elbow what kero let go of the little ninny who promptly collapsed with her sister into a soggy heap she looked down at the man whod spoken one of the keep armsmen lying against the wall on a makeshift pallet of tablecloths and bloodsoaked cloaks some of the blood was probably his he peered up at her from beneath a cap of bandaging and his right arm was strapped tightly to his side shes taken lady he repeated i saw they took her and thats when they left he coughed she seized a goblet from the floor and found a pitcher with a little wine still in it rolling under the table she knelt down beside him and helped him drink his teeth chattered against the rim of the metal goblet and he lay back down with a groan i saw it he repeated closing his eyes i been with lord rathgar for ten years now sworn man lady i dontthiss no lie i swear it there was a mage awhat for a moment she was confused what could a mage have had to do with all this carnage the armsman opened his eyes again a mage he said had to be one minute im on the wall hearin nothin seein nothinthen theres like a breath of fog kinda cold and damp an i cant move not so much as look around then this bunch of riders comes in nobody challenges emthey get in through the gates an i can see theyre scum but somebodys given em good arms the last word was choked off and he lay for a moment panting with misery while kero clutched the goblet so hard her knuckles were white still couldnt move couldnt yell he continued staring up at nothing couldnt then i hear the yellin from the hall an i can moveran right straight inright into the ones waitin for me he coughed and his face spasmed with pain waitin around blind corners like they knew the place lady got free of em made it as far as th hall thats when i seen em take the bridelord rathgar he was down gods save em they got th last of her guards an they took her an thats when the fightin stopped they just packed up and grabbed what they could an left he blinked and focused again on her i tried lady i tried now she remembered his name hewerd i know you did hewerd she said absently that seemed to satisfy him he closed his eyes and retreated into himself a magethat made sense especially when i think how father hated mages maybe he had an enemy that was a mage or became one he had other enemies too maybe one of them got together with this mage they might have been waiting a long time to catch him offguard to take revenge when he wasnt expecting it she shivered and stood up staring out over the shambles of the hall but not seeing it that must have been thethingthe dark thing i touched with my mind maybe one of fathers enemies bought a mage that could happen too it would have to be someone who knew him well enough to know that he didnt have a house mage of his own and it would have to be someone who knew about the wedding agniras teeth she shuddered hes destroyed us theres no one to go after diernathere isnt a man fit to ride in the whole keep and if we dont at least tryi know her uncle hell call bloodfeud on us kill every last one take the keep diernas uncle the powerful lord baron reichert had used the pretext of familial insult to add to his lands more than once he wasnt likely to turn down an opportunity like this oneand by the time the king found out about it the baron would have ensured that there was no one left at the keep to argue lordans innocence if they were lucky theyd escape with their lives if they werentthe baron had no percentage in their survival we wont have a chance she thought bleakly not unless someone goes after her makes a token try at rescuing her diernas sweet heartshaped face and sensitive mouth and eyes rose up like a ghost to confront her dearest gods the poor baby that last unbidden thought did something unexpected to kerowyn she was overwhelmed with dizziness and reached blindly for the support of the wall as her hand touched the wall it faded away and she was afraid she was about to collapse to faint like one of diernas foolish cousins but she didnt collapse she opened her eyesbut it wasnt the hall she was seeing it was the road and faint shapes in the moonlight a band of men on horseback for a moment she saw the girl bound and gagged and carried in front of one of the riders a tall thin man in robes rather than armor her eyes were wide with shock and fear her delicate face white and waxen and she looked closer to eleven than to fourteen anger replaced fear outrage drowned any other feelings this was not right the girl was hardly more than a child kero blinked the visionif that was what it wasfaded replaced by another a plain simple sword then her own hand taking the swordhilt as if it belonged to her but i cant again a flicker of diernas frightened eyes blessed trine only fourteen and sheltered all her life like a little glass bird and just as easy to break the visions faded leaving her staring out at the hall again the anger retreated for a moment im the only one left that could follow if i try to get her back her uncle wont have an excuse to come after lordan she hugged her arms to her chest and shiveredthen the anger returned stronger this time and dear godsall alone with those bastardsi cant just sit here playing ninny like those cousins of hers i cant it isnt honor it isnt pride it isnt any of those things in balladsits that i cant sit here knowing whats going to happen to her once they think theyre safe and not try and do something to prevent it then something else occurred to her and amid the anger and the fear there rose a tiny flicker of hope and maybe grandmother will help me suddenly following after the raiders didnt seem quite so mad a decision she turned on her heel and ran for the servants entrance but this time instead of going down she went up emerging into a corridor that ran the length of the hall itself and led to the family quarters her own room was in the first corner tower where the hallway made a rightangle bend she snatched a tallowdip and lit it at the lantern then ran up the short flight of stairs to the round room above it was cold by winter and hot by summer and drafty at all seasons but it was hers and hers alonewhich meant it held things not even lordan knew about she lit her own lamp beside the door and blew out the tallowdip as the light rose she went to the tall curtained bed and pulled the mattress off onto the floor instead of the usual network of ropesprings keros bed was one of the old style a kind of box with a wooden bottom only the bottom of this bed held a secret as she had discovered when she was a child it could be raised on concealed hinges to reveal a second shallow compartment it still held a few of her childhood treasures the dreamingpillow her grandmother kethry had sent her favorite stuffed toy horse the two wooden knights lordan had never played with and never missed when she spirited them out of his nursery and into hers but now it held besides those things her brothers castoff clothing and armor a set of light chain made for him when he first began training long since forgotten in the armory it no longer fit him he was too broad in the shoulder but it fit her perfectly she shed the ruins of her skirts with a sigh of relief and pulled on breeches stockings and sleeved leather tunic she bound up her hair as best she could debated cutting it off for a moment then decided she was going to need it under the helm the chain mail shirt came next without a squire getting into it was a matter of contortion and wriggling and enough hipwaggling to make a trollop stare it caught in her hair despite her best efforts she jerked her head and the caught strands were torn out of her scalp with the weight of the mail finally she settled it into place jingling noisily with a final shake of her hips it covered her from neck to knee slit before and behind so the wearer could ride another leather jerkin went over it to muffle the inevitable jangling of the rings she pulled on her riding boots then turned and headed for the door but all she had in the way of weapons were her knives i dont know how to use a sword she thought hesitating with one hand on the door handle but knives arent much use against a longer weapon maybe id better take one anyway so instead of going back the way shed come she headed for her brothers rooms and his small private armory hopefully the raiders wouldnt have gotten that far lordans rooms were farther down the darkened hall halfway between her tower and what had been her mothers solar kero had never had the leisure to play the lady over a bowerful of maids nor had she really ever cared for fine sewing even if shed had the leisure for it so the solar had been closed up until such time as lordan took a bride or rathgar remarried and since the latter had never occurred lordan had used the solar as a place to keep his arms and armor so that he wouldnt have to tend it down in the cold uncomfortable and gloomy armory doubtless their father would have had a fit if hed known but kero hadnt seen any reason to tell him if lordan wanted to polish his swords up in the sunfilled solar why not sun had never harmed metal or boys so far as kero had ever heard she pushed the door open and went in the moon shown full through the solar windows and the armor on its stand looked uncannily like lordan for a moment it gleamed a soft silver where the moonlight struck reflections from the polished metal and those reflections gave it a momentary illusion of movement lordans swords were hung from the racks where shuttles for the looms had been kept in lenores day kero knew the one she wanted one of lordans earliest blades a light shortsword the closest thing to a knife and hence the one she could probably use the easiest if it came to that lady agnira grant it doesnt she buckled the belt over her tunic hesitated a moment more then resolutely helped herself to a little round helm with a noseguard hanging on the wall beside it it might not be much in the way of protection but it was better than a bare head lordans rooms next door had a private stair to the stables outside normally locked but she and lordan had made enough illicit moonlight expeditions that shed long ago learned how to pick the clumsy old lock in the dark the door was still locked but her hands though they shook a little still remembered how to tease the lock with the thin blade of her knife she forced herself to breathe slowly told herself that this was nothing out of the ordinary leaned against the door frame and tried not to think about what she was doing it worked the lock clicked and the door swung open hinges creaking the stairs gave out on the tackroom and the shielded light normally kept burning there made her blink eyes watering but there were no sounds of restless horses beyond the door and the tackroom itself was a shambles as her eyes adjusted to the light and she picked her way over the saddles and other tack strewn over the floor she saw whythere were no horses to hear the stall doors stood wide open what beasts the brigands hadnt stolen had doubtless been driven off witless things that horses were they were undoubtedly scattered to the four winds running until they foundered so much for sending someone for help she thought bleakly not even the guests are going to be able to send their own people back not until some time tomorrow at the earliest someone had planned this very well indeed with one small exception kero hurried to one stall that would have been empty even if one of the guests hadnt brought a highbred palfrey to install there though this was the stall reserved for keros riding beast her shinainbred mare spent most of her time in the pastures from the time the last of the winters snow cleared off until the first of it appeared kero generally kept verennas tack hung over the side of the stall it didnt take up much room since she had never permitted anything other than shinain tack on the young mares back the one thing rathgar was an expert on was horses and hed taught his children himself kero tended and trained verenna with her own hands unless there was an urgent need for her to be otherwise occupied the tack was still there blanket a saddle with lightweight stirrups that was hardly heavier than the blanket bitless bridle and reins she gathered it all up slipped the hackamore over her arm and took her back way out of the stables out into the pasture some of the horses had either jumped the fence or been driven out hereshe saw them in the moonlight dark shapes milling around at the end of the pasture whinnying their distress catching them was going to be impossible until theyd tired themselves out pray verenna hasnt gotten caught up in their panic she thought biting her lip if she has best not to think about it kero pursed her lips and whistled shrilly three times and very nearly jumped out of her skin as something warm and soft shoved her in the small of the back gods she managed to kill the scream trying to tear its way up out of her throat before she frightened the mare but she did drop all the tack startling the young horse so that she shied a little and danced away nervously kero for her part just stood and shook for a moment a very long moment in fact so long that verenna got over her startlement and picked her way cautiously back toward her rider before kero had entirely recovered the horse nuzzled her anxiously and kero found the steadiness to reach for verenna and scratch her ears while she regained the last of her own composure finally she was able to take the hackamore off her own arm and slip it over verennas nose without her hands shaking so much that shed be unable to get the band over the mares ears saddling verenna was a matter of moments the mare stood on command quietly as shed been taught while kero slung the saddle and blanket over her back and fastened the girth chest and rump bands were next as kero fumbled the buckles a little in the dark then kero snugged the girth tight against her barrel verenna snorted a little but was being remarkably wellbehaved under the circumstances which is just as well kero admitted as she put her foot in the stirrup and pulled herself up onto verennas back im not sure what id do if she decided to get out of hand she rode the mare up to the fence then leaned over and grabbed the latch on the gate the pasture gate could be opened from horseback and verenna remained quiet though a little jumpy throughout the entire maneuver at least i dont have the others crowding up around this end waiting for a chance to bolt verenna was a very lightfooted beast and hardly made more noise than a goat as she pivoted in place so that kero could pull the gate shut and latch it closed kero was counting on that shed need every advantage she had against the raiders verenna automatically turned southward as they moved away from the gate at a fast walk kero normally rode her along the game trails in the keeps wild lands and the shortest way there was along the road south she shivered under the saddle horses are creatures of habit and her world had been turned all round about this evening first by the invasion of strange men and horses into her pasture then by keros arrival on the heels of the chaos this business of riding out in the middle of the night had the mare nervous and confused and now kero confused her still further by turning her in an entirely opposite direction to the one she expected westward not southward and away from the hunting lands and the main village she stopped snorted again and bucked a little kero held her head down and she fought the reins for a moment more then settled shaking her head poor baby you dont know what were doing out here in the middle of the night do you kero let her stand for a moment until she stopped shivering then loosened her reins and gave her a touch of the heel obedient but still snorting a little in protest the mare headed into the west up to the least hospitable side of the valley along a faint track that led to the border of the keep lands their road stayed a track only so long as it lay within the keeps borders from there it turned into a goat path then into a game trail verenna didnt like it at all it was bordered by clumps of bushes that swayed and rustled alarmingly and overhung by trees that made it difficult for either her or her rider to see the path any horse bred by the shinain nomads could pick her way across uneven ground in conditions much worse than this but that didnt mean she had to like it her ears were laid back and kero sensed by the tenseness of her muscles that the least little disturbance would make her shy and possibly bolt a spooky enough road for a visit to a witch kero kept looking sharply at every movement she caught out of the corner of her eye and starting a little at every sound she was just as bad as verenna when it came down to it this was the way to her grandmothers home called kethrys tower kero hadnt been up this road very often but she knew it well enough as a child shed been taken here either pillion behind a groom or on her own fat pony and the visits had been at least once a month later though as lenore became ill shed gone no oftener than twice a yearand since her mothers death she hadnt gone at all not that she hadnt wanted to but although rathgar hadnt expressly forbidden it hed certainly made his disapproval known kero had her hands full running the keep and somehow there never seemed to be enough time to visit her grandmother and grandmother had never sent any messages urging a visit either so perhaps she hadnt wanted any visitors and maybe she still doesnt but thats a chance ill have to take as kero remembered it the place wasnt exactly a tower it was more like a stone fortress somehow picked up and set into the side of a cliff kero scrubbed at her burning eyes with her sleeve wishing that the keep had been as impregnable as that towerit always looked to her as if it had been grown into the cliff side or perhaps carved into the living rock and the only access to it was along a steep narrow stairway witch and sorceress her grandmother might be but she took no chances on the possibility of having unfriendly visitors verenna stumbled and kero steadied her now that they were away from the keep the normal night sounds surrounded them as if nothing at all had happened back there tonight off in the distance an owl hooted and beyond the clopping of verennas hooves kero heard tiny leafrustlings as nocturnal animals foraged for their dinners mother said that grandmother had offered to build the keep into something like the tower and father refused she remembered suddenly why he wasnt normally that stupid to refuse help was it just that he didnt want to be any further in grandmothers debt that could have been it every thumbs length of property that rathgar called his own was actually his only through lenore and had come as her dowry and he had resented it kero was certain of that rathgar was not the kind of man who liked to be in debt to anyone stubborn headstrong determined to make his own way to depend on no one and nothing but himself and to allow nothing to interfere with his plans for his lands and children but he loved mother she thought letting verenna pick her way through the thin underbrush i know he loved mother and not just her lands he used to bring her meals and feed her with his own hands when she was too weak to even move he never said a cruel word to her ever he never once even looked at another woman while she was alive and i dont think he wanted to look at another one after she was gone verennas eyes were better in this light than keros were basically all she had to do right now was keep from falling off and stay alert for stray bandits or wild animals it was hard to believe that rathgar was really dead oh father she thought about all the happy times shed spent in his presence how hed taught her to hunt how proud hed been of her scholarship he could hardly write his own name she thought with a lump in her throat yet he was so proud of me and lordan and mother he used to boast about how learned we were to his friends he used to tell them about how i could keep books better than wendar and how lordan was writing the family historyand then hed drag lordans chronicles out and have me read them out loud to everyone after dinner and he used to tell us both how we were following in grandfather jadreks footsteps and how respected grandfather had been and how we should be proud to live up to his example she could see him even now sitting on the side of lenores bed with lordan at his right and herself at his left and whatever book they happened to be reading on his lap dont be like me hed say solemnly dont pass up your chance to learn look at metoo ignorant to do anything but swing a swordif it hadnt been for your mother id probably be living in a bar somewhere throwing out drunks by night and mopping the floor by day and with that hed look back over his shoulder and hed stretch out his hand and gently touch lenores fingertips and theyd both smile what happened she asked herself around the tears that choked her throat i know he changed after mother died was it because i wasnt able to be like her he became so critical thats all i ever saw there were times when i wondered if he hated meand times when i wondered if he even knew i was alive maybe if i hadnt been so completely opposite from mother maybe we could have gotten along better verenna stopped for a moment ears pricked forward and kero hastily rubbed her eyes then peered into the moondappled shadows beneath the trees ahead of them she slipped her knife from its sheath as she heard a repetition of the sound that had alerted the horse in the first place a rustling noiseas if something very large was threading its way through the brush a crash that sent her heart into her throatand then it stood in the moonlight on the path a stag verenna shied the stag saw them and with a flip of its tail dove into the brush on the other side of the trail keros heart started again and she urged verenna forward the mare didnt want to go and was sweating when kero forced her to obey but once they were past the spot where the stag had appeared she calmed down a bit maybe it was because he thought i wasnt listening to him about schooling she thought trying to calm the mare further with a firm hand on her neck i know he thought i should be spending more time reading and less with the horses dammit i passed every test the tutor ever set me is it bad that i like to be outside that i hate being cooped up inside four walls when i could be out doing things whats wrong with that a books all right when the weathers foul and theres nothing else to do but why sit and read when the wind is calling your name shed never been able to figure that out lordan thoughevery chance he had he was at a book or driving the tutor mad with questions it was as if he got all of keros love of learning as well as his own books dear gods he owns more books than anyone i know and if he gets his way hes going to spend half diernas dower on more books if hes still alive to do it her eyes stung and watered again and her throat knotted she rubbed her sleeve across her eyes and wondered if hed live the night if i can just get grandmother down to the keep if shes got the kind of power everyone seems to think she does father would have had a cat if hed known about the stories i used to pick up in the kitchen they say she built the tower in one night with magic just before she moved out of the keep and gave it to mother as her wedding present they say she has a giant wolf and a demonlizard for familiars they say she can kill you or heal you just by looking at you and if only half of thats true she surely will have what i need to save lordan and get dierna back kero bent over verennas neck to keep from getting hit in the face by a series of lowhanging branches and thought about what shed ask for something that shot lightning perhaps a magic wand that called up demons exploding arrows maybe the help of that giant wolf with magic even i ought to be able to get dierna away and magic can surely save lordan unless grandmother doesnt care what happens to us the thought made her heart freeze and every succeeding thought seemed worse than the first she never once sent a messenger or anything after mother died maybe she was angry with father for taking mother away from her maybe she really hates the rest of us maybe she thinks we all hate her and shes gone all sour and mean maybe the magic has gotten to her brain and shes gone mad lady kerowyn said a voice out of the dark three lady kerowyn said a voice from beneath the shadows of the trees frightening the breath out of her closing her throat with an icy hand there was no warning no movement beside the road just a voice coming out of the darkness it was a voice as harsh as the croaking of crows and kerowyn jerked letting out an involuntary squawk of surprise as she reined in verenna the mare jumped and squealed dancing madly backward but fortunately didnt bolt her heart felt like a lump of frozen stone her pulse rang in her ears as she wrestled verenna to a standstill hands trembling on the reins she peered at the dark shadowshapes under the trees there was something there but she couldnt even make out if it was human or not much less if it was male or female and that voice certainly didnt tell her anything who are you she replied hoping her own voice wasnt going to break what do you want i live here replied the voice which is more than i can say for you what are you doing out here beyond your fathers lands lady kerowyn why arent you safe in your bed in your fathers keep it sounds like an old woman kero decided a really nasty old woman the kind that makes her daughterinlaws life a misery oddly enough the mockery in the old womans voice and words made her feel calmerand angrier which is more than i can say for you indeed if you really live here you know that the sorceress lady kethryveris is my grandmother she called back i need to see her and id appreciate it if you got out of the way youre frightening my horse in the middle of the night the old woman retorted dressed in mens clothing carrying a weapon she moved out into the middle of the path blocking it but still in enough shadow that kero couldnt see her as anything other than a cloaked and hooded shape what kind of fools errand are you on girl kero tightened all over with anger inadvertently making verenna rear and dance when she got her mare and herself under a little better control she told the old woman of the raid in as few words as possible though she wondered why she was bothering im going to ask my grandmother for help she finished now if youll please get out of my way dressed like that the woman produced a short bark of a laugh like a fox i think you have something else planned i think you reckon to follow after these raiders and try to rescue this girl they took and what if i do kero retorted raising her chin angrily what business is it of yours youre a fool girl the old woman said acidly then hawked and spat in the dust of the path just in front of verennas hooves youre a moonstruck fool thats a job for men not silly little girls with their heads stuifed full of tales youre probably acting out of ignorance or out of pride and either one will get you killed go back to your place girl go back to womens work go back where you belong every word infuriated kero even more she went hot then cold with ire and by the time the old woman had finished she was too angry at first even to speak verenna was no help she reacted both to keros anger and to something the mare sawor thought she sawunder the trees as verenna danced and shied the mares panic forced her to calm herself down in order to control the horse she finally brought verenna to a sweating eyerolling standstill a scant length from the old woman whoever she was the old hag was at least as foolhardy as she accused kerowyn of being for she hadnt moved a thumbs length out of the way during the worst of verennas antics what i do or plan to do has nothing to do with pride kero said tightly through clenched teeth as verenna tossed her head and snorted in alarm theres no one left down there thats capable of riding out after her no one old woman not one single man able to ride and lift a weapon all thats down there is a handful of frightened servants and pages and two old arthritic men who never learned to ride if i dont go after dierna no one will if i wait until that socalled proper help arrives shell be dead or worse people who intend to ransom a captive dont ride in and try to slaughter every ablebodied adult in the place i dont have a choice old woman she wanted to say more and couldnt fear stilled her voice in her throat she was rightbuteverything i said is trueandeverything she said is true this is going to get me killed but ive come too far to turn back now i made my choices back at the keep i made my choices and im going to live or die by them she finished hoping she sounded brave but all too aware that she probably sounded like a foolhardy braggart and im going to see my grandmother whether you bar the way or not she touched her heels to verennas sides and the mare bolted forward the old woman stepped adroitly aside at the last possible moment and they cantered past her and were out of sight or hearing in a few moments kero reined the mare in as soon as shed run out some of her nerves the path was still just as dark and potentially treacherous and the last thing i need is for verenna to break her leg within sight of the tower i should be in sight of the tower by now she thought looking upward through the branches of the trees that old womanin tales shed either be a demon sent by the mage that took dierna to turn me back or a creature of grandmothers sent to test me if shes a demon the next thing will be a whole swarm of them after me the back of her neck crawled at that thought and she could not resist the temptation to stop turn and look down the path behind her nothing just the moving shadows of tree limbs and an owl winging silently across the road even verenna seemed calmer no longer fighting the reins no longer sweating so much for the tales she thought a little embarrassed by her wild fears sometimes a crazy old woman is just a crazy old woman the tower was exactly as kero remembered it or at least the little of it she could see in the darkness was exactly as she remembered halfway up the side of the cliff a single light burned beside the door there might have been a fainter light coming from a curtained or shuttered window above that but it was too faint for kero to be sure it was there verenna whickered inquisitively as she dismounted the trees and brush had been cut away for several lengths at the bottom of the cliff leaving a wide expanse of meadow not a carefully manicured and tended meadow though this one was kneehigh in grass and wildflowers and looked very much like a natural clearing the moon shone down on this swath of grass unhindered by brush or trees making it possible for kero to see quite clearly there was a hitching post beside the beginning of the staircase a steep narrow open stone stair not even a shinainbred horse was going to be able to negotiate that it was barely wide enough for a single human and its a good thing i have a head for heights she thought soberly eyeing the stair dubiously oh well she tethered verenna to the hitching post giving her enough leadrope so that shed be able to graze a little its too late for wolves and too early for mountaincats i hope once again she looked back down the path and once again saw and heard nothing out of the ordinary she turned and started up the staircase with one hand on the rough stone wall resolutely looking at the steps and not over the open side the stone beneath her hand was still warm from the afternoon sun she forced herself to hurry as much as she dared taking the relatively shallow steps two at a time shed have run but the footing was too uncertain and the light was deceptive by the time she reached the top she was feeling the strain in her legs she paused for a moment to square her shoulders and lift her chin then hefted the cold metal ring set into the door and knocked the first blow sounded dull as if the door was a lot thicker than it looked the door began to open before she had a chance to finish the second knock she released the iron ring hastily before it would be snatched out of her hand a lantern she had not seen bloomed into life beside the door as it opened the soft yellow light fell on a silverhaired greeneyed woman who bore a strong resemblance to keros mother lenore except for her hair she showed few signs of age she was as slim and erect in her soft bluevelvet gown as any girl and moved gracefully if slowly there were a few crowsfeet around her eyes concentrationlines on her brow and smilelines at either corner of her mouth but otherwise her face was unwrinkled she was exactly as kero remembered herwhich was eerie she should have shown some signs of increasing age kerowyn the sorceress frowned i knew there was something wrong butnever mind come in kero edged cautiously past her grandmother careful not to touch her and tried not to stare there was no telling what shed take offense at and kero had to keep repeating to herself that this strange ageless woman was her grandmother i cant believe she still looks like this mother looked older and not just because she was so sick kethry turned away to close the door and kero took the opportunity to glance around while her back was turned there was no anteroom she found herself in some kind of public room that took up the entire bottom floor of the tower it was full of comfortable clutter the kind of things kero would have expected to find in any womans rooms ordinary things an embroidery frame by the window a basket of yarn and knitting beside the fire cushions piled carelessly everywhere what furniture there was tended to be worn overstuffed and looked as if it saw heavy use kero shivered despite the unexpected warmth of the room the lighting was concentrated near the fire leaving the rest of the room in shadow and kero wasnt certain she wanted to look too deeply into any of those shadows kethry closed the door with a dull thud but did not shoot the bolt home kero looked back at her hoping she hadnt noticed her granddaughters wandering attention she turned with a frown on her face though kero could not tell if it was because of her or for some other reason kero clasped her hands behind her back nervously and waited for her grandmother to speak i felt somethingwrongdown in the valley kethry said vaguely her brow creased and her eyes looking somewhere past keros shoulder something magical ive been expecting a messenger since i pledged rathgar when he wed lenore that i would not enter his domain uninvitedbut i didnt expect that messenger to be you she promised fatherdear agnira kero took a deep breath and stored that bit of information away for later if there was a later she looks so oddblessed trine i hope she hasnt gone senileim the only one fit to ride lady kethryveris she began grandmother kethry interrupted tartly her focus sharpening for a moment i am your grandmother it wont hurt to say so sit she continued gesturing at a bench by the door as she took a seat opposite it what happened down there that they sent you to bring me word kero nodded a shiver of real fear going up her back and gulped no shes not senile if she still admits shes my grandmotherwants to admit itmaybe she will help usgrandmother nobody sent me nobody could send me i came by myself itsits horrible she told the story a second time watching as kethry grew more and more distantand more and more collectedwith every word by the time she was halfway through her grandmother looked like the powerful remote creature the stories made her out to be and kerowyn continued a sick leaden feeling in the pit of her stomach trying not to break down in front of this selfpossessed regal woman but she began to relive the tale as she told it her stomach churned and her throat began to close with harshly suppressed sobs i have to get through this i have to make her believe me i cant do that if im crying like a baby she managed to sound relatively calm or at least she thought she did until she got to the part where shed first come up from the kitchen she faltered stammered a littlethen clenched her teeth and plowed onward but she kept seeing the bodies and then she came to the part where she saw her own family fallen victim first lordan then rathgar that was too much she lost every bit of her composure and fell completely apart there was a brief flurry of movement as her grandmother roseand warm arms clasped and held her she found herself sobbing into a bluevelvet covered shoulder found her grandmother holding her as no one had held her since her mother died it was something she hadnt known she needed until it happened she cried all the tears and fears shed held in since this nightmare began cried until her eyes were swollen and sore and her nose felt raw kethry didnt say a word simply held her stroking her hair from time to time and it was with a great deal of reluctance that she freed herself from that comforting embrace to finish the story she had to do so with her eyes shut tightly against the tears that threatened to come again her throat thick and her hands knotted into fists are you going to be all right kethry asked when she had finished kero took a deep breath opened her eyes and shrugged ill have to be she replied i told you im the only one left kethry nodded pushed her down into a chair and narrowed her eyesand turned from comforter to something far different the sorceress face lost all animation she cooled she became somehow remote the men she said dispassionately describe them again they didnt look like much kero replied falteringly ratty looking like banditscum the kind wed never hire except that their armor was awfully good it wasnt new but it wasnt dirty enough for them to have had it long no badges no insignia not that i saw she said hardly knowing what to think how did it fit them her grandmother persisted what now kero really was perplexed her grandmother looked impatient youre no dunce child how did it fit them well or badly too big too small places where it was just held together by juryrig straps uh now that she thought back on it the armor for the most part had fit badly gaping places where it was too small on some men toolarge mail shirts spilling over knuckles on others badly mostly ah are you sure you dont want to go back and see if theres someone that can go after dierna besides you she gave kero a measuring look you look to me as if youve done enough already i wouldnt say youre up to this personally no kero said as forcefully as she could kethry nodded and changed the subject did it seem as if anyone was the leader the questioning went on until kero was ready to scream for the wasted time and kethry kept asking her if she was certain she didnt want to go back she answered everything as honestly as she could but it almost seemed as if her grandmother was now looking for an excuse to dismiss her and her plea out of hand before shed even had a chance to voice it she certainly was just as discouraging and disparaging as the old woman down on the trail had been shes not going to listen she thinks this was all fathers fault and she doesnt care what happens to the rest of us kero was shaking now there was a light in kethrys eyes that she didnt in the least like hard and colduncaring perhaps the sorceress face was unreadable still when kethry seemed to have come to the end of her questions and stood up to pace back and forth with her arms crossed deep in thought kero took a deep breath and made her carefully rehearsed speech before her grandmother could tell her to take herself off ill never have another chance grandmother she said urgently i have to go after dierna if i dontthere wont be anything left of the family by the time her uncle gets done with bloodfeud he might leave me alivebut not lordan kethry blinked and seemed to shake herself out of an entrancement i actually know that child she said dryly ive had dealings with baron reichert before that man wouldnt be satisfied if he devoured the world in factnever mind ill tell you later so what do you want out of me help kero cried lordan wont live out the night without a healerand i need help too a magic weapon something that will make it possible for me to get dierna away from those bandits a lightningcaller a tame demonsomething that can attack them from a distance so i dont have to get too close they arent bandits girl kethry interrupted her brow creased with a frown at least that mage isnt whoever whatever he is hes good he hid his presence from me right up to the time of the attackand he wants a virgin girl for something i would guess he was hired and the girl is his price for this nights work i suspect your father made one enemy too many and that enemy has decided to extract a complete revenge and end him and his line or else she gave kero a sharp glance and didnt complete her surmise theres something she knows that i dont kero realized suddenly something she isnt going to tell me i still need a weapon grandmother she persisted and lordan lordan will survive until i get there the sorceress said abruptly turning so quickly that keros heart jumped trust me on that and as for your going after those banditswhat makes you think you can do anything you arent trained in magery or weaponry i have to try kero said stubbornly i have to theres no one else and you told me what diernas uncle why you kethry repeated why not me kero stood up as tall as her shaking knees were permitting and raised her chin defiantly why not meif youll help i can do it you did more with less when you were my age she was all worked up and ready to say a lot more but to her surprise kethry nodded theres truth in that child her grandmother said softly more truth than you know and now i know who it is ive been waiting for all these years waiting for stay there the sorceress crossed the room to one of the shadowshrouded corners and bent over a chest opening it with a creak of iron hinges she turned with a long slender shape in her hands and as she moved into the light again kerowyn could see that it was a sword not a very impressive blade the hilt was plain leatherwrapped metal and the sheath was just as plain here kethry said holding it out to her lets see if shell take to you she kero reached forward to take the hilt without thinking and as she clasped it kethry pulled away the sheath for a moment no more than a breath writing blazed up on the blade itself as fiery and whitehot as if the sword had just come from the heart of a forge kero gasped but kethry only nodded unsurprised she wants you all right child youre the only one of my daughters or granddaughters shes spoken for shes yours nowor youre hers kethry slid the sheath back over the now perfectly ordinary looking blade take your pick when she speaks i dont think anybody denies her what did it say kero asked aware ofsomethingin the back of her mind a testingbut distracted by what her grandmother had just said granddaughters daughters i thought mother womans need calls me as womans need made me her need will i answer as my maker bade me kethry tilted her head sideways to fix kero with a penetrating stare this is my sword need granddaughterthe sword i wore for most of my life your sword now for well or ill youre bound to her like youll never be bound to another living thing man or woman but i dont think youll rue the bargain kerowyn almost dropped the sword in her surprise this was kethrys famous blade even she had heard stories about this sword bbbut i dont know how to you wont have to kethry said confidently shell take care of you at least in this instance she willwell youll see kero managed to stop gaping and slid the sheath onto her belt removing the old blade shed taken from lordans armory grandmother she said slowly looking from the sword to kethry and back again a few moments ago you wanted me to go back home now youve given me thisand youre all but throwing me after those raiders why kethry clasped her hands behind her and stepped back a few paces looking kero up and down with a distinctly satisfied expression i was testing you she said calmly what youre about to do is going to change your life forever oh dont look so skeptical i know what im talking about it will and the road youre about to take is not for the fainthearted but you seem to be made of stronger stuff than poor lenore kethry nodded slowly yes indeed i think youll do what happened one moment kero was standing in the middle of kethrys tower staring at her grandmother then there was a moment of dizziness as if the floor had dropped out from beneath her and she found herself here at the foot of the stairs she blinked and the moonlit meadow wavered a little in front of her eyes dizzyblessed trineshe staggered two steps forward her hand outstretched in front of her stopping herself on verennas shoulder the mare snorted in alarm and jumped as if she hadnt known kero was there until that moment the dizziness vanished she looked up suddenly only to see the light in the tower blink out leaving it entirely dark gods she stared up at the tower but could make nothing out in the shadowsand something told her that if she climbed all the way back up again she could pound her fists bloody on that door and never raise a soul shed gotten all the answer she was going to get at least for now she looked back down at the sword hanging from her belt it was not the one shed gotten from the keep it was the one she remembered her grandmother giving her she stroked the mares neck to calm her i think ive been dismissed verenna she said quietly i didnt get the answer i came for but maybe i got a better one she thought slowly and at any rate its the only one im going to get she clenched her jaw and mounted before she could turn coward come on girl she said to the mare turning her back down the trail the way they had come weve got a hard ride in front of us tarma shena talesedrin kalenedral warrior of the shinain clan of the hawk urged her tall gray warsteed a little faster up the backtrail to kethrys tower the mare snorted an objection as she moved from an amble into a running walk she didnt like taking the back way at night and she didnt like to be rushed at the end of a journey youre going to like whats coming up even less old girl tarma told the mare patting her coarsecoated neck you only think youre getting a warm stable and a rest im afraid were going to be turning right back around as soon as we find out what my partners planning so youre going to follow the girl asked a rough voice as familiar to her as her own in the back of her mind a voice carrying overtones of approval good i like her id have followed her alone if youd refused she has courage oh that certainly lots of guts not too many brains but thats the way of things when youre young tarma retorted to the shaggy calfsized beast trotting along with its head level with her stirrup the kyree turned its lupine head up so that his great glowing eyes met hers and blinked exactly reminds me very much of a certain barbarian shinain i knew many years ago barbarian tarma exclaimed as her mares ears swiveled back with surprise whos calling who a barbarian youre the one who eats his meat raw and fishblessed goddess thats a vile thought cooking ruins the flavor warrl replied haughtily some of the most civilized beings in the world eat their fish raw dear goddess no wonder they die young yes im going after her i just want to find out what keth has in mind for both of us tarma reminded her mare with a touch of her heels that she was supposed to be trotting the mare grunted and grudgingly increased her speed have you picked up anything more from keths magealerts down on the keep no warrl creature of the magicriddled pelagir hills had some mageabilities of his own how much hed never told tarma or her partner hed been able to throw off magical attacks in the past that would have killed a man hed once managed to feign death pull tarma out of a demonsent trance and smell the presence of mageenergy he was also able to speak mindtomind with tarmawhich meant she assumed that he could do so with anyone he chose shed been quite grateful for those abilities in the past and never more so than tonight shed actually been within a couple of leagues of the tower returning from her annual visit to clan talesedrin when warrl had sensed the alarms kethry had placed on the keep sounding a dangersignal theyd pushed their pace knowing keth was going to need themonly to have warrl sense the girl riding hellforleather straight for the tower herself he knew her of course he knew all of kethrys children and grandchildren whether or not they knew him hed played spy for kethry often enough rathgar didnt know of the kyrees existence and what he didnt know about he couldnt forbid wards excursions to the keep were often the only things that kept kethry from violating her sworn word theyd stopped kerowyn easily enough even a shinainbred horse didnt readily pass something as large and carnivorous as a kyree tarma had played a part then testing her while she and warrl extracted information from the girls words and mind tarma had sensed the despair in her voice the fear she had been trying to cover with bravado poor child the shinain thought wishing she was already guarding the childs back wishing shed dared to be sympathetic she wasnt ready for this im glad you intercepted her the kyree said evidently following her thoughts she still might have tried something like this if shed been as featherheaded and stuffed full of tales as you accused her of being if shed been like her mother she isnt stareyed be thanked tarma had very little use for lenore living or dead but then while lenore had been alive the antipathy had been mutual contempt on tarmas side fear mingled with disdain on lenores warrl teased his mindmate by calling her a barbarian lenore had meant it lenore wouldnt have done anything other than faint though and have hysterics girls well rid of that father though the boy has promise well get her through this one then well see she finds out about her kin and clanthen she can make up her mind about what she really wants to do with herself get her through this one first the kyree interrupted she is brave and resourceful but but my rump i did more with less at her age tarma said with more certainty than she felt shes what sixteen seventeen no real weapons training dear gods i was trained all my life then retrained by the leshyae kalenedral uncomfortable thoughts best to get all the plans straight then go see that the girl survived this quest of hers she nudged the mare again bringing her up to a canter the mare knew every pebble of the way from this point and tarma didnt want to waste any time getting on kerowyns backtrail warrl barked once then put on the wild burst of speed of which his kind was capable and sprinted ahead of her toward the dark craggy bulk of the cliff housing the tower when tarma pulled her mare up at cliffside warrl was nowhere in sight which meant hed gone on ahead the lady is saddling up came his mental call thinned by rock and distance we are in the stable light from a full moon directly overhead showed that the path here curved around the side of what looked to be sheer rock face heading toward the stair that led to the tower itself the rough granite gave lodgingroom here only to occasional scrub trees and bushes and a little moss there was no sign whatsoever of a stable which was of course exactly as kethry intended the mare tossed her head as tarma dismounted stiffly her right hip aching a little from the long ride it would have been nice if this mess had managed to happen some time next week she reflected wistfully trying to flex some mobility back into her legs give me a chance to get a hot bath my own bed for a few nights ah im getting soft in my old age as often as she pulled this trick the mare still balked when it came to going through the hidden entrance tarma pulled off the scarf that had held her hair out of her eyes all day and blindfolded the mare with it and walked into the side of the cliff leading the docile horse this trick wouldnt work for just anyone of course only those keth had keyed into the spell for anyone else that granite cliffface wasnt illusion it was real and solid enough to climb tarma still hadnt made up her mind about it and like the mare she didnt much enjoy passing through it she kept thinking that one day something was going to go wrong and shed get stuck halfway through three steps through absolute darkness then she and her mare emerged into the tunnel that led to the towers stables the tunnel the stable and the door were the only extravagances keth permitted herself in the way of magic the tunnel and stable had been carved from the living rock by magic and were illuminated by permanent witchlights the rock walls of the tunnel were planed and polished until the granite shone like marble and the yellow globes of witchlights brightened just ahead of her and dimmed after she had passed austere but attractive was what warrl had called it it gave tarma a case of claustrophobia her footsteps and the mares echoed up and down the tunnel announcing their arrival oddly enough the towerwhich everyone seemed to think keth had magicked into placehad already been here when theyd first had their schools at what was now the keep besides the obvious way in thered been an escape route down through the cellars that was what keth had enlarged into the stables and tunnel and had concealed with her magic the end of the tunnel was considerably brighter than the tunnel itself tarma blinked a little when she led the mare out into the stable proper as warrl had advised kethry was already at work shed already saddled her mount and loaded it with packs of medicinal gear kethry was no fool shed changed into one of her old traveling outfits kneelength hooded robe and breeches both of soft but sturdy beige wool now the sorceress had gotten her gray warsteed to kneel so that she could mount the mares saddle while tarma might still be able to mount unaided these days keth couldnt and made no pretenses about the fact poor keth she moves so gracefully no one ever guesses how much her bones ache we are not what we were mindmate warrl acknowledged ruefully he had flung himself down beside the cool stone wall where he lay panting after his run now that he was in the light he was even more impressive not even a wolfhound or the grasscats of the dhorisha plains could best him for size he couldand hadsnapped a mans leg in half with those formidable jaws your timing couldnt have been better sheenedra the sorceress said as her mare heaved herself to her feet i saw you were almost home when i checked this morning then when i sensed the trouble in the valley i checked on you first and caught your little conversation with kerowyn she checked all the fastenings on the packs as she spoke making sure nothing was going to come loose im going to the keep to see what i can do dont worry i just came down here to tell you ill be playing guardian to the girl tarma interrupted you didnt have to ask she isnt as helpless as you might think kethry said knotting her long silver hair up on the back of her head and pinning it there securely she turned her emerald eyes on her partner and tarma for once could not read them so she raised an eyebrow ineed woke for her silence four daughters a host of granddaughters and fosterlingsnot to mention all the studentsnot one of which woke even a spark from that piece of tin dear and most precious gods for once the damned thing picked a good time to poke its nose in if a sword has a nose tarma took a deep breath quite well aware that her oathbound sister was waiting for some kind of reaction shes neither fighter nor mage so whats it going to do for her kethry wheeled her mare and got her head pointed toward the tunnel whatever it has to protect her from magic make her fight like a hellcat probably more than that things i didnt know it could do all i do know for certain is that with the lives of not one but two young women depending on it need is going to stretch to its limits tarma considered that for a moment in that case id better get on my way and young lordan isnt getting any better for you standing there when kethry didnt move tarma frowned theres something youre not telling me the sorceress grimaced i think rathgar was betrayed i told kero that whoever hired the mage and the bandits to pull this raid was probably one of rathgars enemies but i lied to her i think it was diernas uncle that reichert bastard tarma blinkedand swore an oath strong enough to make the witchlights dim for a moment it all makes sense doesnt itthe fact that the raiders knew about the feast tonight and that almost everyone would be unarmed that they knew where everything was and that bastard has wanted the keep since i cant remember when i didnt like rathgar but he deserved better than that that bastard probably wouldnt be too upset if diernas father happened to die and the collateral lands came to him either kethry pointed out grimly basically i think youd better stay alert for other surprisesand if you can find anything linking him to this massacre bring it back tarma nodded ill keep my nose to the ground kethrys troubled eyes cleared and she urged her horse down the tunnel that takes a lot of worry off my mind ill go do what i can for lordan and ill keep our young swordbearer in one piece tarma mounted up much to the displeasure of her horse and followed her out into the night and may the gods ride with all of us four the moon was down but tarma had no problem following warrl any time she lost him hed be sure to set her right with acidic delight she was far more concerned with her mares footing in the uncertain light one false step and the rescue could be ended with a broken foreleg shinainbred horses were damned canny but accidents could still happen to anyone she was glad now shed left her old mare back with the clan two years ago and had taken a younger beast this was the fourth warsteed to carry the name hellsbane but she was the best so far though lazier by nature than the other three she had keener senses a superior level of good sense and an uncanny knack for pathfinding warrl was up to his usual high standards despite a confused trail he had picked up keros track with very little problem he might be as old as tarma but there was nothing wrong with his nose i cant imagine how that girl is finding the bandits trail though that had her sorely puzzled shes a good enough hunter but not that good and not by night the sword warrl suggested absently kethry said that we dont know all it can do weve never seen it in the hands of someone entirely untrained tarma snarled a little at the thought of the blade that had caused her and her sheenedra so much trouble and agreed ill tell you furface ive never been entirely happy about that blade it has too much of a mind of its own damn thing came awfully close to getting keth killed a time or two the hawkbrothers call it a spiritsword warrl reminded her as he stopped at a crossroads to cast around for the scent i have often thought it to be more than a geasblade but your stareyed bound you two despite kethrys previous link to it so i presume it isnt inimical onlyhmmstubborn tarma grimaced at the kyrees choice of words maybe whatever im glad now that the damn thing does have a mind of its own the only two females in peril for leagues around are kero and her brothers bride therere no women in that bandit group right i have not scented any the kyree confirmed loping off on the fork to the west tarma urged her horse to follow then the goal and the target are clear theres nothing to confuse the issue and kero is going to need all the help she can get we two are not precisely useless the path was leading off into the hills and presently vanished warrl continued to follow with his nose along the bare ground swiftly and silently it was as dark as the inside of a cat with the moon down tarma relaxed rested trusting to the senses of her mount and warrl halt tarma reacted instantly and so did her mare she peered into the darkness ahead of her and could barely make out a moving blot against the lighter expanse of scrub grass and dirt ahead whats up she thought at him she could not speak mindtomind but he could and did read her thoughts theyd used that little talent of his on more than one scouting foray interesting she dismounted here tarma eased herself down out of her saddle and winced a little when she put weight on her bad leg she led the mare up to warrl as quietly as she could to keep from distracting him he raised his head and sniffed the breeze just as she got there fascinating we are somewhere near the bandits camp i can scent smoke and many humans and weary horses and old blood and i think dierna which means the girl kerowyn somehow knew they were nearby he put nose to ground again the sword i presume alerted her or possibly is guiding her or controlling her tarma thought sardonically thinking of times past perhaps i think she led her horse offthere tarma dropped hellsbanes reins groundtethering her and carefully moved off in the direction warrls nose pointed within a few feet of the trail behind a low rise she found a creekbed with a trickle of water running through it trees on both sides of it where the trees were thickest she found keros mare tethered with enough rein that she could eat and drink satisfiedand pleased that the girl had thought to provide for her horseshe tethered hellsbane there beside the girls riding mare and returned to warrl if its controlling her shes at least holding her own now what she asked him he moved forward a few feet at a time ah here she dropped to hands and knees a crawling stalk he raised his head to look at her i would advise the same based on the strength of the scents tarma shook her head in admiration brightest goddessthe damned blade is finally doing something right all right furface lets see what you and i can do about cutting around to the other side of the camp kerowyn halted her horse she could just barely make out the dirt road ahead and the fact that this was a crossroads she stared at the trail and tried to remember what the stories shed heard had said about her grandmothers geasblade there was something about kethry fighting as if she were a master swordswoman even though she was entirely untrainedwhich might mean the thing gave her unusual abilities could it make one a master tracker perhaps she touched her hand to the hilt and felt a kind of tingle as if her hand had a mild case of pins and needles there was something there all right even if she didnt know what it was on the other hand she wasnt too certain she wanted to find out while she had other options available she settled herself carefully in her saddle and opened the protections on her mind slowly this time the last thing she wanted was to let that slimy thing know she was behind them she caught a lot of stray thoughts full of violence and not very clear or coherent and when she opened her eyes she found she was facing westward very well then west it would be each time she lost the trail she found it again by cautiously lowering her protections and listening but then the road she followed turned into a path and the path itself dwindled away to nothing and it was too dark to try and track the bandits by ordinary means now she had no choice reluctantly she eased the blade halfway out of its sheath and relaxed the darkness about her began to lighten and soon she could see as well as if it was near dawn for a moment as she looked around herself in astonishment she thought she might be having some kind of fitthere were little sparkles of sullen light leading off over the hills then she pulled her hand away from the hilt of the sword and she realized that the little sparkles vanished as did her ability to see so clearly the moment her hand left the sword so this means what she dismounted and put her hand back on the sword the sullen light reappeared and as she examined the hard ground she saw the faint traces of hoofmarks there this then was the direction the bandits had taken and the moment she found their trail the light disappeared although she could still see as well as before its letting me do what i can do itsplaying tutor i guess but the moment im in a position where my own abilities can handle thingsthen it just sort of steps back and makes me take care of myself she took the blade in her right hand the mares reins in her left and followed the trail untilsomethingtold her to stop it just didnt seem right to go on farther maybe its about time to see what theyre up to she opened her mind leaning against verennas warm sweaty neck and closing her eyes to do so and went looking for bandits she found them all right an entire encampment of them with sentries posted all around the little valley theyd taken for their own drunk most of them wild disconnected thoughts dierna was there and still aliveand relatively unharmed but with her was kero slammed her protections shut convulsively he was there with her that cold slimy evil presence shed felt before this time he hadnt sensed her presence but that was because he was preoccupied but she had inadvertently come a lot closer to being detected than she really wanted to think about she looked around assessing the possibilities there was a tiny creek not far from where she was standing with trees lining both sides it wasnt much cover but to all eyes other than hers the night was deep and dark enough to hide just about anything with the cover provided by the bushes verenna would be just about invisible now if she could just do something to keep her from making a fusswell the mare probably hadnt fed terribly well what with all the confusion for the feast and then the upset of the raid if she left verenna tethered loosely so that she could get at browse and water that might keep her occupied and quiet she led her mare into the copse right up to the waterside and tethered her in a tiny clearing right next to the creek the clearing was surrounded by bushes and trees and may itself have been part of the creekbed until something changed its path verenna should be safeand if i dont get back shell probably be able to free herself she left the little mare tearing up grass hungrily and proceeded cautiously afoot at first then on her hands and knees opening her mind for brief glimpses of her enemies until she knew that the farthest sentries were little more than a hill away she dropped down beneath the bushes and crawled forward in their shelter all this time her sight had been dimming was the sword taking away her advantage or losing its power or was it that too much profligate use of magic might be somehow visible to the unknown mage now her vision was about equivalent to what shed have under a full moon well thatll doshe thought just as she heard the careless footsteps of one of the banditsentries and the rattle of the bushes as he pushed through them she flattened herself under the cover of the brush with her sword still in her hand face pressed into the gritty dirt her heart pounding with sudden fear and waited for him to pass he did making no attempt at quiet he stalked within an arms length of her armor creaking and jingling and never knew she was there she didnt start breathing again until he was well out of hearing distance didnt get her nose out of the sand and wipe it on the back of her hand until long after that all right i know where the sentries are she thought her right hand toying nervously with the hilt of the sword as she peered out from under the branches so how do i avoid them they seem to be stationed pretty closely together maybe i shouldnt avoid them it was hard to recall the storiesthe tales the old mercenaries told when she was supposed to be out of earshot not the bardic lays the recollections of old battles ambushes things that would be useful to her now denthe told lordan once about how he had to get into an enemy camp he said the sentries were posted all around but they werent used to working together and werent checking in with each other so they wouldnt know if one of them had been taken out until his replacement came looking for him so he got rid of one and brought his entire company in through the hole in the lines somehow all the fear and grief was behind her now now that she was confronting her own lifeor death it was easier to think the pain was far away and nothing was important but the next moment and the strange excitement that sharpened all her senses if i slip past them theyll still be at my back and dangerous i could forget that theyre there and one of them could get me from behind i cant just slip past them ill have to get rid of one no sooner had she made the decision than she was crawling forward after the sentry that had just passed her she had no real plan it was just that this particular man seemed the most careless she followed him with the sword still in her hand able to move with relative silence through brush that she could see and he could not maybe if i can come up on him from behind i can hit him in the back of the head with the pommel like dent showed me she was within a length of him half a length he started to turn and suddenly she was no longer in control of her body as if she was a passenger behind her own eyes a puppet in the hands of an unseen manipulator she felt her muscles tense as the man started to peer through the dark toward her she found herself ducking down and crouching behind the cover of a bush she hadnt even noticed the bush beside her much less that it was big enough to hide behind he even moved a couple of steps in her direction but couldnt see anything and she stayed as still as the disembodied puppeteer could hold her then when he turned away she sprang up swordhilt clasped in both hands and as a wild excitement filled her drove the blade through his body between his ribs using all the momentum of her leap the edges of the blade scraped against his ribs he arced and made a kind of strangled gasp dropping his own blade she seized him around the neck with her free arm and shoved the blade completely through him up to the quillons they stayed that way for a moment then he fell she braced herself and pulled at the same time and the blade came free of his falling body he never even made another sound then just as suddenly as she had lost control she regained it she was the one who staggered two trembling steps away from the carcass mouth open with shock heart thudding against her ribs she was the one who very nearly turned and ran ran all the way back to the copse where shed left verenna to take her and ride home at a gallop only the knowledge that if she did they would probably hear her and kill her kept her from doing just that ive killed a man she thought legs shaking sour taste of bile in the back of her throat her gorge rose ive killed a man myself except that she didnt know the blow that had killed him if it had been her doing shed have just hit him from behind with the pommel nothing like that was in anything dent had taught her it was the sword it had to be only a magic sword would have been able to manipulate her like a puppet and need was of course a magic sword and had been described as giving kethry the same power it had just apparently given kero i never thought it would happen like thatjust take me over like that i thoughti thought it would just sort of show me how to do things this wasnt what shed planned at all she looked at the blade in her hand and the blood on it with revulsion she wanted to drop it right there but then just before she did another thought occurred to her i was going to ask grandmother for a weapon or a demon would this bandit be any less dead if id hit him with a lightning bolt or let a demon eat him what makes it any better if i kill him with my own hands or do it from a distance it wasnt better of course and he hurt and killed my people maybe even somebody i knew she steeled herself steadied her hands and forced herself to clean the blade on his tunic he could have chosen an honest living hes helping keep dierna captive he had a choice he made it and im making mine she went back on hands and knees and eased through the brush toward the camp making as little sound as possible her hands were getting full of stickers and her knees were bruised by rocksbut it was no worse than some of the injuries shed picked up berrying or training verenna so far so far thanks to the sword shed been lucky thanks to the sword it still made her skin crawl to think how it would probably take her over again she didnt have a choice not if she was going to rescue dierna but she didnt like it at all it just takes over with no warning and what else does this thing do that i dont know about what if it turns me into some kind of monster but her grandmother trusted it theres no reason not to trust it i guess she thought as a cramp seized her leg she stopped and eased her leg out straight waiting for a moment until it went away but i cant help but wonder how much grandmother really knew about it maybe it hid things from her too a cheerful thought just then she reached the edge of a dropoff with a screening of brush at the edge bright yellow firelight silhouetting the bushes warned her that the camp was just beyond them she wormed her way under the shelter of one of the biggest and prickliest of them it was not an easy job tiny twigs caught in her hair and scratched her face exposed roots caught on her belt and tuniclacings and held her back finally she reached the edge the branches of the bushes drooped here down over the dropoff making a kind of screen of leaves and twigs between her and the fire lifting one branch out of the way cautiously she peered down at the camp below blinking against the sudden light closest to her and about a length below her were a halfdozen men roaring drunk playing some kind of game with dice or knucklebones two were standing the rest were sitting or kneeling in a rough circle watching one of their number cast and cast again they had tossed their armor aside in a heap right below her up against the side of the low bluff she hid on they were filthy unshaven and dressed in a motley collection of clothing some of which had probably been very fine at one time all of which was now stained tattered and so dirty she wouldnt have used it to clean the stable floor beyond them was another collection of similar scum sprawled at fireside sharing the contents of a wineskin and squabbling over a heap of loot from the keep then came the firebadly built part of it smoking part roaringand beyond the fire dierna her bright scarlet dress made a brilliant splash of color that attracted keros eyes immediately she lay half on her side her pretty face a frozen mask of fear tumbled at the feet of a tall thin man in long red robes the skirt of his robes split fore and aft for riding he sat on a boulder sharpening a knife paying no attention to the antics of his men nor strangely enough to dierna although her legs were exposed to the thigh by the way her dress had torn and fallen open when shed collapsed or been flung at his feet he reached down as dierna shrank away from him and grabbed a lock of her long unbound dark hair he yanked her back toward him with it tangled cruelly in his fingerskero watched her clench her teeth and winceand cut the lock off with a single stroke of his knife kero bit her lip with sudden speculation that was not what shed expected him to do as she watched he rose from his impromptu seat kicking dierna out of the way impatiently and took the lock of hair to a flat rock just inside the ring of firelight maybe one of these bastards will go for his back she thought hopefully having a girl within reach must be driving them mad if one of them tries something makes a move for her thats sure to start a fight either the man holding her will react or one of the otherseither way once a fight starts its bound to spread if that happens maybe i can get in there and get her out while the fighting is going on but the bandits ignored the robed man ignored dierna which was even odder even if this strange man mage this has to be the mage even if this strange mage had given orders about leaving dierna alone scum like this would not have been able to ignore her theyd have been watching her hoping for the mages back to be turned hoping for a chance at her but she might as well not have been there they werent ignoring herthey acted as if they didnt even see her kero turned her startled attention back to the mage that flat rockhe had some kind of paraphernalia laid out on it as if it were an altar he set the lock of hair on a brazier in the middle of the rock picked up something kero couldnt make out and began making passes over the burning hair i dont like this i dont like this at all a moment later the hair on the back of her neck was rising as a circular boundary around the rock began to glow as if he had piled up a circle of dark red embers the strange light pulsed at first then settled down to a steady sullen glow there was one small gap in the circle and the mage put his instrument down as soon as the glow of the boundary settled and strode through it he returned to his boulder his steps hurried and betraying a certain impatience he shot out his hand and pulled dierna to her feet by her bound wrists she yelped a sound that carried above the rest of the noise in the campand not one of the bandits looked up i like this even less the mage dragged the young girl stumbling along behind him then pushed her through the gap in the boundary he cleared the flat rock of encumbrances with a single sweep of his free hand then kicked her feet out from under her and forced her down beside it he waved his hand again and the gap in the boundary closed as fire burned from each end of the arc and met in the middle then he pulled a knife from the sleeve of his robe seized diernas head by the hair and before kero could take a breath slashed diernas cheek from eye to chin for one moment kero was paralyzed with herself and the sword warring to take over her body and act and in that moment of indecision someoneor somethingelse acted outside the circle of firelight a wild clamor went up it was a heartbeat later that kero recognized the sounds for the voices of half a dozen horses screaming with fear the thunder of hooves was all the warning the bandits got before an entire herd of them blind with panic stampeded through the camp then the campfire went up in a shower of colored balllightning and huge sparks and explosions just as they hammered past and they panicked further scattering in all directions and as if that wasnt chaos enough one of the revelers fell into the fire with a bubbling shriek of pain clutching his throat and the bandits panicked as badly as the horses thats an arrow kero realized in the heartbeat before her attention was caught again by dierna and the mage that held her theres someone else out theresomeone with a grievance and a bow but she had no chance to think about it because the mage caught her attention again somethinga cloud of smoke or bloodcolored mistrose up out of the stone it was the height of a man and as broad as two men and it was lit fitfully from within like the clouds on a summer night flickering with heat lightning the mage stepped back releasing the girl it gathered itself coiling and rearing up exactly like a snake about to strike then it lunged forward and fastened itself on the blooddripping cut on diernas cheek dierna screamedhigh shrill the way a rabbit screams when it is about to die kero couldnt move now she was as paralyzed with fear as dierna but she didnt need to for the moment she stopped fighting it the sword took over it flung her out of the bushes rolling down the bluff in a controlled tumble that somehow brought her up onto her feet just as she reached the bottom the fire was still exploding though fitfully a handful of horses were still trampling anything in their way as they circled wildly through the camp and there was more than enough confusion for her to get halfway across the campsite before anyone even noticed her and even then the bandits had troubles of their own for that unknown ally out in the dark was letting fly with arrow after carefully placed arrow picking off raiders with impressive regularity there were at least three down on the ground that werent moving and two more clutching their sides and screaming one of the bandits saw her and charged right at her and stopped dead as kero raised her own sword against him without pausing in her headlong charge whatever he saw turned his face as pale as milk he turned and ran out into the darkness that happened twice more as she half ran half stumbled across the bandit camp dodging fearmaddened horses and the fires set by the explosions in the campfire a few unfortunates managed to get in keros way the sword did not grant them a second chance by now kero wasnt even trying to fight the sword she was still wild with fear but there was a kind of heady exhilaration about this too she hardly noticed the men getting in her way except as targets to be dealt with as impersonal as dents set of pells in the armory she dodged around the nowblazing campfire vaulted a body cut down a fool who tried to bar her way with nothing but a shortbladed knife taking him out with one of those unstoppable twohanded strokesand found herself jerking abruptly to a halt at the edge of the glowing circle she couldnt get across it there was a real physical barrier demarcated by that scarlet line the thin band of crimson might as well have been a wall of iron she looked upand saw the thing still fastened on diernas cheek the light within it growing stronger and more regular pulsing like a heartbeat and beyond it the mage smiled thinly at her and gestured making a throwing motion yellowgreen light in the shape of a dagger left his hands she tried to duck but the sword wouldnt release her so she braced herself instinctively and cold fear froze her from head to toe but nothing happened the dagger of light vanished as it came within an arms length of her she blinked trying to comprehend what had just happened he threw a magic thing at me it never touched me and he expected it to kill me the mage stared in utter disbelief and backed up a halfdozen steps that was enough for the sword kero backed up a step under its direction and it slashed down across the circle of light as if it were carving a doorway a portion of the crimson barrier blacked out immediately the blade sent kero leaping across that blackedout section like a maiden leaping the solstice fires her jump ended two paces in front of the flat rock dierna and the thing fastened leechlike to diernas cheek dierna was no longer screaming she was sprawled across the rock moaning weakly as if this creature was stealing all her strength her eyes were closed and she seemed utterly unaware of keros presence the sword slashed down again but it was not aimed at the leechthing for one horrible moment kero thought it was trying to kill diernabut the hilt twisted in her hands and cut between the girl and the leechcloud shaving so close to diernas face that the blade flicked away a couple of drops of blood from her wounded cheek the mage shouted something incomprehensible but angry the cloud reared back as dierna came to life and rolled weakly off the rock and out of its way the strange thing looking more like a leech than ever before it could lunge at her and refasten itself to her cheek kero had leapt up onto the rock positioning herself between it and the girl she slashed at it cutting nothing but forcing it to retreat it glowed an angry sanguine and seethed at her the roiling movements within it somehow conveying a cold and deadly rage behind it the mage chanted furiously in some language kero didnt recognize she somehow knew that the sword did though for the first time she felt something from ita strange slow anger hot as a forge and heavy as iron her left hand dropped from the hilt and reached for her dagger at her belt and threw it the mage held up his hand and the dagger hit his palm and bounced clattering harmlessly to the ground kero wanted to run but the sword wouldnt let her she could only stand there an easy target the mage sneered and raised his hands they glowed for a moment a sickly red then the glow brightened and a spark arced between them he brought them together over his head and pointedand sent a bolt of red lightning not at her but into the leechcloud it writhed but she somehow had the feeling it was not in pain then it solidified furtherand doubled in size in a heartbeat looming up over her the blades anger rose to consume her and she shifted her grip from the hilt to the swordblade itself she balanced her sword for a moment that way as if it was impossibly nothing more than a giant throwing knife it didnt seem to weigh any more than her dagger had at that moment her arm came back and she threw it like a spear it flashed across the space between herself and the mage arrowstraight and pointfirst and as the mage stared in surprise it thudded home in his belly penetrating halfway to the quillons he gave a strangled cry staggered forward two steps and fell driving it the rest of the way through his body the leechcloud screamed somehow inside her mind as well as with a real voice it seemed to split her skull as completely as any axblade kero dropped to her knees and covered her ears the scream driving all thoughts except the pain of her head from her mind but she couldnt look away from the thing her eyes held by the mesmerizing pulsating lights within it the light flickered frantically wildly the cloud stretched and thinned reaching upward and rose to a height of three men then it exploded vanishing with a roar that dwarfed the explosions earlier kero blinked dazzled eyes shaken and numbed and slowly took her hands away from her ears there was only silence the crackling of the fire and the faroff drum of hoof beats she rose to her feet shaking so hard she had trouble standing her knees wobbly dear gods what happened i cant have killed that thing can i she waited for what seemed like half the night but nothing more happened finally she pulled herself together gathered what was left of her wits and staggered over to dierna the girl lay quietly beside the rock eyes wide and staring face as white as cream she blinked but that was the only movement she made for a moment kero was afraid that she might have gone mad or worsenot that she would have blamed her but when the older girl came into the failing light from the fire there was sense in her eyes and she took the hand that kero offered in both her bound ones and allowed kero to pull her into a sitting position kkkerowyn the girl stuttered weakly after a long moment of silence is it rrrreally you i think so kero replied unsteadily putting one hand to her temple as she looked vaguely around for something to free the girls wrists although the mages dagger lay nearby she somehow couldnt bear to touch it instead she retrieved her own knife and used it to cut through the rawhide of diernas bonds once her hands were freed dierna clapped her sleeve to her stillbleeding cheek and began to cry kero couldnt tell if she was weeping out of pain fear or for her marred cheek probably all three she started to look for something to use for a bandage but when she turned around an old woman in a worn leather tunic and armor that fit her as well as the bandits had fitted poorly appeared out of nowhere between her and the fire kero shrieked and stumbled back and turned to runand shrieked again when she came facetofaceliterallywith the biggest wolf shed ever seen in her life its eyes glowed at her with reflection from the fire as she groped frantically after weapons she no longer held stop that you little idiot the old woman said in a grating voice from directly behind her were friends obviously that voice she spun around again just in time to watch the old woman stalk past her toward the body of the mage the wolf eyeing both of them with every evidence of intelligent interest the woman surveyed the body for a moment then leaned over and wrenched her grandmothers sword out of the mages corpse with a single efficient jerk before kero could say or do anything the woman handed it to her hilt first she took it stunned unable to do anything but take it clean that the old woman growled a frown harsh enough to have frosted glass on her beaky face dammit girl you know better than that dont ever throw your only weapon away just because you were lucky onceah im wasting my time take that ninny of a sisterinlaw of yours and get back home and with that the woman turned on her heel and stalked off to the nearest body wrenching an arrow out of its back kero stood staring dumbly as the wolf jumped down off the rock and joined her it was only then that kero noticed that they were the only creatures living or moving in the whole camp and no few of those bodies were slashed across throat or belly her work or that of the swordin the end it really didnt matter she couldnt help herself it was all too much her guts rebelled and this time there was nothing to stop them from having their way she stumbled toward the rock and leaned against it heaving wretchedly she expected dierna to be having her own set of hysterics but after the first few heaves as she dropped her grandmothers sword from her nerveless fingers the girl helped steady her while she lost dinner lunch and breakfastand then even the memory of food finally when her guts quieted down for lack of anything else to bring up dierna wiped her sweaty forehead with a dustcovered velvet sleeve and helped her to sit down on the erstwhile altar she looked around for the sword it was just out of reach dierna followed her gaze and patted her awkwardly on the shoulder ill get it she said in a voice hoarse with screaming and crying youve done everything else tonight never mind that horrid old woman horrid oldnow i remember where i heard that voice before the old woman that was the same voice i heard on the road the old woman that stopped me on the way to the tower while dierna picked the sword up with a clumsiness caused mainly by the fact that she was trying not to touch it and was doing her best to keep it at arms length away from her kero looked around for the old woman she was gone so was the wolf and all the usable arrows here dierna said thrusting the sword hilt at kero she stared at the girl without taking it that awful bonedeep gash was healing right before her eyes faster than kero had ever seen anything heal before by the time she had shaken off her surprise to take the blade out of diernas reluctant grasp the wound had sealed shut and was already fading from a thin pink line to practically nothing leaving not even a scar it heals dearest agnira it heals too after turning me into a berserk killer and what was that old woman doing here anyway the sound of dancing hoof beats made her turn to see one more surprise in a night full of nearmiracles the enormous wolf had returned in its mouth were the reins of two horses keros and one she recognized as coming from the keep stables keros verenna was sweating with fear and trembling so hard that she was plainly too frightened to try and escape but the other beast was so tired it was paying no attention to its unusual groom the wolf led the horses right up to her and snorted which made verenna grunt and shy kero grabbed the ends of the reins dangling from its mouth and the wolf let go immediately verenna jerked her head and tried to bolt but kero held her dropping the sword into the dirt a second time as the mare rolled her eyes with terror and danced finally kero had to grab her nostrils and pinch them shut cutting off her air before shed calm down she glanced around guiltily as she retrieved the sword a second time but the old woman was still nowhere in sight she had the feeling that shed get a real tonguelashing if she didnt clean the blade off after all this and somehow she didnt want that formidable old harridan to unleash the full force of her scorn so how am i going to keep the horses from running off while i clean the damn thing she looked around for something suitable and finally wound up improvising hobbles for both horses before tethering them to a bush she could only hope that would hold if they bolted she didnt think the wolf was likely to bring them back a second time by now the sword was encrusted with dirt kero had to cut a piece from the bottom of her tunic and use what was left in a stray wineskin to get it clean enough to sheath the fire was dying down by the time she finished and she sheathed the blade at her belt and looked for dierna again expecting her to be collapsed somewhere as helpless and incoherent as her two cousins instead she saw the girl sorting through a pile of the loot that was part of one of the bandits dice winnings turning things over with a stick and tossing selected items onto a tattered cloak she had spread out to one side dierna she shouted and winced when the girl jumped overbalanced and fell she left the horses and walked wearily to give the girl a hand up sorry but what in the name of the six hells are you doing the girls face took on a stubborn expression looking for my wedding presents she said youre what kero wasnt sure whether to scream laugh or cry shed been kidnapped her friends and new relations had been slaughtered shed very nearly gone down the gullet of some kind of monster she lives through all this and shes looking for a few paltry cups im looking for my wedding presents the girl repeated theyre mine they were given to me and iim nnnot going to let thesebbbeasts have them her eyes grew moist and threatened to spill over and kero sensed that she would have hysterics if she were prevented from completing her search i saw most of them she sighed some of these bastards were dicing for them here let me help youby the way lordans all right or at least he will be by the time we get back my grandmother the sorceress kethryveris said so did she the girl replied vaguely fishing a silver plate out of a pile of trash thats good im glad were going to be able to have the wedding after all lordans a very nice boy kero very nearly choked thats good shes happy about the wedding when my father and brother for one moment kethry had to hold very still counting slowly to avoid losing her temper and killing the girl shed come to rescue stop dont kill her she doesnt realize how she sounds and dont tell her what you think of her it isnt going to do any good to shout at the girl lordans the next thing to a stranger she hasnt known him very longwhat a week or so and if she didnt marry him theyd have found another husband for her within a couple of months probably not as goodlooking or personable certainly not as young but equally a strangerdear goddess that could have been me no wonder she wants her wedding presents more theyre all she really has the only things she really owns she doesnt even own herself kero found the last of the set of silver wine cups they were looking for dented but still recognizable and threw it onto the blanket dierna looked up then and the threatened tears did start to fall as she ran to kero and threw her arms around her neck kerowyn held her awkwardly as she sobbed into the older girls shoulder kkerowyn i thought they were going to kkill me dierna cried i thought no one was going to come in time yyou were wwwonderful she went on in that vein for quite a while poor baby poor baby kerowyn just patted her gingerly on the back until the flood subsided then coaxed her to the side of the spare horse and secured the blanket full of loot to the back of the saddle the horse was so tired it didnt even object to the noisy bundle wheres the kneerest dierna asked trying to find the kind of accoutrements she was used to on a saddle there isnt one kero replied hauling herself up onto verennas back youre going to have to ride like me likebut dierna paled then her lower lip started to quiver butbuti cant it isntmy dressits not womanly kero closed her eyes and begged agnira for patience your dress is ruined she pointed out besides no one expects to see you alive dierna nobody is going to notice that youre riding astride now just slit your dress and lets get out of here before one of those bastards comes back and when dierna hesitated with the little knife kero had handed her dangling loosely from her fingers kero added that leechthing might not be dead you know the girl squeaked slit the skirt of her dress so that she could swing her leg over the saddle and get her foot into the stirrup and mounted with all the haste kero could have wanted blessed agnira spare me from womanly if this is what it is she thought making the words an unconscious prayer as she took the reins of diernas horse to lead it behind her own justspare me five so what do you think of the girl now warrl asked conversationally as tarma sorted through the scattered piles of the bandits belongings im pretty impressed the shinain admitted as she squatted on her heels emptying out a beltpouch and separating copper from silver not that there was much of the former and of the latter there was even less but tarma was a thrifty soul and young lordan was going to need all the help he could get he was going to have to pay for enough mercenaries to keep his neighbors from getting ideas about annexing his property to theirs that took ready cash and silver and copper spent as readily as gold i think i have a fair notion how much of what went on was the damn swords doing and how much was the girls she continued pouring the coppers into a large leather pouch that had been a wineskin a few moments ago shes got a few brains besides the guts unlike a certain barbarian nomad i once knew warrl chortled tarma simply ignored him and moved on to a pile of looted wedding gifts the girls had overlooked of course it had been under one of the men tarma had shot which might be why theyd overlooked it she shook her head over a bloodsoaked silk cloak too bad thats one wedding present ruined past anyone using it she tossed it onto the fire i never claimed to have much in the way of brains when i was younger nowwell id rather do things with a minimum of effort and that takes planning that was good work with the horses furface thank you and you displayed your customary efficiency with the sentries warrl nosed something out of the dirt and batted a shiny little gold pendant toward his mindmate with his paw she snatched it up adroitly and dropped it into the appropriate pouch you must be planning something rude youre complimenting me she teased him stripping the body at her feet of everything useful and tossing various items on the appropriate piles ill tell you though i had a bad moment back there when the mage started that bloodrite i thought that stupid sword would take the girl over and turn her into a nice juicy target before we had a chance to start distracting them you didnt think it knew what we were doing warrl dragged a set of saddlebags over to the fire so that tarma could rummage through them then stood beside her head cocked to one side watching her work with absent curiosity ive never known what that sword noticed or didnt notice the shinain admitted i know the damn things amazing when it wants to bebut i dont think even keth has ever figured it out and shes adeptclass all we know for sure is that it heals it gives a mage fighting mastery and a fighter immunity from magic and it wont work against a woman and that women in trouble call it the way lures bring in hawks too true tarma sighed thinking of all the times exactly that had happened and all the trouble the sword had gotten them into as a consequence not to mention all the paying jobs it had cost them what did you do with the rest of the nags anyway herded into a blind canyon they wont be going anywhere i assumed youd want them warrl sounded more than usually smug and with good reason by the time tarma finished collecting everything salvageable there was going to be enough here for at least three pack animalsand the horses themselves would be worth something illused scrubby beasts though they were most of the horses the bandits rode in on hadnt been stolen from the keep theyll be worth more if lordan offers them as bonuses to any merc who signs with him than if he sells them warrl pointed out following her train of thought with his customary ease it isnt often a common merc gets a chance at even a scrubby nag like one of this lot good point ill make sure he realizes that she straightened and surveyed the remains of the camp i think ive gotten everything worth getting the vultures are welcome to whats left no selfrespecting vulture would touch one of these fools warrl sniffed disdainfully stupidity might be catching tarma snorted in agreement as she tied up a bundle of assorted silver plate they really werent terribly bright were they doesnt that strike you as odd tarma paused with her hands on the last knot now that you mention it she said slowly it does you might think these fools had never worked together before hired separately warrl licked his lips then thrown togetherthat would account for some of the laxness the lack of coordination they did act as if each man was following his own set of orders and to the nether hells with whatever anyone else was doing and once back at camp the only thing they did as a group was to set sentries exactly tarma sat back on her heels and stared at the dying fire without really seeing it now why would someone want to throw a group of scum together that they know is going to fall apart the moment the job is over warrl began pacing back and forth head swinging from side to side a little one would assume that whoever hired themwanted them caught good notion lets think about thisif everything had gone wrong for these fools what would have happened to them tarma stood up and joined warrl in his pacing if they had not been able to take the girl rathgar would have been faulted for not protecting her and i would guess that in any case the mage was ordered to dispose of rathgar no matter what the cost they certainly had the men to assure that warrl paused in his pacing and looked up at her which would leave the estate in the hands of the boy who could be gotten rid of as soon as the bride had produced an heir or even before tarma scratched an old scar on the back of her hand all rightif it had gone half right and theyd killed rathgar but left a force of ablebodied men behind to follow it would have taken a while to get that force organized and even if someone had come pounding after them theyd have had time to get rid of the girl which would give the family an excuse for bloodfeud if you assume the girl is expendable warrl sounded sour tarma felt just as sour the shinain lived and died for their clans and the idea that a man could betray his own blood for the sake of gain curdled her stomach not that she hadnt encountered this beforebut it curdled her stomach every time i think she is given whos probably behind the attack in the first place keth already had this one figured the uncle baron reichert lt fits his style aye that hed put up his own daughter as an expendable let alone a mere niece she frowned lets get the horses i think that once were in place wed better make the keep a lot more secure than rathgar had it or the bride is likely to be a widow before the years out assuming she lives that long the sun was approaching zenith by the time tarma coaxed the weary footsore horses through the gates of walls about the keeplandsand by the tingle on her skin as she passed under the portcullis of the keep itself kethry had already put a magebarrier about the place the keep was more than a fortified manor it was a small walled town with a small pastureor large paddockwithin the walls for keeping horses the quarried stone walls were manned by an odd assortment of women old men and boys but tarma nodded with approval as she gave them a surreptitious inspection while she dismounted and tended to the horseherd they were alert they were armed with the kind of weapons they were most familiar with and they looked determined the boys had slings and bows the old men spears and crossbows the women knives scythes and threshing flails by their weathered complexions and sturdy builds those women and boys had been gleaned from the farms around the keep and tarma knew her farmers every mercenary did they could be frightened off but if they decided to make a stand they werent worth moving against farmers like these had taken out plenty of men with those peasant weapons evidently she was expected the farmers around the keep knew her in any event from the old days when the keep had been a school that shed shared with keth those farmers had long memories and several recognized her on sight she even knew one or two once she got within the walls and close enough to make out faces one of those was a woman just above the gate who waved then turned her attention back to the road shading her eyes with her hand while she fanned herself with her hat leaning on the wall beside her was a wicked longbladed scythe newlysharpened by the gleam of it and having seen her at harvest time with that particular instrument tarma would not have wanted to rouse her ire no one came down to help her which spoke well for discipline and that keth had evidently impressed the seriousness of the situation on them i might be old tarma thought with a certain dry amusement as she dismounted but the day a shinain needs help with a herd of exhausted horses is the day theyre putting her on her pyre her warmare followed her to the entrance with the three pack horses trailing along behind warrl held the rest of the horses penned in the farthest corner of the court while she pulled packs and tack off her four when packs and saddle were piled beside the door she and hellsbane drove the three tired nags before her shuffling through the dust to join the rest warrl kept them all in place simply with his presence and hellsbane kept them calm while she opened both stable doors she whistled and through the open door watched warrl climb lazily to his feet then bark once as hellsbane played herdmare that was all the poor beasts needed they shied away from him and broke into a tired trot shambling past her and out into the pasture she slammed the stable door after them and walked as wearily as they had back into the stonepaved sunlit court the kyree was waiting for her looking as if he was feeling every year of his age are we finished yet warrl asked hopefully his tongue lolling out you are she replied stretching and feeling old injuries ache when she moved id better see what keths up to if you dont mind ill go get something to eat and then become flat for a while warrl headed off in the direction of the kitchengarden i think that undercook still remembers me i wish i could do the same she sighed to herself oh well no rest for the wicked she caught up the pouches of jewelry and money on her way past the pile of packs i dont think anyone out here is other than honest but why take chances the keep door was halfway ajar she pushed it open entirely and walked in unannounced the outer hall was cool and very dark to her tired eyes after the brightness of the courtyard that didnt matter this place had been her home for years she knew every stone in the walls and crack in the floors as long as rathgar didnt install any statues in the middle of the path i ought to be able to find my way to the great hall blindfolded she thought and ill bet thats where keth is she was right the great hall was nearly as bright as the courtyard outside it was three stories tall and the top story was one narrow window after another not such a security risk as it looked it was rimmed with a walkwaybalcony that could be used as an archers gallery in times of siegeand the exterior walls were sheer stone kethry was in the middle of the great hall supervising half a dozen helpers with her usual brisk efficiency robes kilted up above her knees hair tied back under a scarf shed set the entire great hall up as a kind of infirmary and she had no lack of patients even tarma was a bit taken aback by the sheer number of wounded it looked suspiciously as if the raiders specific orders had been to cause as much havoc and injury as possible in the shortest period of time which may be the case she reflected soberly as she threaded her way through the maze of pallets spread out on the stone floor the more rathgars allies suffered the better off reichert would be theyd be unable to support the boy and very probably unwilling as well kethry was kneeling at the side of a man who was conscious and talking to her she looked up from her current patient at just that moment and her weary smile told tarma all she needed to know about the mages night long exhausting but with the only reward that countedthe casualties had been light at worst tarma nodded and as keth continued her current task of changing the dressing on a badly gashed leg she slowed her steps to time her arrival with the completion of that task looks like youve spent a night sheenedra the shinain said quietly as kethry stood up hows the boy hell live she said tucking a strand of hair under her scarf in fact i think hell be up and around before too long i held him stable from a distance as soon as kero told me what had happened and i managed to get the one healing spell whatshername taught me to work for a change tarma shook her head and grimaced i never could understand it adeptclass mage and half the time you cant heal a cut finger power has nothing to do with it kethry retorted and its damned frustrating well if you ask me i think your success at healing has as much to do with how desperate you are to make it work as anything the fighter replied shifting her weight from one foot to the other and flexing her aching arches every time youve really needed it to work it has its only failed you when you were trying it for something trivial huh that might just bewell the boy is fine and as grateful as anyone could want bless his heart the girl on the other hand kethry rolled her eyes expressively dear gods and powersyouve never heard such weeping and histrionics in your life kero came dragging them both in about dawn and her highness was fine until one of her idiot cousins spotted her and set up a caterwauling thenyoud have thought that every wound in the place had been to her fair white body about what i figured the shinain said laconically did you truss her up or what i sent her up to the bower with the rest of her hysterical relatives keth told her the mages mouth set in a thin line of distaste and i sent kero to bed once shed looked in on her brother shes made of good stuff that girl she should be tarma replied pleased that kero hadnt fallen apart once shed reached safety but it doesnt necessarily follow well im for bed and see that you fall into one sometime soon soon hell the mage snorted im going now theres nothing to be done at this point that cant be handled by someone else therere half a dozen helpers fresher and just as skilled tarma clutched the tunic above her heart blessed stareyed youre delegating i never thought id see the day kethry mimed a blow at her and the fighter ducked watch yourself or ill turn you into a frog oh would you tarma said hopefully frogs dont get dragged out of their beds to go rescue stupid wenches in the middle of the night kethry just threw her hands up in disgust and turned to find one of her helpers the tallow should be ready about now kero thought setting her mortar and pestle aside long enough to check the little pot of fat heating over a waterbath the stillroom was dark cool and redolent with the odors of a hundred different herbs and of all the womanly places in the keep it was by far kerowyns favorite dierna was still having vapors every time she set foot outside the bowernow converted from armory back to womens quarters by diernas agitated ordersso grandmother kethry had entrusted the making of medicines to keros hands it keeps me busy she thought a little ruefully and at least its usefulbusy not like diernas damned embroidery some of the recipes kethry had dictated from memory and they were things kerowyn had never heard of she was completely fascinated and retreat to the stillroom was not the boring task it usually was retreat to the stillroom was just that tooretreat diernas relatives the female ones in particular were treating her very strangely part of the time they acted as if she was some creature as alien and frightening as tarmas giant wolf the rest of the time they acted as if she was a source of prime amusement they spoke to her as little as possible but she was certain that they made up wild stories about her once they were on the other side of the bower doors they certainly dont seem to spend any time doing anything else she thought sourly as she carefully removed the pot of melted fat from the heat and sifted powdered herbs into it theyre amazingly good at finding other places to be whenever theres real work to be done she beat the herbs into the fat with brisk strokes of the spatula taking some of her anger at the women out on the pot of salve she was very tired of the odd sideways looks she was gettingtired enough that she had continued to wear lordans castoffs rather than proper womanly garb out of sheer perversity im cleaning and lifting and tending the woundedwhen im not out drilling the boys in bow or in the stillroom she thought stubbornly breeches are a lot more practical than skirts why shouldnt i wear them grandmother and that shinain woman do she had to smile at that and they are one and all so frightened of grandmother and her friend that if either one of them even looks cross they practically faint the salve smelled wonderful and that alone was a far cry from the medicines she used to make here she sighed and stirred a little slower feeling melancholy descend on her life was not the same it didnt look as if it would ever be the same again it isnt just them its everything it seems as if no one treats me the same anymore not the servants not wendor not even lordan why has everything changed it doesnt make any sense i havent changed of course father the thought of rathgar made her feel guilty she knew she should be mourning himdierna certainly was the girl had ransacked lenores wardrobe for mourning clothes and had them made over to fit herself and her women shed carried on at the funeral as through rathgar had been her father instead of keros she carried on enough for both me and lordan kero recalled sardonically maybe its just that i really never saw that much of him when mother was alive and when she was gone he really never had much to say to me except to criticize really i might just as well have been fostered out for all that i saw of him i knew dent and wendar better than i knew him she sighed again i must be a cold bitch if i cant even mourn my own father she heard footsteps on the stone floor outside just then and the door creaked open so heres where youve been hiding yourself said a harsh voice behind her warrior bless its like a cave in here what are you doing turning yourself into a bat it has to be dark kero explained without turning wondering what had brought the formidable old fighter here a lot of herbs lose potency in the light ill take your word for it the shinain edged carefully into the narrow confines of the stillroom and positioned herself out of keros way my people dont store a great deal and that little only for a season or two at most dont tell me you like it in here sometimes kero told her its better than she bit her tongue to keep from finishing that sentence its better than out there with the hens and chicks clucking disapproval at you the shinain finished for her i know what you mean the only reason they keep their tongues off me is because theyre pretty sure ill slice those wagging tongues in half if i find out about it she chuckled and kero turned to look at the old woman in surprise we never have been properly introduced im tarmatarma shena talesedrin to be preciseshinain from the hawk clan ive been your grandmothers partner for an age and im half of the reason your father disapproved of her you are kero said fascinated by the hawkfaced womans outspoken manner butwhy because he was dead certain that she and i were shieldmatesthats lovers dear he was dead wrong but you could never have convinced him of that tarma hardly moved but there was suddenly a tiny thinbladed knife in one hand she began cleaning her nails with it the other half of the reason he disapproved of her was because he was afraid of both of us we didnt know our place and we could do just about any damned thing a man could do but thats a cold trail and not worth following are you the reason we could get shinain horses to breed kero asked suddenly putting several odd facts together tarma chuckled damn youre quick dead in the black jelenedra listen im sorry i was so hard on you back on the road the other night i was testing you sort of idfigured that out kero replied the knife caught the light and flashed it looked sharp enough to wound the wind the shinain nodded a satisfied little smile at the corners of her mouth good i was hoping you might i want you to know i think you did pretty well out there about the only time you started to dither was after everything was over and done with you know youre wasted on all this all what kero asked bewildered by the sudden change in topic all this the shinain waved her knife vaguely taking in the four walls of the stillroom and beyond kero hid her confusion by turning her attention to the salve watching her own hands intently this life tarma continued its not enough of a challenge for you youre capable of a lot more than youll find here my people say you can put a hawk in a songbirds cage but its still a hawk think about it i have to go beat some of those hired guards into shape but ill be around if you need me and with that she backed out of keros sight and vanished one moment she was there the next gone leaving only the door to the stillroom swinging to mark her passing all right you meatheads lets see a little life in those blows ten men and womenthose currently offdutyplaced their blows on the ten sets of pells as if their lives depended on it of course their lives do depend on it tarma roamed up and down the line of hired guards scowling but inwardly she was very pleased these were all reliable solid fighters with good references very much as she and keth had been early in their careers the only difference was that these fighters were well into their careers ordinarily they had nowhere to go now but down because shed been able to offer a packhorse apiece with half pay in advance shed gotten the cream of the available mercenary crop none of them were going to be the kind of fighter that legends were made of but for lordans purposes they were far better most of them were in their middle years looking for a post where they could settle down perhaps even think about a spouse and children thats why they werent with a mercenary companygoing out and fighting every year was a job for the young and fools she thought which these gentlemen and ladies are not put some back into it she shouted again feeling a sense of deja vu how many times had she shouted those same words in this same courtyard only then it was into young ears not seasoned ones these folks are well aware of the absolute necessity for practice every day rain snow or scorching heat thirty seasoned fighters that would be enough to give even baron reichert second thoughts and one very special recruit as middleaged as the others without a single thing to differentiate her from the rest even her color and staturegolden skin and very tall for a womanwere not particularly outstanding among mercenaries hired swords came from every corner of the known world and some places outside it beaker had been odderlooking than this woman she acted no differently than any of the others not looking for special status nor making herself conspicuous tarma drilled this recruit as remorselessly as the rest and paid her no more attention and no less lyla stormcloud was from the far south and west past even the dhorisha plains she was half shinain with the gold complexion of her father and the black eyes and wandering foot of her mother a full bard who had double the normal wanderlust of that roaming profession life with a nomadic clan had suited her perfectly and talesedrin made up as it was of orphans and adoptees made her welcome there as she might not have been in a pure clan how theyd gloried in having a full bard with them a full bard with another profession as well the one she had trained in as a childthe skills and training of which she passed in turn to her daughter assassin its a good thing the clans didnt know that until long after shed been accepted on the basis of her talent and current profession and its a damned good thing for her that she admitted it before someone ferreted the information out on his own but im glad it happened especially now try and get an assassin past another assassin tarma furrowed her brow in thought watching lyla at her swordwork blessings on the warrior for sending her mother to talesedrin and a double blessing that lyla was willing to pack up and move on my sayso lordan was in danger as long as baron reichert thought him vulnerable if tarma and her partner could stay herewell nothing and no one was going to get past them now that keth was no longer bound by the promises shed made rathgar she could put mageprotections up that would stop any magical attack on her grandson short of an adeptspell and if tarma could possibly have moved in here permanently but she couldnt and knew it there were other considerations not the least of which was that she wasnt as young as she used to be and guarding a target from assassins was a young persons job that had been when shed thought of lyla after that it had been a matter of sending a mageborne message via keth to the shaman of talesedrinwho just happened to be kethrys son jadrek and then when lyla had agreed to come some mysterious transaction involving the taleedras of the pelagiris forest had been negotiated via jadrek to get her here im still not sure how she got here as fast as she did those hawkbrotherstheyve got to have secrets of magic even kethry and the other adepts dont know probably only the clan shamans have any idea what they can do and they arent telling either even lyla didnt remember how shed gotten here she told tarma that jadrek had taken her to the forest edgeand the next thing she knew she was walking through the open mouth of a cave near the tower just as well let them keep their secrets i dont think i want to know them lordan was now as safe as tarma knew how to make him certainly safer than money could buy lyla was a pleasure to watch wasting no effort and certainly almost as good as tarma in her prime better than tarma was now not through fault of training or will just old bones and stiff scarred muscles slower reactions and senses that were no longer as keenso the world belongs to the young at least therere youngsters im glad to see have it like young kero she hoped shed said the right things neither too much nor too little too much and she might frighten the bird back to its nest too little and she wouldnt realize there was a great big world out here and a whole sky in which to use her wings if im any judge shes got the reactions and the instincts all she needs is the skill and the strength and shell put lyla in the shade she has it in her she has the brains and the guts too which means even moreshe can be more than even an exceptional merc with those but if i push shell rebel or shell be frightened off good she said aloud and the sweaty fighters lowered their weapons with varying expressions of gratitude all right ladies and gentlemenoff to the baths on the quickstepmarch i never thought id find myself here kero thought for the hundredth time watching the rest of the wedding guests over the rim of her goblet she tried not to fidget tried not to feel as if she was being smothered under all the layers of her holiday dress i should be back in the kitchen but she didnt need to be in the kitchen not anymore grandmother kethry had seen to that there was a proper housekeeper nowwhich was just as well since dierna was not up to handling the kitchen staff and servers the way kero had she was good at knowing what orders to give the housekeeper what servants were best where which was something kero had never been able to figure out she was a marvel at loom and needle and lordan was shortly going to find himself in possession of a thriving woolencloth trade if dierna had anything to say about it she was fair useless in the stillroom but but the housekeeper can do that too this housekeeper was an impoverished gentlewoman found by kethry by means of one of her many and mysterious contacts kero had a vague idea that there was a relative involved in some way an uncle an aunt someone connected with some kind of mage school i think there was something about the way shed been dispossessed too something unjust that kethry wouldnt go into when dierna was around could it possibly be something involving diernas uncle the baron well no matter what the cause here she was and grateful for the post being neither noble nor servant she was perfect for the position which wasnt quite family and wasnt exactly underling perfect as kero had not been she knew that now too close to the servants for them to respect her properly that was what diernas mother had said shed said a lot more when she thought kero couldnt hear kero glanced at the lady in question sitting on the other side of the bride and groom and lording it over her half of the table im glad for lordans sake she wont be here much longer i might murder her and disgrace him thank the gods for grandmother and tarma she thought as lordan and his bride shared a goblet of wine and made big eyes at each other they were like whirlwinds magic whirlwinds they blew in they created order and theyre about to blow out again before anyone has a chance to resent them even dierna to her credit through the bride showed no signs of resenting kethrys interference despite the plaints of her own mother shed had more than enough on her hands even with the aid of the housekeeper dierna had taken over nursing lordan as soon as kethry had pronounced him fit for company and hed quite fallen in love with his intended theyre besotted she thought resignedly i suppose its just as well she looked down over the great hall at all the other guests like a bed of multicolored flowers in their finery and many of them just about as immobile fully half of them couldnt stand and all of them wore some token of mourning but that didnt seem to be putting any kind of a pall on the celebrations wendar saw to it that the wine kept flowing and the celebrants were chattering so loudly that it was impossible to hear the minstrels at the end of the hall all enmities seemed to have been forgotten at least for now but she kept catching strange glances cast her way it was beginning to make her want to squirm with discomfort but she kept her seat and her dignity im a heroine and im an embarrassment that just about summed it all up she looked down into her wine and felt the alltoofamiliar melancholy settle over her she didnt fit in she didnt belong even her own brother looked at her as if she had suddenly become a stranger i rescued dierna which makes me a heroine just one little problemim lordans sister shed already heard some of lordans peers teasing him about his older brother kero it made him uncomfortable for all that he was deeply truly grateful for all that hed offered her anything she wanted right down to half the lands and it shamed him he should have been the one to rescue his bride wasnt that the way it went in the tales not his sibling not his sister she could talk until she was blue in the face about how it had been kethrys sword that had done everything none of that matteredbecause she had gone out on the ride in the first place without the help of the sword thats what they were calling it now the ride there were even rumors of a song dierna did not want her in the bower not that kero wanted to be in the bower she most assuredly did not fit in there but she keeps looking at me as if she thinks imwhat was it that tarma said the other day shechorne like im going to suddenly start courting her like i make her skin crawl kero gulped down half the wine in her goblet and a page immediately reached over her shoulder and poured her more the rich fruity scent rose to her nostrils and tempted her not at all i wish i dared get drunk the hired guards didnt want her in the barracks it was not that it was unwomanly for her to be there by their standards they had enough women with them already it was that she didnt fit there because of her status she was noble and she was family and she didnt belong with the hirelings and her old friends among the servants kept treating her like some kind of demideity i dont fit here anymore she thought a notion that had begun to make its own little rut through her mind shed repeated it so often i just dont fit here if i stay here much longer i think i may go mad it feels like im being smothered tarma was right you can put a hawk in a birdcage like a songbird but its still a hawk she caught a movement down at the second table and saw her grandmother and her friend easing out of their seats it didnt look like a trip to the necessary it seemed more final somehow she knew where they were going back to the tower they werent needed here anymore eitherso they were making a graceful unobtrusive exit i wish i could do the same that was when it hit her why cant i do the same why cant i just go she sat up straighter feeling her cheeks warming with excitement i have to return grandmothers sword anywayso why dont i follow after them maybe theyll be willing to teach me things didnt tarma say they used to have a school the more she thought about it the better the idea sounded and the more intolerable and confining the idea of remaining here became finally she excused herself from the tableher seatmate didnt even noticeand slipped out of the great hall and into the corridor beyond once there she hiked her encumbering skirts above her knees and ran for her room there were no servants in the hall to see her and although she split one sleeve of the gown she no longer cared let dierna give it to one of her maids i certainly wont wear it again she slipped out of it as soon as she reached her room tossed it in a heap in the corner and dragged her saddlebags out from under the bed she rummaged through chests and wardrobe in a frenzy discarding most of what she encountered without a second thought casting what shed decided to keep on the bed it was amazing how little she owned that she wanted to keep her armor lordans outgrown castoffs a few personal treasures and the jewelry and books lenore had left her it all fit into two saddlebags with room to spare she started to take a last look around her roomand realized that it held nothing of her or for her anymore so she turned her back on it and strode out chain mail jingling with a cheer she began to feel herself out in the stable even the grooms were absent enjoying their own version of the wedding feast all the better that made it possible for her to saddle up verenna and ride out without anyone noticing the mare came to her whistle and stood quietly while she saddled and bridled her she felt verennas tense eagerness as she mounted as if the mare was as ready to be free of the place as kero was she touched her heel lightly to the mares flank verenna leapt forward they trotted across the courtyard cantered to the gates she was at a full gallop as they passed the gates in the outer wall kero laughed as they burst out into the sunshine wind whipping her hair verenna striding effortlessly under her nothing was going to stand in her way now but she pulled verenna up abruptly at the sight of the two mounted figures waiting for her at the crossroads suddenly sick with dread she approached them at a walk what if they tell me to go back what if they dont want me what if what kept you asked tarma six this was not precisely what kerowyn had pictured when shed asked for teaching chopping wood i can understand kero said slowly hefting the unfamiliar weight of the ax in her right hand she eyed her appointed target an odd setup of two logs braced against the tree and shifted her hand a bit farther down on the haft it wasnt a very big ax and she had the sinking feeling that it was going to take a long time to chop her way through the pile of log sections stacked up at the edge of the clearing shed already put a dent in the pile over the past few days using a larger ax in a conventional manner but this tool baffled her it wasnt much heavier than the hand axes some of rathgars men had fought with ive been cutting wood for you since i got here and i can see that you still need firewood but why brace the logs so that im cutting at that angle warrltarmas enormous wolfcreaturesnorted flopped himself down in a patch of sun and laid his ears back in patent disgust his kind were called kyree so tarma had told herand she needed no testimony as to his intelligence shed seen that herself with her own eyes shed gotten used to his presence over the past weeks and now she could read his expressions with more ease than she could read tarmas it would appear that she was being particularly dense though for the life of her she couldnt figure out what she was missing tarma chuckled evilly and leaned against the woodpile if kero had tried that shed probably have knocked half the logs down the pile didnt shift a thumbs length but what if youve got it wrong the shinain asked conversationally what if we dont need you to chop firewood what kero replied cleverly she blinked and did a fast revision of her assumptions you mean you heat that great stone hulk with magic but i thought you said that it takes more effort to do something magically than it does to just do it yes tarma replied a maddening little smile on her face no we dont heat it with magic yes we use wood and we still dont need you to chop it we hire it done a couple of nice farmer lads with muscles like oxen so why would i be having you chop wood and why would i be giving you different sizes of axes to do it with and now why would i start asking you to work at odd angles kero blinked again and the answer came to her in a burst of memoryrecollections of lordan working out against the pells because you want me to strengthen my arms and shoulders she said immediately all over and not just a particular set of muscles and because while youre doing so you might as well be useful besides if i make you really chop up wood you wont hold back against the pells you might against me you already do this time tarma laughed outright but kero couldnt resent it somehow kero knew the shinain wasnt laughing at her expense it was more as if tarma was sharing a sardonic little joke out on the plains we were set to working bellows at the forge toting water for the entire camp or any one of a hundred other things be grateful its woodchopping ive got you doing ax calluses youre getting now are going to be in about the same places that youd want swordcalluses kero sighed and took her first methodical blow now that she knew why she was engaging in this exercise in frustration it wasnt quite so frustrating and she vowed silently im going to be a lot more careful in placing my hits i just might impress her she certainly wasnt impressing her grandmother kethry had tested her in any number of ways from placing a candle in front of her and telling her to light it by thinking of fire to placing various small objects in front of her and asking her to identify which of them were enchanted shed evidently failed dismally since kethry had given up after three days and told her shed be better off in the hands of the shinain but she wont take that sword back kero thought in puzzlement swinging the ax in an underhand arc repeating the motion over and over switching from right to left and back again under tarmas watchful eye its hers but she wont take it back i dont understandits obviously magical and no one in her right mind would give something like that awaybut she keeps saying that it spoke for me and its mine so marvelous it spoke for me now what am i supposed to do with it faster tarma said kero sped up her blows trying to keep each one falling in exactly the same place right on top of and within the narrow bite shed incised on the sides of the logs those logs were strapped tightly to either side of what had once been a tree when it had been alive it had somehow managed to root itself in the exact middle of this clearing and had taken advantage of the full sun to grow far taller than any of the trees around it perhaps that had been a mistake from the look of the top of the stump some two mens height above her head it had been lightningstruck that top was splintered in a way that didnt look to be the hand of man maybe grandmother got in a temper one day this was not where tarma schooled her new pupil and practiced her own swordwork this was just what it seemed a kind of primitive back court to the tower with a large outdoor hearth for cooking whole deer on one side the pile of firewood ready to be chopped on the other and in the center the old dead tree with iron bands around it a big old dead tree kero could circle what was left of the trunk with her armsbarely thats not too bad tarma observed she pushed herself off the woodpile and gestured to kero to stop then strolled over to the two logs and began examining the cuts closely kero wiped sweat from her forehead with her sleeve and shook her arms to keep them loose thats not too bad at all and considering what a late start you gotcan you finish those in double time she gave kero the kind of look dent used tothe kind that said be careful what you say youll have to live up to it kero licked salty moisture from her upper lip and considered the twin logs they were chopped a little more than halfway through the target shed been creating was just above the iron bands holding them tight to the tree trunk so when i get toward the end theyll probably break the rest of the way under their own weight she squinted up at the sun broken light coming down through the thick foliage made it hard to tell exactly where the sun was it was close to noon though that was for certain her stomach growled as if to remind her that she had gotten up at dawn and breakfast had been a long time the sooner i get these chopped the sooner i can have something to eat some bread and cheese maybe sausage cider fruitand i know she magics that up pears and grapes and justripe apples all served up together are not natural at any time of year i think i can she said carefully ill try tarma stepped back and nodded kero set to driving herself with the reminder of how good that lunch was going to tasteespecially the cider at double time she was getting winded very quickly there was a stitch in her side and she couldnt keep herself from panting which only parched her mouth and throat her eyes blurred with fatigue and stung from the sweat and damp hair that kept getting in the way finally though she heard the sound shed been waiting for the crack of wood first on one side of the trunk then on the other as she got in one last blow then lowered her arms and backed off from the tree the two halflogs bent out from the center trunk then with a second crack broke free and fell to the ground kero rather wanted to fall to the ground herself she certainly wanted to drop the ax which now felt as if it weighed as much as the tree trunk but she didnt shed learned that lesson early on when shed dropped a practice sword at the end of a bout tarma had picked it up and given her a look of sheer and painfilled disgust shed never felt so utterly worthless in her life but worse was to come tarma had carefully patiently and in the tone and simple words one would use with a fiveyearold explained why one never treats a weapon that way even when one is tired even when the weapon is just potmetal and fit only to practice with then as if that wasnt humiliation enough she put the blade away and made kero chop wood and haul water for the next three days straight instead of chopping and hauling in the morning and practicing in the afternoon so she hung onto the little handax until tarma took it away from her all right youngling she said in that gravelly voice as kero raised a hand at the end of an arm that felt like the wood shed just been chopping lets get back to the tower and a hot bath and some food youve earned it then she grinned and after lunch a mild little workout hmm kero finished getting her arm up to her forehead and mopped her brow and the back of her neck with a sleeve that was already sopping wet lady she croaked every time you set me a mild little workout i wind up flat on my back before sundown too tired to move youre a hard taskmaster tarma only chuckled lunch in the tower was as civilized as even keros mother could have wished the three of them sat around a square wooden table in one of the upper balconies sun streaming down on them a fresh breeze drying keros hair despite the fact that she had braided it tightly bits of it were escaping from her braids and the breeze tugged at them like a kitten with string she kept trying to get it back under control but it persisted in escaping and finally she just gave up and let it fly there was no one here to care how respectableor notshe looked she felt much the better for her hot bath though her muscles still ached in unaccustomed places from that little exercise this morning furthermore she knew very well that she was going to hurt even more tonight but it was a small price to pay for freedom freedom from the bower from boredom from pretending i was something i wasnt that thought led inevitably to another so what am i now what am i supposed to be doing with myself and one morewhy wasnt i like dierna content with being someones lady an uneasy set of thoughtsand uncomfortable thoughts but problems that for the moment she could do nothing about she forced her attention back to more immediate concerns like lunch i dont know where grandmother gets her provisions but wendar would kill to find out on a platter in the center of the table were cheese sausage and bread simple fare certainly not the kind of things one would expect a powerful mage to savorbut they were the best kero had ever tasted it wasnt just hunger adding flavor either even after one was pleasantly full the food at kethrys table tasted extraordinary beside the platter was a second holding fruit not only apples pears and grapes but cherries as well definitely not natural those are fresh apples pear season is over grapes are ripe but cherries wont be for another moon and apples dont ripen until fall but the sun felt wonderful the apple shed just cut into quarters was pleasantly tart and kero didnt much want to think about anything for a while im going to enjoy this however it came about father was wrong about grandmother and he was probably just as wrong about mages in general think youre ready for some family history kethry said casting a long look at her from across the old table as kero reached for a piece of sausage i think i have a fair number of surprises for you for one thing you have some ratherunusualcousins quite a lot of them in fact kero froze in midreach the sorceress sat back in her cushioned chair tucked flyaway hair behind one ear and smiled at her expression in her russet gown of soft linen she looked nothing at all like a feared and legendary mage she looked like the matriarch of a noble family and i must look like a stranded fish kero thought trying to get her mouth to close dont look so stricken child tarma said and reached across the table picked up the sausage and dropped it into her hand theres no outlawry on the family name its justwell you have a lot more relatives than you know about those cousins for instance i do she gathered her scattered wits and took a deep breath only then becoming aware that she was still clutching the sausage she put it down carefully on her plate i meanyou said something about daughters and granddaughters earlier but mother never said anythingi didnt know what to think how many did mother have a sister or your mother had six brothers and sisters youngling tarma interrupted grinning from ear to ear at the dumbstruck look on her pupils face she played with one end of her own irongray braid as she spoke the tail of hair was as thick as keros wrist and as gray as the coat of tarmas mare your grandmother and i are goddesssworn sisters and i know ive explained that to you already when kero finally nodded she continued well what i didnt tell you was that before i met her my clan was wiped out by the same bandits shed contracted to stop it was one of my first jobs as a journeyman kethry put in after tarma paused for a moment staring off at a long cloud above the trees they had taken over a whole town and were terrorizing the inhabitants tarma followed them there and i managed to intercept her before she managed to get herself killed huh you wouldnt have done much better alone greeneyes tarma replied sardonically coming back to the conversation well we decided to team up it worked and weactually managed to take out the bandits and survive the experience that was when we figured wed make pretty good partners then things got a little complicated kethry chuckled popping a grape into her mouth a little complicated tarma raised both eyebrows then shrugged i supposein the same way that stealing a warsteed can get the clans a little annoyed anyway the main thing is that we got back to the plains she got adopted into the shinain and she vowed to the elders that shed build a new clan for me eventually she met and wedded your grandfather jadrek and damn if she didnt just about manage to repopulate talesedrin all on her own kethry chuckled and actually blushed jadrek had a little to do with that she pointed out raising an eloquent finger at her partner well true enough and good blood he put in too tarma stretched tossed the braid back over her shoulders and clasped both gnarled hands around her knee thats another story we three raised seven children all told when the core group claimed the herds we added adoptees from other clans orphans and younglings who had some problems and wanted a fresh start talesedrin is a full clan smaller than it was before the massacre but growing kind of funny how many young suitors we got drooling around the core and the corebloodbut then to us a blond is exotic buti dont understand kero protested if my uncles and aunts are all shinain why arent i how did i end up here instead of there good question tarma acknowledged the way these things work is that even though keth vowed her children to the clan what she vowed was that theyd have the right to become clan not that they had to its the younglings who decide for themselves where they want to go we dont make anyone do anything they arent suited forthe plains are too harsh and unforgiving for anyone who doesnt love them to survive there sowhen weve got a case like keths vowed younglings of adopted blood the children spend half their time with the clans until theyre sixteen then they choose whether they want to become shinain in full or go off on their own five of those aunts and uncles of yours chose shinain ways and the talesedrin banner when they came of age to make the choice mother didnt and kero asked curiously why would anyone choose to stay here the keep may be the most boring backwater in the world i was getting to that tarma gave her one of those looks of the two that didnt go with the clans one picked up where his mother left off and took over the white winds sorcery school shed founded and set up at the keepjust moved it off onto property hed swindlahem she cast a sideways glance at kethry who only seemed amused to kero excuse me earned thats your uncle jendar its not that he didnt like clan life its that hes adeptpotential and all that magetalent would be wasted out there theres another son and hes magegifted as well thats your uncle jadrek only hes a shinain shaman but your mother lenore was lastborn your grandfather died when she was very small and we had some problems with the school that kept us busy maybe too busy shewell tarma coughed and looked embarrassed lets say she was different scared to death of horses and had fits over the clan style of living so we stopped even sending her out to the plains bookish like jadrek but no logic no discipline no gift of scholarship no real interest in anything but ballads and tales and romances no abilities besides the ones appropriate to a fine lady no magetalent in short she was our disappointment poor thing kethry sighed and twined a curl of silver hair around her fingers she spent all her time at the neighboring familys place and all she really wanted to be was somebodys bride the same daydream as all the girls she knew i scandalized her tarma terrified her finally i fostered her with the lythands until she was sixteen then brought her back here she came back a ladyand suited to nothing else kero thought about her mother for a moment surprised that for the first time in monthsyearsthe thoughts didnt call up an ache of loss even when lenore had been well shed been fragile unsuited to anything that took her outside the keep walls even pleasureriding and likely to pick up every little illness that she came in contact with no wonder she didnt like tarma or her clan living in a tent for three moons every year must have been a hell for her so what were you going to do she asked carefully mother wasnt the kind of person you could leave on her own she was better with someone to take care of her kethry smiled slightly the lines around her eyes deepening a gentle way to put it but accurate frankly i had no ideas beyond getting her married off i wanted to find a really suitable husband for her one she could learn to love but after one experience with suitors i despaired of finding anyone that would treat her so that shed survive the marital experience her eyes hardened that suitor by the by was baron reichert not the baron then just a youngster hardly older than lenore but already experienced beyond his years one might even say jaded one might tarma agreed i prefer spoiled debauched and corrupt he was never interested in anything other than the lands and when he saw how delicate your mother was he damn near danced for joy she scowled and kero read a great deal in that frown need saw it too damn sword nearly made keth pull it on him and skewer him then and there first time that stupid things been totally right in a long time and us having to fight it to keep from being made into murderers but given whats been going on maybe we should have taken the chance kethry sighed and leaned forward a little well we were in a pickle then i knew reichert would keep coming back as long as she was unwedded and lenore was just silly enough that he might be able to persuade her that he loved her i was at my wits end i even considered manufacturing a quarrel and disinheriting her long enough for reichert to lose interest then your father showed up escorting a rich young mageling and looking for work when his escort duties were done strong handsome in an overmuscled way full of stories about the strange places hed been and amazingly patient in some circumstances personally i thought he was godsent the fathead tarma muttered under her breath kero winced a little not because of what tarma had said but because she couldnt bring herself to disagree with it shed been here at the tower for several weeks now and with each day her former life seemed a little less real a little farther distant she supposed she should be feeling grief for rathgar but instead whenever she tried to summon up the proper emotions all she could recall were some of the stupid things hed done and the unkind words hed said so often to her im turning into some kind of inhuman monster she thought with guilt i cant even respect my fathers memory he may have been a fathead sheenedra but he was exactly what lenore needed and wanted a big strong man to protect and cosset her kethry looked up at the blindingly blue sky and followed a new cloud with her eyes for a moment i offered to let him stay on for a bit and the moment lenore laid eyes on him i knew she was attracted to him give her credit for some sense at leastreichert terrified her as much or more than you ever did i was just afraid that hed notice what he was doing and manage to convince her he was harmless tender little baby chicks know a weasel when they see one tarma retorted scratching the bridge of her beaklike nose with one finger thats not sense thats instinct lady bright i suppose i should be glad her instincts were working at least one year in his custody and youd have been out a daughter and lands and probably under siege in this tower probably kethry agreed wearily well to continue the story that young mage was the last pupil we were going to take we planned to retire within a few years so i let rathgar stick aroundand i told lenore i wanted her to run a little deception on him that part i know about kero exclaimed if you mean that she pretended to be the housekeepers daughter instead of yours so he felt free to court her kethry nodded and kero flushed when i was little that seemed so romantic tarma snorted romantic dear goddessi supposed shed think of it that way we were both afraid that if he knew she was keths daughter hed never even think about courting her we just wanted her under the protection of somebody whod take care of her without exploiting her it all would have worked fine except for rathgar himself kethry said shaking her head if id had any idea how he felt about mageswell she fell very happily and romantically in love with him and he was just dazzled by her and it all looked as if things were going to work out wonderfully he proposed she accepted and i told him who she really was and the roof fell in kero felt entirely confident in making that statement she knew her father and had a shrewd guess as to what his reaction to such a revelation would be outrage at the deception further outrage that this mage was his beloveds mother before long hed have convinced himself that kethry had some deeplaid plot against him and hed have done his best to pry his poor innocent lenore out of her mothers deadly influence i didnt see it coming kethry admitted i should have and i didnt and at that point it was too late my daughter was deep in the throes of romantic love and rathgar was her perfect hero anything lenore heard from me on the subject threw her into hysterics she was certain that i wanted to part them she thought he made the sun rise and set tarma said with utter disgust her hawklike face twisted into an expression of distaste its a damned good thing he was an honest and unmalicious man because if hed beaten her and told her she deserved it shed have believed him how could any woman put herself in that kind of position willingly i suppose i should have expected it kethry said gloomily i set the whole mess up in the first place you know what your people saybe careful what you ask for you may get it for the first time she had someone around who thought she was wonderful just as she was helpless and weak and wasnt trying to force her to do something constructive with her life of course she thought he hung the moon tarma threw up her hands i still dont understand it keth went ahead with the marriage because anything was safer than letting reichert have another chance well that was when lenore decided keth and i were old fools and began listening only to rathgar and when he saw he had the upper hand he started making demands finally it came down to this when lordan was born he made keth promise never to set foot on keep property without an invitation so thats why keros voice trailed off a great many things started making sense now i think he was afraid id try and take her away from him kethry said after a long silence filled only with the sound of the wind in the leaves below them i really do think he didnt care as much about the property as he did about my daughter on the other hand i know that he always resented that every bit of his newwon wealth came from me i think he kept expecting me to try and take over again to control him through either the wealth lenore or you children probably that was the one thing he hated more than anything else being controlled by someone maybe because he got a bellyful of taking orders when he was younger i dont know i do know that hed never have believed grandmother didnt have some kind of complicated plot going tarma got up stretched and perched herself on the stone railing of the balcony well im not that generous she growled the man was a common merc a little better born than most but not even close to landed and that was what he wanted all his lifeto win lands and become gentry thats what most mercs want once they lose their taste for fighting whether its a farm they dream of or a place like the keep they all want some kind of place they can claim as their own and thats the long and the short of it kero shifted uneasily on her wooden bench and put down the last of the sausage uneaten she had the vague feeling she ought to be defending rathgar but she couldnt both of them were right she knew beyond a shadow of any doubt that rathgar had adored her motherbut she also knew his possessive obsession about his lands and she knew that there would be no way that kethry could ever have convinced him that she didnt care about the property so long as her daughter was happy he simply could not have understood an attitude like that kero had heard him holding forth far too many times on the folly of some acquaintance or some underling giving up property for the sake of a child and his reasoning by his own lights was sound after all if one gave up the property now how could one provide for that same child or leave it the proper inheritance destroy a birthright for the sake of the moment shed heard him say once when the lythands had settled a dispute with a neighbor by deeding the disputed land to a common relation folly and madness your children wont thank you for it when theyve grown into sense and she was sure now that this was the source of his deepseated bitternessthat he owed everything not only to his wifes mother not only to a woman but to a mage and one who had earned it all honestly herself that must have rankled the most mages were not to be trusted mages could change reality into whatever suited them at the moment mages were the source of everything that was wrong with the world thats how and why your folk ended up with a breedingherd of shinain horses tarma said startling her out of deep thought i dont know if you know how rare it is for us to sell a stud but we let him have onean ungelded cull but still a stud he wouldnt listen to keth about the lands he didnt have her resources and he didnt have her capital he was operating on the edge of disaster squeaking through season after season never making a profit we had done fine but wed had the schools this land is too rocky to be good farm land the tenants barely managed to make ends meet finally i had the clan bring in a herd of the best culls and sell them to him at a bargain price he figured hed outbargained the ignorant barbarians we didnt care that got him something he could use to maintain the keep and lenore without stripping the lands bare or abusing the tenants then when you and your brother were of an age to train your own beasts i arranged to have a couple of good young mares slipped into the next batch he bought she lifted her face to the sun and breeze and kero thought she looked very like a weathered bronze statue tough yet somehow graceful it wasnt all that hard to do kethry said wryly really it wasnt after all we were making trips back to the clan every year to see the rest of my brood it was more than worth the fuss to get him convinced you two should have them and then convince him it had been all his own idea it was about my only way of doing anything for you after i pulled back to the tower and promised to leave you all alone so what do you think of all this tarma asked finally turning those bright blue eyes back toward kero it isnt often a person gets an entire clan as relatives and right out of nowhere too am i ever going to get to meet them she asked impulsively the others my uncles and aunts and all tarma laughed oh i imagine eventually but right now you and i have a previous appointment kero felt a moment of disappointment then smiled after all it wasnt as if everything had to happen all at once look how much has happened in just the past few weeks i think i can wait a little longer then wed better get to it before we both get stiff she replied and grinned or before i get a chance to think about what youre going to do to me at practice the one thing tarma was an absolute fanatic about was cleanliness she insisted kero take a bath after morning work and afternoon training both there was no shortage of hot water at the tower unlike the keepthat was one magical extravagance kethry was more than willing to indulge in once kero got over her initial surprise she found that she liked the idea of twicedaily baths hot water did a great deal to ease aching muscles and the evening bath was a good place to think things over with a light dinner and good wine right beside the enormous tub kethry left her granddaughter alone after dinner saying when kero asked her that everyone needs a little privacy kero was just as glad she tended to fall asleep rather quickly after those long soaks and she doubted shed be very good company for anyone with unlimited hot water she found she was following tarmas example drawing one bath to get rid of the dirt and sweat then draining it and drawing a second of hotter clean water to soak in the bathing chamber in her room was far nicer than the corresponding room at the keep it was as big as her sleeping chamber easily and the tub could have held two comfortably that tub looked as if it had been hollowed out of a huge granite boulder then polished to a mirrorsmooth finish there were convenient flattened places just the right size to rest a plate and a cup at either end of it water hot and cold came out of spouts in the wall above the middle you simply pulled a little lever attached to something like a sluicegate and the water ran into the tub the water itself came from a spring in the mountain above kethry had shown her the cisterns at the top of the cliff the tower had been built intotelling her they were part of the original building the original building and she doesnt know how old it is thatsamazing it made kero wonder who those builders wereand what theyd been like they certainly enjoyed their comforts she mused idly sipping her wine set into the wall of the bathing chamber was an enormous window made of tiny handsized diamondshaped panes of glass glazing the windows had been kethrys addition the previous occupants had either seen no need for glazed windows or had been unable to produce them tonight kero had noticed a full moon rising and once shed drawn her second bath she blew out the candles to watch it and the stars with all the incredible things those builders were able to do i cant imagine why they wouldnt have been able to make a little glass i wonder if they were so powerful that they could actually keep the winter winds out of the tower by magic moonlight filtered through the steam rising from her bath and touched the surface of the water turning it into a rippling mirror she had to laugh at her fancies then for the answer was obvious to anyone but a romantic of course glass breaks and grandmother said herself she had no idea how long the place stood empty there are more than enough crows and robberrats around here to steal every last shard blessed agnira some of mothers silliness must have rubbed off on me she laughed aloud and the water sloshed at the sides of the tub as she reached for the carafe of wine to pour herself a second serving that was when she noticed that she was nowhere near as sore and stiff as shed expected to be i must be getting use to this she thought with surprise by the trinei was beginning to think id never stop aching funny thougheven when i was so sore i wanted to die i still was enjoying myself this afternoon had been the first time tarma had actually given her a lesson in real swordwork admonishing her to pretend im one of those logs the shinain had run her through some basic moves then brought her up to speed on them before the afternoon was over she had been performing simple strikeguardstrike patterns against tarma at full force and full speedand she thought her teacher seemed pleased it had been even better than yesterday when tarma started her on tracking once kero knew what to look for it had been surprisingly easy to track the movements of a deer a badger and warrl himself across a stretch of forest floor of course none of them had been trying to hide their trails kero had a notion that if warrl wanted to hide his traces the only way anyone would be able to track him would be by magic most satisfying about todays exercises had been that the skills shed acquired had been all her own the sword was hanging on the wall of her room and kero wasnt going to take it down until she didnt need its uncanny expert assistanceat least where fighting was concerned is that what i want to do she asked herself suddenly is that what i want to learn she pondered the question while the moon climbed higher in the window and the square of silver light crept off the water and onto the floor leaving her end of the bathing chamber in darkness i suppose it makes sense she thought with a certain unease after all its always been physical things that ive been best at riding hunting hawkingthat knifefighting i pried out of dent the only proper thing i was ever any good at was dancing the one thing shed been able to surprise tarma with was her expertise with bow and then she asked me why i hadnt taken a bow with me when i went after the bandits when i said that it just never occurred to me i thought she was going to give up on me then and there kero sighed its so hard to have to think of people as your enemies at least she isnt being as nasty as dent was to lordan dent had been absolutely merciless on his young pupil never giving him second chances cursing and sometimes striking him with the flat of a blade driving him to exhaustion and beyond and yet once practice was over he was unfailingly courteous a kindly man whod praise lordan to his face for what hed done right remind him of what hed done wrong and then go on to tell rathgar of lordans progress with exactly the same words praise with the criticism he never treated me that waybut why does it feel as if he wasnt doing me any favors by letting me get off lightly she closed her eyes and sank a little lower into the hot water maybebecause half of what tarmas teaching me is undoing mistakes i learned to make well at least i can see some progress i get a little better each day she shows me something new each day and shes giving me the same kind of talks afterward that dent used to give lordan that felt good warm and satisfying there were no buts attached to tarmas compliments when she said that kero was doing something well she meant it with no qualifications i just hope im not boring her too much at least im patient lordan used to get so mad when he couldnt do something right that hed storm off the field and go duck his head in the horse trough and she cant say im not determined the moon finally rose to a point where there was no light shining in the window at all the bathing chamber was in complete darkness and the wine was gone i guess its time for bed she decided before i fall asleep in the tub she found the plug at the bottom of the bathtub with her toes took the bit of chain attached to it between her big toe and the rest and pulled when tarma had shown her the drain at the bottom of the tub shed been both amazed and amusedthe tubs at home had to be bailed by hand then tilted over on their sides to drain completely she couldnt imagine why no one had ever thought of something like this before she stood up slowly a thick towel hung from a rod at the side of the tub it gleamed softly in the darkness and she reached for it then stepped out onto the tiled floor that was the only thing wrong with this chamber the tile made the floor cold cold enough that she dried herself off quickly and hung the towel back where it belonged tarma had given her one of those looks when shed thrown it on the floor and kero had managed to deduce that there werent many servants in the tower thereafter shed put things away properly she pulled on the old shirt she used to sleep in and walked slowly and silently across the floor to her own room tarma wanted her to practice moving quietly whenever possible so that doing so became habit rather than something she had to think about kero had decided on her own that learning to move quietly in the dark would be a very good idea so she practiced a little every night once past the doorway she turned to light the candle shed left on a shelf by the door and when she turned back with it in her hand she thought shed jumped into a nightmare teeth that was all she saw at first huge white fangs gleaming in the candlelight and eyes the size of walnuts shining with an evil green glow all their own seven she shrieked jumped back into the wall behind her and dropped the candle all at the same time the flame went out immediately leaving her in the dark she felt for the wall and edged along it toward the door hoping to escape into the bathing chamber before whatever it was realized she was movingand wondering what awful thing had happened that this thing had gotten past tarma and her grandmother children snorted a voice fromsomewhere it seemed to come from everywhere at once she froze child i am not the snow demon i dont eat babies i just came here tonight to talk to you she didnt move and the voice took on a tone of exasperation will you please light that candle again and go sit down wwho are you she stammered where are you right here something cold and wet prodded her between her breasts and she nearly screamed again its warrl you little ninny you see me every day warrl she reached outcautiouslyand encountered a furry head at about chest level it certainly felt like warrl and while youre at it you can scratch my ears it certainly sounded the way shed imagined warrl would talk if warrl could talk how are you she began he interrupted her im mindspeaking you he said impatiently its exactly what you could do if you wanted to and the other person had the gift of mindhearing she felt a brief movement of air and heard the faintest little ticking sound a sound that might have been the clicking of claws on the floor do light that candle and come to bed theres a good child she went to her knees and groped about on the floor until her left hand encountered the candle once lit she stood up with it in her hand and discovered that warrl had resumed the position hed been in when she first entered the room sprawled on her bed taking up fully half of it make yourself comfortable she said sarcastically more than a little nettled now that her heart had started beating again thank you i have he replied with equal irony she crossed the floor and put the candle into the sconce in the headboard refusing to look at him the entire time only when she had climbed up into bed and settled herself crosslegged on the blanket did she finally meet his eyes so if you could talk all this time why havent you she demanded there wasnt any reason for you to know i could he replied calmly now there is and what pray tell me is that reason i want to know why you have been concealing your gift her heart stopped again she couldnt pretend not to understand him she had the feeling that if she tried to lie mindtomind shed get caught and she knew very well what he was asking her mothers books had called this ability to hear thoughts a gift so she temporized trying to buy time to think i havent been hiding anything she countered it was the truth kethry hadnt asked her if she could hear thoughts or given her any tests to see if she could meanwhile her mind was running in little circles like a mouse caught in the bottom of a jar if grandmother finds out about this shell make me become a mage and i dont want to become a mage i want to be like tarma the kyree laid his ears back and winced please he shouted at her making her wince but bringing that frantic little circle of thoughts to a halt he sighed gustily much better thank you child i have no intention of betraying your secret to kethry if that is really what you wantbut what you just did is precisely the reason why i wanted to speak with you what did i do she whispered head still ringing from his shout his ears came back up every time you feel safe and begin to concentrate on some complicated problem that involves your emotions you do exactly what you just did you think out loud very loud i might add far louder than you know i would imagine that one could hear you all the way to the next keep if one was so minded i do she shook her head it didnt seem possible you do he insisted almost as loudly as i just shouted and unlike my shout which was meant only for your mind your thoughts are heard by anything receptive you are fortunate that your grandmother is not gifted with mindspeaking or your secret would be no such thing he flattened his ears and looked pained his brow wrinkled in a way that would have been funny under any other circumstances it is very discommoding and uncomfortable i wont dispute your right to keeping your abilities to yourself since they dont involve magecraft but i must insist that you get training quickly before you cause an unfortunate incident kero bit back her first reply which was that she had gotten training obviously what she had learned on her own wasnt good enough not if someone like warrl can hear me all the way to the lythands i can probably take care of it myself she said cautiously he lifted his lip just a trifle and snapped at the air in annoyance she shrank back instinctively his fangs were as long as her thumb and very sharp dont you realize i wouldnt be here if that were true there is no way you can train yourself and untrainedwell halftrainedyou are in terrible danger you are just very lucky that the mage you killed wasnt strongly mindgifted if he had beenwell youd probably be serving his every whim right now it is ridiculously easy to take over the mind of someone who is gifted but untrained your barriers are weak and you have no secondary defenses right now you are more vulnerable than someone with no gift at all and you display that fact to the universe every time you become distressed but that just led her right back to the same problem she didnt want kethry to know about this and who else was there that could train her she shook her head i cant he growled and sneezed as if he had smelled something he didnt like must you be so dense im offering to train you myself no one else will ever know not even my mindmate you are she could hardly believe it but why he put his head down on his paws and sighed selfdefense child selfdefense i am increasingly weary of trying to shut you out and you have at times awakened me out of my rest now in the interest of peaceful sleeping shall we work on that socalled shield of yours youre going about it all wrong and i thought i was overworked before kero thought with a little groan as she opened bleary eyes two weeks later on a morning that had arrived much too soon shed trained herself to wake as soon as the first light of sunrise came through her eastern window it seemed to hit her closed eyelids candlemarks earlier every morning the worst part of it is if tarma knew warrl was keeping me up half the night shed probably let me sleep later but if i tell herno i cant i dont know what shed think about this and i know shed tell grandmother kero rubbed her eyes with her knuckles and sat up slowly by the look of the clear pinktinged sky this was going to be another perfect daywhich meant tarma would be feeling pretty frisky kero was beginning to look forward to rainy days even more to days of cold and damp with a heavy morning fog both conditions made tarmas joints acheshe would stay in bed until late morning and confine keros workouts to sessions in the practice ring against the pells or other targets it wasnt particularly nice to be pleased when her teacher wasnt feeling wellbut kero had found that guilt in this case was easily outweighed by the pleasure of sleeping in for the past week shed been freed from the chopping and woodcarrying now she practiced against the pells and in sworddances in the morning had an hour or two of booktraining directly after lunch and practiced against tarma in the afternoon she no longer wondered what she was going to do with herselfshe was going to become a mercenary like tarma and like some of those women kethry had hired to protect lordan and the keep the only question in her mind now waswhat kind of mercenary the books that tarma was teaching her from were studies in strategy and tacticsthe ways to move and fight with whole armies at this point kero couldnt see why shed need anything of the sort but maybe tarma had some kind of plan kero was perfectly content to learn whatever tarma wished to teach her and let the future take care of itself tarma was always saying that no learning no knowledge is ever wasted if nothing else it probably wouldnt be a bad thing for an ordinary fighter to know how whole armies moved so she could anticipate her orders she stretched and arched her back then wormed her way back down under the warm blankets ill just relax a little longer she thought and reveled in the silence in her mind she hadnt realized just how much shed been overhearing until after warrl showed her the right way to protect herself ground center and shield for years there had been a kind of buzzing in back of all her thoughts as if she was hearing a tourney crowd from several furlongs away now it was gone and the relief was incredible she hadnt quite realized how useful this particular ability could be to a fighter either until warrl showed her hed proved she could use it to get a tactical advantage in many situations from doing as she had during the rescue and reading the area for enemy minds to reading her opponent during a combat and countering his moves before he even made them but she wasnt entirely happy about using it that way she caught herself falling asleep again and jerked herself back up into wakefulness she threw back the covers and swung her legs out of bed before she succumbed a second time a brief trip to the bathing chamber and a splash of cold water solved the problem the water was cold enough to make her gasp but she was certainly awake now i dont like the idea of reading someones thoughts without them knowing she decided while climbing into her breeches and tunic it doesnt seem fair maybe if the circumstances were really extraordinary like going after dierna alone it would be all right i mean with odds like that you have to use every advantage youve got but if i was just oneononeno its not right she tightened the laces on her tunic and reached for stockings and boots besides if i used it a lot pretty soon i wouldnt be able to hide its existence then what people would hate me or theyd be afraid of me it wouldnt be an advantage anymore itd be a handicap no i dont want that ive had my fill of being different that led to the same problem that had been troubling her since she came here whats wrong with me she asked herself unhappily as she laced her boots tight to her legs why is it that i dont want what everyone else does every other girl seems to want a husband and a house full of babies even grandmother and tarma had families and if tarma hadnt been swordsworn shed have raised her own children instead of helping with grandmothers she shook her head her earlier cheer gone i dont like children and if anyone else knew that theyd think i was some kind of monster i hate being cooped up inside and i dont want to have to spend my life taking care of everybody except myself but all the priests have to say about it is how women should rejoice that they can sacrifice themselves for their families blessed trine am i the one whos crazy or is it everybody else but since there was no possible way to answer that question she jerked the laces of her boots tight with a snarl of frustration and went out to take out her illhumor and uncertainty on the pells tarmas private practice ring was indoors rather than outside a second hollowedout cave beside the stables this one with the walls left rough and convoluted shed long ago tired of practicing in the cold and wetand the mere thought of practicing in the snow was enough to make her shiver besides back when she and keth had held the keep shed gotten used to having an indoor practice ground this one was much smaller but she didnt need room for twenty pupils anymore kero was going through her paces one of the shinain sworddances and as tarma watched her the swordsworns heart sang with pride granted it was one of the simplest of the exercises but kerowyn performed it so flawlessly that it looked as effortless as breathing the girls a natural she thought with a kind of astonished pleasure years and years of training younglings and never a natural in the lotand now at the end of my days i not only get to teach one but shes an adoptee my clan shed been waiting for kethry to get up the nerve to ask about the girl for weeks keth had been vaguely disappointed that kerowyn proved out null so far as magecraft went though shed admitted to her partner that the girl seemed more relieved than anything else now at last shed come down to watch kero work out and tarma sensed that she was ready to ask the question well kethry said as kerowyn moved into the next exercise in the cycle this one a little harder than the last she looks like shes doing all right that isnt need is it no its a painted wooden practice blade tarma told her i made it the same size heft and shape so she could get used to the weight and balance needs up on her wallher decision and she says the damn thing stays there until shes sure of her own abilities and she knows that what she does is due to her skill not the sword working through her so keth replied so what tarma countered teasingly so how is she the mage snarled in annoyance is she any good or not to tarmas utter amazement her throat closed and her eyes filled with tears she couldnt speak for a moment and kethry bit her lip in dismay oh no she whispered when she didnt have any magetalents i was surewhat are we going to do with her tarma wiped her eyes on the back of her hand and coughed to get her voice working again keth sheenedra youve got it backward the girls good hellfrost shes better than good one year just one year of teaching and companies are going to stand in line to have her she pulled kethry into one of the alcoves formed by the irregular walls of the cave so that kero wouldnt notice them watching her from the shadows look at her look at her move shes a natural keth the kind of pupil that comes along once in a teachers lifetime if shes lucky shes never had anything other than some indifferent training in knifefighting but shes taken to the sword as if she was born with one in her hand shes doing things now that most of my old students couldnt have done after two years of teaching she could probably earn a living right now if all somebody wanted was a basic recruit and in that year kethry watched her granddaughter rather than tarma in that year shell be able to go to the best companies and theyll take her for officer training they wont tell her that of course but shell be an officer a lot faster than you or i made it shes not only a natural with a weapon shes a natural on the field she poked kethry with her elbow to regain her attention by the way warrl said to tell you that you were right shes a mindspeaker he also said to tell you that hes taking care of the training kethry relaxed good and i appreciate his delicate sense of what to promise you know i was afraid you were unhappy because she was awful and you didnt know how to tell me tarma chuckled hardly and hardly unhappy to get a student like her is amazing enoughbut that it turns out to be one of ourswell the only thing that would make me happier would be if jadrek were here to see her keth smiled a little he probably knew before we did and thank warrl for me i was afraid she was a mindspeaker but since im not i had no way to tell i thought she was shielded but that could just have been the fact that she was concentrating shes better off in warrls handspawsthan mine i think he has his paws full tarma said recalling what warrl had told her this morning as stubborn as ever you were mindmate and as taciturn she wont tell me anything i have to pry it out of her thank the gods theres only one of her and i dont have to teach her combative mindmagic she refuses to learn the offensive techniques he had snorted his opinion of her attitude she has all the morals and compunctions as one of those halfcrazed heralds in that case i have a proposition to make you kethry took a deep breath before she continued tarma restrained a sigh keth only did that when she was going to ask something she didnt think her partner would like would you be up to teaching two your second pupil will already have had several years of good instruction so hell be about at keros level id guess tarma considered that for a moment id like to devote all my attention to herbut she needs some competition depends she replied after a moment depends on who the pupil is and how much free rein i have with him it is easier to teach two and having someone else around will keep her on her toes competition will be damned good for her especially if she thinks shes having to compete for my attention but i cant have a brat taking my concentration away from her and frankly i wont put up with a brat anymore i got a begging letter from megrarthon kethry replied watching kero and picking absently at a shiny bit of quartz embedded in the rock wall it arrived a couple of days ago but i had to get up the nerve to ask you about kero first so whats the king of rethwellan want with us tarma asked a little surprised was it from his majesty the king megrarthon jadrevalyn or my old student jad and did he mention his overhand from your old student and he said the gout in that broken shoulder is just too bad hes never going to get the overhand swing back hopefully hell never need it kethry sighed and tarma knew why the kings letters had always been very open with both of them and lately theyd been profoundly unhappy rethwellan politics were torturous at the best of times and he was regretting that his fathers sword had ever spoken for him three state marriages two of them loveless had given him a surfeit of sons and daughters and one of the sons was making life difficult for him tarma and kethry were two of a scant handful of people he could be that open with tarma had changed his diapers more than once and had tutored him in the way of the sword keth had nursed him through his first love and subsequent broken heart together they had helped put his father on the throne before he was a year old which made them very old friends of the family that middle son of his is being a grekkashen tarma said in disgust said carrion eater combining the worst aspects and habits of every scavenger known to the shinain it ate things even vultures wouldnt touch it slept in a bed of rotting detritus from its foraging and both sexes were known to eat their own young on a whim kethry nodded so hes written to you not lately but yes i got a letter while i was down on the plains i just didnt see any reason to depress you with it tarma grimaced you know sometimes i wonder if the reason the rethwellan royal line has so much trouble is because of the wretched things they name their children thats as good a theory as any kethry replied managing not to smile the names jad had given his boys were bad enough but the eight girls names were worse all full of historical significance and all as unpronounceable as kyree howls those awful names were an ongoing joke between the two of them faramenthas as bright and trustworthy a young man as youd ever hope to see and karathanelan is making up for him by causing jad three times the grief his older brother gave his latest antic is to torment the youngest boy verbally until the youngster explodes and attacks him now the poor lad is getting a reputation for being a hothead and a bully because thanel is a handsome languid vicious little fop playing on the fact that hes shorter and lighter than the other boy tarma interrupted remember ive seen him when i went back up with faram to deliver him to jad and see him made heir thats why i told jad i wouldnt have him here at thirteen hed already made up his mind that since he wasnt the heir he was going to sleep and charm his way to a crown he probably will too some little fool of a princess with a senile old father is going to fall for his pretty face clever wit and graceful manners and spend the rest of her life pregnant while he plays bed games with her ladies torments her lap dogs and spends her treasury dry kethry shook her head from everything jad says youre right i told him it was a mistake to let irenia raise thanel instead of fostering him out and now the mistake is irreversible well the long and the short is that he hopes he can find some place to send thanel that will keep him out of mischiefbut until he does he needs to get the youngest out of thanels reach otherwise theres going to be fratricide tarma nodded it was a logical solution and rather elegant especially since it would get the hotheaded boy some muchneeded discipline and training so he wants us to take the youngest thatd be darenthallis right absolute baby of the bunch right hes not magetalented so hell be yours kethry tilted her head to one side are you up to this tarma stretched feeling every joint creak for jads sakeand for the boys from what jads said the youngster is a lot like faram which means he wont be at all hard to teach i understand that the boy does have a quick temper which makes him an easy target for thanel i wouldnt see any lad have to put up with that if i can help it i dont like bullies and thanels the worst kind of bullya clever one although i must say a lot of this is jads own fault he wouldnt have gotten into this mess if he hadnt been trying to compete with you in the number of offspring he could produce kethry smiled the tension draining out of her i was hoping youd say that now just one other possible problem my granddaughter is not what i would call unattractive and shes very probably not only a virgin she has no idea of tarma grinned evilly she knew what was coming and she had no intention of letting keth slough this job off on her especially not when shed agreed to teach a second youngster all by herself then youd better tell her hadnt you after all youre her grandmother and you know very well when i start to make the two youngsters work together whats going to happen but kethry said faintly tarma kept right on going i think the experience will be good for both of them actually the boy has probably been playing a poor third to faramtheheir and thanelthebeauty itll be nice for him to have a young lady paying attention to him but kethry repeated and you have to admit im hardly the one to give kero the basics of nature im celibate remember tarma was enjoying her partners discomfort keth had landed her with the job of explaining those basics to every boy that ever passed through their schools and since there were usually twice as many lads as girls passing through their hands tarma found herself with that uncomfortable duty far oftener than keth now the shoe was on the other foot and tarma intended to enjoy the fact besides she finished if your own daughter was such a dunce as to leave her completely ignorant its up to you to rectify the situation kethrys mouth tightened in dismay youre right of course and if shes going to join a company shes going to have to know all of it damn right she is tarma replied becoming serious from camphygiene to postrape trauma and since you worked with the healers in the sunhawks youre better equipped for that than i am those arent the kind of problems lads are going to face and they arent the kind of problems i ever had to deal with on my own but you can take it slowly i think give her the basics and pregnancy prevention and take care of the rest later she grinned think of it as my fee for agreeing to take daren on kethry shook her head still a mercenary tarma chuckled thats how you tell a merc is dead he just stops collecting paychecks kero knew that there was something in the air tarma had been a little absentminded lately with that slight frown she always wore when she was thinking but once shed satisfied herself that she wasnt the cause of the frown she relaxed whatever it was that was bothering tarma it was not under her control so she kept a weather eye out but concentrated on the things that were in her power to deal with she had speculations but nothing concrete to go on finally all speculations came to an end when she showed up at the practice ring with her arms full of equipment to find tarma there already fully armored complete with full helm working out and tarma wasnt alone there was a young man with her that was surprise enough he looked around keros age and she stiffened reflexively as they both stopped what they were doing and turned at the sound of her footstep he was rather handsome in a lanky notquitefinished sort of way his long hair was somewhere between brown and blond his eyes between gray and hazel he was taller than tarma and moved like a young colt that still isnt quite certain where his feet are going to go when he puts them down his armor was goodvery good use on it but wellmaintained and in perfect condition and there was a surcoat lying crumpled up with some other odds and ends in one of the little alcoves a surcoat that was as wellmade as the armor and looked as if it was blazoned with some kind of familial device all of which added up to one conclusion he was some kind of nobility kero did not like the implications of that tarma waited for kero to come up to them before speaking she pushed the faceguard of her helm up and gave kero a cool appraising look the young man did the same with his helm then shifted his weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other kero tarma said in a neutral even voice this is darenthallisdaren to us hell be training here with you keros first reaction was of resentment why her second was of jealousy we were just fine with the two of us she stepped forward slowly keeping her expression neutral but not her thoughts they dont need the moneyand now tarma is going to be spending half her time with him which means i wont be learning as much from her it isnt fair by the look of him he could have any teacher he wanted why should he steal mine she eyed his armor with envy up close it was even better than shed thought combination plate and chain mail the chain mail so fine it looked to have been knitted with articulated plate that had to have been specifically fitted to him and he wasnt finished growing yetwhich meant that someone somewhere didnt care how much it cost to keep fitting him with new armor every time he put on a growth spurt then she recognized the nameafter all there werent that many young men named darenthallis in the world and there was only one likely to have armor of that quality his highness prince darenthallis third son of the king which explained how hed gotten tarma to agree to teach him and virtually guaranteed that the shinain would be spending the lions share of her time with him the privilege of rank keros resentment trebled i have to earn my way here and he walks in and takes over but she kept it out of her face and manner shed learned to school her expressions long ago rathgar took a dim view of resentment and rebellion in his children daren smiled he looked selfconfident and sure of his superiority keros temper smoldered well well just see how superior you are especially once we get into the woods if youve ever had to track anything in your life my fine young lord id be very much surprised she cleared her throat and made the first move im kerowyn she said nodding a little not holding out her hand she could have freed one to shake his but she chose not to daren he said are you one of lady kethryveris students ignoring the fact that im carrying armor assuming i couldnt possibly be anything other than a nice little ladylike mage im her granddaughter she replied acidly and im kalenedral tarmas student tarmas left eyebrow rose a little but otherwise her face was completely without expression well now that youve met she said quietly why dont we get down to business keros resentment continued to simmer over the next several weeks daren wasnt any better than she was especially not at archery but he kept acting as if he were giving her unaskedfor advice in a patronizing tone of voice that said whats a little girl like you doing mans work anyway and made her blood boil but she kept her temper somehow always turning to tarma after one of those supercilious little comments and asking her advice as if she hadnt heard darens unfortunately from time to time this backfired tarma would occasionally give her a slow sardonic smile and reply i think daren hit it dead in the black daren would smirk and keros ears would burn and she would have to bite her lip to keep from accidentally bringing her shield up into that arrogantly squared chin and then shed pull her faceguard down and do her damnedest to give him the trouncing of a lifetime at night before warrl arrived for her evening lesson in mindmagic shed lie back in her bath and seethe its not fair shed repeat like a litany hes had the best trainers from the time he was able to walk ive only had tarma for a few moons why should i have to share her and what makes him so much better than i am that money and power didnt buy for him but that was the problem wasnt it life wasnt fair and power and gold bought whatever they needed to from peoples skills to peoples lives and if anyone happened to be in the way it was too bad money had doubtless bought the nearruin of her family power was probably keeping the real perpetrator safe and now both were conspiring to steal her future if she lay down and let it happen i wont she resolved every night ill make him compete with me for every moment of time ill be so much better than he is that tarma will see shes wasting her time with him and concentrate on me again ill do it i have to it helped that he was as helpless as a baby in the woods and when he started he couldnt even track the most obvious of traces she would give him advice in the same kind of patronizing tone he used with herand she laughed inside to see how he bristled she was planning on doing just that this morning as she skipped down the stairs to the stable humming a little tune under her breath today was going to be a daylong stalkandtrap session a hound and rabbit game tarma called it and warrl was going to be the rabbit daren hadnt yet figured out that warrl was anything more than a very large oddlooking dog and kero wasnt going to tell him after all they were supposed to be using their minds and paying attention to things and if he hadnt been able to figure out that the kyree was something rather different by now she didnt see any reason to enlighten him besides it would give her an edge that edge combined with her tracking skills should enable her to beat him to the quarry by whole candlemarks the meeting point was the stables kero reached them ahead of both daren and her teacher a brief look out the window this morning had told her all she needed to know about the weathertoday was going to be a typical latefall day for these parts cold wet and miserable even though there were no clouds overhead kero had seen them on the horizon the kind of flat gray clouds that meant an allday drizzle so shed dressed for it a waterproof canvas poncho over lambswool shirt and heavy sweater sheepskin vest and wool hose and breeches and her thickest stockings inside her boots daren had dressed for the cold but not an allday chill in wet weather he was wearing mostly leather which looked very good on him and would keep him warm at first but would do nothing for him once it was soaked his only concession to possible drizzle was a wool cloak a bright russet that would stand out in the graybrown woods like a rose in a cabbage patch and which was going to get caught on every twig and thorn unless he was very careful keros gray poncho wouldnt it was belted tight to her body at the waist and thorns wouldnt catch so easily on the tightlywoven oiled canvas kero hid a smirk with some difficulty tarma glanced at her in a way that kero couldnt read but said nothing daren just took in the peasantstyle clothing and gave her an amused and superior little smile kero had been toying with the notion of warning him about the oncoming rain but that smile made up her mind for her if hes too stupid to read the weather and too cocksure to ask advice when he sees someone dressed for weather he didnt expect he can suffer she thought with angry anticipation and i cant wait to see him shivering and chafing in that fancy wet leather i told you yesterday that this was going to be another hound and rabbit game following warrl tarma said interrupting her thoughts i didnt tell you that it would be under different rules kero stiffened and dropped her thoughts of revenge she noted that daren lost his little smile and fixed his eyes on tarma as if he was trying to read her mind this is going to be a hostile territory game the shinain continued rule one youre in enemy territory behind their lines following a spy assume that anything you do or say may give you away to the enemy rule two leave no traces yourselves assume the enemy may have someone trailing you rule three this is a real scouting mission which means you are not working alone rule four both of you come back or you both lose the game at rule three kero realized what tarma was pulling on them at rule four daren figured it out the glare of outrage he gave her was only matched by the exasperation she dealt him in return she cantlm going to be saddled with this overbearing fool all day long and if i dont keep him from falling on his face im going to lose the game she wanted to tell her teacher exactly what she thought of the idea and only one thing kept her quiet the sure and certain knowledge that tarma was testing her as she had been tested at the crossroads only this time the test was not for courage but for good sense and the ability to take orders such considerations did not hamper daren you cant mean that he said angrily ive had years of training and you expect me to drag this little tagalong and take care of her i expect you to take the orders youre given and follow them young man tarma replied evenly with no display of emotion at all i expect you to keep your mouth shut about it i have my orders from your father you are to treat me as your commanding officer at all times and i have your fathers full permission to do whatever i like with you be grateful this is all ive ordered you to do how do you ever expect to give orders that will be obeyed if you never learn how to follow them yourself daren stared at her with his mouth hanging open for a moment while kero fumed tagalong am i years of training hmm then why cant he even follow a rabbit track a furlong without losing it ive given you your orders tarma said putting one finger under his chin and shutting his mouth for him remember the rules she turned on her heel and went back up the staircase leaving the two of them alone in the stable darens stormy expression did not encourage conversation so kero just shrugged and headed out into the valley daren followed overtaking her in the tunnel so that when they emerged he was in the lead kero hung back deliberately so that he would have to wait for her after all under the rules if he ran off without her hed lose im beginning to see some advantages here she thought as her anger cooled provided i can keep my own temper the clouds were already moving in the sky was gray from horizon to horizon or at least as much of it as kero saw beyond the black interlacing of leafless trees daren waited impatiently for her beside the hidden stable door and pointed at warrls obvious clawmarks in the dust beside the path he went that way the young man said and plunged off into the underbrush leaving a telltale thread from his cloak on the very first thornbush he passed kero would have left it except that she remembered the rules leave no traces and since she was being graded on his moves as well as her own she sighed and picked the russet thread out of the thorns before she passed on she was still sucking a stuck finger when she caught up to him you left this she said sardonically holding it out to him before he could accuse her of lagging he took the thread from her his mouth shutting with a snap and frowned without saying a single word he turned back to studying the ground ignoring her she saw that warrls tracks vanished here as his trail crossed a dry streambed the obvious answer was something any reasonably smart animal would dorun along the streambed for a while then leave it at some point that wouldnt show much disturbance a bed of dry leaves for instance but warrl wasnt an animal kero studied the trail and noticed that the tracks were blurred the claws dug in a bit too deeply he walked backward in his own tracks the beast she thought with admiration i didnt think he could do that instead of following downstream as daren was moving upstream and obviously expected her to take the other direction she traced the tracks back and found where warrl had leapt out of them and intoyesa pile of dry leaves off to the side of the trail there were several old wet leaves on top of the dry ones and a few more scattered against the direction of the last winds showing that the leaves had been disturbed she waited beside the telltale traces until daren came storming back by that time the expected drizzle had been falling for about a candlemark and as she had anticipated his cloak and his leathers were soaked through he was shivering and the leather was probably chafing him raw wherever it touched bare skin and his temper was not improved by his discomfort you were supposed to take downstream he shouted i had to take both you lazy little bitchyoure supposed to be doing something not standing around waiting for me he left the path here she said clenching her hands to keep from hitting him he walked backward in his own tracks and then jumped off the trail into that pile of leaves daren looked at her scornfully im not some green little boy who believes in pelagirtales im a prince of rethwellan and ive been trained by some of the finest hunters in the world you she lost her temper and grabbed the lacings in the front of his leather tunic then dragged him past the pile of leaves surprise making him manageable for the necessary few steps does that look like a pelagirtale little boy she hissed pointing at the very clear pawprint in the mud seems to me youd better start growing up pretty quickly so you know what to believe and what not to believe ive beaten you at this game five times out of six and you know it so dont you think youd better stop playing the high and mighty princeling and start paying attention to somebody who happens to be better at this than you are he pulled out of her grip his face growing red since when does half a year of training give you the right to act like an expert he shouted since that was all she had a chance to say something very dark and very large suddenly loomed up out of the bushes just behind her she never had a chance to see what it was the next thing she knew she was flying through the air and she had barely enough time to curl into a protective ball to hide her head and neck before she impacted with a tree after that all she saw was stars and blackness eight this was the worst headache shed ever had and the most uncomfortable bed it felt like a bush a leafless prickly bush what happened kero tried to move and bit back a moan as every muscle and joint protested movement it felt as if the entire left side of her body was a single ache and her head hurt the same way it had when one of the horses had kicked her and shed gotten concussed well that was tarmas voice you two certainly made a fine mess out of this assignment she opened her eyes wincing against the light tarma stood about twenty paces away just beyond her was daren lying up against another tree as though hed impacted and slid down it fine mist drooled down onto her face droplets condensed and ran into her eyes and down the sides of her face to the back of her neck her mouth was dry and she licked some of the moisture from her lips looks like he got some of the same treatment i did kero decided and shivered even wet her wool clothing would keep her warm but she must have been lying on the cold ground for a while and it had leached most of the heat out of her body youve managed to botch everything i told you to do tarma said coldly arms crossed under her dark brown rain cape her harsh features looked even colder and more forbidding than usual her iceblue eyes flicked from one to the other of them first you dont even bother to set up a plan or agree on who is going to do what then you daren storm off into the game leaving behind a trail a baby could follow so that kero has to spend twice the time she should covering it for you then you kero let daren waste his time in a fruitless search when you knew from the moment you saw warrls tracks that he was chasing a wild hare then you both start arguing at the tops of your lungs an army could have come up on you and youd never have known it until it was too late she glared at both of them and kero didnt even try to move under the dagger of that stare keth was working with me on this she continued pitilessly we decided to make this run dangerous for you to teach you that if you fouled up youd get hurt just like real life you triggered one of her booby traps with your arguing and thats exactly what it caught two boobies two fools who couldnt even follow simple orders to keep their mouths shut well i have a further little assignment for you get home theres just one catch until you cooperate you wont be able to find your way back she smiled nastily and turned on her heel stalking off into the rain in the time between one breath and the next she was gone as if the drizzle itself had decided to step in and hide her kero struggled out of the bush shed flattened in her fall twigs scratched her as she slowly pulled herself up onto her knees then from her knees shakily to her feet her head ached horribly and she guessed that she was one long bruise from neck to knee along her left side the only good luck shed had was that shed fallen into that bush in the first place there had been enough dead leaves and grass between herself and the ground to keep her out of the mud bits of leaves clung all over her making her look as if shed slept in them she brushed herself off as best she could and waited for daren to join her he used the tree trunk to steady himself as he got to his feet he wavered quite a bit getting there and looked as if he felt just as shaky as she did when he saw she was watching him he glared at her and limped off after tarma without taking a single backward glance at her that little bastard she thought indignantly well two can play then she looked around she had been in and out of these woods for the past several months they werent that far from the back door to the tower it was late autumn most of the leaves were off the trees which should have made it easier to see through the woods in spite of the rain she didnt recognize anything now she was totally inexplicably lost and in three breaths daren came storming out of the mist head down limping along like a wounded and angry bull and ran right into her hey she yelled indignantly he caught her as she started to fall then shoved her away what are you doing running into me like that he shouted runyou pig you ran into me she spluttered you werent anywhere in sight he yelled back turning red again you just jumped out of nowhere i did no such but he was gone again as fast as his bruised legs would take him this tune going in the opposite direction to the one hed been traveling when he ran into her thatshe couldnt think of any name that was bad enough to call him that swine that rat unreasonable pigheaded overbearing arrogantshe looked around angrily dashing water and wet hair out of her eyes with the back of her hand that vague shape looming up through the rain beyond and above the treesthat might be the cliff of the tower i think it changed from moment to moment shrinking and growing and sometimes vanishing entirely behind the trees well i have to go somewhere ill bet i make it back no matter what tarma said and ill bet he doesnt all i have to do is head for the tower and watch for where we were or find tarmas tracks she limped off keeping her eyes alert for signs of disturbance that marked their travel she found plenty of little snags of wool a sure indicator that daren had been there and she found traces of his footsteps and of her own but she found nothing identifiable as warrls or tarmas tracks and though she stopped frequently to reconnoiter she saw no landmarks that looked familiar and no sign that the tower cliff was any nearer she might as well have been on the other side of the world she couldnt even tell if she was wandering in circles the forest seemed utterly lifeless the steady dripping of rain on dead leaves hiding any other sounds when she stopped and listened she couldnt even tell where the sun was the sky was a uniform gray everywhere her head throbbed and her stomach knotted with nausea walking was torture but at least it kept her warmer than standing when she stopped to try and hear past the falling rain she was shivering in moments finally for lack of anything better to do she took out her beltknife and began to mark the tree trunks at least this should keep me from going around in circles she thought slogging her way through heaps of soggy leaves shivering with the cold rain that kept trickling down the back of her neck as long as i keep going in a straight line ill come to something i recognize i have to find the place eventually either ill run into the cliff or ill run into the path or ill find the stream if i dont do any of those things ill get to the road i have to cross either the stream the road or the path theres no other way off tower lands or so she thought until she stopped to ease her bruises side aching so much she wanted to cry and rested a while leaning up against a tree trunk and when she felt a little less tired and started to mark the trunk she happened to look at the other side first and saw her own sixarmed star chipped carefully into the bark as tarma had taught her the least amount of damage to the tree that she could manage and still have the mark visible it was still so fresh that the wind hadnt disturbed the fragments of bark still clinging to the tree she looked around in a panic sure she couldnt possibly have touched that tree the place was in no way familiar but the mark was indisputably there she clung to the rough bark suddenly faint and dizzy but this isnt possiblei know id have seen that huge pigshaped rock or the little cave under it and the tree with the hawks nest in the fork and theres no way i could forget that clump of holly its the only green thing ive seen all afternoon nevertheless it was her unique marking in a place shed never seen she closed her eyes the dizziness and nausea increasing she fought them down telling herself not to panic but when she opened her eyes again fear clutched her heart and made it pound painfully in her temples for her sight was darkening too then she realized that it was not her eyesight dimmingthe sun was setting dusk closing in rapidly and she was nowhere nearer to getting home than she had been from the moment tarma left them tarmashe cant mean to leave us out here all nightwere both hurt and we havent eaten all day shell come and get us shell come and get me surelynone of what happened was my fault i followed the rules for one moment she let herself believe that then as she thought about how angry her teacher had been beneath that mask of indifference she knew with a sinking heart that there would be no rescue tonight we arent children one night in the forest isnt going to kill either of us well just wish we were dead and even if i followed the rules i didnt make sure he did when i saw he wasnt going to measure up i should have forfeited the game by turning around and going home she heard a thrashing sound behind her then the noise of someone forcing his way through undergrowth rather than looking for paths she knew what it was before she turned no animal would ever make that much noise and no animal in the forest limped on two legs its a good thing were not really in enemy territorytheyd have heard him a long time ago she moved to the other side of the tree and put her back up against it to watch the dim shape grow more distinct as it neared finally it was close enough to make out clearly she put her knife away and watched daren stumble toward her shivering visibly inside his soggy woolen cloakno longer a handsome russet it was mudstained and snagged in too many places to count and daren looked much the worse for wear he didnt act as if he saw her he didnt act as if he saw anything hey she said wearily as he started to blunder past her he stopped dead in his tracks and blinked as if he was surprised to see her maybe he was the more kero thought about it the more certain she became that her grandmother had a hand in this confusion of what should have been familiar territory hadnt she read in one of tarmas books on warfare about a spell that fogged the enemys mind and made him unable to recognize his surroundings kkkero daren said stuttering from the cold are yyyou still lost tttoo i guess so she replied reluctantly full dark was descending and with it more rain harder and colder both somebody needed to make a decision here and it didnt look as if daren was up to remembering his own name we need to get out of this and we need to find someplace to hole up for the night otherwise were going to wander around until we drop the only place at all close was that enormous rock shed noticed earlier the size of the keep stables and right now that little hollow place under it was the closest thing they were going to get to real shelter look she said grabbing him by the elbow and pointing at the stone outcropping theres just enough room under that rock that we can both squeeze in out of the rain right now even if i knew where i was i wouldnt be able to find my way back in a candlemark you wont be able to find your hand at the end of your arm for a moment it looked as though daren was going to protesthe frowned and started to pull away from her but evidently he was at the end of his resources he gave in as she tugged at him and they both stumbled through the downpour to the shelter of the overhang it was a lot drier in the little cave than she had thought and the cave itself was larger than she had estimated as she crawled on hands and knees into the hollow feeling her way with her left dry sand gritted under her probing dry relatively clean sand there didnt seem to be anything in here but a pile of dry leaves blown into the back no snakes for instanceand mercifully few rocks there was enough room for both of them to get completely out of the weather if they squeezed in tightly enough and the leaves cushioned them from the worst rough edges of the rock wall without being asked daren pulled off his soggy cloak and draped it over both of them shamed a little she squeezed some of the water out of her outer sweater and handed it to himwet wool stretched and he managed to get it on over his tunic her prediction of coming darkness proved true within moments after they took shelter it was impossible to see anything out beyond the mouth of the cave for that matter it was impossible to see anything in the cave at least we dont have to worry about bears or wolves or anything daren said after a long silence both of them had finally stopped shivering even though kero doubted that either of them was really warm she thought with a longing so sharp that it hurt of hot tea and her hot bath and a fire in the fireplace in her room this isnt fair i wouldnt be out here if it wasnt for him playing the fool i wouldnt be bruised and battered if hed had any sense still being surly wasnt going to accomplish anything and if he decided she was insulting him and left in a huff shed freeze together their bodies were keeping the little hollow of their shelter tolerable by herself shed shiver herself to pieces you think were safe because nothing with any sense would be out in this rain kero asked youre probably right unless theres any truth in the stories about waterdemonsand i doubt either of us would be of much interest to a waterdemon not even waterdemons are going to stumble around in this daren replied his voice dull and dispirited dear gods i hurt even my hair hurts i know what you mean kero told him glumly the colder i get the stiffer my bruises get she hesitated a moment then said you know we could have handled this better you mean you he stopped himself i guess youre right we i justi never thought you were serious about all of this and i didnt think there was any way you could keep up with me youre a girl so half of the mercs grandmother hired for the keep are girls kero retorted curtly half of the mercs that put your father on his throne were girls his sister the captain of the sunhawks was a girl id have thought it would have occurred to you by now that being a girl doesnt mean your mind is dead or that you cant handle anything more dangerous than a needle youre going to become a mercenary his voice spiraled up and broke on the high note butwhy because i have to keep myself fed and clothed somehow your highness she said sourly nobodys going to give me anything my father was a common merc himself before he married my mother and grandmothers the only family ive got besides my brother im not going to live out my life on her charity or as the old maiden aunt if i can help it ive seen too many old maiden aunts taking care of every chore the wife finds inconvenient and i really dont have any interest in selling anything other than my sword she thought by his coughing fit followed by an embarrassed silence that shed made him blush finally he cleared his throat and asked just exactly what are you you speak like a noble but you dress like a peasant half the timea male peasant at that thats because dressing like a peasant is a lot smarter than you think in conditions like this hound and hare game she pointed out shifting a little to ease an ache in her hip the grays and browns blend right into the forest and you cant fight in skirts and tight bodices or hunt or ride or do much of anything besides look attractive youd discover if you ever bothered to look closer that a lot of the peasants working in the fields that you think are men and boys are actually women they are evidently this had never occurred to him how in hell are you supposed to swing a scythe with a skirt in the way she asked him youd have your skirt in ribbons as for us we were supposed to be thinking enemy territory right so i was dressed like a peasant hard to see and if anyone did see me they might not think i was anything dangerous and i was warm might i add peasants know how to dress for bad weather and there you are in a bright red cloak in the middle of a dead forest i suspect wed have been tagged for that alone oh he sounded gratifyingly chagrined so you just found out for yourself how well those hunting leathers of yours keep you warm in the rain she persisted you didnt pay any attention to the weather this morning you didnt ask tarma about it either did you ive never once heard you ask what the weather was going to be like when we were going to be out all day its been unseasonably good since you arrived if you want to know the truth you could have told me he replied sullenly why her own repressed anger was warming her better than all her shivering you come in here and take my teachers time away from me you treat me like im too stupid to know that youre insulting me with your superior attitude you act like you expect me to be excited about the socalled privilege of training with you why should i tell you anything why should i share my edge with you you havent done a thing to deserve it he stiffened as she spoke and she waited for the outburst she knew would followed her words it never came why is it that youre here kerowyn he asked slowly all i know is that youre lady kethrys granddaughter i thoughti guess i thought you were just playing at this business of learning from tarma but youre talking about really going out and selling your sword im not talking about it im going to do it she told him firmly her stomach growled reminding her that it had been a long time since shed last eaten i dont have much choice in the matter not unless i want to live on my brothers good will until he decides to find an appropriate husband for me if anyone would take me at this point theres no telling ive certainly scandalized all of diernas family and of course that assumes id sit right down and marry whoever he found for me like a good little girl which i dont think im minded to do and if some of the hints about the baron that grandmothers dropped are true i suspect hed have an interest in keeping me from producing any competition for the keep kethry had never actually accused the baron of anything but kero was perfectly capable of putting facts together for herself including a few that kethry didnt know about the baron had been quite interested in the proposed marriage and had sent a very handsome set of silver as a giftyet had sent no representative to the wedding which argued for the fact that he might well have known that something was going to happen and he was in an excellent position to plan for it to happen she was very glad that tarma had hired all those guards those very competent guards doubtless kethry was keeping a magical eye on the place as well since the promises shed made to rathgar were void with his death i dont know why your brother would have any trouble finding a husband daren began something about the way he said that crystallized the problem that had been going around in her head for weeks she interrupted him what if i dont want him to find me a husband what if im perfectly happy without a husband why should everyone think im supposed to be overjoyed about getting wrapped up in ribbons and handed off to some man ive never even met im not so sure id want to be handed off like a prize mare to anyone i have met but i thought that was what every girl wanted he said with what sounded like honest bewilderment my sisters all do or at least thats all they talk about not tarma she reminded him not grandmother not your aunt idra and not me does every man drool at the idea of going out and hacking people to bits well he admitted no my cousin well nothing she interrupted again every man doesnt want the same thing then why should every woman want the same thing were not cookies you know all cut out of identical dough and baked to an identical brown and sprinkled with sugar so you men can devour us whenever you please she was rather proud of that simile and preened a little in the darkbut the talk of cookies made her hunger all the worse no he replied some of you are crabapples for once her mind was working fast enough at least crabapples dont get devoured she snapped though id eat crabapples right now if i could find them shed have turned her back on him if she could have but there wasnt room in their shelter its not any easier on a man you know he said after a sullen silence broken only by the steady pattering of rain on dead soggy leaves we get presented with some girl our parents have picked out for us we have no idea what shes like and were expected to make her fall deliriously in love with us so that she goes to the altar smiling instead of crying and then were supposed to live up to whatever plans our fathers have for us whether or not we actually fit what they have in mind im just lucky farams the best brother in the world and i dont want the crownhe thinks id make a good lord martial and ive always been pretty good at strategy so im not going to have to do anything i hate and since im the youngest nobodys going to be expecting me to pick out a bride until i want one poor farams got to choose before midsummer and the gods help him if there isnt at least a sign of an heir by winter solstice all this came out in a rush as if hed been holding it in for much too long kero realized as she listened to him that she felt oddly sorry for him maybe too much power and position is as bad as too little so what are they forcing you into she asked quietly there must be something he sighed and winced halfway through as the sigh moved ribs that probably hurt i like the idea of planning things and i like fighting practice he said its like a dance only better because in court dances you spend an awful lot of time not moving much butive neveractually killed anyone i have she said without thinking its not like in the ballads its pretty awful she felt him wince again thats what i was afraid of he confessed im afraid thati wont be able to he swallowed audibly then seemed to realize what shed said youve killed someone he said his voice rising again well the sword did youre that kerowyn he squeaked she couldnt tell from his voice if he was pleased or appalled im what kerowyn she asked i didnt know there were more of me the one the songs about the one that rescued the bride for he faltered for her brotherwith her grandmothers magic sword i guess i must be she said wearily since there cant be too many kerowyns with magic swords around the sword did most of it it was more like it was the fighter and i was the weapon if id known you were that kerowyn he began i wouldnt have you see she said through a clenched jaw why should it have made any difference in the way you treated me deciding that someones serious just because theyve had a bloody song written about them is a pretty poor way to make judgment calls if you ask me grandmother and tarma had plenty of songs written about them and most of them were wrong its justjust that when i heard the songi wished i could meet you he whispered i thought thats a girl that i could talk to she doesnt have any stupid ideas about honor she just knows whats right and then she goes and does something about it well youre talking to me now she replied sourly hunching herself up against the bed of leaves wishing she could find a position that hurt a little less i guess i am another long silence so what was it really like if i hadnt been sweating every drop of water out of me id have wet myself she told him bluntly ive never been so scared in all my life somehow it was easy to tell him everything including things she hadnt told her grandmother the anger shed felt at rathgar for being so stupid as to die and leave them all without protection the same anger at lordan for being unable to take up the rescue himself she didnt cry this time she wasnt even particularly saddened by the losses anymore it might all have happened to someone else a long time ago and not to her at all he told her about his father his brothers quite a bit about faram not so much about thanel she guessed though from what little he did say that thanel was a troublemaker a coward and a sneak the worst possible combination fortunately their father seemed well aware of that kero just hoped hed considered the possibility that thanel might well try to arrange for an accident to befall his older brother daren didnt say anything about that and kero decided that it wasnt her business to bring it up they dozed off sometime during the night for kero it was an uneasy sleep she woke every time he moved and every time one of her bruises twinged and it was hard to sleep when her stomach kept gnawing at her backbone when the sky began to lighten she just stayed awake the moment it was bright enough to see she nudged him he must have been as awake as she was because he pulled the cloak off them without a single word and they both crawled out of their shelter the rock theyd hidden under was no longer pigshaped it was a very familiar castleshaped outcropping that kero had seen a hundred times they were no more than a few furlongs from the tower daren blinked stupidly at the rock undoubtedly he recognized it too but he didnt say anything so far as kero was concerned this only confirmed her suspicion of last night that kethry had cast some kind of glamour over the area that wouldnt lift until they cooperated well they were cooperating now she caught darens eye he nodded they got themselves as straightened up as possible then dragged themselves back to the tower figurative tails between their legs kero wasnt sure what daren was thinkingand saw no reason to try and find outbut she had to admit that theyd pretty much brought this whole mess on themselves and she had a shrewd guess as to what was going to be awaiting them she was right daren preceded her he stopped for a moment behind the outcropping that hid the entrance said something too low for kero to hear then went on in she followed with the relative warmth of the stable closing around her like a cozy blanket tarma stood impassively just inside the stable door leaning against the rock wall as if she had been there all night and was prepared to go on waiting she looked them both up and down face unreadable theres food in your rooms she said get a hot bath and feed yourselves then get your rumps back down here ill be waiting in the practice ring after the bath and the food kero felt a little closer to human today wasnt going to be pleasant but as she climbed stiffly into warmdryclothing she had to admit that shed spent worse and i know damn well that if we dont exercise those bruised muscles were going to stiffen up then tomorrow will be twice as hard she closed the door of her room behind her and ran into daren on the staircase down daren was bewildered she could read it in his faceand resentful she could read that in the way he carried his shoulders stiff and hunched whats the matter she asked he looked over his shoulder at her as if he halfway expected her to ridicule him if i was home he said hesitantly after something like last night id have been well fussed over theyd have sent servants up with my favorite food gotten someone to massage me probably sent me to bed he stopped and she realized her expression had probably betrayed some of her disgust she made herself think about what he was saying and realized that he wasnt to blame for the way other people had treated a prince of the blood look she said trying to sound as reasonable as possible do you think thats what would happen in battle conditions youre going to be in worse shape than that at the end of each day if theres ever a war fought he obviously took the effort to think about what she had just said in his turn and stopped on the staircase i guess youre right he replied there wouldnt even be any hot baths much less all the rest wed probably be sleeping in halfarmor and eating whatever the bugs and rats left us exactly if this had been a foray during a war wed have been lucky to get the food and dry clothes she looked at him in the dim light and shrugged i guessi guess if im supposed to be learning how to command armies maybe id better start getting used to a couple of hardships now and again there was the sound of sardonic applause from below them as the light from the landing was blotted out tarma stood for a moment on the first step still clapping slowly then took the stairs up toward them at a very leisurely pace its about time you finally figured out why youre here young man she said one corner of her mouth turned up in something that was not quite a smile now i have a bit of news for you both your day is only beginning the exercises she set them were harder than anything shed given them before and any resentment or residual anger kero had felt was lost in the general exhaustion daren was in worse shape than she was since his bruises were deeper and more extensive by the time she crawledliterallyup the stairs to her room she was quite ready to fall into her bed and sleep for a week but her day wasnt over yet she was as tired as shed ever been in her life including when the entire keep staff and family had gone out to get the tenants harvest in to save it from a storm given a choice shed have gone straight to bed stopping just long enough to eat something and drink enough wine so that she didnt ache quite so much but she knew she didnt have a choice another hot bath would do more good for her bruises and stiff muscles than all the sleep in the world and unless she wanted to wake up aching a lot more than when shed gone to sleep she was going to have to take the time for another bath shed just eased herself down into that bath when she had a visitor not twolegged this time but four she didnt even realize he was there when he wanted to he could move as silently as a shadow she was lying back in the tub with her eyes closed when he mindspoke her startling her so that she jumped might one ask what exactly you thought you were doing out there yesterday besides playing the fool of course me she spluttered i was the one playing by the rules he by the letter perhaps not the spirit the kyree sat like a great gray wolf just out of range of any stray splashes you knew very well that im not simply some kind of welltrained performing animal why didnt you tell daren that do you think for a moment he would have believed me she asked angrily up until last night he didnt think i had a mind so why should he credit you with one it was your job to convince him warrl said coldly that is what teamwork is about if you have knowledge your fellow does not you are obliged to enlighten him why she retorted it would have wasted time i knew what you were that was enough why because withholding information could get both of you killed what if something incapacitated you what if i as the enemy used the fact that you withheld that information to split the two of you up that was exactly what happened didnt it you let him follow a wild hare and sat down and waited if i had been a real enemy i would have disposed of him then come up behind you and disposed of you but you were too busy feeling superior to worry about that werent you me i the accusation was as unfair as anything else that had happened in the last day she was trapped between anger and tears and the tears themselves were half caused by anger he continued to sit and stare an immovable icon of conscience you finally get in a position where you have the upper hand and you misuse your opportunity you could have found a way to convince him that you knew what you were talking about and you could have done it in such a way that he would have felt surprised and grateful after that he would have been much more attentive to any suggestions you made instead you jeopardized him yourself and the mission all out of pique no i couldnt i she was completely unable to continue she tried and choked up when you become a mercenary whether you work alone or with a company you will often be forced to cooperate with those you dislike you will find yourself working for those who hold you and your skills in contempt if you continue on in your present pattern you will if you are lucky succeed only in getting yourself killed if notyou may bring down hundreds with you wards eyes glowed blue as ice and hard as the finest steel i advise you to think about this he said after a long pause during which she wasnt even able to think coherently he waited again but when she didnt reply he simply rose to his feet so smoothly did he move that not a hair was disturbed he could easily have been a statue brought to life by magic he pierced her with those eyes once more and padded out as silently as he had arrived she pulled the plug on the bath too upset and tense now to relax the water flowed out smoothly with scarcely a gurgle as she climbed out she seized the waiting square of cloth and jerked it from the hook beside the tub then toweled herself dry rubbing hard as if to rub those unkind untrue accusations out of her mind unkind untrue and unfair she stalked out of the bathing chamber and flung herself down on her bed seething im not the one that went pelting up the trail leaving tracks and traces a child could read im not the one that decided he knew what was happening without bothering to consult his partner im not the one that decided to divide the partyhe wanted me to go downstream while he went up she turned over onto her back and stared at the ceiling the more she thought about warrls little lecture the angrier she became what gives him the right to sit in judgment over me anyway what gives an overgrown wolf the right to dictate what i should and shouldnt have done how could he possibly understand he isnt even human she was still simmering when exhaustion finally caught up with her and flung her into sleep daren appeared the next morning at the common room breakfast was a selfserve aifair she sometimes shared with tarma and her grandmother daren sported sunken cheeks and enormous dark circles under his eyes since she didnt have a mirror kerowyn couldnt have said if she looked the same but she was very much afraid that she did it had not been a restful night to say the least well you look like hell kero greeted him over the buffet table handing him a piece of hot bread thank you he replied if youre curious its mutual where in hell does she get all this food i havent seen a single servant since i got here magic i suppose kero replied although you know not that much of it has to be cooked just the bread and the oat porridge everything else could be set beside the bread ovens to warm ive never seen the kitchen it could be just on the other side of that wall i have no idea how theyd vent ovens this deep in the cliffthat would be magic but ive seen stranger things in this place like the bathing chambers hmm she eyed the table the ham and bread would reappear at dinner the fruit and cheese at lunch the hardboiled eggs would keep for quite a while and the oat porridge would be gone at this meal all four of them liked a good big bowl of it laden with sugar and swimming in cream one cook and two helpers could take care of all this and more and still have time for the helpers to double at light cleaning and laundry she said we all clean our own rooms that means the only places a servant would have to clean would be the common rooms daren blinked at her in surprise she dished out her own bowl of porridge loading it down with maple sugar and sweet raisins leaving just enough for him how do you know all that he asked all what household nonsense tarma and her grandmother had evidently just finished they were disappearing together through one of the doors that was always kept locked kero knew what was on the other side of that one thoughher grandmothers magic workroom shed visited it once and had no desire to do so again daren completed his selection and followed her to one of two small tables beside the hearth i thought you said you werent interested in marriage and a family im not i took care of the keep for five years after mother died and for most of two years before that she made a face and cut a careful bite out of her ham slice i hated it but i learned it anyway why do you look like you spent the night tossing because i did he replied rotten dreams she put her knife and fork down you too he nodded then stopped in midchew to stare at her finally he swallowed and asked were you in the middle of some kind of battle in a scout group and you went off looking for something in a party of about six she nodded and you were there and we had an argument about something yes and then he leaned forward thenyou wouldnt listen to me or i wouldnt listen to you i cant remember which but the party split and we both missed something really important because when we got back wed lost half the scouts and we discovered that the enemy had cut around behind us and everyone on our side was dead he sagged back in his chair his eyes closed oh gods i thought it was just a dream it was just a dream a new voice entered the conversation kethrys daren jumped then tried to leap to his feet sit kethry ordered him she was in russet today the color darens cloak used to be but as if to underline what kero had told him earlier she was not wearing a gown she was in breeches and a long tunic if it had been a prophetic dream certain warnings would have been triggered and i would have known if it wasnt prophetic kero asked hesitantly what was it kethry smiled as if she had expected exactly that question a warning she said this placeseems to trigger things like that its happened perhaps a dozen times since we moved here its not showing any possible future so far as ive been able to tellits showing you the general outcome of a negative behavior pattern so what we saw isnt going to happen to us daren asked hopefully no not likely kethry repeated and you wont dream it again unless you continue the pattern but if we do we get the same dream over and over at kethrys nod daren grimaced pretty effective way of getting someone to break the pattern evidently the builders of this tower thought so kethry patted him on the shoulder in a very motherly fashion turned and vanished back through the heavy wooden door leading to her workroom daren sighed and turned back to kero will it help to say that ive been a blockhead and i apologize she considered him with her head tilted to one side for a moment will it help to tell you ive been just as pigheaded as you he smiled its a start good she replied lets build on that then she laughed feeling a burden lifting from her mind besides id do a lot more than just apologize to avoid another two days like the past two but warrl was destined to have the last word although he was nowhere in sight its about time said a sardonic voice in her mind humans if daren wondered why she was choking on her porridge trying not to laugh he was too polite to ask nine kero studied the sandtable the terrain laid out in miniature the tokens that stood for civilians stock fighting men and women bloodless warfare she thought to herself all the fighting reduced to numbers is that how generals see us had it been a year since that quarrel with daren it must have been since it was winter again tarma had gradually begun teaching them other things strategy and supply tactics and organization every daylight hour was spent in some kind of study from their weapons practices to reading the fragmentary accounts of the wars of the ancients even their leisure hours usually had something to do with their studies all right tarma said leaning over the sandtable she indicated the tokens that represented the enemy forces tokens she had just put in place therere the opposing forces what have you got daren he studied his tokens cupped in the palm of his hand and placed them carefully in the sand five companies of foot one of horse one of specialists in country like that the horse is useless he placed a token with a painted horses head on it behind the lines i need another company of foot and two of specialists if im going to hold you off mountain fighters irregulars if i can get them which means you hire kero what have you got for him to hire tarma leaned over the table resting her weight on her hands and watched kerowyn through narrowed eyes she represented the mercenary guild and the freeswords according to the list you gave me he can get what he wants but hes going to have to make some choices she studied the roster and wondered what he was going to pickand what his resources would bear she didnt know what he had to draw on tarma did but while she was playing the enemy she would pretend she didnt know he studied his handful of papers again so what are my options he asked her first theres a full bonded company of foot theyre athire and their base is within three days march of your position youll have to send a messenger across the border though so i hope your relations are good with king warrl over there she grinned at the kyree who was playing all the neutrals in this little game ill think about it warrl replied genially depends on what nice present he sends me kero grinned she knew daren couldnt hear the kyree which made warrls comments all the more amusing daren consulted his list again i can afford to send him a bribe of some fine beefstud stock under pretense of a trade mission thats in my private holdings and wont make me raise taxes warrl laid his ears back and looked hurt bribes how crude i dont know well i suppose i must crude or not he stood on his hindlegs put his forepaws on the edge of the table and nudged the little flag that signified clear passage thanks your majesty daren studied his sheaf of papers with a frown on his face all right i can pay for the foot company with surplus in the treasury so what about these irregular fighters thats where you get the choice she told him you can either hire two more bonded companies you can hire one bonded company and one freelance or you hire the freelance company and set up recruiting posts and hire enough freelancers to put another temporary company together the bonded company will work with the freelance company but not with a puttogether force theres more than enough of the individual freelancers in your area freelancers would be cheaper about half the cost of companies the same size she looked up at him thats the first time i recall tarma giving us that option shes always had bonded companies in the game no freelancers quite true tarma replied nodding youve gotten used to those options time to spice up the game with a little more reality by the time you need them daren bonded companies will usually have been hired by someone else daren pursed his lips hmm the treasury is getting mighty lean tarma whats the difference between freelancers and a bonded company freelancers are just that individual hireswords some of them may have bought into a company some may be totally on their own theyre cheaper because they havent posted bond with the mercenary guild she stood up and kero noticed her flinching a little her joints must be hurting again i keep forgetting how old she is were going to have to start working out against each other more now that the weathers turned cold save our teacher for the things only she can teach us thank you warrl said softly into her mind kero did you say some of those freelancers were a company or am i dealing entirely with individuals daren asked i dont want to hire individuals it would take too much time to get them coordinated and id have to detail one of my own officers to command them according to these notes i dont have that kind of time and i dont think i have an officer to spare and besides i know i remember you saying that the bonded company wont work with something just thrown together kero looked at the list again one company the rest on their own daren winced well ill be hiring one bonded company anyway now whats the difference between a freelance company and a bonded company tarma licked her lips its easier to tell you what freelancers arent a bonded company has posted a pretty hefty bond with the mercenary guild on top of the individual dues each hireswords paid into the guild what that means is that they have to follow the guild mercenary code if they violate that code the guild pays the injured party damages then takes it out of the bond then they take it out of the offending partys hide and they are not gentle let me tell you and if you violate your contract the guild will fine you and you wont be able to hire bonded fighters for at least a year maybe more depending on the severity of the offense whats this code anyway kero asked youve never mentioned that before youve talked about the guild code of conduct for individuals but not a company code its pretty simple whatever is in the terms of the contract is followed by both parties to the letter bonded companies do not pillage in the countryside of their employer and pillage only in enemy territory with permission of the employer that takes care of cutting your own throat in a civil war tarma looked at both of them can you figure out why kero was marginally quicker easy if you keep everybody on your side from looting the locals are going to come over to you and thats going to make big problems for the opposition if they arent doing the same good and really whats the point of wrecking your own tax base all right if a bonded company or one of its members surrenders they are permitted to leave the battlefield unmolested and report to a neutral point theyll get ransomed by the guild thats why the individual members pay their dues every year you know about the individual code so i wont go into that tarma leaned against the sandtable they wont switch sides in midcontract they wont follow a mutiny against their employer they wont fight a suicidecause but theyll do their damnedest to get their employer out of a bad situation in one piece because of the twin codes bonded companies are more reliable and trustworthy than unbonded thats why theyre expensive daren examined the table again ive got a bad situation here i think maybe id better take out a loan or go find a buyer for some crown properties and go the distance for two bonded companies what would you do if i set up the situation like this tarma moved two of her counters away and placed them farther along the border daren studied the table again hire one bonded and one freelance and see if i couldnt negotiate with my neutral neighbor to take a stand those two companies are threatening his territory too good what about this she pulled the counters oif the table entirely the bonded foot and the freelance guerrillas then id arrange things this way he set up his counters against hers accepting the two mercenary counters from kerowyn and id put the freelancers right here theyre not going to pillage my countryside because thats all rocky hillside once i move the sheepherders out theres nothing there to pillage which means every profitable move for them to make will be against the enemy and not against me he moved around the table and looked at the situation from tarmas angle whats more they cant mutiny theyre on the end of the supply line and all i have to do is cut them off i think theyre relatively safe to trust there tarma studied his setup and smiled slowly excellent lets play this and see how it runs kero the first move is yours kero had the most interesting time of it according to tarmas profile sheets the freelance guerrillas were a newlyformed company and fairly unreliable but the bonded foot were an old established company with a nice subgroup of scouts that made up for the deficiencies of the freelancers and daren had set up a situation in which the very worst that could happen would be the freelancers deserting with a howling wilderness between them and civilization they were kero judged less inclined to do that they played the game out over the course of two hours and in the end darens side won during that time hed even found the bribe that would bring warrl in on his side so the victory cost him less than hed feared good all the way around tarma applauded im proud of you both daren did you see why keros companies did what they did pretty much though i was kind of surprised at the versatility of the foot he smiled over at kero who returned it feeling warmed by it thats one thing youll often find in a good bonded company theyve trained together with many weapons and they have their own support groups tarma yawned even the best companies have gotten shafted now and again the guild imposes fines but thats after the damage has been done thats why they like to have everything they need under their own control well those two extra hedgewizards may have saved the day daren yawned too and kero fought to keep herself from echoing it it had been a long day but a good one this victory against tarma on the sandtable had been the dessert to the meal they didnt often win against her im off to bed children the shinain said blowing out the extra lanterns leaving only the four set onto the corners of the table for light savor your victory ill get you tomorrow no doubt kero laughed so far youve beaten us five games out of seven keeps you on your toes the shinain retorted on her way out the door warrl grinned at them and padded after her kero collected the tokens while daren smoothed out the sand in the table good game he said handing her a token that had gotten halfburied in the sand you know its a lot more fun being your friend than your enemy in the game or in general she teased both he put his arm around her shoulders and hugged her she returned the hugbut there was a different feeling about the way he held onto her tonight keeping her close a breath or two longer than he usually did sliding his hands down her arms before letting her go tired he asked something in his voice telling her than he hoped shed say no not really she put the flags and tokens away in a drawer under the table and looked up at him expectantly she wasnt tired eithernot with him looking at her the way he was feel like talking a while she asked hopefully her muscles tensing a little with anticipation was she reading more into his words than was really there if you dont mind it wasnt her imagination there was an odd light in his eyes an appreciative glint shed been seeing quite a bit lately your room or mine yours she said its cleaner she laughed but the way he kept watching her was sending an oddly exciting chill up her spine she stretched and came close to giggling at the way his eyes widened she blew out the rest of the lanterns and headed for the door only marginally he repliedbut instead of letting her precede him he caught her hand in his as she walked past him she stopped for a moment then gave his hand a squeeze he returned it and caressed her palm with his thumb as she tugged at his hand and got him moving out the door she shielded her mind with studious care right now she couldnt afford any leakage she knew what was going on shed begun to hope he found her attractive several moons ago and it was a distinct thrill to see him responding though she truly wasnt trying to flirt even if she hadnt figured it out tarma had taken care to let her know a couple of days ago youre young attractive and here shed said bluntly hes young attractive and not very sure of himselfthough i doubt hes a virgin youre a friend so you arent threatening if you want to go to bed with him go right ahead but make sure youre protected shed been relievedbut disappointed is that all it is justavailability tarma had shaken her head child even if it was love everlastingwhich we both know it isnthes a prince of the blood and youre going to be a common mercenary he cant afford to marry you and you shouldnt be content with anything less your potential is enormous or that damned sword of keths wouldnt have spoken for you you have no right to fritter your life away as prince darens mistress you have things to doso enjoy yourself now but know that when its over youre going to go out and do them but with darens hand holding hers possessively and then darens arm around her shoulders as they climbed the stairs together it was difficult to keep tarmas advice in mind there was another side to it all as wella kind of relief im all right im not shechorne or anything im not so different from the other girls after all daren wants me and i want him that was not such a bad feeling being wanted he liked her as a friend and wanted her as a woman a good combination if she could keep it from getting serious shed followed part of tarmas advice she was protected that much lenore had taught her the moonflower powder all the time to control moondays as well as preventing pregnancy or childbane afterwardthough moonflower was better for you easier on the body they reached the top of the stairs and kero was glad that there werent any servants there was no chance that theyd be interrupted or gawked at knowingly she had the feeling anything like that would put daren off entirely she felt overheated flushed and excited and with odd little feelings in the pit of her stomach and groin daren had to let go of her to get his door open and that seemed to make him shy again he followed her inside without touching her and made a great fuss of clearing off a chair for her to sit in he carefully avoided looking at the bed and she followed his example pummeling her brain for some way to make him feel comfortable again if it had been warmer she would have suggested they go out on his balconyhis room had one hers didnt but it was freezing out there literally the ice on the ponds would be thick enough to skate safely on come morning cold hands and feet were not conducive to romance and the temperature out on the balcony was likely to chill the hottest lust her throat tightened and she flushed for no reason suddenly she was afraid though of what she couldnt have said to cover the fact she ignored the chair and sprawled out on the sheepskin rug in front of the hearth half reclinging against a cushion talk say anything if you could be anything in the world she said staring at the flames as he sat down hesitantly beside her what would it be anything at allanything you wanted king minstrel beggar whatever he thought about it she took a sidelong glance at him and saw that his face was set in a frown of concentration you know i think id be a merchant id get to travel anywhere see everything i ever wanted to id be a rich merchant though he added hastily so i could travel comfortably she chuckled like one of tarmas proverbs what good is seeing the wonders of the world when youre too saddle sore to enjoy them he laughed and relaxed a little letting his hand rest ohsocasually on hers what about you being a rich merchant would be nice she agreed but id rather be the kind of person that travels just because she wants to not tied to a caravan or a trading schedule ah he said nodding wisely a spoiled dabbler a what she said sitting up straight pulling her hand away a dilettante he teased a brat a he didnt have any chance to go on because she hit him with a pillow that attack engendered a wrestling match which he heavier and stronger was bound to winunless she resorted to tactics which would have ended any further plans for the evening but it was a great deal of fun while it lastedthe more so because she discovered his one weakness and turned the contest into something much more even he was ticklish very ticklish especially down both sides and on the bottoms of his feet she managed to get his shoes off while tickling his sides protecting one meant that the other weak point was vulnerable and the moment he curled up into a ball she grabbed his feet and ran her nails along the soles when he thrashed helplessly and got his feet away from her his sides were exposed before long shed turned the tables on him she tickled him unmercifully until they were both laughing so hard their sides ached finally neither one of them could breathe and they tumbled together on the rug completely unable to move you he panted cheat no suchthing she replied trying to brush her hair out of her eyes with one hand while she held onto his bare foot with the other justobeyingmy teacher exploiting the enemys weakness he was getting his breath back faster than she was and he managed to eel around so that her head was in his lap but keroim not your enemy arent you she began when he stopped all further conversation with a kiss it was in no way a chaste or innocent kiss it picked up where the last of their tentative explorations had left off and carried them to the logical conclusion kero let go of his foot and groped for the laces of his tunic his hands slid under her shirt and cupped her breasts with a gentleness that vaguely surprised her stroking them with his callused thumbs the tuniclacings foiled her hands which seemed to have lost all dexterity she broke off the kiss and cursed the things he laughed and got out of the tunic without bothering to unlace it tossing it off somewhere into the dark the loose shirt a copy of her own was easy enough to slide her hands underwhich she did holding him closer to her feeling her blood heat at the play of muscles under his skin beast she said and went back to the kiss he sank slowly to the floor taking her with him his hands moving against her skin under her shirt she pushed his shirt up out of the way the better to touch him he rolled over to one side to give her hands more room to roam this time he broke free with a yelp as his bare back came into contact with the stone floor i hate cold floors he said ruefully as she giggled at his woebegone expression then he scrambled to his feet and pointed off into the dark she couldnt see his face from that angle and she couldnt see past the light cast by the fire so she jumped to her feet only to find herself scooped up and launched across the room to land in his bed a moment later he was beside her oh my she said where do you suppose this came from he didnt even bother to answer and in a moment she didnt really want him to shirts and breeches were everywhere being tossed out of bed or shoved to one side somehow she managed to get out of her clothing without tearing anything he wasnt so lucky he couldnt get the wristlacings on his shirt to untie and with a muttered oath he snapped them his hands and mouth were everywhere well so were hers every touch seemed to send a tingle all over her seemed to make her want more they explored each other a little awkwardly sometimes she hit him in the nose with her elbow once and he knocked her head against the footboard kero hardly felt it when she collided with the carved wood every inch of skin felt afire and she was propelled by such urgent need that she could have pursued him over the side of a cliff and never noticed it hurt when he took heror she took him whichever she wanted him as much as he wanted her but it didnt hurt that much and he was as gentle as his own need would let him be and she began to feel something else something she yearned after as shamelessly as a bitch in heat just out of reach it was all over too soon though and she was left feeling as if something had been left undone unsatisfied and still hungry somehow sated he just rolled happily over into the tumbled blankets and went right to sleep she could have killed him twice she curled up on her side stared into the dark and listened to him breathe and wondered what did i do wrong later she figured out she hadnt done anything wrong practice as with anything else made both of them more proficient better able to please each other eventually the outcome equaled the anticipation and neither went to sleep unsatisfied she finally understood what all the fuss was aboutand the obsession she understoodbut she felt herself somehow apart from it her desire was satisfied but whatever it was that awakened real passion in others had not touched her and nothing ever quite made up for the letdown of that first night and he never understood or even noticed winter became spring then seemed to run straight into autumn without pausing for summer there were never enough hours in the day for everything kero often wondered what possessed her to have consented to this she often wondered if she were doing the right thing she had no doubt that a conventional life would be far far easier and i wouldnt have to rise with the sun unless i really wanted to the wooden practice blades were nowhere in sight which was a little odd kero exchanged puzzled glances with daren then looked away before the glance could develop into anything more intimate i dont know how much longer i can keep this as just friends she thought staring at the sandy floor of the practice ring grandmother was worried about me getting my heart broken but it seems as though its going to be the other way around i really like darenbut but blessed agnira im a coldhearted bitch i ought to be on my knees with thanks that hes in love with me or thinks he is instead all i can think of is how can i pry him loose on the other hand tarma was right there is no way i would ever be allowed to marry him not that id want to tarmas entrance broke into her ruminations and she looked up gratefully at her teacher all this thinking is making my head hurt daren who had been reaching for her arm stiffened and pulled away a little and kero breathed a sigh of relief tarmas eyes flicked toward daren though she gave no other sign that shed noticed him moving i think youre ready now for something a little more serious the shinain said gravely its about time you both got used to handling the weapons youre going to fight with not that youre going to practice all the time with them she added holding up a long hand to forestall any questions but youre going to be working out at least a candlemark every day with them i can approximate the weight and balance of your real weapons with your practice swords but i cant duplicate itand your bodies will know the difference she handed daren a longsword twoedged but with a point as well the blade was magnificent and the jewel in the hilt a ruby so dark as to be nearly black was worth kero and all of her family combined for her part she took up need with a certain amount of trepidation although she felt a kind of tingle when she first set hand to hilt the sword showed no other signs of life which suited her very well over the course of that single night shed had her fill of being the tool instead of the wielder tarma she said hesitantly is this a good idea i mean i thought i was supposed to be learning swordsmanship but if im going to use need tarma chuckled dont worry about it first off youll be bouting aginst me not daren and she wont let you harm a woman secondly she works in peculiar ways now that youve established your talents as a swordswoman shell never help you fight again ah but magic now thats where shell protect you so far as i know there isnt a magicker in the world can harm you while you hold her so thats how it works she murmured without thinking exactly thats why she did both for you when you went after lordans bride you were neither fish nor fowl yet tarma grinned now since shes no more than a very good blade in your handsdefend yourself girl blessed agnira its been a long day kero hung her sword in its rack pulled her armor off and draped it over its stand and stretched tarma was right about having to get used to needs weight and balance theres a distinct difference between her and that practice blade she stretched again reaching for the ceiling feeling shoulders pop that hot bath is going to feel so she started for the bathing chamberand realized she was still holding her sword thats odd she frowned i could have sworn i hung her up she turned back toward the wall rack and tried to place the sword in its cradle tried she couldnt make her hands let go oh no you dont she muttered youve done that to me once no more she put the sword in the rack and concentrated on freeing her left hand one finger at a time let go of me she stared at her hand as if it didnt belong to her concentrating until she had a headache a sharp pain right between her eyebrows one by one she loosened her fingers one by one she pried them off the scabbard as she released the last of them she felt something in the back of her mind stretch and snap she pulled her right hand away quickly before the sword could take control of her again ill thank you to keep your notions to yourself she told it frostily ignoring the incongruity of talking to an inanimate object then she turned and walked deliberately back to the bathing chamber she heard something as she heard thoughts faint and at the very edge of her abilities to sense it it sounded like someone grumbling in her sleep disturbed but not awakened she ignored it and drew her bath whatever it was it went away while she was undressing and by the time she slid into the hot water she wondered if shed only imagined it but as she lay back relaxing she began to feel a kind of pull on her mind as if something had hold of her and was trying to tug her in a particular direciton since the direction was her bedroom she had no doubt who that someone was she ignored it and it grew more persistent then painful like a headache in the back of her skull stop that she thought sharply sitting up in the bath the pain eased off but the tugging was still there she sat back and thought for a few moments then she put up her very best shields the shields even warrl had not been able to break through the tugging stopped she waited for several moments but whatever the sword was doing did not seem to be able to penetrate the shielding you ruled my grandmother sword youre not going to rule me she closed her eyes leaned back again and let the bath relax all her muscles for her finally the water cooled and she felt relaxed enough to sleep she opened her eyes and stared at the wall thinking i cant keep shields like this up forever if im lucky i wont have to if im not though this is going to be an interesting little power struggle she lowered her shields slowly waiting for the sword to resume its insistent nagging you may be older with all manner of magic behind you she thought at it but ill bet im a lot more stubborn than you are nothing its a good thing daren was too tired after practice to be interested in bed games tonight she waited for a moment then left the shields down and climbed out of her bath this is too easy its not going to let me off this easily she dried herself and went back into her room to lie down on the bed if i were need what would i do a straighton attempt didnt work anytime she starts on me again i can bring my shields up and block her out so the next logical move would be to try something subtle it occurred to her as she pulled the covers up a bit tighter around her ears that it was possible she had inadvertently weakened the swords hold on her by not using it during the first few moons shed owned it those books of grandmothersthey had something about soulbonding in them i think i still have them in fact she sighed the bed was so warmand the room was already getting chilly and she was so awfully tired stilli need the information more than i need the sleep she gritted her teeth and flung back the covers resolutely flinching as she swung her legs over and put her feet on the cold floor at least the tower was heated a lot better than the keep there this deeply into winter she could put a mug of water down beside her bed and it would be frozen all the way to the bottom by morning she wrapped herself up in a robe groped for the candle on the table beside the bed and took it to the fireplace she scraped away enough of the ash to expose a coal and lit her candle at it the books were right where she thought shed left them pushed into the corner of the bookcase next to her desk ignored in favor of the volumes on the history of warfare and strategy and tactics that tarma had given her to read shed been working her way through them with the interest and enthusiasm she hadnt been able to muster for the books of poetry and history her tutors had assigned her i think it was the red one she decided studying them as she tried to recall which one held the information she wanted butoh never mind therere only three of them if there was one thing that studying under tarma had taught her it was never to discard a book you never knew when something in iteven in so innocuous a volume as a book of poetrycould prove useful she pulled them out and scurried back to bed with them putting the candleholder beside the bed and pulling the blankets up over her legs she began leafing through the first book looking for the section on enchanted objects and soulbonding it was where she remembered it and she read it carefully this time paying special attention to anything that might apply to need finally she closed the book put all three of them on the table and blew out the candle she turned over onto her side and watched the embers glowing in the hearth while she thought about what she had read it seemed that by her determination to learn swordwork on her own she had inadvertently weakened the blades hold on her according to several sources quoted in that book the first few moons were the critical ones in a soulbonding close physical proximity was required after the inital contact as well as frequent use of the object in question so by hanging her on the wall and not touching her i kept her from getting the hold on me that she had on my grandmother and probably everyone else that had her over the past howevermany years so the soulbond had been set in but lightly had kero been a magicuser this could have been an unfortunate situation it might even have been a disaster depending on how much the magicuser in question was likely to depend on the swords ability to take over and provide fighting expertise it was probably just as well that kethry had been deeply soulbonded to the thing given some of the stories kero had heard from her and from tarma but to protect kero from magic it simply needed to be in physical proxmity to her which meant it probably didnt need to be bonded to her at all except that it wants to know just who its fighting for and it probably needs to have some kind of bond to make sure it can protect the bearer at all levels but its got a light bond so to protect me now its got everything it has to have it probably wasnt going to like that though given what kethry told her about the way the sword had behaved in the past ill bet its going to fight me trying to get what it wants im not going to give in now i wondershould i give this thing up if i can kethry had never said anything about the sword deciding to switch owners before the present owner was ready to lose it it could happen all it would have to do would be to decide that it doesnt want to protect me right at the moment some sorcerer has me targeted well that was true enoughexcept that would also be violating the blades own purpose given that its refused to work against some fairly nasty characters simply because they were female i dont think its likely to drop me in the middle of danger that still didnt answer the question of whether or not she wanted to be rid of the thing i dont think so its too valuable andi dont mind paying for that value with a little altruistic work now and again truth to tell its something id probably do on my own anyway the sword is just going to tell me when it needs to be done and who needs help it was getting harder and harder to keep her eyes open especially since there didnt seem to be a good reason to stay awake any longer but as she drifted away into sleep she couldnt help but wonder just how much of a fight the sword was going to give her and who was going to come out the victor the next four weeks were a constant reminder that a potent shinain curse was may your life be interesting the moment she fell asleep at night she dreamed vivid colorful dreams of women in peril in which she rode up and put their peril to rout dreams of a life on the move in which all innkeepers were friendly all companions amusing all weather perfectin short a life right out of the ballads finally on warrls advice she took the sword down off the wall and unsheathed it with it held in both her hands she thought directly at it unshielded im not thirteen and youre not going to gull me with herotales she told it firmly save them for minstrels and little children was it her imagination or did she hear a sigh of disappointment as she hung the blade back up on the wall in any event the dreams ended only to be replaced by darkly realistic ones night after night she was witness to all the evil that could be inflicted on women by men abuse and misuse emotional and physical rape murder torture evil working in subtler fashion marriages that proved to be no more than legalized slavery and the careful manipulation of a bright and sensitive mind until its owner truly believed with all her heart in her own worthlessness betrayal not once but many times over all the hurts that could be inflicted when one person loved someone who in turn loved no one but himself this was hardly restful and during the day any time she was not completely shielded the sword manipulated her emotional state making her restless inflaming her with the desire to be out and on the move but she wasnt ready and she knew it even if the blade didnt every day meant fighting the same battleor rather mental wrestling matchover and over the sword saying go and kero replying no and to add the proper final touch daren was alltooobviously becoming more and more infatuated with her and infatuation was all that it was kero was pretty certain of that she had a long talk with her grandmother about the differences between love and lesser emotions and to her mind daren did not evidence anything other than a blind groping after someone he thought was the answer to all his emotional needs or as tarma put it much more bluntly hes barely weaned and youre a mature doe in you he gets both mate and mama i hate to put it that way child but emotionally youre years ahead of him young daren isnt in love with you little hawk hes in love with love kero hadnt said anything but shed privately felt tarma had wrapped the entire situation up in one neat package daren would make someone a very good husbandwhen he grew up she was fairly certain that when he did so it would happen all at oncebut hed have to be forced into the situation meanwhile he wasnt going to not with someone like her around he was making some hints that had her rather disturbed hints she hadnt confided to anyone hints that he would be willing be actually marry her if that was the only way he could keep her as if he thought she could be kept that was keeping her awake at night as much as the dreams were then one night he did more than hint he told her that he would talk to his father about ennobling her if shed just come with him to the court and there was only one reason for him to make that offer that she knew of he was serious about her and she didnt love him she liked him well enough but her answer to the question could you live without him was most decidedly yes if he left tomorrow and she never saw him again she would miss him but shed go right back to her swordpractice without a second thought and her sleep would hardly be plagued by dreams and longing she got up early the next morning after a particularly bad night to pace the cold floor and try to get herself sorted out it was at least a candlemark till dawn but she just couldnt lie there in bed anymore she lit the candle and got dressed in the chill premorning air and began walking the length of her room pacing it out as carefully as if she was measuring it i like daren she thought rubbing her arms to warm them hes clever hes intelligent hes flexiblehes not bad in bed either he wouldnt ever hurt me deliberately but the sword had filled her few sleeping hours with some fairly horrific scenes and if she married daren there was no way she could do anything about problems like the ones the sword was showing her the princes wife just cant go riding off whenever the mood takes her in fact i doubt very much that the princes wife would be able to enjoy half the freedom kerowyn does thats really what it came down to privilege or freedom the relief of being like every other girl or the excitement of being like no one else of setting her own standards power and wealth or the ability to now and again right a wrong if she married daren she would never again be able to totally be herself if she didnt shed spend the rest of her life keeping her head above water and wondering if the next sword thrust the next arrow was deaths messenger security or liberty it was enough to give anyone a headache and she had an incredible one when in the pearlygray moment of predawn someone tapped lightly on her door she nearly tripped over her own feet in her haste to answer it she was expecting tarma but it was daren he was white and shaking and from the tear streaks on his face and his reddened eyes hed been crying he tried to compose himself his upper lip still quivering as he tried to breathe more calmly kero stood frozen with her hand still on the door latch she couldnt even begin to imagine why daren would look this way surely he hadnt been upsetting himself that much over her had he but his next words told her everything she needed to know kero he said hoarsely as tears began to trickle down his face once again kero itsmy fathers dead ten for one long moment she couldnt seem to do anything but stand there stupidly staring at him then his shoulders began to shake with silent sobs and she reacted automatically pulling him inside taking him over to the bed and getting him to sit down on the side of it what happened she asked bewildered last shed heard the king was in excellent health and prince thanel had been safely married off to the queen of valdemar dear heavens that was over a year ago closer to two daren expected to be called home then but it didnt happen and that was when he started making hints about getting me ennobled have we been here that long she tallied up the seasons in her mind and realized with a bit of shock that she had been tarmas pupil for over three years she glanced reflexively at the mirror built into the wardrobe and the kerowyn that looked back at her hard lean eyes wide with surprise was nothing like the illtrained girl that had arrived here never mind that right now i have to get some sense out of daren she held daren against her shoulder and let him cry himself out that was the best thing she could do for him right now as the pink light of dawn filled the room he got a little better control over himself and groped after a handkerchief as usual hed forgotten one shed never been quite so conscious before of the fact that he was younger than she by at least a year at this moment he felt more like her brother than her lover ththanel he stammered at last it was all thanel hes dead a week or so ago he tried to murder his wife he what but his wifehe tried to assassinate the queen of valdemar she exclaimed dearest godsbut what does that have to do with your father when they told father hei dont know something happened maybe his heart gggave out on him theres a branch of kethrys mageschool not far from the capital they sent word there and one of the mages sent word to kethry and she wwwoke me he choked up again and couldnt get anything more past his tears she patted his back absently one part of her intent on comforting him as best she could but the rest of her mind putting together all the possible ramifications valdemar isnt particularly warlike and they just finished that mess with the tedrel companies tedrel companies indeed trust karse to find an entire nation of lowlife scum and hire them on as freelancers then complain when valdemar routs them and they turn back on karse to loot their way home serves them rightshe gave herself a mental shake and got back on the right trail but that was just before daren came valdemar took some pretty severe losses and they cant possibly have recovered enough to declare war right sothanel tries to take out his wife i assume so that he can take the throne he must have failed i need to know who caught him and what they did with him the king gets the news and promptly collapses then dies which puts thanels brother on the throne no love lost there which means he could possibly placate valdemar damn i need to know how thanel tried and whether or not he had any help either from here or from inside valdemar itself she tried to calm daren down a little but he was incoherent she hadnt realized he cared that much for his father so she just held him close rocking him back and forth a little it felt like the right thing to do and it seemed to soothe him as well he didnt utter a sound after she stopped asking him questions and that made her heart ache all the more for him those silent sobs bespoke more emotional pain than she had ever felt in her life finally he stopped trembling the storm of voiceless weeping that shook him went the way of all storms she continued to hold him until she felt a little resistance as if he wanted to pull away from her then she let him go and he slowly raised his head from her shoulder sun streamed in keros window ironically it was going to be a beautiful day but all prospect of enjoying it had just flown with the migrating birds daren winced away from the light his eyes darkcircled swollen and red his face still white as the snow outside i think you should get some rest kero said quietly i know you dont think youll be able to sleep but you should at least go lie down for a while he bristled a little which she took as a good sign at least he wasnt going to fall over helplessly and let her take charge of his life really if you dont at least go put a cold cloth on your eyes you arent going to be able to see out of them she insisted finally he nodded and stood up youll come get me if you hear anything wont you he seemed to be taking it for granted that she would be with her grandmother and tarma that was as good an idea as any i will she promised and got up to lead him out the door they parted company at his door and she raced down the hall to the stairs then took the stairway down as fast as she could without killing herself the common room was empty but there was light coming from under the door leading to kethrys working rooms kero hesitated a moment torn by the need to find out more information and her reluctance to pass that doorway finally curiosity won out and she tried the latch the door swung open at a touch and kero pushed it aside at the far end of the room kethry was seated at a small marbletopped table bent over a large black bowl and tarma sat beside her face utterly impassive there was a light source inside the bowl itself kethrys face was illuminated softly from below her unbound silver hair forming a soft cloud about her head kero coughed delicately kethry ignored her but tarma looked up and motioned to her to join them she picked her way gingerly across the cluttered room she was never entirely sure how much of the clutter was of magical use and how much was simply junk relegated here to be stored that huge draped mirror for instanceor the suit of armor that couldnt possibly have fit anything human or even alive since the helm was welded to the shoulders and the faceplate welded shut besides mostly she tried not to look at much of anything there were some stuffed animalsshe thought they were animalson shelves along the walls shapes that didnt bear too close an inspection if one wanted pleasant dreams as she neared the two women she saw that there was movement down in the bottom of that bowl the light eddied and changed casting odd little shadows across kethrys face when she finally reached them she saw with a start of astonishment that there was a tiny man looking up at kethry from the bowl gesturing from time to time and making the light change behind the man was a kind of glowing rosecolored mist and the light appeared to be coming from that soft and lambent haze its only an image tarma said softly as kero found a stool and placed it beside her its keths son your uncle jendar so according to the herald the prince had been part of this conspiracy for some time one of the other heralds their weaponsmaster somehow got wind of the assassination attempt and when selenay rode out for her exercise he took a group of young warriors with him and followed her at a discreet distance so when the conspirators ambushed her they got something of a surprisefirst of all none of them expected selenay to be much of a fighter second they didnt expect the rescue party thanel was fatally injured during the fight he died a couple of candlemarks later thats just as well kethry replied her posture relaxing just a bit is there any sign that thanel might have gotten any help from rethwellan none that anyone there has come up with and no one at court seems very inclined to look for it here the bearded figure cocked his head to one side a gesture that made him look very like his mother mother do you want me to look into it no not really she replied id just as soon leave that to valdemar at this point it isnt a threat to rethwellan or the royal family and i hope youll forgive me for being insular but thats really all i care about jendar shook his head if you insist i will have to admit that id just as soon not deal too closely with the heralds theyre wellintentioned and really good people on the whole but theyre too intense for my taste too much like you when that sword wanted you to do something and the one time i was in valdemar was enough for me she replied im glad i was just barely across the border have you ever been there he shivered once like you just barely across the border i kept feeling eyes on the back of my neck but when id try to find out what was watching me i could never find anything i got the feeling that whatever it was it was very unfriendly and i had no intention of staying around to find out what it was and why it felt that way it gets worse if you work any magic she replied soberly quite a bit worse by the way this is your niece kero the tiny man peered up at kero out of the depths of the bowl looks like she takes after the shinain side he said with what kero assumed was a smile of approval kero if you are ever in great harsey look us up the school is just above the town on the only hill within miles were not hard to find therere only about forty of us here but the town itself doesnt number above two hundred she swallowed with some difficulty uhthank you iuhill be sure to do that the man laughed merrily and kero saw then that he had his mothers emeraldgreen eyes just like every other fighter ive ever metshow her magic and she curls up and wilts yes and what do you do when someone has a sword point at your throat kethry retorted with a hint of tired good humor i do my best to make sure im never in that particular situation mother dear he replied so far that strategy has worked quite well kero child if magic bothers you i suggest you try valdemar they seem to have some kind of prohibition against it up there in fact he continued thoughtfully i seem to have one demon of a time even mentioning magic to them dont know why it might be interesting to see what happens to mothers nag of a sword north of the border thats an experiment id rather not see tried kethry told him is that all you have for us thats all for now jendar said dropping back into a serious mode ill contact you the usual way if anything more comes up i know theyll want the young man here as soon as possible get him on the road tomorrow if you can you might tell him if he seems interested that his brother is definitely assigning him to the retinue of the lord martial with a view to making him lord martial in a few years id guess three years at the most the poor old warhorse is on his last legs and losing jad has done something to him he was looking particularly tottery this morning tarma i hope the young man is up to the challenge hes up to it she said firmly i wouldnt turn him loose if he wasnt remember i held him back when thanel went north because he wasnt ready good enough ill let the word leak into the council take care mother the man bowed once and the light in the bowl winked out kethry raised her head slowly as if it felt very heavy thank the windlady im an adept she said feelingly the pool of imaging took it out of me when i was young i hate to think what id be feeling like these days whatoh right adepts can pull on energy outside themselves to work magic kero remembered learning the capabilities of the various levels of mages was something both kethry and tarma had insisted she and daren learn knowing what your enemys mages can and cant do may help you win a fight with a minimum of shed blood tarma had stressed daren that blood should be as precious to you as your own if only because each fighter lost is a subject lostkero youre talking about the fighters to whom you are obligated in every way and they in turn are your livelihood so a fighter lost may well represent next years income lost sounds cold i know but you have to keep all of that in mind what was that kero asked carefully its a spell only masters and adepts can use kethry said pulling her hair off her forehead and confining it with a comb she looked terribly tired and her eyes were as red as darens had been its basically a peacetime communication spellits draining its as obvious as setting off fireworks and it leaves both parties open to attack but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages to my way of thinking you can talk to the other person as easily as if you were facetoface kero said wonderingly i had no idea that was possible like a great many spells its one we tend to keep quiet about kethry told her with a wry twist to her lips there are a fair number of warleaders out there who wouldnt care how dangerous the spell was to the caster if that was the kind of communication they could get i can see thatwas that really my uncle in the fleshso to speakand kicking tarma said hes the one that took over your mothers white winds school and moved it up near the capital hes got a fair number of friends on the rethwellan grand council so as soon as anything happens he knows about it useful sort of relative i just wish he was a little less interested in politics and more in the school kethry said a bit sharply one of these days hes going to back the wrong man maybe tarma replied evenly maybe not he has unholy luck your son and hes twice as clever as you and me put together besides you know as well as i do that to keep the school neutral the head has to play politics with the best of them the only reason you survived down there was because you were protected by the crown and if that wasnt playing politics what is i yield kethry sighed youre right as usual its just that i hate politics hate them all you want so long as you play them right tarma replied all right little hawk she continued turning to kero now you know as much as we do need anything else tarma hadnt said anything nor had kethry but kero sensed that they wanted to be alone she had no idea how well they had known the king but he had been tarmas pupil and they had known his father very well all things considered it was probably time for a delicate withdrawal i dont think so she said thank you hows the lad tarma asked as she turned to leave hes probably fallen asleep by now she said recalling that shed left him sprawled over his bed in a state of exhausted numbness i think hell do a little better knowing faram wants him from what hes said hes a lot closer to his brother than he was to his father not surprising tarma said cryptically well ill let him know the news when he wakes up that was a definite dismissal and kero left as quickly as she could without actually hurrying it was with a certain relief that she closed the door on kethrys workroom she walked slowly toward the fireplace feeling at something of a loss for what to do next she was the only person in the towerexcept perhaps for the seldomseen servantswho was left entirely untouched by the kings death untouched though not unaffected for this affected daren she went up to her room pulled a chair up to her window and sat gazing out her window at the snowcovered meadow below the tower not really thinking just letting her mind roam she sat there the rest of the morning and on into the afternoon before thoughts crystallized out of her musings uncomfortable thoughts the king was calling in his brother and daren would be leaving in the morning which left her the only student at the tower there wasnt much more that tarma could teach her now that she wouldnt learn just as quickly through experience there were things she needed to learn now that only experience and making her own mistakes would teach her in short it was time for her to leave as well leaving going out on my own the thought was frightening paralyzing at that moment someone tapped on her door shaking her out of her trance yes she said still partially caught in her web of thoughts and the visitor opened the door slowly and cautiously kero daren said softly shaking her the rest of the way out of her inertia come in she turned away from the window searching his face though she really didnt know what she was looking for are you im all right he said walking toward her slowly as his face came into the light she saw that he looked a great deal calmer in fact he looked as if he had come to terms with the news and with his own feelings i really am they told me that faram wants me home as he said that his face changed and there was hope and a bit of excitement beneath the mourning thati was kind of afraid faram had forgotten me he said shyly it would be awfully easy to andand i thought hes had one brother turn on him he might not trust me anymore either i wouldnt blame him you know and neither would anyone else id be tempted if i were in his place and i knew he was safely tucked out of the way with two of my fathers old friends keeping an eye on him i thought that might even be the reason father sent me out here in the first place to get me out of the way with someone he trusted making sure i didnt turn traitor on him i thought maybe that was why he didnt send for me when thanel went off to valdemar kero nodded slowly that was sound reasoning in fact in his place shed probably have suspected the same thing but faram wants me more than that he wants me to apprentice to the lord martial there was suppressed excitement in his voice and a light in his eyes its just about everything i ever dreamed of kero and you deserve it she interrupted him with as much emphasis as she could muster youve worked for it youve earned it tarma herself would be the first to tell you that and now you can come with me he continued as if he hadnt heard her theres nothing stopping me from having you with me faram studied under tarma he knows kethry we wont even have to go through that nonsense of getting you ennobled so we can be married married whoa she said sharply who said anything about getting married that brought him to a sudden halt his eyes widened in surprise at her vehemence i thought that was what you wanted he said in innocent surprise i want you with me kerothere isnt anyone else id rather be married to do you want me enough to have me apprenticed alongside you she asked pointedly he stared at her in shock as if he could not believe what she was saying you know that wouldnt be possible he exclaimed youre a girl women cant do things like that im your equal in blade and on horseback she replied with rising heat im your better with a bow and with tactics why shouldnt i work at your side because youre a girl he spluttered you cant possiblyit just isnt doneno one would permit it well what would i be able to do she asked sit on the council act as military advisor of course not he was shockeddespite all their talking all the things they had done togetherby the very idea not so enlightened as we appeared to be hmm well will i be able to keep in training she waited for him to answer and didnt much care for his long silence all right what will i be able to do ride some and huntgenteel hunting with hawk and a light bow he said obviously without thinking nothing like the kind of hunting we have been doing here no boar no deer good gods that would send half the court into apoplexy you cant offend them in other words i wouldnt be able to do a single damned thing that ive been trained and working at for the past three years she pointed out bitterly i cant offend themby them i assume you mean the menby competing with them you want me to give up everything ive worked for all this time and even my recreations you could advise me in private he said hastily i need that kero just like i need you and we could practice together in private so no one would know your lady wife can beat the breeches off you two times out of three she said acidly deliberately telling the truth in the most hurtful way possible of course in private he replied angrily you cant do things like that where people can find out about them after all you wont be a common mercenary do you think i want anyone to know that im your equal and their superior how good i am she stood up in short you want a combination of toy soldier and expensive whore your delicate lady in public and whatever else you want out of me in private with no opinions or thoughts of my ownexcept in private thank you no i told you that night we first talked that i wasnt prepared to sell anything other than my sword that hasnt changed daren and it isnt likely to she rose to her feet and stalked toward the door so angry that she no longer trusted her temper with him and only wanted to be away from him so she wouldnt say or do anything worse than she already had she grabbed her cloak as she passed the door and he made no move to stop her she was walking so fast and was so blind with suppressed fury that she didnt realize until she was down in the dimly lit stables and on her way out the tunnel to the rear entrance that she had also snatched up need on her way out she paused for one moment that startled and alarmed her was the sword controlling herhad she so lost her temper that shed lost her protections against its meddling then common sense reasserted itself just good reactions she decided finally ive gotten to the point where when i head out of my room i snag a weapon without thinking about it she flung the cloak over her shoulders fastened the clasp at her throat and belted the sword beneath it doesnt it just figure she thought angrily as she strode out into the chill lateafternoon sunlight that when i finally get to the point that im reacting like a professional fighter daren pulls this on me offering me anything i wantas long as i dont do anything that embarrasses him like act like a human being capable of thinking for herself another thought occurred to her as she pictured the kind of pampered pet daren seemed to want her to become dierna would have given her soul for an opportunity like this suddenly she stopped dead in her tracks just outside the hidden entrance to the stables the wind molding her cloak tight to her body so whats wrong with me why dont i want this easy life on a platter she shivered and pulled the cloak closer about her as another whip of breeze nipped at her why am i going out to fight for a living why do i want to what kind of fool am i anyway she resumed her walk but at a much slower pace she paced the hardpacked path through the forest with her head down eyes fixed on the frozen snow but not really seeing it if hes offering this to me it pretty much negates what i first told him that im going to be a mercenary because no one is going to keep me fed and clothed hes offering that i dont have to do this so why do i still want to she raised her head and looked around half hoping for some kind of omen or answer there were no answers coming from the silent forest only the mocking echoes of crows in the distance and the steady creaking of snow underfoot there were no answers written against the sky by the bare black branches and no revelations from the clouds either she walked onward following the familiar path to the river out of habit her nose and feet growing numb and chill well she decided finally i suppose one reason is that im good at fighting it would be a damned shame to let that talent go to waste it would be stupidity to let someone else do the job who isnt as good at it as i am the wind died to nothing and her cloak weighed down her shoulders as if embodying all of her troubles that thought led obliquely to another im good at fighting of course it would be nice if there wasnt any fighting if bandits would stop raiding and people would stop making war on each other and everyone could live in peace but that isnt going to happen in my lifetimeprobably not for a long long time so it makes sense for people who are good at fighting to go out and do itbecause if theyre good at it that means the fewest number of other people die that was essentially what tarma had said to both of them a hundred times over that her job and darens was to learn everything they could about advance planning to protect those serving with and under them to keep their casualties to an absolute minimum but there are going to be people like bandits like the karsites who dont care how many people die people with no conscience no honor i know that a lot of folk think mercs dont have eitherbut if thats true then why the codes it was all beginning to come together to make a vague sort of sense she stopped again and squinted her eyes against the westering sun theres always going to be fighting i cant see the world turning suddenly peaceful in my lifetime people of honor have to be a part of that because if they arent the only ones fighting will be the ones who dont care who have no honor and no concern for how many others die right thats why im doing this in a funny kind of way its to protect the diernas and lordans the people who would be the victims even if im getting paid to do it its still protecting them because if all the fighting is done by people with no conscience there wont be any safety anywhere for the people who only want peace that was the answer she was looking for she felt tension leaving her as she turned her back on the setting sun and headed home with her shadow reaching out before her black against the bluetinged snow im good now but i have to become very good special so special that i can pick my company and my captain pick someone with a company so good he can choose when he wont take a job because its for the wrong side and the wrong causes just like grandmother and tarma did and that was why she wouldnt give in to daren and to what he was offering the love he was offering came with restrictions restrictions on what made her unique if he truly loved what she was rather than what he thought he saw he would never have placed those restrictions on her and last of all i dont love him she thought soberly i like him but thats not enough if she took him up on his offer of marriage she would be offering him considerably less than true coin she didnt love him she didnt think she could ever learn to love him in time she might even come to hate him for the lie he was making her live what if one day he outgrew this infatuation and found someone he really did love that would be a tragedy as horrible as anything in any of the romantic ballads worse really there theyd be living double lies and trapped in the agreements theyd made when neither of them was thinking particularly clearly what if she found someone but that notion made her grin sardonically right me in love about as likely as having my horse decide to talk to me i may not be shechorne but i dont think theres been a man born that could be my partner and i wont settle for anything less than that no liking daren was entirely the wrong reason to go through with this charade of his it would be just as false as putting on a dress and pretending to be something she wasnt for the sake of appearances and it was ironic that the things that made her so differentand that he now deploredwere the things that had attracted him to her in the first place if he wants a woman to be different why does he want her to be the same as every other woman she asked herself as she stood just inside the stable door waiting for her eyes to adjust to the dimness inside men why cant they ever learn to think logically daren found himself caught between anger and bewilderment first kero stormed off and left him standing in the middle of her room torn between frustration and feeling foolish he couldnt understand what was wrong with her why couldnt she see that she was going to have to adjust herself to what people expected of her the world wasnt going to change just because she was different hed offered her something any woman in her right mindand certainly every single woman at courtwould have pledged her soul to have and she stormed off because hed told her the truth of the matter and how she would have to change he waited for her to come to her senses and return to apologize and take his hands and say she never wanted to fight like that again but she didnt come back and she didnt come looking for him after he returned to his own room tarma showed up toward sunset she looked older somehow and he guessed that his fathers death had hit her pretty hard well she said its official faram wants you up there yesterday so youd better get yourself packed up youll need to be on the road tomorrow will i need an escort he asked a little doubtfully he didnt really want one and a retinue would slow him down tarma shook her head i dont think so you can take care of yourself quite well youngling and if you have any enemies out there they wont be looking for one man and his beasts theyll be looking for a damned parade he sighed well i guess this is the end of my stay here ivenot precisely liked it buttarma i appreciate all youve done for me i cant really say how much because i wont know exactly how much youve taught me for years yet she smiled a little then youre wiser than i thought if youve figured that out wise enough to know that youll be better off packing up now so you can leave straight away in the morning does kero know im leaving tomorrow he managed to get out tarma looked at him oddly for a moment then nodded i told her the shinain said her expression utterly deadpan she didnt say anything did you two have a fight he started to tell her what had happened between them then stopped himself why he didnt really know unless it was just that he didnt want anyone else to now about this particular quarrel not really he said its just i havent seen her all afternoon he let his words trail off so that tarma could read whatever she wanted to in them she nodded goodbyes are a bitch she said shortly never got used to them myself travel well and lightly jelenedre ill miss you she gave him a quick hard hug and there was a suspicion of tears in her eyes then she left him alone in his suddenly empty room left him to pack the little he had that he wanted or needed to take with him not the clothes certainly except what he needed to travel withfaram would have him outfitted the moment he passed the city gates in the finest of silk and wool velvet and leathers not the books they were tarmas the weapons and armor some notes and letters a couple of books of his own his life here had left him very little in the way of keepsakes and where was kero why didnt she come to him she didnt appear at his door any time that evening he finished packing and tried to read a book but couldnt concentrate on the words finally he took a long hot bath and drank a good halfbottle of wine to relax he thought about his father he and kero had that in common as well after the first shock he was having a hard time feeling the way perhaps he should he hardly knew the kinghed spent more time away from court than in it mostly because of thanel faram had been more of a father than jad the king had been the king and word of his death was enough to shock any dutiful subject into tears if it had been faram now he finished the bottle tried once more to read then gave up and climbed into bed he more than halfway expected kero to drift in through his door after he blew out the candle she has to come he thought she has to she loves me i know she does and our lovemaking has always been goodonce i get her in bed i can make her see sense i know i can but no though he waited until he couldnt keep his eyes open anymore despite tension that had his stomach in knots and his shoulders as tight as braided steel she didnt come by morning hed finally begun to believe that she wouldnt that hed said the unforgivable he hadnt expected her but as he was saddling up his old palfrey tarma came down the stairs to the stable to see him off hed never had more than cursory contact with lady kethry and he wasnt surprised when she didnt appear at her partners side but he was unexpectedly touched to see tarma again couldnt let you go without a parting gift lad she said youll need it too take roan take roan he could hardly believe it the gelding hed been using was a fine saddlebred of her clans breeding he was astonished and touched and very nearly disgraced himself by breaking into tears again dear gods weve got ironheart and hellsbane plus a couple of mules hell be eating his head off in the stable if you dont take him she led the gelding out of his stall and tethered him beside the palfrey look at him hed be perfectly happy to do just that id say its your duty to save the overstuffed beggar from his own stomach in that case he said i guess i have no choice never try to cross a shinain boy she told him gravely we always get our way so ive learned he dared to reach for her bony shoulders and hug her she returned it and they both came perilously close to damp eyes now get out of here before i have to feed you again she said pushing him away gently stareyed bless but the amount of provisions weve had to put in to keep you fed you and that gelding make a matched set it was a feeble joke but it saved him and he was able to take his leave of her dryeyed saddle up roan and ride off down the path to the road then as he stared back at the tower his eyes burned and stung after all she didnt come she hadnt even come to say goodbye he turned his back on the place resolutely shed made her choice he had to get on with his life only his eyes kept burning and not all the blinking in the world would clear them he was rubbing them with the back of his hand when like the ending to a ballad he heard hoofbeats behind himhoofbeats he recognized the staccato rapping of keros little mares feet on the hardpacked snow hed know that limping gait anywhere any time verenna had favored her right foreleg ever since an accident in his second year here and he knew her pace the way he knew the beat of his own heart he turned his gelding to greet her his heart filled to bursting she came to her senses shes coming with me i won her over then as she came into view he felt a shock and stared his eyes going so wide he thought they were going to fall out of his head it was kero all right with her face made up like one of the court flowers her hair in an elaborate arrangement that must have taken hours to do in a dress a fancy velvet dress a parody of huntinggear it was years decades out of date and she must have gotten it out of her grandmothers closet she looked like a fool it wasnt just the dress it wasnt even mostly the dress old and outdated as it was it was that she was simpering at him her eyes all wide and dewy her lips parted artfully her expression a careful mask of eager honeyed anticipation oh daren she gushed as she rode within hearing distance how could you ever have thought id stay behind after all youve offered me after all weve meant to each other how could you have ever doubted me she rode up beside him and laid a hand on his elbow a delicate and patently artificial gesture i thought over what youd said and i realized how wise you are daren the world isnt going to change so i might as well adapt to it after all it isnt every day a prince of the blood offers to make me his consort she gigglednot her usual hearty laugh or even her warm friendly sensuous chuckle but a stupid little giggle her mare sidled a little and she let it instead of controlling it thats when it dawned in him she was acting exactly the way those little ninnies at court had been actingvacuous artfully helpless emptyheaded greedysickening he pulled away from her an automatic unthinking reaction abruptly her manner changed the artificial little fool vanished as completely as if she had never existed kero looked at him soberly the absurd riding habit painted cheeks and ridiculous hair all striking him as entirely unfunny verenna tried to sidle again and this time kero controlled her immediately i just gave you everything you said you wanted me to be yesterday thats exactly the way you asked me to behave in public he protested not when were together oh no she tilted her head to one side really and how private is a prince of the blood when can you be absolutely sure that our little secrets wont be uncovered when can you guarantee that we wont be interrupted or watched from a distance he was taken rather abackand vivid recollections came pouring back of private assignations that had become public gossip within a week of secrets that had been out as soon as uttered of all the times hed sought privacy only to find watchers everywhere roan stamped impatiently reflecting his riders unease even if you can get away from your courtiers she persisted her brows creased as she leaned forward earnestly in her saddle even if you can escape the gossips how do you keep things secret from the servants theyre everywhere and they learn everythingand what they learn sooner or later the entire court knows she sat back in her saddle and watched his face her eyes following his besides what you live you start to become the longer i act like a pretty fool the more likely i am to turn into one is that really what you want from me no he exclaimed startling roan into a snort no what i love about you is how strong you are how clever you are how much youre like a friendthe way i can talk to you like another man he stopped himself appalled but it was too late she was nodding but this is what you asked me to become she replied taking in dress hair and all with a single gesture daren dearheart you dont really want me as a lover you want me as a friend a companion but i cant be a companion in your worldi can only be something like this he tried to say something to refute her but nothing would come out daren you have a companion and partner waiting for yousomeone who needs your help and support and the fact that you love him and needs it more than i ever will she said softly but emphatically your brother is and will be more to you than i ever can or ever should and once wed both gotten to the court youd have found that out i could never be more than a burden to you then and it would frankly be only a matter of time until my temper made me an embarrassment as well iyou he sputtered a while then shook his head as his gelding champed at the bit impatient to be off ii guess youre right he said crestfallen i cant think of any reason why you should be wrong anyway he looked down at his saddle pommel for a moment then defiantly met her eyes but dammit i dont have to like it no you dont she agreed but that doesnt change anything she stared right back into his eyes and in the end he was the one who had to drop his gaze daren she said after a moment of heavy silence broken by the stamping of horses creak of leather and jingle of harness wait a couple of years wait until ive found my place then i can be your eccentric friend that crazy female fighter princes are expected to have one or two really odd friends she chuckled then and he looked up and reluctantly smiled i suppose he ventured you might even do my reputation some good oh definitely the smile she wore turned into a wicked grin just think how people will react when they know im your lover prince daren tamer of wild merc women i can see it now theyll stand in awe of your manhood he blushedall the more because he knew damned well it was true kero he protested are we friends again she said abruptly he blinked his eyes once more filling with tears and this time he did not try to pretend they werent there yes he said although why youd want a fool like me for a friend oh i have to have someone i can borrow money from she said lightlythen reached across the intervening space between them and hugged him hard and when she pulled away there were tears in her eyes as well just you take care of yourself you unmannered lout she whispered hoarsely i want you around to lend me that money mercenary he replied just as hoarsely she nodded and backed her horse away slowly exactly so my friend exactly so she halted the mare just out of reach and waved at him and you have places to go and people waiting for you prince daren he turned his horse and urged it into a brisk walk looking back over his shoulder as he did so he halfway expected to see her making her way toward the tower but she was still sitting on her horse beside the path when she saw him looking she waved oncemore a salute than a wave the departing salute he gave her was exactly that then he set his eyes on the trail ahead and never once looked back kero waited until daren was out of sight then turned her horses head toward the tower im not sure what was more surprisinghim developing good sense or me developing a silver tongue she hadnt quite known what she was going to say only the general shape of it she certainly had not expected the kind of eloquent speech shed managed to make one thing that was not at all surprising she was already missing darenbut she wasnt as miserable as her worst fears had suggested which meant to her way of thinking that she was not in love with the man deep in the lonely hours of the night shed had quasinightmares about successfully sending him away then discovering she really couldnt live without him she sighed and verennas ears flicked back at the sound well she told the mare i guess now its my turn to figure out exactly what im going to do with my life and need chose that moment to strike kero had a halfheartbeat of warning a flash of something stirring like some old woman grumbling in her sleep just before the blade began exerting its full potential for pressure she managed to keep it from taking her over entirely but she could not keep it from disabling her it did its best to overwhelm her with a desire to run away from all this to be out running free a desire so urgent that had she not already fought one set of pitched battles with the sword shed have probably spurred verenna after daren overtaken and passed him now she knew these spurious impulses for what they were and she met them with a will tempered like steel and a stubborn pride that refused to give in to a piece of metal however enchanted she had just enough time to toss verennas reins over her neck groundtying her before the sword took over enough of her body that making verenna bolt for the road was a possibility then she sat rigid and trembling every muscle in her body warring with her will it wasnt even going to be possible to get back to the tower and get help from kethryassuming kethry having spent years under the blades peculiar bondage even could help damn you she thought at the blade as her body chilled and verenna shuddered unable to understand what was wrong with her rider but sensing something she didnt at all like damn you i know who and what i am and what i want and even why i want itand if a man i like isnt going to be able to pressure me into changing that no chunk of metal is going to be able to either muscle by muscle she won control of her body back she closed her eyes the better to be able to concentrate and fought the thing oblivious to everything around her finally candlemarks later or so it seemedthough the sun hadnt moved enough for one candlemark much less the eight or nine it should have taken for the fightshe sat stiffly in her saddle the master of her own body again she waited warily for the sword to try again as her breath and verennas steamed in the coldand she sensed that the sword would try again unless she could devise some way of ending the struggle here and now she stripped off one glove and placed her halffrozen hand on the hilt listen to me you she thought at the blade and sensed a kind of stillness as if it was listening however reluctantly listen to me and believe me if you dont stop this nonsense and leave me alone and let me make my own decisions ill drop you down the nearest well i mean it having a blade that will protect me from magickers may be convenient but damn if im going to lose control of my life in return she sensed a dull sudden heat like faroff anger look you know what ive been thinking i agree with your purpose dammit im even perfectly willing to go along with this agenda of helping women in trouble but i am by all thats holy going to do so on my terms and youre going to have one hell of a time helping women from the bottom of a well if you dont go along with this the anger vanished replaced by surpriseand then silence she waited a moment longer but the sword might as well have been a plain old steel blade at that point not that it felt lifelessbut she had a shrewd notion shed made her point silence means assent she said out loud and put her glove back on then bending over and retrieving the reins much to verennas relief she sent the mare back toward the tower but the last thing she expected was to be met at the stable by tarma the shinain took verennas reins from her once shed dismounted and led the mare toward her stall all without saying a word kero waited wondering what was coming next a reproach for not taking daren up on his offer that hardly seemed likely but tarmas silence portended something tarma tethered verenna to the stall but instead of unsaddling her at once put a restraining hand over keros id have said this within the next couple of months she began but sending daren back is just letting me say it sooner youre ready little hawk think youre up to losing the jesses kero blinked to go where she asked after a moment of thought knowing you you have a plan for me tarma nodded her iceblue eyes warming a little experience is going to be a better teacher than i am from here on she said and ive been looking around for a place for you for the past couple of moons as it happens the son of a good friend of mine just took over a bonded company theyre called the skybolts theyre scoutskirmishers like my old company the sunhawks lerryn twoblades is the captains name hes got a reputation for honesty fair dealing and as much honor as anyone ever gives a merc credit for hell have you and gladly if you want to go straight to a company and if i dont kero asked curious to know just what her options were tarma shrugged you could go out on your own and i have some referrals for the jewel merchants guild caravans but your skills would be better used in a company like the skybolts you could go home if you really want you could go after daren youre even dressed for that she said wryly but its time for you to gobefore you stop wanting to silence hung thick in the stable even the horses sensed something was afoot and werent making their usual noise finally kero nodded i thought this would happen in the spring but im readyor as ready as ill ever be and ill go to the skybolts id have to be a fool to turn down an offer like that tarma relaxed and smiled i try not to train fools she replied andkero youre of the clani want you to take hellsbane what kero asked incredulously i cant do that why not tarma retorted youve been training with her all damned year youre better with her than i am leave keth your verennaa saddle horse isnt going to do you much good as a merc anyway youll spend far too long getting her battletrained ill still have ironheart keth is never going to need a battlemare again and to tell you the truth shes always been a shade uneasy about riding them shell be just as happy with verenna and your girl will be a lot happier with us warrl appeared like a shadow behind the shinain shes right you know hellsbane is warriortrained like you it would be a shame for her potential to be wasted kero shook her head part in disbelief part in amusement i can see ive been outvoted tarmas hoarse voice roughened still further with emotion youre kin of my clan youre the closest thing ill have to a daughter youre my only true protegee and youre the best damned warrior ive ever trained i want you equipped with the very best then she smiled and her voice and eyes lightened again besides after you see the rest of the gear keth and i got you hellsbane is going to seem like an afterthought kero found it very hard to speak or even swallow i dont know what to say she began tarma pulled the saddle off verenna and led the relieved mare back into her stall you can start with thank you and well take it from there think youd be ready to take the road by the end of the week i kero faltered i if you are tarma continued keth can start the messages out to twoblades and we can start fitting your fancy new armor to you so you dont disgrace us when you get there i can be ready she managed as ready to leave as im likely to be i wishi wish i didnt have to leave or that i could take you with me tarma snorted not likely i did my share on the lines chick cant go back in the shell and a young hawk cant unfledge time for you to try your wings time for me to see what its like out there on my own time maybe to really live and maybe fly she said thinking aloud oh youll fly little hawk tarma answered youll fly
