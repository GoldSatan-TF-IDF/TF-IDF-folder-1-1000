ian slater choke point chapter one direct action mission a am khyber pass northeastern afghanistan fastroping down from the hot oily smell of the pave low chopper into the stygian darkness of a frigid ravine seven us special force commandos ran quickly out of the downblast over snowdusted rocks toward a sixfoothigh threefootwide fissure in the sheer rock face the mouth of the suspect cave pausing fifty feet from the entrance the alpha strike trio with veteran commander and medal of honor winner captain david brentwood on point checked out the closetsized opening through the thermal sights of their heckler koch flame and soundsuppressed machine guns bravo the backup squad of four commandos was comprised of eddie merton armed with the teams squad automatic weapon saw two men carrying m carbines and jamal jam hassim the only muslimamerican in the team toting a shotgun the sevenman team of alpha and bravo waited two minutes an eternity in the gritty dustsmelling darkness radiant heat seeping from the cave showed up as white splotches against the emerald green of the commandos night vision goggles as did the infrared id tape on their helmets sleeves and ankles there was no sign of guards the seven men waited until they were sure that no one in the area had been unduly aroused by the sound of the pave low that any al qaeda present would it was hoped dismiss it as yet another of the allied helos that periodically skirted the towering peaks of the hindu kush flying westward through the khyber pass into kapisa province and on to the armorfriendly plains north of kabul even in the icy wind chill several of the commandos were sweating beneath the weight of their missionspecific gear which included ammo loadassault vest packs flash bang grenades additional mags flashlight pouch camelback water bladder night vision goggles black nomex gloves balaclava beretta mm sidearms and the beloved miscellaneous gadget bags attached to each mans load vest satisfied there was no movement nearby six of the sevenman team three on either side entered the cave the seventh man eddie merton armed with the saw and responsible for operating the teams hf radio satcom unit and cell phone took up position as planned at the entrance to the cave thermal satscans in satellite overflights had shown that the entry widened immediately beyond its opening snaking its way for four hundred feet into the rock below a razorback ridge as the two threeman squads moved cautiously forward in the cave eddie placed his saw against a twofoothigh rock by the entrance and popped his baby umbrellathe black double crisscross satcom antenna he then took cover behind the boulder from where he could best serve as the da teams rear guard during the snatch and grab for a while at least he could maintain communications with brentwood and the other five each equipped with saver fm radio and earphone inside the cave the air was damp sour the rock floor strewn with thousands of marblesized pebbles blown in throughout the ages by the fiercely frigid winds that swirled through the mountain fastness of the hindu kush despite the weight of their packs the commandos footsteps were all but silenced by the us special forces stateoftheart overboots made of black oilimpregnated leather spandex and slowrecovery foam they muffled the sound of the commandos approach david brentwood knew that soon there would be no reliable radio contact with merton because of the serpentine nature of the cave he glanced at his watch and whispered into his throat mike they had been down for three minutes exfil exfil confirmed merton it meant they had exactly twentyseven minutes before the pave low returned to exfiltrate the team now that the ambient starlight that had been boosted over three million times by their night vision goggles was no longer available the green monochrome faded and the direct action team switched on the tiny infrared light at the front of the helmetmounted monocular unit coming to a dogleg where the cave suddenly narrowed bravo held back so as not to crowd brentwoods strike trio whose sole purpose was to find li kuan if he was there a former and corrupt middle manager from norinco the chinese governments arms export company kuans sole purpose was to sell osama bin ladens successors depleted uranium for a dirty antisatan bomb a conventionally exploded nuclear waste device that would spew out deadly uranium dust over the terrorists american city of choice li kuan the commandoes had been told should be easily identifiable from a pockmarked scalp reportedly the result of a sulfuric acidtube timer for a nitrate bomb that had prematurely exploded when he was instructing his al qaeda clients in fact brentwood had been one of the thirtyeight americans whod had the misfortune of witnessing both the nitrate bomb explosion in oklahoma city in and on furlough in new york city in the first of the hits on the world trade center his sisters husband a bosom buddy had been one of the scores of firefighters cremated alive when the south tower imploded and jam hassim had lost a cousin a us army sergeant in the attack on the pentagon knowing this general oakley of special operations command told davids team that their anger was a good motivator but remember hed added the mission isnt to waste this prick li its to snatch him bring him back so intel can have a quiet word with the bastard the chinese say hes also trying to sell his dirty bomb stuff to terrorists in the province of xinjiang so youll save a lot more people if we get him alive understood they had and theyd studied the computerenhanced photo of li that beijing had sent the only one available it seemed to them however that aside from the pockmarked bald head the face was so indistinguishable it could have belonged to any one of a billion asians or eurasians the team had completed their refresher runthroughs at delta forces killing house at special operations facilities at fort bragg where they had also undergone no survived brentwood would have said the fortymeter inverted crawl in twentyfive seconds the thirtythree pushups in a minute the grueling twomile seventeenminute runs in full gear and the lovely hundredmeter swim while fully clothed and in assault boots only then would they have met the exacting standards laid down for them by the legendary now retired general douglas freeman only thirty feet into the cave brentwood paused sensing movement his hand signals taking over the job of whispered throat mike instructions rats scuttled left and right the stench of the cave now laced with the odor of roasting goat jam hassim could feel warm eddies of air gently brushing the sliver of exposed skin between his nvgs and balaclava but as yet there was no wood or charcoal odor no whiff of kerosene and no white splotch in the nvgs that would indicate the source of the warmth perhaps the eddies hed felt were body heat hassim thought but whose the team was trained for speed and daring but when needed caution all seven commandos were alert for booby traps he motioned the team forward they had been down from the pave low for only eight minutes nineteen to go and lots to do satisfied that the only noise hed heard was that of the rodents he checked his watch after ten paces though he thought he heard voices faint maybe twenty feet farther in and signaled the men to stop chapter two northeast pacific on the far side of the world moving from quiet to ultraquiet the footlong virginiaclass uss utah the fastest and deadliest attack submarine ever built was speeding beneath gray seas at sixty miles an hour when one of the four sonar operators in its bluelit control room spotted an anomaly on his green waterfall screen contact on surface he said bearing zero six three degrees fifteen thousand yards the attack subs sonar library computer containing the acoustic signature of every ship afloat immediately printed hostile by nature of sound officer of the deck ordered captain john rorke man battle stations man battle stations aye sir the gsharp sounded throughout the utah and the officers and men scrambled to assigned positions their vibramsoled sneakers barely audible all nonessential equipment quickly powered down the deep gurgling sound of torpedo tubes flooding could be heard by some as the plotting officers computer crunched the numbers water salinity sea temperature angle on the bow and the other myriad variables necessary to solve the complex mathematical equations that preceded firing the subs advanced capability mark torpedoes the torpedomen removed the warning warshot loaded cards from the notification slots of the two tubes selected for firing each tube housed a sleek blacknosed ton mark fish capable of running at sixty miles per hour for a distance of twenty miles the warhead was designed not to hit the target dead on but below an enemys keel in order to create a vacuum into which the doomed ship would collapse and sink within minutes steer course zero six five said the weapons officer very well weapons captain rorke replied the plotting officer checked the proposed vectors on his computer chart shot looks good on plot very well plot acknowledged rorke officer of the deck secure for battle stations secure for battle stations aye alicia mayne the lone civilian scientist aboard sat on the flipdown stool just outside the entrance to the combat control center she was struck once again by the navys ritual of dogged repetition designed to avoid the kind of catastrophic error that had lead to the uss greenevilles accidental sinking of the japanese trawler ehime maru off hawaii in february the board of inquiry investigating the greenevilles grievous mistake had pointedly noted that civilians aboard the sub had crowded the boats combat control center and so alicia was now careful to stay out of the way she enjoyed simply listening to the vocal confirmation of each order it evoked a sense of teamwork honed under all kinds of conditions it was reassuring and she enjoyed watching captain rorke a lean sixfooter in his early thirties she guessed so absorbed by his task that he was oblivious to her presence or perhaps so disciplined that he knew she was there but was able to focus entirely on his job anyway prepare to come to periscope depth commanded rorke prepare to come to periscope depth aye seconds later rorke ordered officer of the deck proceed to periscope depth proceed to periscope depth aye everyone was tense battle stations could last for a minute or an hour either way they were approaching the moment of truth was it a drill or would it be an actual firing only the navigating officer and the captain knew for sure in the torpedo room an auxiliaryman bet ten bucks it was a drill david brentwood hand signaled his five da commandos forward again the voices he thought hed heard were gone his men had all heard the phantom sounds before on other missions the wind moaning through the hindu kush could play on the imagination a fact well known for a hundred years by the british regiments who had tried to pacify the wild afghani tribesmen jam hassim with his beloved remington pumpaction at the ready moved up but he wasnt happy there hadnt been any al qaeda guards posted at the caves entrance then again why should there be it was a top secret operation and the commandos fast rope infiltration had gone by the book the noise of the chopper only transitory by now the most common sound in the war against terror besides the fact that there were no guards could mean that the cave was deserted the heat signature the team had seen through the nvgs at the mouth of the cave could be hours old heat ghosts of the kind that remained even after a parked car had left the parking lot its residual infrared signature like a mirage on a hot day still extant though invisible to the naked eye and jam knew how many times the special forces had been fed rumor rather than hard intelligence because of the now retired cia boss admiral stansfield turners obsession with signal intelligence and other gizmology as his archcritic general freeman had repeatedly pointed out to the pentagon instead of cultivating more human intelligence spies around the world the cia and other us intelligence agencies had relied too heavily on satellite reconnaissance afghanistan for example had only a handful of us agents unlike britain whose long colonial experience in the near and far east had yielded more informants and most of the handful had been hunted down caught and tortured to death during the talibans reign of terror before when reliance on electronic eyes and ears had been able to yield only so much since the situation been changing but human spies took time to cultivate train and infiltrate now it struck jam as it had brentwood up ahead that they could well be on a wild goose chase whoever had been ensconced in the farthest recesses of the winding subterranean fissure was probably there only during one of the allied air strikes through his nvgs brentwood on point discerned a perfectly straight thin white line a few inches above the cave it passed from one side of this eightfootwide section to the other it was hightech in a lowtech environment a photoelectric beam his hand shot up again and the other five commandos froze good for dave jam thought had he broken the beam an alarm would have sounded al qaeda and the taliban belonged to the stone age but bin laden had taught them to go hightech wherever possible and hed provided the funds then again all allied special forces including the aussies and brits used such early warning devices and jam realized that if the cave hadnt been abandoned they might be closing on another allied specop team taking temporary refuge from the bitter cold bad intel no he dismissed the thought as wild surmise it couldnt be the cave now narrowed to a sixfootwide fivefoothigh tunnel that split into a y the six commandos dividing into two threeman squads bent low crouching over their weapons as they proceeded farther into the tarblack interior brentwood had elected to lead his strike trio into the left spar of the y remembering that the satellite heat signature pictures suggested the lefthand fork had been bleeding heat jams trio including a rifleman julio sanchez took the right branch of the y which jam guessed might soon peter out he was right he signaled his team to backtrack to join the other squad which meant he was now tailend charlie with brentwood still on point there were fourteen minutes to go when brentwood glimpsed a baseballsize white blur coming at him from the left flank down he yelled pivoting swinging his hk and unleashing a burst of mm fire the eardunning crash of the grenades explosion its purplish white cross combining with the fiery tongue from his weapon bloomed out his nvgs the white on white temporarily blinding him as his hk sent redhot rock fragments ricocheting off the caves walls over his five prostrate comrades three commandos returned fire pocking the ys left branch where jam now saw a clutch of terrorists there were at least eight of them momentarily illuminated by the detonation of a flashbang stun grenade tossed by sanchez on jams right the two commandos to jams left were literally shot to pieces as the fire erupting from the terrorists aks threw them in sharp relief against the rock that formed the caves culdesac the terrorists hid behind a shoulderhigh barricade of expended ammunition boxes filled with pebbles one of brentwoods trio fell dead and his right arm was split from below his elbow to his shoulder streaming blood as he continued to fire at the terrorists twenty feet away his hk tucked tightly between his left arm and kevlarprotected waist the hydraulic shock of the rounds knocked down al qaeda as if they were being felled with a sledgehammer jam pumped his remington four times its gauge sabot slugs smashing through the terrorists barricade the force of the slugs was so powerful that three of the four not only shattered the stonepacked ammo boxes and killed three of the terrorists but also created a deadly hail of pebbles that hit the remaining four terrorists with the equivalent of a hundred or more stones within seconds all but one of the eight were down the thudding booms of the remingtons enfilade momentarily deafening the three remaining commandos smoke and the acrid stench of cordite engulfed the culdesac then spread out slowly in ethereal layers wafting like lazy swamp gas out toward the caves entrance where eddie merton unable to make radio contact with his buddies wondered what the hell was going on only one terrorist was still on his feet one hand thrust up in surrender the other trying vainly to stem the spill of his entrails the red spaghettilike clump taking on the luminescence of melting ice cream in the four remaining commandos nvgs the stench of feces and urine choked the air then brentwood heard a sound like running water pebbles continuing to spill from the terrorists shattered ammunition boxes which had served as their ad hoc sandbags with sanchez whod thrown the illuminating flashbang covering the captive brentwood and jam hassim quickly checked the seven terrorists on the ground feeling for a pulse with one hand the other holding their weapons barrels against each enemys throat the playdead technique was as old as combat itself but in the confusion of battle it still worked occasionally taking a wouldbe victor especially a new hand by surprise there was a flash in brentwoods nvgs the one survivor throwing a knife at sanchez as it shot past bentwoods helmet hassim pumped two sabot slugs into him rendering the mans head mush on the caves back wall now all eight terrorists were dead and when they checked none of the men was chinese bad intel and what to show for it brentwood asked himself two americans dead and the brains of seven al qaeda splattered against ancient rock and no li kuan he took a moment to bend down and do up a loose bootlace for a moment in this subterranean hellhole of death and gagging smells he smiled to himself recalling his dad who like all parents occasionally drove their kids nuts by repeating a favorite story or warning ad nauseam in this case it was the memory of his dad telling him repeatedly how dangerous a loose shoelace could be again the story of the german tenor fritz wünderlich in the s coming downstairs one evening in his home to answer his doorbell wünderlich ignoring a loose shoelace tripped tumbled down the stairs and broke his neck just like that davids father had told him never ignore a loose lace son no dad hed replied now brentwood heard a sound like tarpaper tearing a saw light machine gun two bursts then a sharp crack like a bull whip shit jam said moving fast back past david and sanchez toward the tunnel entrance to help eddie david followed but neither of them ran they knew that an escaping li kuan or whoever it was could have activated a booby trap somewhere along the sixfootwide tube that was the cave which rushed at them in their nvgs the snaking gunsmokefilled enclosure now widening to ten feet where they could finally stand up there was another crack down shouted jam brentwood instinctively dropping to the rock floor a few feet from the caves entrance his flex kevlar elbow pads absorbed most of the shock and he smelled the sharp odor of burned cordite issuing from mertons now silent saw drifting up like an errant fog out into the pristine mountain air outside the cave unlike the cloying perspiration and ratsoured atmosphere behind them in the cave the blast of oxygen was at once ice cold and invigorating though it was laden with fine dust particles that in the nvgs magnified starlight looked to david like white tracer jam hassim he saw was dead facedown the back of his head blown off by what must have been the snipers second shot eddie merton had been killed by the first what had been eddies left eye was now a gaping void the bloodfilled socket a jaggededged white hole on davids nvgs rapidly losing its intensity as the snowcold wind moaning through the hindu kush caused the dead commandos body temperature to plummet and his blood to coagulate david used his infrared night sight to scan the razorback ridge that formed the other wall of the deep ravine there was a residual heat signature but no body except the one david was using as a weapon rest jams still warm corpse and why david asked himself angrily because hed bent down to fix a goddamn bootlace what the hell had happened had the man who somehow escaped from the tunnel and shot merton from behind been li kuan and had he also fired the second shot which killed jam or had the second shot been fired by whoever had been on the ridge it was the fog of war no one would really know until they had the luxury of hindsight the monday morning quarterbacks cleareyed view all david knew for sure now as he tried to piece it together was that one of the best buddies hed ever had was dead because of that goddamn shoelace he cussed his old man then felt guilty and extraordinarily weak the effect of the blood hed lost from his right arm overtaking the adrenaline rush of the facetoface combat in the claustrophobic killing zone in the cave one thing was for damn sure he thought somehow somewhere he was going to nail that son of a bitch kuan he reached for mertons satcom mike lying inert on the ground only now realizing that it would be touchandgo as to whether a medevac helo would make it in time chapter three the utah was nearing periscope depth in combat control rorke ordered stand by to shoot four and three stand by to shoot four and three confirmed the ood up scope scopes breaking announced the watchman now speed was everything rorke cap reversed eyes glued to the scopes rubber cups flicked down the columns arms the cups werent supposed to be there the design of the new virginiaclass attack sub having replaced the captains oldfashioned scope the scopes view through the cups now seen as pictures on tv monitors in the combat control center however finding the physical detachment from what they were viewing too unnatural rorke and some captains of other virginiaclass subs had insisted on retaining the old drill his arms draped over the handles he rotated with the scope then stopped his senses super alert the newcarshowroom smell of the cccs more powerful than usual bearing mark range mark down scope above the soft whine of the retracting search scope his reflection distorted in its oilglistening column rorke reported i have one visual contact his confident tone however masked the fact that given the northwesterly chop and spray it was difficult for him to discern the suspected hostile clearly range he asked eighteen miles came the response it was four miles short of the torpedos maximum range sonar rorke called acoustic signature still hostile signature still hostile by nature of sound very well the automatic sonar modules on virginiaclass subs didnt need operators but rorke liked to have a handson sonarman on his watch solution ready announced the weapons officer ship ready added the assistant wo ship ready aye acknowledged rorke match sonar bearings and shoot the firing officer now took over shoot four and three every man in the utah heard the rush of compressed air blasting the two mark torpedoes out of their tubes their propulsor jets quickly taking over each fish trailed guidance wire from the first of its two compact tenmilecapacity spools the existence of guidance wires alicia mayne knew was a surprise for visiting vips who expected wireless torpedoes in the twentyfirst century four and three running announced the wo very well acknowledged rorke having already started the stopwatch that hung about his neck tti time to impact nineteen minutes twelve seconds as per standard procedure no one aboard except the captain and his navigating officer knew where their sub was let alone the target all the utahs crew knew was that they had left bangor base over a day before passing through the retracting section of the hood canal bridge by now they could be off the alaskan panhandle or heading for hawaii the pressing question on the minds of most of the young crew was whether a crazy ivan or third world hostile had come to test their potential adversarys state of readiness or to land illegalsagents that was standard procedure for all blue water navies including that of the us or as was part of every us submariners lore was it readying to launch a surprise attack as the japanese sub i had when it suddenly surfaced off the california coast on the night of february and shelled the strategic oil installations at santa barbara plus every us submariner like the us navy at large like america itself carried the memory of having been taken utterly unawares on december and on september the navy in particular vowing that neither its surface nor submarine fleet would ever be taken by surprise again bangor submarine base washington state are you ready admiral jensens wife asked him playfully as she slipped into bed beside him her plumeria perfume washed over him her diaphanous peachcolored nightie catching the light teasingly before she switched off the lamp it was am and the fiftythreeyearold admiral walter jensen commander of us submarine group and his wife margaret were tired but relaxed they had returned from a successful if long navyhosted reception for over two hundred northwest vips including everyone from bill gates to the greenpeace representatives with margaret in tow the admiral had reassured the movers and shakers of the northwest and seattle in particular that the us navy was conscious of its environmental responsibility in the pristine waters of puget sound especially the fiftythreemilelong milewide hood canal waterway through which the admirals nucleararmed subs egressed into the strait of juan de fuca and the open pacific among the guests were several canadian politicians from the nearby province of british columbia where the southern tip of vancouver island formed the northern flank of the vitally strategic strait washington states ruggedly beautiful olympic peninsula forming the southern flank even the environuts as they were deridingly called by some in the navy seemed satisfied that the admiral was doing everything in his power to assure the environmental integrity of the clear cold cobaltblue waters whose emerald islands had attracted urban refugees from throughout america the admiral switched off the light in all a good nights work chief he told margaret were not finished yet she replied reaching lustily for him squeezing hard her perfume even stronger now permission to come alongside he joshed eagerly id rather you came aboard she said very well permission to come aboard permission granted hed begun his roll to port when the phone jangled in the darkness its red light showing it was from the base damn jensen admiral sorry to disturb you sir this is duty officer morgan yes sir star has spotted an anomaly the duty officers voice was even unhurried thoroughly professional but the admiral knew that at three in the morning it had to be important star was base shorthand for darkstar the resurrected unmanned aerial vehicle which along with the navys undersea hydrophone sound surveillance system or sosus was used for comsubpacgru s realtime security surveillance of puget sound and environs this had been particularly important since the terrorist ressam had been caught at port angeles in crossing over from canada with a truckload of explosives intending to blow up los angeles airport anomaly on land or water the admiral inquired sitting up water sir vessel wake or sub venting the admiral pressed none reported in the area sir we have the utah out but shes much farther west which meant the anomaly could be a patch of upwelling a common occurrence on the west coast where fresh water leaked upward from seabed springs through fissures in juan de fucas evershifting tectonic plate because of the fresh waters different salinity and thus slightly different color it often showed up as an anomaly like a slick of oil readily visible by darkstars godseye view or the anomaly could be the first sign of an environmental disaster an oil spill you check with coast guard air at port angeles asked the admiral with that his wife turned on her bedside lamp resignedly sliding over a copy of time from her nightstand all right she heard her husband tell the duty officer keep me posted no no you did the right thing when the coast guard gets back to you let me know what they say perhaps its just some weird local phenomenon yes absolutely call me either way margaret jensen scanning the time interview knew that her husbands either way meant he wouldnt be able to relax enough to have sex at least not the kind she wanted he was in line for cno chief of naval operations the uss highest naval rank and the smallest screwup as hed so often reminded her could scuttle the promotion he looked apologetically at margaret sorry about this kafuffle she shrugged trying not to look annoyed but knowing thered be no orgasmic relief until walt knew exactly what the damned anomaly was morganll get back to me soon he assured her dont think so she said still reading why she turned the page weather channel said theres a low closing in from the pacific fog coast guard planes wont see anything damn youre right he lifted the phone about to punch the preprogrammed button for the base then decided against it best to wait for the coast guard report dont overreact a potential cno never panics pray god it was a simple case of upwelling and not the first trace of an oil spill from some liberianregistered vessel having illegally discharged its bilges under cover of darkness to save a few bucks having it pumped off in port fifteen minutes later the phone jangled again the admiral let it ring twice jensen here admiral duty officer morgan no reports from coast guard air and their vessels report nothing but the usual run of boater accidents general assistance calls et cetera but theyre sending a cutter out to have a looksee its dark as sin out in the strait theyll use infrared infrared wouldnt show a spill in this weather the admiral pointed out if it is a spill no sir agreed morgan but they can take water samples then the do posited an entirely different but quite plausible explanation for the anomaly darkstar had spotted it could be a nawid he meant a natural airwater interface disturbance caused by a hard rain shower or a school of fish in a frenzy of feeding on plankton near the surface the admiral was nodding thinking about requesting a sidescan sonar profile of the sea bottom rather than settling for the ordinary sonar depth reading that as a matter of standard procedure would be taken by the coast guard cutter but to request a sidescan radar profile that would reveal any venting or other anomaly on the sea bed was a costly proposition for the navy ergo the taxpayers and he could be accused of making a mountain out of a molehill he decided to wait all right he told morgan let me know if you hear any more request another darkstar run tomorrow aye aye sir good night the admiral replaced the phone maybe the anomaly had been nothing more than a sudden squall of wind hed seen that often enough anybody whod been on any kind of boat had seen it an area of water disturbed by a phantom gust ruffling the water causing it to momentarily take on a different shade of blue green or gray depending on the color of the sky but margaret saw that he was worried go to sleep she urged pulling the bedspread playfully up over his head you think im overreacting came the muffled voice beneath the cover she put the magazine aside and switched off her bedside lamp well you have made a bit of a meal out of it he cast off the cover a meal out of it ive never heard you use that before there was silence youve never used that phrase before he repeated i dont know she said in the penumbra of his bedside light i must have read it somewhere ive heard it before the admiral said accusingly its a limey expression that limey admiral the brit liaison guy at the base hes always using it maybe she said tiredly but youre never on the base how would you know there was another long silence before she spoke dont start with me walter start what obsessing goddammit all i said was that youre never on the base are you now he could hear the alarm clock ticking answer me margaret margaret she wouldnt dammit he sat up couldnt sleep but she could through a tornado perhaps shes right he thought he was obsessing again his darkstar anxiety expressing itself in veiled accusations about a suspected attraction between her and the limey liaison officer like a dog with an old bone he told himself his obsessive streak made worse throughout his career by the navys insistence particularly the nuclear navys near paranoid insistence that you do everything by the book or else check doublecheck and check again lives depended on it oh use your initiative by all means but only after you know the rules well enough to know the ones you can break of course there were renegades cowboys like the seals and freemans nowdisbanded salerts sea air land emergency response team who thought they could operate under their own rules but sooner or later the service army air force navy or marine reined them in and they sure as hell didnt make flag rank the problem he knew was that he was so close to becoming cno settle down he told himself this was simply an attack of nerves and selfdoubt that at times assailed even the most selfassured individuals who momentarily with sweating palms heartbeat racing out of control are seized by the unshakable conviction that theyre about to be found out the veneer stripped away the naked self revealed warts and all jensen wondered if that was why mike borda the navys most beloved admiral a mustang a man whod worked all the way up from the deck to admiral ended up blowing his brains out in ostensibly for wearing a medal to which he wasnt entitled his eyes now accustomed to the darkened room jensen made his way quietly into the living room past the smell of hothouse roses past the faintly visible outline of the model of the new virginiaclass sub and poured himself a stiff jack daniels eschewing ice for fear of the dispenser waking margaret or was she just pretending to be asleep thirty years of marriage and there were still times like this when he wasnt sure whether she was genuinely asleep or using it as a means of escape get a grip he chided himself youre acting like a goddamn ensign before his finals youre commander of subgroup nine for christs sake cmon walter he started when he heard the phone ring and took it in the kitchen admiral jensen morgan here sir we have a coast guard cutter report no anomaly no spill no spill fishheads dumping said jensen realizing now that the anomaly had probably been caused by one of the hundreds of fishermen oops fishers if you were headed for cno who plied the northwests waters they often dumped thousands of fishheads from their catch to save valuable storage space in the boats freezer which given the price of fuel cost them a small fortune to keep cold yes it was pollution of a sort he acknowledged but small potatoes the fish heads quickly devoured by the seas predators morgan could hear the admirals sigh of relief very well said jensen everythings fine then good night there was new buoyancy in his tone but back in bed pulling up the covers residual anxiety stayed with him everythings fine hed told morgan the very same phrase hed used to assure bill gates et al about the pristine waters of puget sound it recalled the advice his uncle used to give him about voicing such blasé assurances say that about your car his uncle had once cautioned and next day the goddamn wheels fall off flinging aside the bedspread once more jensen walked softly back to the living room and called the base morgan call port angeles send out a bruiser with two divers see if theres any evidence of gas venting from the seabed it was the one phenomenon amid all the wacko bermuda triangle theories that had made a smidgen of sense to jensen the idea that at times enormous bubbles of hydrate gas like a fart in a bathtub as one chief had indelicately but accurately put it were vented from the seas bottom lighter than air the escaping gas would not only disturb the waterair interface but would rise rapidly and if there was a sparker in its path such as an aircraft or boat engine thered be an enormous explosion leaving nothing on the radar screen a bruiser two divers morgan confirmed adding itll be light in about an hour admiral you want me to wait until no send em out right away cut in jensen besides itll be dawn by the time they get there tell them that if they smell gas vapor theyll need to cut the motor for the last half mile and go in under paddle power yes sir morgan answered adding as he put down the phone theyll like that chapter four david brentwood heard the deep brrr of the bulky pave low coming in over the ravine he saw the dim outline of the choppers portside crashresistant external auxiliary fuel tank as the pilot trimmed the craft then the tanks silhouette in his nvgs was lost against the helos body the pilot deciding against dropping antimissile sucker flares because a rain of incandescent decoys would announce to any hostile in the area that infidels had arrived rules of engagement meant that david in urgent need of first aid would have to go up first next the bodies of jamal hassim eddie merton and the four commandos killed in the cave would be hauled up followed by sanchez the only other survivor besides brentwood whose job it would be to hook up the dead it would take time it would be dangerous but special forces first commandment was thou shalt not leave a comrade injured or dead intuitively david felt badly about insisting that he be the first in line for extraction but common sense together with specfors rules of engagement had to overrule his better nature if his arm could be saved either by the d first responsetrauma medic among the choppers sixman crew or at the battalion mash unit at tora bora base he could fight again and go after li kuan before a dirty bomb appeared in an american or somebody elses city as he ran out to grab the rope lowered by the chopper into the ravine the caliber machine gunner on the paves rear ramp door moved his weapon left to right on the pintle mount in concert with his nvg sweep of the razorback ridge that cut the night sky like a knife blade no more than a hundred feet away sanchez emerging from the caves entrance knelt to cover brentwood amid the onslaught of dust and pebbles kicked up by the helos downdraft the ramp gunner saw a flash at one oclock swung his hard left and unleashed a full burst the machine guns deafening staccato overriding the whack of the snipers armorpiercing round hitting the right auxiliary tank whose sealant wall did not prevent a leak but there was no flame the pilot wanting to jettison the tank but afraid it might strike brentwood who was still on the ground directly beneath the chopper yelled through his mike asking if he was hooked up to the spie line the copilot meanwhile released a rain of orange antimissile flares are you hooked up shouted the pilot do you copy are you yes i am go go go and the paves bulbousnosed radar dome and inair refueling proboscis dipped in unison the choppers rear rotor tilted as the pave rose swiftly above the dark vshaped cleft of the ravine the helos rear ramp machine gunner laying down suppressing fire until the last possible moment the ramp door closing like the mouth of some airborne flamespitting dragon david still on the ground as the pave low took up the slack clung to the rope with his left hand his right dangling uselessly then suddenly he was off his body and boots a tiny exclamation point to the pilot the commando leader dangling over two hundred feet below the chopper in fact brentwood was only ten feet off the ground his illusion of height caused by the freezing air roaring into his lungs as wind currents buffeted him from side to side dangerously close to the narrow ravines cliffs like a pendulums bob the vapor trail of the russianmade rocketpropelled grenade streaked up from a razorback hide and was clearly visible to sanchez at the caves entrance not being a heatseeking missile the rpgs kilogram highexplosive antitank round struck the helo below the right engine mounts cowling black smoke poured out of the helo which immediately began losing power in an instantaneous decision the pilot jettisoned the right auxiliary fuel tank that had already been hit by the rangefinding sniper bullet the tank dropped like a bomb but the pilot was right to release it for now he could see that the tank was afire david felt the whoosh of hot air as the tank plummeted past him no more than ten feet away a second before the chopper rose another fifty feet the burning tank smashing into the ground exploded vomiting out an enormous pearshaped orange flame that engulfed the caves entrance incinerating sanchez and jams inert body im going down yelled the paves medic grabbing his trauma pack the helos ramp was opening again its caliber now joined by the helos rightside minigun go yelled the pilot who fought against the fierce winds coming up from the ravine which had no doubt been strengthened by the auxiliary tanks explosion he realized as the medic must have that any attempt to winch brentwood up farther would spell disaster given the helos severe rockabye motion either brentwood would be smashed against the rock face or delaying the pave make the helo a sitting target disengage the medic yelled at brentwood david didnt have to be told twice both men falling within seconds of one another from the spie line ten feet to the ground david rolled onto his injured arm the pain shooting so fast to his brain that he momentarily passed out the medic dragging him behind the cover of boulders twenty feet from the caves entrance davids pain was so intense however that a moan escaped him shut up the medic told the medal of honor winner injecting him with a vial of morphine he taped davids arm and started an iv drip the wind almost blowing off his kevlar helmet which was pelted by small pebbles and dust as fine as talc but all the medic could think of now was whether the pave pilot had had time to send a mayday to tora bora and if so had they heard him goddamn cia he cursed theyd given the afghans hundreds of heatseeking stingers to fight the soviets and now the missiles were being used to kill americans the world was crazy and now the russians were helping the us fight the terrorists he checked brentwoods pulse it wasnt good why in hell had the helo stopped dropping flares to avoid stingers probably the medic guessed because the copilot was conserving them for the run back over hostile areas to tora bora it occurred to him then that if al qaeda got to him and brentwood he could barter his medical skills and supplies for his survival you goddamned coward he berated himself aloud youre special forces for christs sake one of freemans boys get a grip he saw david brentwood struggling with his left hand for the mouthpiece to his camelback but the water sack had been lacerated either by the firefight in the cave or by shrapnel from the explosions of the helos jettisoned fuel tank the medic took off his own camelback but warned david just a sip the helo now free of any encumbrance rose high and barely missed by another rpg round banked sharply to the left for twelve hundred meters beyond the maximum range of an rpg from there the pave hovering its machine guns roaring aided by infrared searchlights began raking the razorback now that the helo had more freedom to move winds are dying down noted the pilot maybe we could have another go why not said the copilot sounding braver than he felt missile three oclock low shouted the pilot hauling hard on the paves yoke narrowly avoiding the rpg the paves gunners laid down suppressing fire left to right the helo banking hard toward the ravine the copilot warning the medic this would be the last attempt the medic was frantically lashing himself to brentwood when the weighted spie line thumped him in the back sending his helmet flying knocking him and brentwood to the ground jesus christ but he was quick enough to grab the line and clip on the line now slacker dragged past him the paves pilot tried to ease the pave up but despite the helos heavy enfilade another rpg was coming straight at him he dropped the helo abruptly and the medic and brentwood who had been rising before were now dumped for a moment the medic thought the spie line had been jettisoned again to save the chopper the rpg exploded high above them on the ravines cliff face sending a rain of rock fragments down on the two men the whack on brentwoods helmet was so loud that the helos winch man swore he heard it above the rotor slap the baseballsize fragment that struck the helmetless medic wasnt heard by anyone on the pave as the helo rose quickly simultaneously winching the two men up the dust storm it created sent a gritty eyeclosing wind over the terrorists who nevertheless kept firing the pave taking several hits none fatal the ramp machine gunner shot in the right boot was unaware of it until he felt the warmth of his foot the boot filling with blood brentwood was dragged hard over the fuselages lip the medic though none of the crew realized it at the time was dying from a massive hemorrhage in his brain chapter five as the fiveman crew of one of the port angeles bruisers as the thirtyfootlong rigid hull inflatable boats were unofficially known readied to put to sea the crew of the utah seventy miles to the west of juan de fuca strait braced for the explosions they expected against the suspected hostile target nineteen miles or so farther west the hand on rorkes watch reached zero knowing that noise raced through seawater at three to four times the speed of sound in air depending on the oceans salinity the crew were aware it would take twentyfive to thirty seconds for the detonations to reach them plus a few more for tide and current interference and for torpedo counterevasive tactics should the hostile have seen the utahs torpedoes coming and tried to outmaneuver them at zero plus twenty seconds no one was worried at zero plus thirty seconds nothing forty damn said the weapons officer looks like weve got a lem then they heard and felt the blast of the pound highexplosive warheads followed by the awful sound of bulkheads buckling and collapsing like the bones of some huge prehistoric animal in its death throes how many were dying rorke could see the question written on the faces of his young crew now that the excitement of the hit had passed relax gentlemen he announced smiling we didnt deep six anyone just a rusty target hulk rigged to emit hostile acoustics you did the utah proud he turned to lieutenant commander ray peel this watchs ood officer of the deck emergency blow emergency blow aye sir the ballast control operator activated the two mushroomsballast control valves the rapid gush of air from the subs air banks to her ballast tanks so alarming that it made her crew tense again utah broke surface nose first in an enormous rush of foaming white phosphorescence before she trimmed her belly coming down on the sea like a broaching whale the phosphorescence quickly faded men releasing their hand holds alicia mayne could see the men visibly relax she felt it too as one of the navys preeminent torpedo researchers shed known that at some point during utahs exercise patrol her first aboard one of the billion virginiaclass subs thered be a shoot in order for her to study postfiring telemetry data but she hadnt been told when or where it would take place why couldnt you have told me beforehand she asked rorke pointedly albeit with a smile thought you might alert the crew he replied take the edge off them now she was offended and rorke knew it no no he said not tip them off verbally its a persons body language just like youre telling me now how pissed you are at me besides he added cheekily i thought you might enjoy the suspense enjoy not knowing if we were going to be fired on i figured the experience would give you a greater appreciation of what a torpedo launch is like he said telemetry is only one part of it your knowledge of the human factor could be just as valuable in improving the new mark he paused you notice the strain on the men in combat control in the weapons officers voice when those boys their average age is twentytwo are sending out all that information through the wire one slip one nanosecond of lost focus could mean our fish hits a hostile a second too late giving the enemy time to launch and thatd be the end of us alicia knew he was right she had felt the guttightening human factor when the adcap had been fired seeing how it was done on the sub rather than watching a launch in the lab tank ashore could help enormously in the design in upgrading the mark a minute change could buy you that vital nanosecond i agree she told him thats why i came along rorke realized then why she was tops in her field it wasnt just because of her mastery of physics and ocean dynamics she was quick to concede a point if she thought you were right not pigheaded like some of her male colleagues though obviously proud to have been the first child of a bluecollar family as the navy times had put it to work her way through college the icing on the cake as her father said a phd from mit it was clear that unlike other aspiring postdoctoral students she wouldnt allow her pride to stand in the way of admitting to a better idea from colleagues it was one of the reasons rorke concluded that she had been appointed senior scientist in charge of upgrading the mark adcap torpedoes and the mark the revolutionary ship and airlaunchable ninefootfourinchlong by inchdiameter torpedo which was half the size of the adcap and less than a quarter its weight well captain she told rorke when you start using the b you can forget all about the problems of wire guidance itll be strictly shoot and scoot no hanging about great but dont we already have that with the present mark yes but the bll give you fifteen more knots which meant it would have twice the speed of the adcap he was obviously impressed and ushered her into the wardroom where a sonar operator had taken in the reams of the two fired torpedoes telemetry printout for her perusal like a coffee doctor rorke asked hot chocolate alicia declined the excitement and anxiety of the launch was all the stimulus she needed to stay awake may i ask she ventured coyly where we are before he could answer either way she added im guessing on the nanoose range she was referring to the testing range east of vancouver island loaned to the us navy by canada for firing and retrieval of dummy warhead torpedoes nope he said goodnaturedly the nanoose range is so full of sh er crap miles of used wire and other navy debris bangor had to hire oregon oceanics to clean it up were nowhere near it were west of cape flattery thats off washington state right right most northwesterly point of the continental us he raised his coffee mug in salute were you on who wants to be a millionaire oh no she laughed no i couldnt stand the strain ah too bad he smiled i could have been your lifeline he said it jocularly but pointedly sipping his coffee their eyes met he saw her blush like a schoolgirl ah she stammered how long will it take to clean up goose i mean nanoose island he laughed an open breezy laugh nanoose bay what oh yes of course bay rorke shrugged month or two hall the guy who runs oregon oceanics works pretty fast unlike most government contractors he doesnt soak the taxpayer exseal and salert one of freemans boys rorke could see alicia hadnt heard of either freeman the retired general or frank hall oceanographer extraordinaire or was she still trying to find her feet after his subtle but unmistakable pass freemans a tough old buzzard explained rorke exspecfor warrior very unpopular in washington dc has a nasty name for bureaucrats oh then to show him she was no neophyte blushing notwithstanding she asked well arent you going to tell me no maam its not for the likes of you you mean im a goodytwoshoes he paused putting down the coffee mug yes maam you are youre a lady she was shocked on a sub shed expected to be treated as an equal by the officers she had a phd to make the point but a lady for a man who captained the most technologically advanced weapons platformthat is killing shipin the world lady struck alicia as delightfully oldfashioned thank you kind sir he nodded appreciatively ill leave you to your work he glanced at his watch as if in sudden need of an excuse to go well be heading through the juan de fuca strait soon back to base fine she hesitated then followed him briskly down the corridor thank you for letting me use your stateroom id expected to have to she was flustered again actually i dont know what i expected doss down with the crew now that wouldve taken the edge off them with that he was gone leaving her in the wardroom staring at the seemingly endless printout of telemetry she made a mental note that when she got back to the lab ashore she needed to do another security check on all her lab personnel a mandatory requirement for all department heads ever since hansen of the fbi had avoided such regular checkups to become the most infamous russian spy in americas history and it would be a good excuse to check captain rorkes file he wasnt wearing a wedding ring but was he engaged estranged it wasnt the sort of question you could ask the crew though it had been a short exercise patrol alicia toiling back in the wardroom with her telemetric data had become attuned to the slight variation of sound in the sub that indicated a change in speed now it felt as if the utah was barely moving are we stopping she asked a steward who was cleaning up the wardroom no maam were still underway but were entering juan de fuca strait its always busy but especially now that its fall hows that theres a lot of shipping he answered theres always a lot of shipping alicia said nonplussed as she put down her marker pen to take a break from the rows of oceanographic data its one of the busiest waterways in the world well you know its snakehead time asian smugglers bringing illegals across into canada and the us they try their luck starting springtime too cold in the winter theyd freeze to death in those containers its bad enough for em being locked in there for three weeks with other containers stacked on top of them and all around them the steward picked up empty mugs and swiped the wardroom table with a chamois some dont come in container ships try to sneak in on some rust bucket during the night with no navigation lights no lights period figure that once theyre through the strait and get to where it widens into the funnel of puget sound theyre home and away get lost amid the myriad islands amid the myriad islands alicia was taken more by the stewards vocabulary than by what he was telling her she knew about the ongoing problem of illegals trying to slip into north america with canada being particularly known as the softest touch in the world for immigrants it had harbored everyone from genuine refugees to nazi war criminals and terrorists but a steward who used a phrase such as amid the myriad islands was intriguing forgive me if im prying she said but have you always been in the navy yes maam from high school on he could see where she was headed hed been asked the same kind of question before i like what i do he explained im not really a people person in this job i know exactly what i have to do at the end of my watch thats it gives me lots of time to read thats what i like doing best aha she said smiling folding her arms and sitting up straightbacked against the bulkhead in a mildly triumphant mood it was a moment of exuberant empathy youre one of us im no scientist maam but alicia knew he knew what she meant and she knew she was flirting she was surprised at herself even mildly disapproving but she was enjoying it she didnt lack confidence in her job but she was essentially a shy person her white lab coat ashore evoking a more impersonal reserved impression that of the cool objective scientist who if not devoid of emotions kept them under tight rein that is until rorke had showed up and the g sharp sounded again man battle stations man battle stations chapter six heading out fast from the coast guard station at the end of ediz hook in port angeles into the fogbound darkness of the fifteenmilewide seventymilelong strait the fiveman thirtyfoot rigid hull inflatable bruiser bucked its way northwest toward the dark brooding mass of vancouver island six miles out the coxswain of the bruiser began a wide left turn setting a westward course just south of the linethe maritime boundary that divided the west to east strait between the us and canada the twin diesels jacuzzi propulsion system now at full throttle the bruiser headed into the swells that came funneling in from the pacific the breakers first landfall tatoosh island off cape flattery the coxswain and his observer though seated behind the steering consoles protective windscreen were as drenched in spray as the divingcummedicalmechanical technician and the two other divers rafe albinski and peter dixon aft of the platform they held their air tanks and other equipment while clutching the grab rail against the seas incessant pounding though almost opaque with salt particles their fall masks nevertheless afforded some protection against the biting wind there was little conversation the effort required to be heard above wind sea and the ribs bodybashing progress against the swells at thirty miles per hour being conserved for the dive which was always a tricky proposition given the often heavy maritime traffic the state of the sea and the strong currents in the strait fortunately admiral jensens request had come at the tides ebb giving albinski and dixon reasonably stable underwater conditions before the incoming tide made conditions above and below hazardous for both rib and divers alike the coxswain his observer and the technician strained to pick up any sign of shipping despite the strait being the conduit to seattle to the south vancouver to the north and much of the pacific northwest in between it was notoriously difficult to pick up the pinpoints of starboard and portside navigation lights given the sprinkling of shore lights on the us olympic peninsula or on the equally sparsely populated west coast of vancouver island besides in the predawn fog the rib would be virtually impossible to see by shipping traffic despite the light the coxswain had rigged atop the boats airfiltershaped radar dome seven feet above the stern on a reasonably calm sea day or night the radars sweep would pick up oncoming traffic but in this kind of chop the radars outgoing signals were often bounced back by high swells and covered the radar screen with ground pepper sea clutter the mens biggest fear was the presence of an oil tanker coming through the strait en route to washingtons cherry point refinery the quartermillionton behemoths pushing an enormous bow wave before them were incapable of stopping in under seven miles despite using full reverse thrusts and their props and thus obliterating anything and anybody in their path twentysixyearold seal peter dixon one hand on the grab rail edged toward the coxswain asking loudly how long longer than yours yelled the coxswain grinning in the faint glow of the instrument panel dixons response a short loud obscenity a half hour the technician answered my kidneys are rupturing put in rafe albinski dixons diving buddy you shouldnt have any by now joshed dixon a reference to the thirtyfiveyearold albinskis long list of gutjarring missions one of the most dangerous being during desert storm when albinski dixon and other seals inserted by low silhouette fast boats had sneaked ashore planting timerequipped explosives and assorted machine gun and small arms noisemakers when these went off the iraqis panicked believing that the us marines in the hovercrafts and other vessels offshore were about to land troops they called for reinforcements of them the seals colossal feint had thus diverted four iraqi divisions away from the real allied offensive it had been a tough exhausting mission but the truth was albinski would have preferred to be on another such covert op than here in the strait the thirtyfoot bruiser was more than living up to its name the crafts lower fiberglass hull and nylon neoprene upper hull taking the kind of punishment en route to darkstars anomaly site unknown to most surface sailors even to the oldtimers of world war iis corvette navy most of them canadian they would have recalled the constant battering of the sea against their small ships during the bitter doordie battle of the atlantic against german uboats at sustained periods from thirty to forty miles per hour the punishment taken by the human body was so severe that more often than not men came back from the highspeed cold numbing missions literally bruised black and blue to say nothing of the longterm effects on their internal organs ironically dixon and albinski were relatively warm the quarterinch foam beneath their neoprene wet suits having trapped any water entering the suit their body heat then warming this to create an insulated layer twenty minutes later as dawns light suffused the fog and began burning off the mist the coxswain turned to the two divers shouting making good time be there in five minutes doublechecking his consoles gps he told the technician make ready marker buoy checked that the ribs diving light array was working and quickly switched it off all lights working as they should the next time he turned them on theyd be on station dixon reached forward for his black attack board the size of a childs flotation board only heavier embedded with a depth gauge shockproof digital watch and compass a fourinchdiameter handgrip slot cut on either side of the board counting each kick while watching the dials dixon and albinski would be able to estimate how far they were going on their search pattern of the anomaly grid as dixon grabbed for the board the bruiser was punched hard midships in a cross swell flinging him against the grab rail the attack board clattering onto the platform thatll help it said albinski wryly abruptly the motors died to slowidle the ribs diving lights on after all this said dixon adjusting his face mask i hope we find something the rib technician was busy helping the divers with their tanks weight belts and the rest and the coxswain maneuvered the boat to provide as stable a platform as possible against the incoming tide but once the divers were over he knew thered be nothing to do but sit and wait for the mechanic the pitch and yaw of the boat by the marker buoy on station was much more likely to make him feel queasy than the bruising run out from port angeles in the next minute both divers checked their flashlights and spat on the inside of their face masks rubbing the spittle about as a condensation preventative ready to go over the starboard side dixon would lead with the attack board the crew of the utah were no longer on battle stations a sonar man having mistaken the sound of a canadian sub indeed the only sub the canadians had on their west coast as that of a possible hostile alicia had returned to the wardroom working on the torpedoes telemetry data when rorke reentered and poured himself a coffee hope we didnt frighten you with that latest alert i wasnt frightened he seemed not to hear continuing repairs to the subs diving planes changed the canadians sound signature as it egressed from esquimalt thats vancouver islands southeastern harbor she knew where it was it was a big canadian naval base full of obsolete warships shouldnt that have been in your listening mike sosus computers she asked i mean shouldnt the microphones have picked up the subs new signature murphys law he answered on the most sophisticated wp in the world she countered with mock severity her use of wp for weapons platform telling him she knew more than he might think yes he answered quietly defensively it was the first time alicia had seen utahs captain look anything like sheepish as he added canucks should have notified us perhaps they did why was she doing this she asked herself her tone with him becoming almost accusatory when what she really wanted to do was endear herself to him was it her professional curiosity overriding her amorous intent or was it some latent feminist aggressive streak in her that had driven her to the top of her field in a world still overwhelmingly dominated by men but she didnt like feminists in her opinion they were pushy and shrill perhaps they did notify us rorke conceded anyway he added tersely im responsible oh damn she thought no hes not but he was adopting the navys timehonored stance that whoever was in command was responsible if a seaquake which happened often enough near the juan de fuca plate swallowed up his sub he would still be held responsible as far as the navy was concerned im sorry alicia said hastily i didnt mean to imply captain it was the officer of the deck ray peel on the speaker bogey on screen coming rorke replied striding out of the wardroom now shed missed the opportunity to apologize she realized what had begun as a simple tease had ended in an absolute muddle precisely the opposite of what shed intended she knew a lot about telemetry but men whats your best guess gentlemen rorke asked his sonar operators each one working the scores of vertical lines on his green waterfall screen each wiggle representing a different sound from the cacophony in what most people erroneously imagined was a silent underworld whales rorke suggested shrimp distant volcanic definitely not a sub the senior sonar man replied the others readily agreeing its very weak sir but its there distant ivan rorke pressed meaning the noise might be the remnants of a faraway active pulse from a russian sub no sir not a sub no way very well said rorke his eyes scanning the arc of green falls to his right keep tracking it officer of the deck no change of watch for sonar men while were on this no change of watch aye sir ray peel acknowledged chapter seven the two divers fell back in unison the cold backward plunge hitting dixons forehead with the force of an ice cream headache in high summer startling his senses into high alert rafe albinskis reaction was more sanguine long experience plus his naturally more relaxed nature allowed him to absorb the facial shock as little more than one experienced during a dramatic change of temperature while taking a shower it was something which happened to him frequently whenever his seventeenyearold son dirk against house rules turned on the hot water tap in his basement shower momentarily freezing rafe in the upstairs shower where rafe would thump the wall goddammit dirk albinski smiled when he thought of dirk they were close except when he turned on the basement tap the attack board its outline surprisingly sharp in the flashlights beam because of the renowned clarity of the waters in the pacific northwest was already registering temperature depth and direction as the two divers began their search within five minutes of beginning the grid the fogfiltered dawn that had afforded them initial light allowing them to see the variegated colors of marine life passing by grew faint as they went deeper midway along the northern perimeter of their search grid dixon through dim flashes of silver herring saw the temperature on both the attack board and on the mercury thermometer built into the cokecansized water bottle sampler on the boards righthand side registering an increase of three degrees it was a big jump from the norm for that time of year his left hand on the boards side grip and letting his flashlight temporarily dangle from his wrist he used his right hand to scratch degree jump feet on the boards slate and pointed at the boards thermometer for albinski to see albinski was signaling them up for a surface temperature check as they broke through the undulating gray mirror above them that was the seas surface they noticed a drop in temperature here too of half a degree which they knew would have been enough to register as an anomaly dixon gave the thumbsup to the mechanic on the bruiser fifty yards away then both divers descended again at fortyfive feet they saw that the temperature had changed from three degrees at thirtyone feet to four degrees dixon tripped the water bottle through an arc of degrees both springloaded rubber stoppers at either end clamped shut trapping the water sample at that depth the degree fall breaking the mercury column so that the temperature reading now registered on the thermometer would remain the same no matter how deep or shallow they dived dixon scratched the slate board feet bottle tripped as they went deeper the temperature rose another degree though it should have been falling but the lateral dimension of the anomalous patch at this depth was small no more than twenty yards across the whole anomaly grid took the shape of a dumbbell about fifteen yards wide at its waist and fifty to sixty yards long the ends of the dumbbell each about thirty yards across they went deeper still and the temperature became hotter relative to the surrounding ocean the diameter of the dumbbells waist now decreasing to no more than five yards across from this they were able to deduce that whatever effluent was at work it was pluming up from the ocean bottom in a conical shape narrow at its source widest at the surface like a double ice cream cone albinski hypothesized that the source point of the plume was only a few yards or even feet wide the one thing they were sure of was that whatever was bubbling up from the depths its relative salinity compared to the surrounding ocean had no doubt produced the different color effect seen from on high by darkstar it was definitely not oil soon albinski and dixon were down to feet pressing the normal safety limits for this section of the strait albinski tapped his buddys arm signaling them to go up dixon was keen to press beyond the normal safety limit but for veteran albinski there was no sense in risking your life if people werent in danger this was strictly a recon grid for comsubpac and recon in peacetime wasnt worth risking the bends for that way you stayed alive lived long enough to collect a veterans full pension and noexception catastrophic medical coverage for you and your family besides albinski thought he had a damn good idea what was causing the anomaly the ribs coxswain his observer and the mechanic strained to help the two divers aboard the rib albinski and dixon streamed with water in the gray dawn like two harbor seals sliding over the gunwales the bruiser bobbing up and down in the increasingly aggressive chop find anything asked the coxswain as he turned the bruiser downwind for the run back to port angeles temperature anomaly replied dixon pulling up his face mask no oil though upwelling the coxswain asked freshwater spring cant tell till we do a chemical analysis of the water sample albinski replied i think its probably a water tank or refrigeration unit leaking from some old wreck not very big probably an old trawler something relatively small wouldnt it have leaked out by now whatever it is asked the coxswain no replied albinski the arizona in pearl harbor is still leaking oil from when it was sunk in fortyone the coxswain shook his head his voice rising against the brisk wet wind and the noise of spray splattering the ribs saltencrusted windscreen coast guard says they did a sonar run over it saw nothing couldve missed it countered dixon dropping his flippers onto the equipment slab a hundred yards either way and youd see zilch this possibility the coxswain knew would have been more than likely in the old pregps days but not now albinski and dixon had been given precisely the same coordinates as the coast guard vessel maybe it is a simple upwelling conceded albinski freshwater or saline from an undersea aquifer but even the coast guard sonar trace saw nothing countered dixon so how come we get a temperature anomaly and the cg doesnt that had albinski and everyone else on the bruiser stumped as the bruiser returned to port angeles the coxswain radioed ahead to base how long will we have to wait until we get the results of our water bottle analysis two hours admiral jensens given this one top priority its nothing opined the mechanic as the coxswain ceased transmission jensens a worry gut glass half empty all the time admiral gloomboots they all laughed at gloomboots a name that stuck for a full hour and fortythree minutes until the coast guards seattle lab emailed port angeles the chemical analysis of albinskis water bottle sample highly toxic and proof positive that whatever the source material was that had reacted with the supersaturated saline solution of the sea it had generated a significantly high temperature differential of plus or minus four degrees everyone was suddenly a gloomboots first question why hadnt the coast guard water sample revealed any toxicity even if the coast guard vessel had not passed exactly over the dumbbell zone and somehow missed a clear sonar profile of the sea bottom there the surrounding water surely would have been toxic enough to have been measured by a coulter counter that could identify minute parts per million second question were there any known naturally occurring toxicities of this type on the sea bottom in that part of the strait the answer to the second question was no oceanographic charts showed no wrecks in that location that might be leaking toxic materials albinski however reflecting on his long seal experience of invasion beach surveys was able to offer a reasonable explanation for the coast guard vessel not discerning any temperature anomaly its prop would have been churning the seas surface so violently he said and sucking in such a flood of colder water from outside the dumbbell perimeter that any temperature difference could have been so small as to be virtually undetectable given the mix all right jensen told duty officer morgan at bangor order a sidescan sonar the expense was now warranted for he knew that if greenpeace the sierra club or any of the other environmental organizations got wind of this anomaly it didnt bear thinking about and that very morning the chief of naval operations in washington dc had emailed a request for jensen to forward an updated résumé visàvis his estimation of comsubpacs liaison with puget sound residents the cno was doubtless gearing up in the search for a successor who rated high in pr skills in the same email the cno asked jensen to rate his own performance on a scale of one to ten jensen emailed that he was a nine he told margaret he believed he was a ten but it was prudent to show a little humility have our two seals go back and do a deep dive he ordered duty officer morgan morgan suggested the divers use frank halls oceanics vessel petrel ii the oceanographic ship had all the required equipment for a deep dive even loshok explosive to send sound waves down for its sidescan sonar should the sonars electric transponder malfunction plus petrel ii more commonly known as petrel was a civilian ship and a common sight in northwest waters a simple press release from bangor could claim petrel was moving farther west of nanoose bay where it was usually employed to retrieve practice torpedo debris the release could emphasize the navys zero tolerance for scrap metal especially the miles of torpedo guidance wire that since the thousands of practice firings during world war ii had until now been permitted to pollute the strait damn good pr morgan said the admiral and itll be the truth morgan added elated by the admirals appreciation i mean this anomaly is polluting have to clean it up precisely there was silence on the line admiral why didnt the cg water sample show anything the admiral asked this water bottle would have been taken below the prop wash that albinski was talking about faulty equipment proffered morgan perhaps but the admiral didnt sound convinced want the coast guard to do it again sir suggested morgan same vessel tell them not to change any of the equipment do it just as they did the first time a double check good idea the coast guard steamed over the dumbbell in the morning fog and took another sample it showed a threedegree difference in the water and high toxicity what in hells going on jensen asked morgan from his study his voice tired he hadnt had a wink of sleep since morgan called in the first situation report before the duty officer could answer jensen continued wheres the utah could it have anything to do with this no way sir last sitrep says that its heading into the strait as we speak over twenty miles to the west it had a practice target firing and one false alert nowhere near the anomaly the admiral paced his office gazing out at the cobalt blue of the hood canal and the wildly beautiful mountains of the snowtopped olympic peninsula beyond something was odd about the coast guard not getting any anomalous reading the first time around no salinity change no temperature change weird he muttered then the admiral had a burst of inspiration his voice suddenly losing its fatigue its an old torpedo morgan by god why didnt i think of it before leaking those two divers reported its a small source area right coneshaped yes agreed morgan damn torpedos buried in mud morgan thats why coast guard sonar didnt pick up a profile how long will it take those two divers from the rib to reach petrel he asked impatiently they would need the ships special salvage deeper diving gear they could be there within half an hour sir itd only be a short helo hop from port angeles to the ship do it yes sir whats going on margaret jensen asked her husband as he appeared blearyeyed at the kitchen table i dont know he answered truthfully less sure about his idea of the torpedo now sonar penetrated mud still whether you got a profile did depend on the angle of approach he knew about ballards difficulty in finding the titanic still god he wished life was simpler she slid the seattle post intelligencer toward him dammit margaret just once id like to get the paper in one piece after youre finished with it i cant find a damn thing she poured him coffee its probably nothing its something he said turning the paper inside out until he finally found the social section theres a good photo of you margaret told him on page two he grunted but turned to it nevertheless she was right both of them looked good though shed never admit it he couldnt remember margaret ever saying shed taken a good photo couldnt remember any woman saying she liked her photo something always wrong with their damned hair but there they both were standing next to the wonder boy gates himself its something toxic he told her how long before you know the cause she asked without looking up from the funnies tonight possibly divers are going down again to the bottom civilian research vessel i should hope its before nightfall he said nothing turning the paper noisily back to the front page china and taiwan were on the boil again beijing resurrecting the confrontations of the fifties and sixties when the pla had shelled the taiwanese islands of matsu and quemoy was warning taipei not to proclaim independence if it did beijing said thered be war the admiral shook his head the us should never have agreed to defend taiwan he thought if push came to shove thered be a war against china as well as the war against terror war on two fronts any militarys worst nightmare isnt that dangerous margaret pressed sending them to the sea bottom in those conditions yes ill say a prayer thanks margaret folded her hands and closed her eyes he envied her faith hed lost his long ago some commanders like the retired nuisance general freeman hadnt but even freemans faith was qualified his adage being love thy neighbor and keep the son of a bitch in your sights as jensen worried and his wife prayed the oceanographic ship petrel was casting off from nanoose bay and albinski and dixons chopper was heading for it to land directly on the upper decks helo pad chapter eight suzhou china over suzhou the ancient canal city of eastern china the morning mist and smog had turned the autumn sun into a hazy saffron ball but apart from this the october dawn had begun much like any other from around the algaestreaked arch of wumen bridge and the myriad hutongsthe alleys leading away from the grand canal came the usual sounds of people on their way to work the crush of jangling bicycles shouted greetings the noise of children and the sound of bird sellers the smoggy air was heavy with the vinegary odor of urine on damp earth and the stench of feng che the night soil carts mingling with the warm sweet aromas of the sidewalk stalls selling fresh mantao buns hot soybean drink and the oilfried breakfast twists of youtiao the hunched rider of one of the feng che carts passed an old man in a faded blue mao suit his chin stubbled teeth brown and crooked a homemade cigarette dangling from his lips as he sat on his haunches on the dirt sidewalk outside a dingy claywalled house a small boy emerging from the dark interior of the house watched the old man spreading an oilstained rag before him on the sidewalk and placing on it an odd assortment of screws small levers and tire puncture kits the old mans sinewy hands sifted through the bits and pieces like some aged carrion bird picking over a carcass now and then he made a strangled coughing noise took the drooping cigarette from his mouth spit wiped the dribble from his mouth with his wrist and looked up at the endless river of bicycles streaming to and from the arch of the wumen bridge as always the cyclists heading to the bridge slowed as they drew level with the old man for it was here they dismounted and began filing off to the right there instead of having to lift and carry their flying pigeon or forever bicycles up over the stone stairs they used the narrow gutterdeep troughs running up and down the arc of the bridge enabling the dismounted riders to wheel their bikes next to them as they climbed the stairs up and over the arch of the bridge down toward panmen gate high above the gate redflagged battlements towered forbiddingly over the crumbling ruins of nearby rugang pagoda it happened when a small boy one of the many children who were now running and laughing through the crowded alleys dashed past the old man and down the embankment steps to the right of the bridge for a few seconds urinating into the fetid green water he was unaware of the commotion that was beginning up on the bridge a clump of cyclists head and shoulders barely visible above the bridges stone balustrade began shouting gesticulating wildly down at the him gan kuai gan kuai grab a pole only then did the boy look up and out at the canal and see the floating lump gyrating slowly in the shadowed eddies beneath the arch at first he thought it was the body of an infant girl the infanticide of baby girls as common in suzhou as in any other province of china whose strictly enforced policy of one child per couple gave preference to males a crowd of onlookers was gathering quickly about the embankment and as they pulled the body ashore its sodden mao suit now an inky blue the head lolled down like a wet black mop some of the more curious onlookers bent low peering between the legs of others a noisy khaki motorcycle and sidecar pulled up its two traffic policemen in crumpled baggy white uniforms they walked over importantly beneath the shade of the sycamore trees ordering the crowd of drab blue and grayclad workers aside while appearing to move away the crowd merely moved around staying more or less where they were until a small blue jinlin truck arrived carrying four members of the peoples liberation army they were from general changs nanjing military districts th army and along with new olivegreen uniforms and medals for valor in tiananmen square and against the mass protests of the falun gong sect their uniforms sported the new gold shoulder boards of rank the soldiers bearing aks started shouting orders but even then the crowd moved reluctantly some sullenly to let the soldiers through one man well back in the crowd asked aloud whether the peoples liberation army had come armed because they intended killing more of their fellow chinese or because they were afraid to come among the people unarmed someone else incensed at the comment shouted that he didnt blame the soldiers for defending themselves these days another two of them had been found garroted in the hutongs in just the past week presumably by xinjiangkazakhstan terrorists or members of the counterrevolutionary liu si minzhu yundong the june democracy movement or by the falun gong as the two policemen searched the bodys sodden mao suit the four soldiers found it increasingly difficult to keep the onlookers from pressing in and the soldiers officer a young lieutenant told the policemen to hurry things up after a quick glance at the dead girls green identification card one of the policemen handed it up to the pla lieutenant da bizhi he said a big nose a foreigner the photograph showed a young woman eighteen years old five feet four inches hazel eyes and brown hair now turned black by the water the engaging smile of the identification card in marked contrast to the gruesome matted hair and bloated corpse that had just been dragged from the canal the pla lieutenant showed the photo to his gawking comrades announcing loudly meiguoren xuesheng american student he was disgusted it was common knowledge that foreign students and rebellious antisocial elements among the chinese students often had postexamination fivestar beer parties got blind drunk fell into the canal and drowned after finishing work charles riser the attaché for cultural affairs at the us embassy in beijing returned to his apartment in the diplomatic compound near the friendship store on jianguomenwai daijie he smiled when he saw the red light blipping on the message machine as he walked in hed insisted that amandamandy as he always called his daughter leave any messages on the home tape machine because the voice mail at the embassy which like all voice mail was stored on computer chip could be tapped at leisure by chinas feared gong an bu the public security bureau but because of the relatively oldfashioned message machine hed had installed at his residence the gong an bu wouldnt be able to retrieve a call once it had been made unless the they were actually tapping his home line twentyfour hours a day seven days a week but he knew he wasnt that important he said hello to mrs tse his ayi who cleaned and made dinner for him mandy had left two messages one that charles realized hed forgotten to erase from last evening which said she and fellow totally stressedout students as she put it in her wonderfully mellifluous voice taking a break from beijing culture and language university in haidan district had finally reached suzhou after a terrible flight on china air to hangzhou they would be in suzhou for two or three days depending on the vicissitudes of china air a later second message obviously from her cell phone given its brokenup transmission sounded urgent daddy wu ling loaded as usual told me chang a rush of static like fish frying then tralize or wes kind of deal the mill more static then silence she sounded frightened for his little girl as he still called her to risk the call instead of waiting to tell him whatever it was in person meant that she must have known she was being followed or worse that she might not reach home mrs tse handed charles his evening scotch and evian he took it like an automaton didnt say thank you something hed never failed to do before and ran the message back to note the time of her call pm he rang the beijing culture and language university our general office is closed for the day and will reopen charles riser tried to recall her teachers name damn he should have paid more attention to what shed told him whenever she came home to visit on the weekend where was she staying in suzhou all he remembered was that the students had to take a flight to hangzhou first because there was no airport in suzhou darn it what was her teachers surname but then how would a name help him as cultural attaché he was only too aware of the massive problem china had with surnames there being basically only five creating a nightmarish problem for bureaucrats and businesses alike one of the few ways overseas chinese had overcome this problem and one riser had encouraged as cultural attaché to the us was to adopt a variety of anglicized first names so that they became homer wong or irene li and the like at ninetwenty that evening charles received a visit from a gong an bu man who read a note aloud saying that the suzhou coroners office regretted to inform him that his daughter amandahe pronounced her surname as wiserhas drowned dead in suzhou canal stunned charles could only ask frantically where is she if hed thought about it for a moment the answer was obvious the suzhou morgue but the shock had hit him like a battering ram i do not know answered the gong an bu man who added after a few seconds offices will be closed now in suzhou within seconds of the man leaving charles was calling the wai shithe foreign affairs branch of the gong an bu using whatever influence he thought his status as american cultural attaché might exert the chinese government despite all their blather about equality among the people were after the japanese the most statusconscious crowd riser had encountered in asia while waiting interminably on the phone he was stressed both by the tension of waiting for the next official up the ladder to respond to him and by the knowledge that someone maybe one of mandys friends was trying to get through to him god almighty what was happening to his family first his wife elizabeth had died just two years before why charles never found out mandy then seventeen had been inconsolable all they were told was that it had been a hit and run at night on the raindrenched new jersey turnpike though running late to meet charles for mandys high school graduation in rockville elizabeth had apparently seen a car ahead of hers pulling off to the side taillights flashing an elderly woman slumped over the wheel she pulled off to the shoulder used her cell phone to call then getting out to help was struck by another vehicle the impact hurled her over the guardrail and thirty feet down an embankment a witness another motorist said it was a jeep that had hit her a jeep with a gun rack attached to the cabin trying to pass the vehicle in front on the inside crossing the shoulders safety line in the downpour thered been no chance for anyone to see the killers license number and given the volume of graduation traffic on the turnpike thered been no hope of a trace all that charlie riser graduate of yale majoring in fine arts could think of then was that it had been a jeep with a gun rack hunters guns violence in america all the high school shootings it was one of the reasons hed applied for the beijing posting after mandy graduated from college to give her a year or two abroad in another culture without guns the operator came back on the line no one from the university could be reached the whole of china it seemed was asleep the operator however perhaps because she felt some empathy for the big nose added suzhou is really under nanjing military districts th army charles phoned th armys headquarters and was told its commanding officer general chang would not return till tomorrow stymied he ran the message again he skipped daddyit was too painful and tried to concentrate on what he thought were the key words wu ling loaded as usual told me tralize or wes kind of deal the mill wu ling and chang were no mystery one of mandys friends wu ling was the mistress of general chang a man in current disfavor in the eyes of the chinese government because of a bungled highseas attempt by him and rogue russian cohorts under the russian general kornon to hijack the prototype of the us superfast rone computer the attempt had been just barely thwarted by us oceanographer frank hall and the former special forces salert buddies of general freeman after charles had been introduced to chang during the annual moon festival he discovered that changs mistress wu ling just happened to be enrolled in the same international relations and language courses at bclu as mandy no surprise every american officials kin were routinely targeted by the gong an bu to be befriended in an effort to gather information about american attachés spies in beijing riser knew of course that the cia did precisely the same thing to chinese college students in america whose parents worked in the chinese embassy and consulates throughout the us like his chinese counterparts in washington he also forwarded anything of interest he picked up at unofficial functions but his daughter that was out of bounds thinking about the message he wondered if or was part of either or or was or west northwest was mil military it was the first thing he thought of in the post world or was it a grain mill a meeting where some kind of massive trade fraud deal was about to be consummated ten minutes later his phone rang and he snatched it up it was general chang expressing deepest sympathy for your loss and promising the assistance of nanjings th army whose command included suzhou in finding the antisocial elements responsible for mandys death there was a terrible silence in charless apartment the home where he and mandy had laughed and cried and held each other when after hed brought her to china their loss of wife and mother sometimes overwhelmed them so you believe charles said slowly that she was murdered of course replied chang his bluntness at once appreciated and resented by riser this police report from suzhou continued the general is how do you americans say a coverlift coverup yes a coverup the suzhou police dont want to admit the murder of a foreigner bad for tourists suzhou depends heavily on tourists riser found himself nodding without speaking a wave of nausea engulfing him chang said forgive me for prying at this time mr riser but was your daughter carrying valuables charlie riser was about to throw up a robbery i mean you think it was a robbery gone bad somehow not that it made any real difference charles found it easier to consider a robbery gone wrong than a straightout murder suzhou says no answered the general her xuesheng zhengher green cardwas still on her but perhaps it was still a murder for money the thief not knowing what to do with the green card no matter that there is much more tourism these days the fact is mr riser very few chinese have ever seen a foreigner in the flesh and they would not know what the green card was even if they did they would have to sell it to a foreigner this is very dangerous chang had a point leave it to me mr riser i will investigate further thank you general perhaps he thought changs offer of assistance was purely selfserving after changs failure with the russian kornon to get the rone supercomputer the general was probably trying to rehabilitate himself in the hierarchy of chinese intelligence to prevent the kind of international strain the murder of an american officials daughter would undoubtedly place on chineseamerican relations relations which were never good at best and worse than usual right now because of taiwans evergrowing assertive industrial and military strength though unlike kornon he hadnt been transferredthat is exiled to xinjiang chinas siberia as punishment for his failure to grab the latest american technological breakthrough chang like kornon would no doubt have to do something spectacular to get back into the good graces of his superiors helping beijing avoid american charges of chinas ineptitude in the matter of solving the murder of a young american woman would certainly do the trick it might put chang firmly back on the road toward becoming party chairman head man of china in any event charlie riser didnt care about the fact chang might be helping him just to ingratiate himself with beijing the point was chang was the one party official who was at least trying to get to the bottom of it and for that god bless him chapter nine bangor washington state while admiral jensen anxiously waited for the result of albinskis and dixons second dive he filled in time with an unannounced inspection tour of the submarine base on hood canal instructing his driveraide davis to begin with the james bond house he meant the huge magnetic silencing facility shed built over water at the base of which the trident boomers and hunter killer subs entered in order to be degaussed this process wiped off their magnetic signature through rows of enormous electrical coils thus reducing their vulnerability to enemy detection jensen was also inspecting his bases explosive handling wharf another enormous shed built over water in this one the fortyfourfootlong sevenfootwide trident d missiles with their distinctive royalblue fiberglass protective domes were being loaded into each of two footballfieldlong ton tridents or boomers each boomer held two rows of twelve missiles atop each missile sat fourteen five hundred kiloton reentry vehicles each housing a thermonuclear warhead thus each boomer was capable of striking over a range of eight thousand miles different targets all of which could be hit from just one us submarine and each of these bombs was ten times more powerful than the one dropped on hiroshima now of course japan was one of the uss most reliable allies in asia and china which had once fought with the us against japans imperial expansionism was considered by washington to be its biggest single threat notwithstanding americas ongoing war against terrorism satisfied with the efficiency level at both the mse and the explosive handling wharf the admiral was driven the mile or so south along the shoreline road to the triangularshaped delta refit pier with its docking facilities for two boomers and room for another one in its dry dock jensen continuing to reassure himself that all was well as it needed to be for a prospective cno headed for the mange the deforested clearcut areas in the otherwise heavily forested seventhousandacre site where the stocks of c and d missiles were housed deep underground he worried about the vulnerability of the area despite the presence of the heavily alarmed security fence that ran around the huge base hed assured washington after that even though the manges were as visible from the air as any clearcut area in a commercially logged forest they were safe the protective sheath around the missiles was so far underground that no bomb not even their own stateoftheart guided bunkerbusting gbus could penetrate except a nuke the secure phone in his humvee rang it was the to noon watch duty officer reporting another anomaly it spooked the admiral though he took care not to show it as he waved nonchalantly to the skipper of the sleek tug that was gently nudging a boomer into position in the azure blue water that lapped peacefully against the delta refit pier switching to open voice so his aide in the humvee could hear him jensen asked the duty officer for more details of this latest darkstar photograph its in the same general area as before admiral a bit farther north in the direction of our san juan islands where exactly jensen demanded as his aide brought up the canadian hydrographic service scale chart of juan de fuca strait it showed the waters between the olympic peninsula and admiralty inlet to the southeast and north to the edge of the san juan islands exact position reported the duty officer latitude fortyeight degrees twentytwo minutes and three seconds longitude degrees and four minutes jensens aide punched in the coordinates and immediately had a red circle on the map depth reading plus or minus feet how big an area asked jensen irregular shape discolorationbout two hundred yards in diameter wait a minute said the admiral how the idea came to him he didnt know maybe it was the jolt of his breakfast coffee waking him up after the long night enter kelp beds location he instructed the aide explaining how such discoloration could be caused by large vessel traffic through the strait ships bow waves pushing brown kelp before it was scattered again by wind and current in milliseconds the laptops screen was pockmarked with brown splotches along the long western coastline of whidbey island north of hood canal and in the funnelshaped area of sea bounded by whidbey in the west and narrowing eastward into the long juan de fuca strait between vancouver island and the olympic peninsula still jensen was so anxious about his possible promotion that he ordered the coast guard to check it out and started imagining everything from a hostile sub being in the area to hostile antisubmarine mines being placed on the bottom which when he thought seriously about it made no sense for one thing there was the extensive underwater sosus microphone array the us navy had in the area as well as all around the pacific for another this second anomalys location which was now being investigated by albinski and dixon was not in the egress channel for his subs unlike the first location but to be absolutely sure he demanded that the coast guard do a depthsounding run of this new anomaly as well as a visual check yes he told himself admittedly it was a very small area the duty officer said it was a hundred yards or so across in the squaremile area but again he thought of admiral kimmel c in c pacific who hadnt been given the report of a radar anomaly north of oahu on the morning of december he called the duty officer any report yet from the deep dive at anomaly one not yet sir petrel is on station now very well said the admiral i still think he was interrupted by the do sir coast guard has seen kelp in the vicinity of anomaly two by god said jensen turning to his aide why didnt anyone else think of kelp beds before me davis the aide shrugged not as smart as you admiral jensen laughed the first time hed done so in over fortyeight hours you sucking up davis id like a posting to hawaii sir well youre not gonna get it they both laughed ahead was the explosives handling wharf at its apex two fully armed marines manned an m machine gun behind sandbags another two stood guard as line handlers in their orange life preservers as tugs secured boomer ssbn the uss will rogers into which one of the big white treetrunkdiameter d missiles was about to be lowered jensen was once again aware of the awesome responsibility he had little wonder he worried about everything from the safety of the missiles to the guards on his sub bases perimeter must have been kelp he assured davis though davis said nothing the admiral sensed that his assistant wasnt convinced which uncaged his obsessive streak once again all right then he told davis call the do have him send a burst uhf message to the utah and have captain rorke pick up a sample of that damned kelp from the site on his way into base it was hours when the admirals humvee pulled up at the trident refit facility it would be hours yet before hed hear anything from petrel he glanced at the forest on the other side of the milewide canal and the olympic mountains beyond wild and beautiful inside the trf shed there was no sub but a search periscope that carried cameras and radar sensors was being tested along with a smaller attack periscope nearby a boomers j scope was having its hermetic seal checked for any possible water air or gas leakage looking at the boomer preoccupied with thoughts about his own days at sea during the gulf war and the mixed emotions he used to experience on his way out from the base during the eighthour fiftyfivemilelong transit up through the canal and the strait into the pacific jensen didnt see the marine guard and his german shepherd dog coming around the corner of the building the dog suddenly lunged at him snarling baring his teeth jensen stopped dead in his tracks the guard jerking the dogs leash apologized jensen swallowed hard its all right soldier good to see you doing your job yes sir aide davis saw that the admirals hand was trembling jensens cell phone rang christ his aide walked discreetly away jensen the admiral barked into the phone duty officer sir coast guard reports nothing unusual they suspect youre right darkstar must have picked up a floating kelp bed they say kelp can act like oil on water smooths out a patch so it looks calm compared to the surrounding chop that would register an anomaly very well said jensen his voice strained everything all right sir inquired his aide yes answered the admiral seems as though darkstar gave us a false alarm that damn things too sensitive like the temperature gauge in my suv damn thing changes every hundred yards his relief after the adrenaline surge caused by the german shepherd together with the coast guards confirmation of his kelp theory suddenly gave the admiral a burst of confidence if not an unusually aggressive almost arrogant air during his inspection of one of the boomers exteriors he pointed to an abrasion on the subs anechoic coating the rubber sonarabsorbing layer applied to the hull to reduce the possibility of detection by enemy sonar pulses make a note davis i want that fixed yes sir not asap the admiral added and in his buoyant mood added his favorite churchillian phrase action this day yes sir churchill had been very popular since the president and his speechmakers having borrowed freely from the great englishmans world war ii speeches by the time the shotup pave low heading south taking sporadic small arms fire along the way approached the sundrenched airfield at tora bora its engines sounded more like a harvester shucking wheat hydraulic fluid was bleeding from its belly against the blue afghan sky and the snowcapped peaks of the hindu kush like all such snatch and grab missions brentwoods had been a secret operation but not now that fire trucks ambulances and padre were on code red and with rumors flying about the medal of honor winner having screwed it up the stories bandied about the camp temporarily put to flight the stagnant air of insufferable boredom that forms the interregnum between battles poor bastard said a tank gunner as he watched brentwood being stretchered through the blazing heat into the mash unit where the soft whirring of the airconditioning unit delivered a different planet to the afghan desert it was a cool place where brentwood fought the trauma team heavies who tried to strap him down in preop the morphine now losing its battle with the invading horror of consciousness a timedistorted frenetic attack on his conscience in which he wanted to rush back into the cave and save his buddies and then the shot of sodium pentathol took over the cave closing in smaller by the millisecond until all light was gone the monitors whirring and the periodic alarms of intravenous pumps were heard only by the trauma team in their fight to first save his life and then if possible preserve the use of his right arm they saved him and the shotup arm but the main brachial artery had been severed and though sewn up with over thirty stitches it was remarked by surgeon major ainsleigh that this captain brentwoods career in the military was now over lucky bastard it was an or orderly incognito behind his surgical mask possibly a reservist who had signed up for the adventure of weekend bivouacs and the few extra bucks not for fulltime service in what the ghanistan troops called boring boring their hope was now that the war on terrorism was winding down at least in afghanistan theyd soon get news they were going home back home where a sixpack wasnt against the will of allah where a girl was free to go out with whoever might ask her and let a man take off more than her veil chapter ten general chang was as good as his word calling back by threefifteen mr riser i have some information about your daughter he said as you probably are aware my niece wu ling is was excuse me please a good friend of your daughter yes riser said though he had never personally met the generals niece has she any information the general wasnt used to such directness in china one took longer to get to the point and it was considered impolite to rush but then again the general told himself if someone had murdered his daughter he would be just as impatient for information as was the american wu ling said she was with your daughter at the museum of opera and theater when she called you does she remember what my daughter said a little i think that is why im calling she told me it was very noisy tourists he added a lighthearted selfcriticism of his fellow countrymen chinese tourists very loud riser had the will but lacked the energy to laugh openly ah continued the general it may be helpful if you spoke to my niece is she with you yes may i speak to her now of course there was a pause as the general summoned her wu ling tried to be helpful but it was hopeless her english was poor and she spoke a dialect of cantonese not mandarin the official language of government and of cultural attachés and with riser unable to see her body language any attempt to splice mandys segmented message into something cohesive was impossible could he meet her he asked the general unfortunately we are in suzhou for the next week perhaps when we return to beijing we could arrange no now said riser i can fly down to hangzhou then catch the train to suzhou riser heard a rapid loud exchange between chang and his niece he had never gotten used to the din of chinese conversation at times it felt like being assaulted by a human ghetto blaster wu ling chang apologized is very saddened by miss risers death she does not want to dwell upon it i understand said riser believe me charles paused to regain his composure but i wouldnt take much of her time i would be grateful for even a half hour ill catch the early morning flight riser heard wu ling agree albeit reluctantly perhaps added chang clearly sensitive to risers mood we could meet somewhere quiet the garden of the master of the nets you know it yes said riser tell wu ling i appreciate it this is very kind of you general i wont forget it neither will my government the truth was his government didnt know about him going to hangzhou because riser knew there was no way his boss and the american ambassador would sanction a trip to hangzhou tomorrow it was the day of the moon festival an important allchina midautumn celebration during which cultural attachés posted in beijing should have remained in the capital not traveled six hundred miles away to the south no matter what personal reasons they might have besides china and the us were not on good terms as usual there was the perennial tension over the human rights issue in chineseoccupied tibet the ever potentially explosive issue of taiwan and now beijing struggled with the problem of the stansthe countries of central asia that bordered china they included tajikistan afghanistan kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and pakistan with their huge muslim populations in particular there was the problem of muslim terrorists in chinas far northeast region of xinjiang in that vast province almost four times the size of texas many of the terrorists were believed to have been financed by al qaeda charlie riser forgetting that he was still on the phone with the general was surprised to hear chang speaking it was a kind of absentmindedness that had frequently overtaken him since mandys death wu ling said the general tells me that your daughter desired it very much the garden desired thought charlie it was such a beautiful albeit unusual way of putting it yes riser said i look forward to it the thought that he would be walking in a place where his daughter had so recently been was strangely comforting and saddening at the same time as usual china air was running late en route to hangzhou riser irritated by the surliness of a flight attendant recalled how the nascent airline used to test applications for the job honest to god the embassy military attaché bill heinz had told him four turns in a swivel chair if you didnt get dizzy you were in it was the only airline charlie knew from a flight hed once made to xian to see the famed buried stone warriors that had landed the aircraft with food trays still down and not cleared on one flight both pilot and copilot managed to lock themselves out of the cockpit and drawing the curtain separating flight deck from passengers proceeded to bash their way back in by means of a fire axe he was relieved when he saw the early morning lights of hangzhou still sparsely lit by western standards most of them were clustered east of the west lake a long string of lanterns marking the sudi causeway which seemed to be running uphill north to south across the foursquaremile lake as the plane banked the blackness of the lake dotted here and there by the firefly dots of ferries and sampans after the gritty mongolian dust storms that perennially blanketed beijing and irritated his contact lenses it was the fresh sweet air of hangzhous surrounding hills that first struck charles as he stepped off the plane the second thing he noticed was the abundance of colored lanterns hangzhou would of course be required to celebrate the anniversary of maos revolution but much of the bustle in the city was in preparation for the moon festival at the hangzhou rail station there were no softseatclass tickets left envisaging riding hard seat jammed in with masses of cawking spitting comrades in a blue haze of cigarette smoke and shouted dialects riser told a taxi driver the price he was prepared to pay in yuan for the eightymile cab ride to suzhou the driver snorted as if the proposed price was ridiculously low riser began walking to the next cab in line when the first driver relented even so he wrote down the amount so there could be no misunderstanding when they reached suzhou ni hùi shuo yingwen ma he asked the driver do you speak english bu shuo the driver said shaking his head zhèci lüxing yào hua duochang shíjian how long does it take two maybe forty hours the driver told him in english grinning in the rearview mirror a comedian charles gave him a smile though he didnt feel like it the fact that the teeming life of china of the world was going on outside without the slightest concern for his daughters death seemed monstrous to him but part of the reason he put his walkman earphones on again was not so much to shut out the world but to try to make sense of mandys urgent staticsaturated message that hed taped and replayed at least twenty times and to hear her voice and yes in part to black out the teeming uncaring world to close his eyes to the passing fields of morning to retreat like a migraine sufferer withdrawing from his pain into the cave of darkness in drawing the shades against the indifference of the world against its harshness and unrelenting glare he could see her again hear her voice his memory of her and his need for vengeance were the only things that made it possible for him to go through these china days but he couldnt escape the urgency in her tone daddy wu ling loaded as usual told me chang tralize or wes kind of deal the mill he only hoped bill heinz could help at first riser had resisted passing on a copy of the garbled conversation to the military attaché it seemed to him like giving up something his daughters last words an intensely private thing to a stranger but maybe the appropriate agencies could make something of it since the atmosphere in the embassy had been as paranoid as that in america itself and so while not yet recovered from the mindnumbing shock of mandys murder he sought what the media called closure while knowing there could never really be any following your childs death which was when he had typed out a memo including the message to heinz chapter eleven at the surface the tough fiberglass kirvymorgan diving helmets that frank halls petrel crew had gotten for rafe albinski and peter dixon were a bright canary yellow atop the seals black neoprene dry suits under the suits they wore their navyissue clothing as they dove to reinvestigate darkstars first reported anomaly only this time they would be going much deeper literally trying to get to the root of the problem within fifteen feet the canary yellow diving helmets were a light pastel another twenty feet and frank hall his right hand wheeling clockwise telling the two adjacent winch men to keep lowering could no longer see the helmets his eyes shifted instead to the two blocks at the apex of the square ashaped derrick the depth needle on each block moving smoothly registering the two divers descent each of the seals umbilical cords consisted of a halfinch black air or kluge hose a thin communication wire and nylon tethering rope they had passed easily over the blocks wheel a coarse chalky white powder rising from both divers cables as dried salt particles were spat out by the uncoiling tether rope in the nether world feet down the two seals saw the high intensity light of their halogen lamps suddenly speared by a sixtyfoothigh forest of kelp moving in a strangely beautiful yet quixotic ballet parts of it swaying gracefully side to side in the main eastwest current other strands of the amber plant quivering rebelliously the rasping sound of frond upon frond faintly audible to the divers external mikes dixon though the junior of the two wasnt at all fazed by the sight of the massive kelp barrier which was so wide their halogen beams couldnt find a perimeter around which they might circumscribe the forest in fact dixon thought it a cool diversion and he radioed rafe albinski man thats pretty albinski agreed but hed lost colleagues to this pretty stuff like fishing line that could entrap divers hed seen this mesmerizing ballet of giant shadow and light turn ugly the vertical forest breaking up in intertidal flux collapsing in a morass of interweaving vines it could be a huge mesh in which men had became quickly entangled their air used up much faster than normal if theyd succumbed to panic and then ended up suffering gasping as hopelessly as a fish trapped in a net but they passed through the kelp turning their mikes volume down to drown out the irritating abrasive sound of the kelp chafing itself the immediate drop in the noise level was a welcome respite so much so that when albinski felt a juddering sensation against his umbilical air hose he assumed hed merely swum against an unseen stalk on the kelp perimeter and guessed that the impact registered all along the snaking air hose communication wire and rope to petrels compressor over feet above them then he felt a tug more like a yank on his umbilical causing him to rise several feet before descending again something also sent a shudder down dixons air umbilical but it had not been nearly so strong you feel that rafe dixon asked his dive buddy but all he heard was a faint noise like a tap left running remembering that hed squelched the volume button against the kelp he turned it up now he heard a roaring sound as if a dam had burst perhaps the noise of a bubble cascade picked up by albinskis mike so loud it would surely drown out any sound of albinski confirming a sudden and potentially fatal imbalance of pressure caused by whatever had whacked his umbilical and been thwarted by his helmets nonreturn valve automatically shutting off preventing a surge of water into his air hose the vibration in albinskis umbilicals communications wire was so intense that frank hall standing on petrels aft deck saw the aframes block bucking violently he could also hear the splitting of individual strands of the umbilicals tether rope throwing off droplets from the visible part of the tether line with such force that the shower of water particles hissed as they peppered the waves the tension meter needle on the aframes block was shivering ominously its point in the red overload zone hall turned to albinskis winch man bring him up dixons umbilical looked all right the fact that albinski didnt answer halls radio call wasnt necessarily conclusive because hall knew that albinski was a pro and might be breathing in air from his bail bottle the small onehour auxiliary tank that working divers strapped to their back but without the insulation of air that kept albinski warm earlier in the dry suit there was a pressing danger of irreversible hypothermia rafe frank shouted again trying to penetrate any semiconscious barrier that might be closing in on the diver the exseal oceanographer thinking reflexively to give the diver that extra shot of hope that sometimes made the difference of a few lifesaving seconds all right pete frank informed dixon were bringing you up too copy that petrels officer of the watch turned the vessel further into the wind to prevent her from rolling too much in the ballfreezing wind as the bosun referred to the easterly fourteen miles to the west captain rorke was overseeing his deck party including alicia mayne carefully descending utahs vaneless sail down to its base from which to take the water sample requested by admiral jensen it would show no unusual seasonal temperature variation confirming jensens hypothesis at least in his own mind that the problem had been currentdriven kelp beds the huge sea plants own salt and other chemical constituents causing both anomalies sighted by darkstar son of a began dixon abruptly cut off in midsentence during his ascent by the noise that to frank halls ears sounded like the sustained hiss of a water jet he heard dixon gasp flooding followed by a gurgled got it nonreturn valve closed thank christ you on bail bottle came franks anxious inquiry no im sucking my dick didnt know you had one riposted frank it eased the tension momentarily but why did both divers have trouble with the supposedly foolproof nonreturn valve damn thing should have closed immediately when water tried to enter the air lines hall raised his canvasgloved right hand moving his forefinger quickly clockwise through the salt air in the seamans traditional up fast signal to the hoist men both winches now singing in unison it would be six minutes till albinski and dixon were up water spitting from the aframes block and winch drum alike then suddenly both winches began to labor the umbilicals of both divers under enormous strain the tension meter needle on each winch having swung hard right into the red quivering the winch man for albinskis line donned protective goggles if the line broke above the surface under the strain it would come across the deck like a bullwhip were near overburn frank the winch man warned franks hand was still circling furiously then fucking overburn go till theres smoke he switched channels to the dry lab lab you getting this on the trace yes sir sonars recording well two suits in a huge tangle both hoses severed cant tell in all this kelp shit as high density profile as you can were on it captain the shift from hall or frank to captain measured the mood of urgency that had taken over petrels crew of sixteen several of them in offduty wet gear now that it had begun to rain coffee mugs in hand were gathering at center deck aft of the dry labs overhang from where they could keep one eye on the aframes two blocks and one on the stylus racing across the sonar trace paper the glacially slow reverse spin of the depth meter told them the two seals should reach surface in about five minutes a few grim side bets being made on dixons and albinskis chance of survival the onlookers tried to make some sense of the sonar image but like untrained eyes looking at aerial recon photos the black and gray shadings against the white paper seemed nothing more than that smoke it was dixons winch man everybody had expected albinskis winch to be the first to evidence malfunction since hed been the first in trouble but frank recalled that the dixon winch was older the winch man slammed his foot down hard on the brake pedal the ablocks depth needle stopped abruptly and frank screamed slower you idiot tap it given the enormous weight of the kelp that had wrapped itself around the umbilical such a sudden brake could exert enough torque to snap the cord as easily as an impatient fisherman jerking his line against a snag albinskis winch man was standing up now in his tractor spring seat for a better view of the ablock meter sorry captain said dixons winch man there was obviously nothing they could do till the block cooled a crewman was rushing out of the dry lab toward the smoking winch with a foamnozzle fire extinguisher no yelled frank get back in the lab christ thats all he needed foam on the winch drum soap on a rope lose the vitally needed friction grip of the cord against the drum try it now frank ordered dixons winch man over the agonized scream of albinskis winch now the sonar showed the two divers at about the same depth eightyfive feet a short dip in the ocean compared to the dives frank had supervised over the marianas trench which was so deep it could swallow mount everest with another five thousand feet of water to spare but right now the two seals though in much shallower water were in a much more dangerous situation a dead weight lift smoke now it was albinskis umbilical but this time the winch man pumped the brake pedal to a stop the winch hauling up dixon groaning the umbilical taut completely devoid of any slack smoke dixons line was overheating again threatening to snap at any moment the tether ropes strands starting to split ragged as the bosun explained to the cooks young gofer all bets as to how long it would take were now off if both divers had gotten to their bail bottle in time there was still the question of their energy nitrogen oxygen helium and air running out sir it was petrels second officer comsubpacgrus on the line they want to know not now the admirals asking not now chapter twelve nai hao came the greeting at first riser didnt recognize the general the commander of nanjings th military district had donned the traditional drab blue workers mao suit instead of his uniform wu ling also in the drab blue uniform looked on shyly ni hao replied riser extending his hand and nodding to wu ling the generals eyes smiled and the sparse apology for a mustache momentarily became a straight line his tobaccostained teeth highlighted by expensive gold crown and bridge work his breath so pungent it could have stopped the shanghai express riser wondered if his own breath was offensive mandy would had occasionally reminded him daddy i think you need a mint and since her death the same thing had happened after elizabeths fatal hit and run hed let personal habits slide didnt give a damn if hed showered twice a day anymore polished his shoes or done the other things he habitually did i am sorry the general said that the flight to hangzhou was delayed china air is not very punctuated punctual said riser immediately regretting the correction which many chinese particularly higherups like chang often resented as typical of big nose arrogance but chang laughed easily at his mistake punctyouall yes riser smiled seizing upon the generals good humor to get to the serious questions he wanted to ask and for which hed risked the wrath of his boss by foregoing the official moon festival festivities in beijing wu ling trailed behind them so deferential that it was immediately obvious to riser that she was not going to be the source of much helpful information in the courtyard of the inner garden riser suddenly had a powerful sense of déjà vu so much so that despite his impatience to find out what chang knew about mandys death he stopped walking staring at the lanterns and the masters study with its distinctive ming furniture he had seen this before with his wife but he and elizabeth had never been to china let alone suzhou together chang was still talking i wanted to meet you here one needs tranquility before he saw that riser had fallen several paces behind him the attachés face reminding the general of the british politician tony blair creased with worry lines that momentarily gave him the appearance of a much older man an effect highlighted by the bereaved cultural attachés uncharacteristically unkempt appearance riser turned his gaze from the masters study in the garden to the general yes perhaps you are not ready suggested chang for what obviously the american hadnt heard him to go to the morgue wu ling riser saw had tears in her eyes fighting hard to control her emotion no riser told chang im not ready but i have to i suppose quite so i thought the garden might give you a chance to revive your spirits first perhaps i should have arranged it the other way around no no im sorry i didnt mean to be rude but ive just i feel as if ive been here before with my late wife you are correct riser stared at the general completely nonplused some years ago the general explained this courtyard was copied in every detail and displayed in new york at the metropolitan museum when asked riser relieved by the possibility that his mind was not imagining things but merely remembering a real happier time his sunday visits to the museum with elizabeth and mandy going to church he used to call it the highlight of their week mandy transfixed by monets haystacks i think replied the general it was before your daughter was born yes charles forced himself to return to the present what have you found out she was murdered mr riser but i do not think it was for money charles felt his bowels turning to ice his doubts about mandys death had been difficult enough to deal with but confirmation of his suspicions that she had been randomly attacked he had to sit down on the stone bench and take a deep breath perhaps you should not go to the suzhou coroner the general meant going to the morgue yes said charles i have to see her can we go now if you wish said chang surprised by the energy of risers request coming so quickly after what had clearly been a body blow i want to get it over with riser told him sensing the generals surprise outside the garden of the master of the nets the general resorted to small talk in an effort to amortize the americans pain explaining to charles how the garden had been named after a government official so fed up with bureaucracy that hed decided to abandon his world and become a simple fisherman casting his nets charles appreciated changs efforts and he did understand how the official had felt how like so many he had yearned to be free of it all as he himself did now free not only of the bureaucratic world but of the world itself on their arrival at suzhous morgue wu ling remained in the car the building was renovated but still bore all the elements of the brutal soviet architecture of the s chang and riser passed through a small cluttered smokefilled office there were three computers but no one at them two of the female clerks staring at the big nose the other preoccupied doing her nails the coroner mr wei was out one of them told general chang apparently not recognizing him out of uniform it was the grim overpowering smell of antiseptic that first struck riser further inside however the morgue looked and sounded disconcertingly gay with moon festival paper lanterns strung all about and chinese opera wailing from suzhous chinese central television channel copies of renmin ribao the peoples dailythe countrys propaganda organ outdated editions of the shanghai star and several tabloids hed never seen before featuring frontpage pictures of nudes soaking up the sun on some unnamed southern beach were strewn about either there wasnt much to do in the suzhou morgue or it was overstaffed had the gong an bu seen these ideologically impure publications either that or they hadnt been here at all there was a short sharp exchange in dialect between coroner wei as he returned and the general an assistant in a bloodstained lab coat quickly gathering up the tabloids and scurrying out to the cramped front office as if by way of apology for the festive rather lackadaisical air or so charles thought at first chang walked over to the tv seemingly to turn it off but he surprised riser by turning the opera up even louder the high nasal whine of the danthe female roles played by men reached such a pitch that riser was sure he was in for a splitting headache even though he was more or less conditioned by now to the appalling noise pollution levels in which most of china carried on its business i like opera chang told him loudly while scribbling something on a piece of notepaper and waving riser over toward the far bank of aluminum freezer trays i particularly like this one the peoples justice do you know it no said riser so forcefully that it betrayed his irritation though hed no sooner said it than he realized that chang was probably creating what in the embassy they called an ad hoc special classified intelligence facilitya rubbermounted plastic bubble with anechoic coatings from which no sound could be detected by either beam mikes aimed through glass from outside a building or from fixed mikes hidden in the room the experience of having to identify elizabeths body still vivid in his memory charles steeled himself to be ready when wei pulled out the cold calicosheathed aluminum slab there was a delicate lace of ice about her hair worried shed be so cold charles gently brushed the frost back from her forehead the opera was reaching hysterically high levels and already queasy from the overpowering antiseptic a peculiarly sweetish astringent odor which he knew he would never forget he said nothing chang indicating the bruising on her head spoke quietly in english as if not wanting any of the coroners staff to hear say nothing she was tortured raped massive internal bruising with that the general stood up pushed the slab in partway and reaching up drew down a fifteenby twentyfourinch paper bag taking out a blue mao suit and a smaller jewelers packet spilling out a digital casio watch and a locket her personal effects one watch one locket you must sign here ah added chang awkwardly there is a fee i am sorry twenty yuan no doubt it was another foreigner ripoff but charles rummaging beneath his shirt in his money belt didnt argue he owed chang a lot more for telling him the truth i think you need a drink said chang charles nodded in a small pavement restaurant near barberrys pub café on liangxi road chang told charles ive found out more since i called you we think she was tortured because of a message she was trying to get to you charles wasnt taking it in unable to evict the sight of ice in her hair so cold and final now the general was saying something about stupid girl what wu ling answered chang ive told her never to repeat anything she hears me discussing with beijing but i guess it was a chang paused trying to think of the english word a juicy story about li kuan the general saw the name meant nothing to riser understandably given the fact that kuan was a common enough name either that or the american cultural attaché was still deep in shock at just having confronted the bleak reality of his daughters death she was had been a beautiful woman li kuan the slag merchant chang explained riser his mind still with his daughter looked across at the general refocusing yes everyone at the embassy knew about li kuan the slag leftover radioactive waste dealer who was hawking the deadly material reclaimed out of everything from spent fuel rods to medical waste with which terrorists could make a cheap radioactive bomb and not all of li kuans merchandise was slag some bill heinz said was high weapons grade material stolen from poorly monitored soviet installations riser vaguely recalled heinz telling him that some hwg material as they called it had been housed in buildings that lacked the most basic video surveillance all of which made li kuan one of the worlds deadliest salesmen whats he got to do with wu ling inquired riser wu ling and her bclu friends were having a drink at barberrys pub very popular among big nose students said riser wu ling went to the ladies room explained chang there was a lineup she overheard a student from xinjiang province its our most northwesterly province it borders on four of the seven stans kazakhstan afghanistan uzbeki i know where it is said riser many muslims in the area continued chang wu ling heard this student say soon the american and chinese infidels would pay for their ungodliness that there would be military attacks in the northwest you see the muslim fanatics believe anyone who isnt muslim i know said riser impatiently we remember yes of course said chang apologetically well these friends said this li kuan had done a deal with holy ones from xinjiang to taiwan that soon their wrath would be unleashed against america and china that the world would be run instead by the holy ones i think in english you call them the moolas mullahs said riser so chang leaned forward his breath reeking of black bean sauce wu ling told your daughter and her other friends riser could guess the rest the fanatic or his friend realized theyd been overheard and followed wu ling and mandy out of the pub yes but only mandy was attacked yes perhaps because she was the only american the terrorists are more afraid of americans than chinese they watched the iraqi war on cnn but i dont doubt they intended to kill my wu ling and the other students who might have overheard them but there was much confusion wu ling said many other students came out of the pub the assassins escaped by now they are probably in shanghai or xinjiang which meant riser realized they would never be found you think it was just beer talk riser asked about attacks in the northwest he was thinking of mandys frantic phone message the northwest of china or america chang shrugged what puzzles me is what were two muslim fanatics doing in a pub riser hadnt thought of that muslims fanatical muslims were forbidden to drink alcohol terrorists have no patent on hypocrisy said charles true agreed chang riser got up from the table ill pass the information on to washington good it may be nothing said chang but i will also pass it on to beijing the problem is mr riser we must be careful the inflection chang gave to we was clearly meant to refer to china not america i thought beijings policy was to be tough on terrorists yes said chang as they walked back out to rejoin wu ling we agree with your president but beijing must be careful if it were to attack the terrorists in taiwan for example it could be accused by washington of using antiterrorism as an excuse a pretext to take over taiwan riser nodded and extended his hand youve been very kind to tell me all this general i wont forget it the general brushed it aside if it was my daughter yes said riser more sharply than he intended but he was already thinking of revenge for mandys murder the scum had tortured her for a man who was his countrys cultural attaché a man presumably more sensitive to the finer things in life he was taken aback by the depths of his hatred by his seething desire for vengeance against whoever had killed his daughter but the more he listened to mandys last call to the fear in her voice its urgency the evidence of her courage the less he cared about the propriety of his thirst for revenge he wanted the killer or killers what would be the best he could hope for execute them the way the chinese did it a shot in the back of the neck no that was too quick chapter thirteen in beijing the us military attaché or ma as bill heinz was called was trying not to be curt he was naturally sympathetic to risers loss but dammit didnt the cultural attaché realize the possible import of mandy risers last message you shouldve told me about this right away charlie i did responded riser his voice echoing in the embassys enclosed security bubble i left you that memo before i flew down to hangzhou memo a few words something about a wu ling nor wes cmon charlie i cant send this to the agency theyll think ive gone china cuckoo too long away from the states how about the notes i left you about what general chang told me shit charlie dont you remember the flap in fiveohtwo charlie had to think military attachés preferring milspeak to english fiveohtwo may two thousand and two what about it said charlie jesus charlie heinz said more cordially what do you cas do all day anyway listen to peking opera before riser could answer the jest the military attaché hurried on may two thousand and two charlie congressional hearing on the security gaps before how come almidhar and alhamzi two of the pricks who took over american flight and crashed it into the pentagon had been identified by the agency in kuala lumpur as al qaeda operatives as far back as january ohtwo but we didnt pass the info on to the fbi or state department and how come the fbi itself failed on one of its own agents tips to find out why so many arabs were taking flight training courses in the us how come our own navy secretly builds research vessels and doesnt tell brother agencies about it heinz answered his own longwinded question interservice rivalry yes but just as often charlie its because people simply dont pass on the intel in time charles looked nonplused what im saying charlie is that soon as chang told you about those terrorists talking about slag in heinz glanced down at charlies notes borberrys pub barberrys yeah well charlie for a cultural attaché your handwriting sucks point is old buddy you should have called me on the hotline immediately like right away xinjiangs backtoback with kstan continued the military attaché meaning kazakhstan and kazakhstan charlie is oil three hundred million barrels a year most of its been piped to russia but thats changing fast chinas petroleum corp wants in on the tit new deposits in the caspian sea puts kazakhstans reserves to eighteen billion barrels that old buddy now remember this charlie equals threequarters of the uss total reserves so we want into kstan too cut our dependence on saudi arabia et al a lot of us companies have already invested there problem is among the million people who inhabit the stans there are a lot of muslim fanatics and not just al qaeda some of these terrorist crazies are stirring it up in kstan with one dirty bomb im not that dumb riser told his colleague no one wants them to set the oil wells on fire or the pipelines you let one martyr get away with blowing himself up next to a pipeline and it starts a trend you cant punish him riser said wryly if hes dead correct which is why your info from chang is red hot because its telling us washington dc that if theres any sign of li kuan who one of our specfor direct action teams was supposed to waste in afghanistan but failed heinz took a breath if theres any sign that li kuan and his henchmen are stirring the pot along the chinesekstan border beijings going to kick ass and take names and uncle sam had best stay out of it let the pla get li kuan and his mob so now charlie riser saw something he hadnt before that while it was nice of chang to help him cut through the red tape and tell him what happened to mandy the general and thus beijing had also seen it as an opportunity to use him as a conduit to the uss beijing military attaché thus informing washington that li kuan whod given this specfor team the slip was now headed for the kstan chinese border andor taiwan to trigger chaos in china and the oilfields but hopefully not chaos in america so proffered charles the chinese dont want the us to interfere should they have to wield a bit of stick correct said the military attaché oh in case youre tempted to get a big head about being the chosen messenger dont the chinese have been feeding us this line for a while through other channels not officially too much danger of leaks to painintheass human rights types whod march on the un if they knew but if changs right about li kuan moving to kstan we could see sma there any minute sma riser asked knowing it was the mas acronym for substantial military action but wanting his colleague to explain it in english substantial war cut in riser in central asia or even taiwan if thats where beijing thinks the terrorists are about to strike beijing still sees taiwan as a province of china taiwans a long shot said the ma climbing out of the embassys icb bubble on the way to the code room he was going to send this message himself charlie could still see the spidery white frost in mandys hair covering her once lustrous sheen with a web of old age years before her time if anything good could possibly come of her death maybe it would be beijings messages to washington dc via his conversation with general chang to give beijing a free hand against li kuan to hunt him down and kill him on petrel the afterdeck an island of light in the evening darkness was illuminated by the arc light atop the aframe albinskis and dixons umbilicals which had earlier been groaning through the aframes left block now had to be stopped every few minutes to clear kelp from them as fast as possible then albinskis winch man called thirty feet to surface a murmur of excitement passed through the dozen crewmen huddled around the dry lab only frank halls work party of six men including the bosun allowed on the apron of steel directly beneath the aframes block twenty feet to surface how bout dixon asked one of the deck party another sixtyfour answered the divers winch man at once grateful for the cooling that each kelpclearing stop afforded his winchs motor but worried too like everyone else whether the divers if they were still alive had enough air left in their bail bottles to wait out the seemingly neverending kelp clearance the weed at times so thick about the umbilical that it wouldnt pass through the block in sight announced albinskis winch man there was a loud cheer as bubbles erupted in an undulating circle of light that moved up and down the choppy surface like a sodden white sheet the rain sweeping over it steady frank cautioned the winch man sometimes in the excitement of a surfacing the winch man miscalculated the rate of hoist during the final seconds of haul in which a diver emerged from the density of sea his weight in air if the winch man hadnt geared down fast enough could suddenly cause him to swing like a freed pendulum smashing into the ships stern steady steady said frank holy shit it was one of the work party literally taken aback when instead of the fiberglass helmet hed expected to see what was emerging from the sea was like something out of a horror movie a huge glistening mass of kelp some said afterward it was the size of a vw beetle an exaggeration but it was big the enormous fronds looking like the tentacles of the giant squids that other oceanographers had found off new zealand as yet no sign of albinski dont just stand there bellowed the petrels bosun get the pikes onto it frank hall switched his mike channels sonar he asked what else do you see besides the kelp nothing sir were too close to it no definition just a big blob of kelp obscuring the whole damn trace four of the work party had thrust out their pikes the longhandled boat hooks grasping albinskis umbilical four to five feet below the aframes starboard block the men prevented a dangerous pendulum by using counterforce pulling the umbilical in as petrels stern dipped in the swells pushing against it as the stern rose atop the next swell two of the deck party were slicing at the kelp torn between going so fast that theyd sever the umbilical or so cautiously that theyd lose the race against what they knew must be albinskis emergency air supply in his bail bottle and all the while dixons umbilical was moving at an agonizing snails pace through the aframes portside block its smoke stops and quivering tension meter needle testimony to the winch operator that he too was hauling in a massive load of kelp you know said an offduty crewman standing anxiously by the dry lab they use kelp to smooth out ice cream the outrageously inappropriate comment was presumably the only way he could deal with his own mounting anxiety dixons winch man didnt bother to respond all his attention was on albinskis umbilical which was swaying port to starboard and back like a hanged mans rope the umbilicals thin communication wire missing the black air hose though looking intact good he said aloud what said the ice cream man his shadow cutting across the winch drum oh yeah amazing stuff eh get outta my light suddenly there was a tremendous splash astern foaming seawater cascading down on the work party swirling and running out about their feet through the scuppers with furious speed two men were sprawled on the deck cursing and trying to get their wind when frank grasping petrels starboard rail shouted bring im in slowly albinskis neoprene suit looked bigger than it should have been his helmet still obscured by an errant swath of kelp that took on a bright cherry color in the arc light mother of god said the bosun his tone immediately casting a pall over the deck crew frank was helping up one of the men who had been downed in the splash caused by the enormous ball of kelp that had suddenly given way under the pikes probing and plunged back into the sea in easy he said in a tone as gentle as the soft rain that continued to fall its shadows slicing the deck lamps light like a black snow the cherrycolored helmet contained all that remained of rafe albinski the tremendous sea pressures set upon him when his oneway nonreturn valve failed to shut had crushed his body expelling the ninetyeight percent that was water pulverizing the remaining two percent of bone skin and organs into a paste that was forced by the indifferent laws of physics up the ruptured tube that had been his dry suit into his helmet what had been his dry suit was now an obscenely bloated michelintireman figure that having expanded as it rose to the surface was disgustingly urinating from a hundred different pinsized holes two of the deck party had dropped their pikes and run back amidships being sick over the side for which frank hall would dock them five hundred dollars each if hed still been in the navy he would have insisted on formally charging them he knew that exseal albinski would have understood his fellow seals action by deserting the afterdeck albeit in shock they had left the work party shorthanded with a fellow seals umbilical cord still ascending when every man in the work party was needed in order to tear off blockchoking kelp that frank fully expected to see wrapped about dixons line in sight called out the bosun shit said the ice cream man this bastards biggern the other one fortunately he meant the kelp entanglement and not dixons dry suit which once the kelp was cut off was revealed unlike albinskis to be as formfitting as it should have been even so with seawater pouring off it it wasnt certain whether it was puncturefree it was only when they saw dixons eyes exhaustedlooking yet obviously cognizant of what was going on that they knew his nonreturn valve had continued to function properly as frank disengaged dixons fiberglass helmet from its oring neck assembly dixon was shivering so badly he couldnt speak his lips purple but frank knew the young seal desperately wanted to say something to ask whether his diving buddy was okay and if not why chapter fourteen when the machinechattering newsroom at cnn headquarters in atlanta received the report from its kabul correspondent of a bomb having exploded northwest of jinhe no one had any idea where it was besides bombings by terrorists separatists freedom fighters whatever they called themselves were a dime a dozen and unless an incident seemed to have any direct bearing on the uss wider world war against terrorism it simply didnt make the cut for the news but a professional sifter in the newsroom was paid to keep tabs on the location of all place names coming in on the media feed in the event that some outoftheway hole in the wall suddenly became prominent the sifter clacking away on his computer heard one of the anchorwomans assistants add kabul guy reports chinese troop movement along the border what border the kabul correspondent spelled it for her all these stans that sounded alike in central asia had never meant anything to the american public before the wars on terrorism in afghanistan and iraq such countries were ignored by the world in general relatively few people even knowing they were breakaway republics from the old soviet union along the border with kazakhstan said the sifter here it is put in another assistant jinhe some burg bout eighty to ninety miles from the chinese border with kazakhstan looks like its on the only rail link between the two countries us have anything near it the sifter enlarged the computer map jinhe was in kyrgyzstan immediately below southeastern kazakhstan apparently we have a big air base there lets see he tapped the mouse at someplace called manas three and a half thousand of our guys personnel the anchor told the sifter yeah right base has been there since puts us in range of tajikistan afghanistan iran man whod believe it most of these stans used to belong to the ruskies two hundred and thirty million more than one and a half times the population of russia now weve got a base there fighters transporters and tanker planes hey added the anchor during a commercial break russia is now a member of nato chew on that world war against terrorism said the sifter by way of explanation politics makes strange bedfellows the enemy of my enemy is my friend said someone else all right joshed the anchor enough with the proverbs how big was this bomb attack in this jinhe he glanced at his recessed computer screen our guy in kabul replied the sifter says it blew apart the rail tracks for a mile or so any american citizens killed or injured it was the news producer in the booth dont know yet said the anchor shuffling his papers ready to move on to the next item but not before hearing a staff member voicing his curiosity about the explosion being so large as to have taken out a mile or so of track within a half hour of the predawn bomb attack on the rail link northwest of jinhe between chinas far northwestern province and oilrich kazakhstan two chinese group armies men a fraction of the plas three million crossed the onethousandmilelong border on a threemile front northeast of jinhe each army of men with their own air engineering and artillery support in urumqi xinjiangs drab smokestack capital of million miles east of where the two armies were crossing into kazakhstan another bomb exploded in a mailbox outside the holiday inn killing three people and injuring a dozen laborers on their way to work early in the morning this bomb authorities suspected was probably meant to explode later in the morning rush hour as sirens wailed through the city the gong an bu began rounding up the list of usual suspects muslim separatists from among the muslim urghurs who made up million of the provinces seventeen million inhabitants and had always considered the han chinese to be invaders since as recently as over ninety percent of xinjiangs inhabitants were nonchinese but now over half the population were chinese sent westward in droves by beijing who wanted to secure the province in part to use the salt lake lop nur in the vast area of xinjiangs turpan basin for further nuclear testing the two group armies dispatched from the tacheng subdistrict in lanzhou one of chinas seven military regions met only sporadic resistance in the form of aktoting muslim urghurs the latter used red arrow antitank guided missiles which despite multiple firings whose backblasts and burned solidpropellant blossomed and crisscrossed in the dusty air took out only eight of the plas upgunned ts these russianmade pla tanks with their lasersighted mm cannons decimated fortytwo of the muslim rebels old russian mm ts whose threeroundsaminute and thousandmeter range could not stand up to the bigger bore sixroundsaminute ts and this despite the fact that many of the kazakhstanis old soviet ts had been equipped with reactive armor the terrorists and nationalists in the kazakhstani forces had placed high hopes in the reactive armor whose explosive slabs would detonate when hit by a plas t armorpiercing discarding sabot round but inferior manufacture of the reactive armor meant that it failed to stop the apdss tenpound footlong dart from penetrating the kazakhstanis t in kazakhstans new capital astana miles northwest of chinas invasion or policing incursion as beijing preferred to call it the ruling communist party boss a sullen prorussian leftover of the cold war and the soviet unions collapse did not join the muslims or the pla afraid of the deep and still active muslim hatred of russia and the plas institutionalized distrust of moscow besides the muslims made up almost half the citys population and the most radical elements were known to make common cause with chinas muslim urghurs what the communist party boss did do however was try to contact the elusive li kuan the party boss had connections with old comrades in russian nuclear facilities who had difficulty making enough money to put bread on the table later that day in washington dc the president expressed outrage at the plas violation of kazakhstans territorial integrity and said he had called in the chinese ambassador chinas two group armies were now fifty miles into the arid steppe of kazakhstan and kept advancing albeit slowly determined to rout every muslim terrorist out of every crack and cave the aim was to form a buffer zone between the two countries and secure the vital oil and rail lines between the two from terrorist sabotage which beijing said was clearly in both kazakhstans and chinas national interests the us state department and the white house in rare agreement were secretly reaching the same conclusion despite the presidents public expression of dismay the surge of over a hundred thousand chinese regulars over the xinjiangkazakhstan border was alarming to some of foggy bottoms experts but a state of open rebellion in china that could ensue should beijing fail to go after the terrorists was a much worse scenario as eleanor prenty national security advisor knew in every administration indeed in any government stability won out against chaos every time if you think yugoslavia breaking up was complex she told the president imagine what the disintegration of xinjiang would be like she paused to take out the map of central asia shed had faxed over from state there are fourteen national minorities over there she continued sooner or later amid all the muslim rioting wed be caught up in it because of our base at manas in nearby kyrgyzstan but said the president always insistent on playing devils advocate in his decisionmaking muslim rioting might break out across all the stans because the chinese have crossed the border granted conceded eleanor there could be widespread rioting throughout the stans and the muslim world in general but if beijing fails to act decisively and go in now after the terrorists staging areas itd be like us sitting still and doing nothing after that vital section of rail track destroyed by that terrorist bomb was over two miles long eleanor glanced down at her satrecon report two point six miles to be exact and all in one hit mr president not sequential explosions we have our problems with beijing the perennial human rights issues especially in tibet versus our prochina trade lobby who keep arguing with some merit that the best way to improve human rights in china is to trade more with them engage them economically beijings been careful not to announce its intention to cross the border because it would have brought out every human rights activist and no doubt the europeans telling us we should step in through the un and put in the chairman of the joint chiefs sam wentworth the last thing we want mr president is a war on more than one front afghanistan and iraq were quite enough for us to handle itd be a logistical nightmare no matter how small the operation im with eleanor on this one its chinas war on terrorism and to put it quite bluntly you ever put it any other way sam there were smiles from the other armed services chiefs i guess not mr president the chairman responded gracefully my point is the plas strike into kazakhstan takes the heat off us militarily all the way to the southwest in the hindu kush and gives the euros someone other than the us to whine about euros youre excluding great britain i hope of course said the chairman it being a particular point of gratitude in the white house that britain and most of the british commonwealth countries particularly australia had stood by americas side in past crises well then were agreed said the president we continue with normal expressions of concern beyond that wait and see the russiansll be pissed warned wentworth former republic and all that the president shrugged do they want to be in nato or not besides theyre no fonder of terrorists than we are they dont like the chinese but they want a steady oil flow stability thank god interjected eleanor prenty we had unofficial warnings about chinas intended move and werent taken by surprise the president nodded that girl riser yes sir mandy riser this country owes her a lot yes agreed cia head john norris who was ever ready to protect his agencys turf in the bureaucratic war spawned by the white houses push to consolidate intelligence agencies after into a new giant department of homeland defense but the agency had heard other unofficial signals of the chinese buildup in the northwest i meant said the president her hearing that this slimebag li kuan was working in kazakhstan your agency dropped the ball on that one thought he was in some damned cave in afghanistan were sure he was there mr president but he got out before we could nail him like bin laden well howd he get to kazakhstan so quickly norris explained that if li kuan had gotten to istanbul or pakistan he could have caught a pakistani air flight to astan in a matter of hours well whatever but it was that poor girl who gave us the intel that the bastard was in kazakhstan and we know now after the rail line hit that li kuans clients there have quite a conventional explosives wallop if he manages to sell them the slag for a dirty nuclear bomb were all in trouble lets hope the chinese get him yessir norris was tempted to explain that it had been the chinese general chang who had actually told charlie riser the us cultural attaché in beijing that li kuan was reported in kazakhstan but he didnt press the point it would have seemed too pedantic john the president said to norris how are our chinese surveillance flights going any problems the president could never bring himself to call the aries ii surveillance flights what they were us spy missions one of the lockheed martin aries had been shot down in april the crew held as pows for a while by the chinese flights are doing fine sir chinese dont like em of course keep sending up migs to try and intimidate our boys okay but tell our air force guys to be careful last thing we need is another international incident now yessir as the meeting ended the president heading off for a press conference asked the chairman of the joint chiefs how many men did we lose in that li kuan mission seven sir six special forces on the ground one from the chopper a medic during evac the presidents jaw clenched as he shook his head only one survivor then yes sir exmedal of honor guy david brentwood ex said the president yes ah well yes story is he choked chapter fifteen ten minutes after the president had given his televised press conference the switchboard received a call from retired general douglas freeman the george c scott lookalike who had been conscripted from the retired list to go on a sponsored goodwill tour for the troops in afghanistan the general knew very well that his ad hoc phone call from tora bora was definitely not the way to make contact with the white house retired officers even fourstar generals were supposed to follow normal channels like everyone else write a letter but even as a young officer long before he had become a legend and what was known as a perennial pita pain in the ass to washingtons bureaucrats douglas freeman had adopted von rundsteds advice to an upandcoming wehrmacht oberleutnant namely that normal channels are a trap for officers who lack initiative white house how may i direct your call yes said freeman forcefully general freeman here id like to speak to the president he knows who i am that was the problem the president certainly did know about the general who though retired felt free like any other goddamned citizen as the general once put it to give advice to the ceo who ran the worlds only superpower freeman wasnt an arrogant man but he was known to be as persistent as an m americas main battle tank the kind he had led during the famous winter battle in which outnumbered by russianmade ts hed ordered a running retreat in what was initially regarded by his men and an appalled pentagon watching on live satellite feed as a blatant act of cowardice the operator directed the generals call to public relations who in turn promised to connect him to a presidential aide presidential aide i dont want some damn gofer who picks fluff off the presidents suit this is a matter of national urgency goddammit ill direct your call to ms prentys office shes our national security yes i know who she is i gave a visiting lecture to her ir course at emory in vir ms prenty was unavailable would the general leave his number and a member of her staff would goddammit exploded freeman slamming down the phone two minutes later he called back it took him four more white house operators to reach the one hed sworn at shed sounded so young may i ask your name maam im operator eight general yes well look i apologize for my rudeness a long long silence goddammit she wants me on my belly thought freeman like eisenhower wanted patton on his belly before hed forgive the general for slapping a soldier hed accused of cowardice in sicily patton sent ike a damn turkey big son of a bitch for christmas didnt make any difference ike kept him out in the cold freeman knew he had the same problem temper but goddammit he took a deep breath us older guys get a bit cranky now and then sorry old or not generalthe bitch hed said older not oldits still no excuse for rudeness no no it isnt youre quite right then a short shot of his own operator eight youre quite right my profoundest apology id be very grateful if youd have one of eleanors people call me back the eleanor should help he thought your name again colonel nicholas feedman colonel operator eight heard an expulsion of air like a tire deflating name is freeman the tightly restrained voice answered her general douglas freeman as in land of the free and the home of the brave which if you want to help keep it free you dozy dame would you like her voice mail colonel ill call back old shed said he was sixty for crying out loud douglas macarthur was still active at seventytwo younger generation didnt know a damned thing appallingly ignorant of the past both geographically and politically he recalled the young woman on nbcs late show whod thought it was the french who had attacked pearl harbor and nbc hired her later as a reporter so how in hell could they be expected to know who he was about the stunning victory hed pulled off years before during the un intervention in the russian taiga a victory so brilliantly executed so particularly reliant on his command of the minutiae and sweep of military history that his exploit had fired the imagination of every soldier in the army one of those soldiers had been a young lieutenant called david brentwood who had gone on to win the coveted thirteen gold stars on the pale blue ribbon that signified he had joined the hallowed hall of warriors the elite some wore the medal easily part of a willingness to take life as it came to them others like brentwood accepted it with deep reservation born of a private conviction that in another place at another time they might just as easily have disgraced themselves and now freeman had heard that brentwood was here at tora bora david brentwood lay in the mashs postop recovery tent his right arm wrapped in virginwhite bandages his bloodshot blue eyes squinting out through the triangle of his tent door up into the hard blue of the afghan sky and the distant hindu kush brentwood had already courtmartialed himself he was too intelligent to wallow in the charge of cowardice he knew hed done his best but he was guilty of something any mission leader who takes in six of the most highly trained men on earth and loses every one of them plus the helicopter medic yes he knew the medic probably would have survived if hed been wearing his kevlar helmet which undoubtedly would have protected his head from the impact of the falling rocks david dragged himself up higher against the pillows his pajamas soaked through with perspiration theyd given him a couple of oxycodone pills three hours before but the pain that even military physicians who should have known better insisted on calling discomfort because it made them feel better was so intense he felt on the verge of passing out normally he would have been delighted to see his old commander among the visiting moraleboosting uso party but this day as he saw a humvee approaching along the afghan plain then coming to a stop in a rush of gritty dust that swept in front of the vehicle enveloping his tent the pain of his wound assailed the medal of honor winner and temporarily rendered him speechless when he spotted the unmistakable figure of douglas freeman emerging ghostlike from the cloud by way of compensating he gave the general an awkward lefthanded salute freeman wearing his afrika korps cap returned the salute with the familiar swagger stick hed been given as a token of appreciation by members of the british special air services he had known the renowned but publicityshy elite british commandos long before theyd unwittingly burst upon the worlds consciousness in london on may executing the perfect and dramatically televised takedown of hostageholding terrorists in the iranian embassy following the example of us colonel beckwith freeman had always insisted his special forces teams be involved in joint deltasas exercises in the grueling terrain of waless brecon beacons as well as in fort benning georgia to the bone i hear said freeman indicating davids bandaged right arm as he took off his afrika korps cap putting it down on the end of the bed he remained standing and unsmiling given his pain david found talking difficult and his tone was uncharacteristically apologetic one or two places he told the general splinters itll mend witch doctors tell me youre finished for combat thats what they think i need to get my hands on an he winced with the effort on an f freeman merely nodded his manner affirming nothing more than that he was familiar with the revolutionary belgian assault rifle designed for the new world disorder in which a soldier one minute might be a un policeman helping to maintain enough order to distribute food in some droughtravaged third world country and in the next be engaged in a vicious firefight with rebels the mm weapon had been designed to accommodate snapon snapoff modules for different situations and to accommodate these modules quickly and easily in this way the f avoided having many of the fixed addons that gave so many other modern weapons a christmas tree look there were other snapon snapoff assault weapons but freeman knew immediately why david was hoping for the ergonomically designed belgian piece the f was not only wellbalanced and easy to carry but was ambidextrous amenable in both firing and carrying mode the cocking handle being on the left of the receiver the relatively light less than eight pounds twentyseveninchlong rifle was especially suited for combat in central asia in this vast region where weapons themselves were under constant assault by the fine grit of dust storms sweeping out of the gobi and other deserts the f whose access points including its cocking slot were sealed was the natural choice it doesnt look pretty said freeman david thought the general meant his bandaged arm until he continued but its compact and does the job clipon grenade launcher thirtyround m pattern mag yes there was an awkward pause david ending it with has a fire control system they say is foolproof freeman grunted whenever they say a things foolproof youd better start looking for the fool david laughed but it was forced both men veteran comrades in arms using their natter about the fs specifications as a standin for the subject they were both avoiding it was distinctly unfreemanlike to step around painful questions indeed it was his unflinching willingness to confront unpleasant situations head on that had contributed in no small measure to his legend in both the military and washington dc the wounded medal of honor winner wondered how long the general could hold his fire started exercising asked freeman yes trying to cut down on the pain pills dont if they help you get through exercises knew a guy once would never take pills rambo type thought he was going to win the game all by himself but couldnt fit into the team wouldnt pass the ball uhhuh know the type remember wouldnt take pain pills cut in freeman not even a damn aspirin thought it was wimpy being a sissy out on an exercise one night up at fort lewis he got a goddamn headache from the howitzer batteries uprange mustve been a migraine wouldnt take a pill got so damn disoriented by this migraine saw the steps made so much noise going through the brush couldnt concentrate and gave the whole squad away reds nailed us before we could hit the kill house steps asked david what oh yes steps going up in front of you like a serrated castle wall its called the castlean aura a lot of migraine sufferers see before an attack distorts their vision usually the steps come with a background of green most beautiful damn green youve ever seen you take the pills then youve got a chance of beating the headache or at least reducing the severity the general stopped the abruptness confirming what brentwood had already realized you suffer from them general freeman the soldat extraordinaire or what his enemies called soldier eccentricaire nodded never told anyone that before strictly between you me and the gate post understood of course it had been the best the general could do in approaching the as yet hidden subject of his visit delaying the unasked question by dredging up the story of the man who wouldnt take medication and of how he himself was a secret migraine sufferer it was a kind of i understand pain too quid pro quo so now he could ask the question soldiertosoldier seven commandos in six commandos dead so what went wrong david you fuck up david moved awkwardly in the bed and pulling out his bedside table drawer with his good left hand unscrewed a smokegrenadesize vial and lifted it to his mouth swallowing two more oxycodone that bad eh said freeman taking the vial from him screwing the top back on dropping it into the drawer it was a shoelace said david cryptically shoelace you starting a quiz program what the hell does that mean you tripped fired your weapon is that what happened he paused blue on blue that what were talking about david no sir i didnt shoot my own men though i might as well have hey snapped the general i dont want any sniveling crybaby mea culpa poorme selfpitying shit whatd i tell you boys all my boys look at it square on youve always stood up taken full responsibility goddammit i wrote you up for the gong saw the president pin it on your chest remember but taking responsibility isnt the same as making a clear analysis i havent read the goddamn aar he meant the after action report im retired remember bastards dont let me see anything cept the damn uso schedule when some blond big tits is going to work up the boys so they spend the next week beating their meat stead of keeping their mind on the job all i know is that seven of my boys went out and six didnt come back what went wrong whatre the aars lessons learned were gonna be in this godforsaken place for years no matter what the white house says stuck here and in the other six stans same in iraq what can we learn from your experience captain david explained about the shoelace the damn german tenor how it was that jamal got ahead of him as theyd run for the entrance so that accounts for why this jam got it instead of you nothing else before david could reply the general asked you think li kuan was there i dont know general light was pretty bad didnt see any pockmarked guy but you think they were waiting for you the general pressed a trap david shrugged his legs relaxing the oxycodone giving him a buzz we spotted one sensor couldve missed others maybe tripped one the general nodded gazing out at the hindu kush lost your confidence davids forehead creased it made him look much older puzzled i dont know sometimes i think no other times at night said freeman turning around mostly replied david dont think too much set an exercise goal push yourself harder every day but dont use it as penance channel it for operation payback havent heard of that neither have i said freeman but itll come you heard about the chinese going into kazakhstan after the terrorist staging areas saw a bit on cnn freeman pulled out a khaki handkerchief and began roughly polishing the goggles he habitually wore in the region wrapped around the old khaki afrika korps cap a gift which like the goggles had been passed down from one of rommels staff the goggles made him look like the famed desert fox himself especially when he rode in one of the open afghanistan humvees standing up and using the caliber machine gun as an armrest that vibrated noisily as the vehicle sped across the afghan plain freeman placed the goggles around the peaked cap i still maintain an extensive list of contacts in the forces he told david keep tabs on whats going on saw the report beijings military attaché sent washington said a young american girl was murdered because she overheard a couple of li kuans al qaeda boys talking about making trouble in chinas northwest xinjiang given what the president just said on the box i take it beijing figures we wont object to whatever the pla does because itll be fighting terrorists were all against terrorists said david the beijing attaché says this young woman riser if i remember correctly amanda riser overheard these two creeps in a place called barberrys pub café in suzhou suzhou david couldnt place it about four hundred miles south of beijing on the grand canal said freeman point is that barberrys pub café is a bar david was ensconced in the initial euphoria of the oxycodone smothering the pain finding it difficult not to close his eyes and luxuriate in the temporary escape but he was far from what the units pharmacist would call zombiefied uhhuh he responded gazing out at ice cream clouds rising majestically in the endless blue of the afghan sky muslims especially fanatical muslims dont drink they certainly dont go to bars right said the general slapping on his cap and pulling out a business card from his load vest you need to talk david you can reach me at this number its the uso id have thought washington would have put you back on the active list they wont even return my calls still pissed at me about the first iraq war told em bush senior shouldve given schwarzkopf the green light to roll on into baghdad and kill the son of a bitch remember the old lube an oil change commercial you pay me now or you pay me later not going to baghdad then meant we gave em twelve more years to build up their terrorist networks and finance al qaeda you should call em about the bar david said his gaze held captive by the majesty of the ice cream cumulonimbus rising and spreading into a line of bruising anvils there was going to be as jamal would have said one mother of a storm over the hindu kush it would be an icy rain he was thinking about the barberrys pub café again general freeman was pulling the goggles snugly below the afrika korps cap as the normally reserved brentwood in a painkillerinduced devilmaycare tone one hed normally use for a fellow special forces warrior and not a general repeated forcefully why dont you call our military attaché in beijing about the bar i will with that the general collected his swagger stick soon as i get back to uso hq wheres that asked david tora bora replied freeman and gave a swashbuckling salute with the swagger stick as rommel might have done douglas freeman despised what the ss and other jewhating nazi scum had done but in the wehrmacht the german army there had been some soldiers of honor and for freeman rommel had been one of them david tried to write his weekly letter to his wife melissa but it was difficult he told her he hoped he could handle an f and convince them he was still battleworthy for encouragement he drew on all the impossible diagnoses he knew and which were habitually cited by special forces as examples of grit overcoming extraordinary personal difficulties adolf galland germanys top air ace had only one eye cheated on the eye chart exam how could he do that fly a messerschmidt and later in the me the worlds first jet fighter with just one eye he would have had no spatial perspective no depth of field and douglas bader the brit lost both legs in an air crash before the war they said he could never fly again not in a fighter old chap he did became an ace was captured by the germans escaped so many times the commandant confiscated his tin legs but davids alltime favorite was a man who had nothing to do with war but with the combat of the soul lance armstrong testicular cancer lung cancer brain cancer and he fought back to win the toughest race in the world the milelong tour de france five times in a row most americans besotted by football hockey and basketball didnt comprehend the herculean stamina and iron will that it took to be first among hundreds of the worlds elite cyclists some fool frenchman complained but e is on chemicals thats chemotherapy you idiot came another americans reply so dammit david thought he could sure as hell learn to stay in the fight to do what hed been trained for for now however his letter to melissa would have to be painfully typed out on a computer then sent to the unit censor since email contact with home had been temporarily suspended because of terrorist hackers whod penetrated the us armys computer network the physical effort of having to type with his left hand afforded him much more time than he usually had to think about what he wanted to say to her and most important what to leave out besides he knew hed have to lead into it cushion the news of his savage wound dear melissa greetings from nowhere this has to be the most forsaken place on earth god was punishing somebody when he made this sunbaked jumble of rocks and dirt our unit g tells us its about the size of texas i asked him how many square miles of water there are and he just laughed zip zero nada you see a tree here you practically die of shock and the people i keep thinking when i was a kid bashing the fridge to close it and saying there was too much damn food in there dad got after me for cussing and tore a strip off me for saying there was too much food how great it was to live in a country where i could say that poor doesnt even begin to describe the people here a lot of them havent even got shoes sandals anything had one of them a scout on one of our missions it was degrees just a tad above freezing and he had nothing on his feet least we didnt have to do that at he was about to write fort benning but censored it himself and instead put camp i cant like them though remember how all the media used to talk about northern alliance against the taliban well at the end of the day i wouldnt give you a dime for any of them most of them are still nothing but mercenaries sell their own mother change sides like they change shirts which come to think of it isnt a good analogy ive never seen one of them wash let alone change but you get what i mean no loyalty at all to one side or the other its all filthy lucre sort of like our congress ha ha on the other hand i know we have to be here after we had no choice but to hunt the taliban and al qaeda down and then go get saddam you remember the day one of our guys climbed up on husseins statue and they pulled it down and ill tell you one thing were going to be here for years and no matter what our politicians say we pull out now after having thrown out the taliban the creepsll come back from their hideaways in pakistan in six months and well have terrorist training camps all over the present government we put in wouldnt last for a week if we werent here look at the assassinations of officials since weve been here and anyway i dont trust one sect more than the other when it comes to any idea of reform the way they still treat women no better than baggage thats getting better now but its going to take a long time what gets me is the afghans say they want an end to war but the first thing they want to get their hands on is a kalashnikov its like northern ireland and all those other places i guess fightings become a habit sometimes i dont think they know what the heck theyre fighting for its just what they know how to do anyway sweetie these are some of the reasons ill be glad to get out of the place which brings me to the big news im coming home high time eh got some shrapnel in the right arm its slowed me down a bit so theyre shipping me to fort for some r and r you know some physio hot tub that sort of stuff before you know it ill be good as new back in the unit he ached needed to tell her how badly he felt about losing his men but he knew shed worry about him worrying and what could she do you can tell me anything david shed told him i dont want you carrying the load all by yourself honey no matter what it is okay okay hed agreed but how could he explain it to any civilian and she was alone all he could do was write the six kias nextofkin and knowing that theyd all write back to him thanking him for his thoughtfulness in writing them made him ill and theyd trust him all the more because he was a hero a medal of honor winner which made him inwardly cringe he signed off with lots of love to everyone kisses and hugs aware that he hadnt told her how long his rr at fort lewis in washington state and therefore their reunion would be at uso headquarters at tora bora where he could use a secure land line the general called the beijing embassy asking for the military attaché he was transferred to riser instead and introduced himself adding sorry about your girl son thank you general you wanted to speak to the ma hes out at the moment friendship store freeman knew the place overstaffed by semicomatose chinese salesgirls who were about as enthusiastic about selling merchandise to big noses for urgently needed us dollars and euros as they were about joining the plas reserves which had begun to decline as the younger cell phone internet generation of chinese became less enamored with the plas slogan of unite against the running dog lackeys of the right and more interested in getting the latest burned american cds general hes just come back said riser handing the phone to bill heinz who respectfully heard the generals concern about the muslims in a bar the same point general chang had brought up with riser and thus indirectly with heinz good point general i see youre sharp as ever i still remember your tipoff about the patriot missile but its not unusual for muslim terrorists to go to bars the ma was calling up his computer file on all suspects thought to be involved in the planning as well as the execution of the attack among them were three men who were at a skin palace the pink pony a daytona beach strip club featuring totally nude xxx naked dancers the night before the attacks on the wtc and pentagon huh responded freeman those fundamentalists sure get around town sure do general course those three suspects might not have been drinking unlike li kuans boys in suzhou guess not said freeman wryly too busy slobbering over pussy at the pink horse pony whatever drinking or perving seems as if theyre using bars and strip joints to fit in no doubt their religious sensitivities are offended theyre just whoring and boozing out of a sense of duty probably laughed heinz maybe getting a taste of the seventytwo virgins theyll get when they hit us again so the info from suzhou isnt suspect just because the muslims were hitting the sauce not as far as im concerned thanks for your time my pleasure general when bill heinz replaced the phone charlie riser asked him about his reference to the general and the patriot missile freeman heinz explained cottoned on to a bizarre fact that in a certain range the patriot missile could be accidentally launched by a babys scream freeman warned them they did tests he was right they fix it asked riser oh yeah real quick charlie riser was impressed anything he doesnt know yeah answered the military attaché how to get on with politicians and their staff too blunt indeed it was the generals prickly relationship with the present administration which was responsible for eleanor prentys delay in returning freemans call to her besides satpix taken over the darkness of the far western pacific were coming in fast and furious showing cluster blossoms explosions of light near the line of the south china coast specifically in shantou and other bases in fukien province both the nsa and cia had alerted eleanor but shed decided not to wake the president until she realized that the latlong coordinates of these blossoms were actually on the chinese coast the explosions caught by the satellites zoom eye were revealed to be in shantou dongshan xiamen and pingtan all major pla navy bases directly across the strait from taiwan sea scratches long white lines could also be seen through the intermittent cloud cover offshore the wakes indicating that the vessels were approaching the chinese coast then the red red phone from beijing rang zhou zhang the premier of the most populous country on earth urgently needed to speak to the president of the most powerful nation on earth eleanor buzzed the interpreter and the president himself and noted that it would now be early dawn in china hello mr president was the first and last english phrase the chinese premier used because he knew there was no room for error or the slightest misunderstanding his message a courtesy to the president was the same message his ministers for defense and the interior were now conveying to their counterparts in europe and russia the chinese mainland was under attack by the forces of renegade taiwan which was obviously taking advantage of chinas preoccupation with its northwestern terrorist problem to launch a sneak attack against chinas eastern seaboard the president had no sooner thanked the chinese premier for advising him of beijings point of view than eleanor handed him a decoded eyes only transmission both the nsa and cia were reporting that the nationalist government in taipei was emphatically denying that it had ordered any attack against the communist chinese mainland all right the president told eleanor but how about the offshore chinese islands the nationalistheld islands are within spitting distance of the mainland whats going on there every day the communists shell the nationalist island of kinmen with propaganda pamphlets and the nationalists are bunkered in a complex you wouldnt believe he took off his reading glasses dropping them tiredly on the oval office desk ever since theyve been at loggerheads chapter sixteen taiwan a typhoon alert had been issued at am the typhoon expected to make landfall at shihmen at the northernmost tip of the milelong leafshaped island of taiwan which varies in width from its tapered fivemilewide southern extremity up through its eightyfivemilewide waist to the northern end of the leaf where the distance from west to east coasts is about thirtytwo miles in the small village four miles east of shihmen the wife of fiftyoneyearold moh pan awoke in the predawn darkness foisting off her husbands groping hands from beneath their bedroll no she said firmly its time it was already five oclock a few minutes he pleaded no after after moh snorted after ill be dead you always say that she was out of bed and though the same age as moh moved with the energy of a much younger person opening the door her voice rose above the roar of the black sea if i had a mushroom for every time you said youd be dead id be so rich we wouldnt have to pick them moh turned away grumpily cursing the necessity of picking the damned mushrooms between five and seven every morning the twohour slot affording the right temperature and humidity for coaxing the valuable fungi from their dark sheds to their prime market size no more than an inch in diameter any later than seven and the mushrooms would be worth much less at the market in shihmen mumbling at his wifes rebuttal of his sexual advances moh who was a little hard of hearing now pretended to hear nothing she said blaming the unending crashing of the surf against the rocky shore a quarter mile down from the village that nestled in a small windblown dell at the northernmost end of the island the high surf there marked the tail end of the most recent typhoon one of the many hurricanes that periodically assailed the island and battered its spectacular east coast here enormous cliffs dropped from wild birdfilled skies sheer to the violent creamyedged sea absorbing most of the typhoons power in the form of torrential rains and winds which after lashing the islands mountain spine were less ferocious when they reached the more habitable and heavily industrialized lowlands of the west coast even there however the prevailing easterlies of the typhoons were still strong enough to favor taiwans daily leafletfilled balloon and loudspeaker war against the mainland a propaganda battle that had continued every oddnumbered day since maos mainland chinese having built the worlds biggest speakers in an attempt to outshout their windfavored nationalist enemies entrenched on the hills and coast of kinmen island the latters name meant gate as if made of gold for it was seen as the gate controlling the adjacent seas off the chinese mainland the island formerly known as quemoy bristled as did matsu with updated us patriot surfacetoair missiles the ferocity of the communists on the mainland who wanted to regain taiwan and all its islands could be measured by the fact that on matsu and kinmen the nationalists still felt obliged to enforce martial law and maintain the presence of their taiwanese troops so selfsufficient and selfcontained were these islands which served as early warning radio and radar listening posts for taiwan that in addition to enough food water ammunition and medical provisions to last months without resupply they even had their own currency as moh pan reluctantly dragged himself out of bed at a few minutes after six he glimpsed what he thought were metallic glints at the gray edge of the world about forty miles due north of shihmen at that moment on kinmen miles westward across the taiwan strait the military headquarters was abuzz with consternation over what night vision binoculars on kinmens western side had revealed was a flotilla of communist pla navy fastattack houxin and huangfen patrol boats heading eastward toward kinmen though capable of thirtytwo and thirtyfive knots respectively the communist attack boats were approaching the nationalist island slowly only to make a uturn back toward the mainland at high speed leaving clearly visible wakes of phosphorescence in the planktonrich sea meanwhile matsu hq was receiving frantic inquiries from taiwans tsoying naval base a hundred miles eastward which in turn was receiving urgent inquiries from the us state department and the washington intelligence community the latter despite their eyeinthesky spy satellites and other gizmology couldnt figure out exactly what the hell was going on walking to market pulling the cart full of mushrooms moh pan looked north again to see whether he could see any ships or had it been the glint of aircraft perhaps he should call shihmens civil defense office do you have your cell he asked his wife batterys dead she answered you forgot to recharge of course he countered and i suppose im to blame for the typhoon too she refused to answer he just wanted to start a fight he was giving her the evil eye paying no attention his wife tightened her scarf against the rising wind on kinmen where moh pans son ahmao was doing his national guard service in the army the nationalist garrison was completely nonplused did the sudden maneuvering by the communists patrol boats presage an attack or were the communists merely taunting the taiwanese as they had so many times during their socalled military maneuvers using elements of their pla navy and pla air force fighters mere seconds from matsu and kinmen and only eight minutes from taiwan itself such maneuvers in this case by attack patrol boats from chinas east fleet were no doubt designed not only to rattle the nerves of the nationalists but to serve as a constant reminder to the taiwanese that beijing believed taiwan was nothing more than a renegade province that sooner rather than later would be forced to rejoin the communist mainland and on that day taiwan would be forced to give beijing back the enormous treasure chiang kaishek mao tse tungs mortal enemy had taken with him and his nationalist army across the straits in beijing had been encouraged since in its dream of reunification when us aid to taiwan and us recognition of taiwan as an independent nation ended and then a year later in when the ustaiwan national defense treaty died even so every president from harry truman who despite his reservations about chiang kaishek whom he called cash my checkto bill clinton in had at times dispatched a cbg carrier battle group up into the taiwan strait to keep the uneasy peace between the two antagonists and now the president and his advisors thought it prudent to repeat his predecessors cautionary move as one of the first questions every president asked in times of impending crisis was where are the carriers the carriers thought to be outmoded in twentyfirstcentury war were floating us air bases that were now more important than ever before given the number of us overseas bases that had been closed once the cold war had ended a war in which the us like the soviet union had made many an unsavory deal with a tin pot dictator in order to prevent one another from gaining an advantage in the others hemisphere the current occupant of the white house had quickly discovered that in the war on terrorism which involved so many different flashpoints even the might of the us navy was stretched thin americas twelve cbgs were spread far and wide standing off the powder keg of the middle eastafghanistan iran as well as the new iraq to say nothing of the farflung us missions to combat terrorists and their myriad bases throughout central and south america and amid thousands of islands of the indonesian and philippine archipelagos then there were missions in pakistan and throughout the africas where american citizens were being kidnapped murdered or threatened in all this the carriers served as standins for all the land bases the united states had lost in post cold war client countries that now felt they could go it alone especially troublesome to the us navy however was the loss of the huge complex at subic bay in the philippines and so it was that this president with a mandate to continue waging the war on terrorism until the terrorists were beaten knew more than any president since jfk about where his twelve carrier groups were at any one time eleanor all of our carriers are overextended the president said over the phone do we have any available in dock she didnt know a quick call to the cnos office in washington the transit coding causing a delay of only seconds gave her the answer there was one in bremerton washington states big maintenance yard it was the uss turner a nimitzc class flat top a nuclear aviation carrier the turner the president nodded western pacific fleet yes sir in for overhaul whats its completion date eleanor phone still in hand relayed the question to cno then informed the president estimated time of completion five days the president shook his head no tell them theyve got twentyfour hours i want the turner to join the mccain which i believe he brought up the cnos map on his computer screen yes theres the mccain south china sea i want mccain to steam north to the taiwan strait asap and it was so ordered the mccain would steam north immediately the turner to leave washington state in the pacific northwest within twentyfour hours the turners co didnt like that mr president proffered eleanor said its almost impossible to speed up overhaul from five days to one he doesnt have to like it he only has to do it yes sir get me the mccains co growly admiral crowley eleanor reminded him diplomatically no growly riposted the president always bitching about how much more we give the other armed forces hes a pain in the butt like freeman put in eleanors junior aide exactly but freemans retired thank god replied the president overhearing know their jobs though said eleanor prenty giving her junior aide who looked ready to join in the dissing of freeman and crowley a withering look it told the aide he had best hold his tongue though eleanor realized she was being hypocritical shed not only ignored freemans phone message to call him shed forgotten all about it freeman despite his legendary status among military types was regarded as a hasbeen and the truth was he had no political clout at all in short he was of no consequence to the administrations agenda you through to mccain the president asked impatiently not yet she replied the image of the nimitzclass carrier in her minds eye the carrier was named after the vietnam hero senator john mccain who after being shot down by north vietnamese communists being held prisoner and tortured in the hanoi hilton for years would not cave in dragged out in front of the blinding tv lights in hanoi with other american prisoners as communist propaganda mccain was blinking so much that it looked as if he might have a damaged retina in fact his apparent affliction was the personification of defiant cool his blinking a morse code message to those at home watching that what the communists were saying was a load of bs admiral crowley was now on the line his voice gruff as usual he had to respect his commander in chief but he detested politicians admiral said the president heartily scrolling down crowleys file on screen in front of him hows your boy richard doing must be his final year at annapolis yes sir came the admirals reply has his heart set on fallon i hear continued the president fallon was the top gun school in the nevada desert well answered the admiral hell have to learn to walk before he can run im sure hell make it the president said adding main thing is admiral hes following his passion we parents cant hope for much more than that true admiral theres some kafuffle up in the taiwan strait what were getting from beijing and taiwan is they started it first not me stuff you no doubt have been getting the traffic commies are accusing taiwanese marines of going after one of their offshore islands taiwan denies it taiwanese are accusing chinese communist patrol boats of going for one of their islands thats it now i want you to take the mccain up there and put yourself between those two our other carrier groups as you know have their hands full at the moment exactly said crowley sternly was there an implicit criticism of the white houses failure to push congress for more naval appropriations in his tone it was difficult to tell he was normally gruff yes said the president noncommittally well admiral were already fighting world war three against terrorists around the globe the last thing we need is war on another front we have to be extraordinarily careful i know the drill mr president fire only in selfdefense no preemptive strikes youve got it admiral beijings terrified of any revolt that might spread thats why theyre so down on these falun gong groups et cetera theyre afraid of a chain reaction a repetition of tiananmen square spreading through china like wildfire particularly now after beijings had to loosen its grip somewhat and allow some budding capitalism theyre afraid they wont be able to keep control of it ive got the picture mr president crowley assured him somewhat impatiently crowley like freeman had a distinguished combat record and their bluntness belonged more to the tradition of admiral bill halsey and george patton than to the kind of diplomatic expertise required in a multinuclearpower age where the intemperate remarks of indian and pakistani politicians about each other for example had taken everyone to the brink high up in the mccains island that overlooked the carriers four and half acres of deck the diminutive crowley who at just over five feet had barely made it into the navy put down the phone the admiral was under no illusion that the president had been prompted by an aide probably about his sons expectations for top gun still it was nice the admiral would never ask for special favors from the president that was strictly against his code but hell it didnt do any harm that the commander in chief of the most powerful nation on earth knew your sons name and where he wanted to go the sun was losing altitude in the south china sea a grand illusion as the world turned the six thousand men and women who crewed the mccain and her air wing hearing the pipe sounding now darken ship hundreds of miles to the north of the mccain in shihmen on the northern tip of taiwan moh pan bent low against the advance force eight winds of what had now been officially tagged as typhoon jane inside the civil defense office moh waited patiently for his turn to speak to the female clerk a knockout from taipei her ashblack hair pulled back tightly passing through a silver clasp her smile revealed the most beautiful teeth moh had ever seen in a woman and her figure was so magnificently proportioned like the singer chyi yu that he welcomed the wait in fact he insisted an elderly woman from his village go before him he knew his wife would have insisted he demand instant service his sighting of possible enemy ships or aircraft off the north shore possibly signs of yet another mainland chinese incursion into taiwanese sea and air space of course moh told himself they could have been taiwanese ships or aircraft but it was wonderful standing here just watching the young clerk breathe when his turn came to report it would be important he advised himself to be thorough not to rush perhaps in the interests of taiwans national security he should show her on a map approximately where it was off the coast he had seen these glintsask to see a highscale map of the region a pictorial accompaniment to his verbal report a chance to demonstrate what everyone had always said about him that he should have been an illustrator for the law courts in taipei where photographs of the accused were forbidden and readers had to rely on stilllife sketches of the accused or victim perhaps she would like him to do a sketch of her in a few strokes he could capture the essential aspects of the face moh felt himself becoming aroused he noticed a young couple in from his neighboring village sniggering at him the girl cupping her hand in front of her mouth whispering to her boyfriend then trying unsuccessfully to stop her giggling moh saw the boyfriend staring at him saying something which sent the girl into another fit of giggles the boyfriend sniffing the air as if there was something malodorous in the room moh realized they were probably laughing at the smell of the fungi fertilizer the couple looking down on him in his overalls as if he was a pig farmer the two idiots didnt deserve defending he thought he had a good mind to forget it to walk out but he stayed and not just to enjoy the sight of the pretty clerk hed do it for his son stationed on kinmen and for all the other young men and women who were worth defending and who were putting their lives on the line still it irked him the couple were the kind of collegeeducated yuppies whom mao had sent out to the countryside during the cultural revolution and made work the communes puncturing their arrogant selfassurance with real labor so theyd respect those whod built the revolution moh didnt like the communists but sometimes anger had overtaken his normal passivity but now the loyal mushroom grower concentrated on the girls breathing again his eyes closed from fatigue and the fantasy of having her in the dark cool shed from outside a gust of galeforce wind rattled the office door she would cling to him frightened of the storm the howling winds the electricblue lightning crashing around them and hed hold her comforting her telling her all would be well by the time moh pan reached the civil defense counter his fantasies about the beautiful clerk had been sabotaged by the young couple sniggering at the smell of his work clothes when he reported to the clerk that hed seen some kind of aircraft or ships off the north cape any confidence he might have had that they were chinese communists evaporated she thanked him for the information and gave him a smile but there was nothing remotely sexual in it merely a young womans courtesy toward an older man he was old enough to be her father his son ahmao on kinmen young enough to be her husband moh felt dejected immeasurably old exacerbated by the feeling that the world had passed him by outside a gust hit him with such force it blew him back against the glass rattling its frame now he wanted to go back to the mushroom sheds for refuge he saw his wife coming out of the market crowd counting her money the red currency startlingly vibrant against the nondescript gray of the town square did you tell them she asked perfunctorily without looking up from the bunch of hundreds yes what did they say nothing you have to recharge your cell yes moh pan agreed obediently if his cell had been charged he wouldnt have had to walk all the way into town and get a chance to see the young beauty they were probably ours anyway said his wife stuffing the money into her purse the sea wind billowing her scarf yes agreed moh pan a big waste of time trudging into town chapter seventeen after helping his deckhands extract what had been albinskis dry suit now looking like a black flattened toothpaste tube oceanographer frank hall decided he had to take a core from the sea bottom see if a hot vents plume of superheated water was responsible for the kind of turbulence that would have fatally loosened the two divers air hoses and twisted the kelp around the umbilicals young peter dixon wheyfaced being sick in one of the dry lab buckets didnt hear the exsealcumoceanographer approaching the bright island of the sterns deck lights seeing only franks shadow looming over him wheres albinskis attack board bud he asked dixon putting his arm on the young divers shoulder dixon looked up from the bucket wiping his mouth as if he hadnt heard the petrels captain or rather that hed heard him but couldnt believe the mans insensitivity piss off frank understood but he was captain he shouldnt couldnt let his emotion cloud the issue i need to see what the temperature variant was down there it could tell us whether a sudden release of vent pressure or whatever had anything to do with it whats the difference man hes dead youre not dixon was supposed to be a seal not a baby wheres the board guess its over there said dixon indicating the shining pile of brown vegetation beneath the aframe where the long tendrils of kelp had been cut away from what had been albinskis dry suit frank gingerly extracted the attack board from the pile of waterslicked tendrils cut the nylon fishing line by which it had been attached to albinskis arms and handed it up to the bosun mother of began the bosun in shock scrawled on the attack boards slate was one word minisub frank strode to the decks intercom mike midway between the winches bridge bridge here go ahead call comsubpac urgent send chopper immediately next frank turned to the bosun assemble the crew dry lab everyone except watch personnel it wasnt until the bosun saw frank working the tumblers on the dry labs safe that he realized why hall hadnt ordered the bridge to transmit the discovery of a hostile minisub in american waters directly to comsubpac jensen the petrel as a civilian vessel though contracted by the navy and using a navy transport helo in its hangar had no coding computers aboard and anyone could have picked up a plain language transmit including those aboard the hostile the helo would have to take the message this delay in getting the message to admiral jensen by chopper was to prove fatal however in retrospect to some critics it was far more damaging to the united states in the near future than the not so sensible delay caused by the decision in december to send the warning of an imminent attack on pearl harbor to admiral kimmel by telegram in the next hour the president let it be known publicly via the tv and cable networks that in order to calm down the rhetoric betweenhe had wanted to say between china and taiwan but eleanor prenty convinced him to change it the peoples republic of china and the people of taiwan he had dispatched elements of the th fleet to the taiwan strait the mccainand that because of commitments elsewhere in the ongoing war against terrorism he considered it prudent to send the uss turner and its battle group as well this announcement the president hoped would send a clear message to both potential combatants to back off or risk the ire of the united states it was a monumentally bad decision because it was based on insufficient information first about who exactly was attacking whom and second on not yet having received the information because of petrels helo delay that a hostile sub had apparently penetrated the american littoral or coastal waters well within the twohundredmile limit a limit extended in modern times updating the old threemile limit derived from the fact that in the days of sail navies the maximum range of a manowars cannon had been three miles from shore the president was not the first occupant of the white house to have made a bad decision against the onrush of escalating developments nor because of the unforeseen consequences of his public address would he be the only president like jfk during the cuban missile crisis who would come to think that it might be his and americas last decision there was harried activity aboard the turners core battle group which under the overall command of admiral j bressard was made up of the nimitzclass carrier itself two guided missile aegis cruisers a fourship destroyer squadron the replenishment vessel salt lake city plus two nuclear attack submarines one of them captain rorkes uss utah the battle group was ordered to maintain station ready for immediate turnaround ten ships in all nine of them already leaving washington states naval base at everett and the bremerton yard the groups replenisher to follow as soon as she was chocabloc with supplies in the words of her highly efficient nononsense captain diane lawson fuel for the huge ton turner was no problem its two westinghouse nuclear reactors having enough power to drive its four shafts for ten to fifteen years or for a million nautical miles before the fuel cores needed to be replaced below in the carriers garagesmelling hangar deck nearly one and a third times bigger than a football field and three stories high an army of mechanics of the carriers air wing personnel were feverishly getting ready for the arrival of the air wing from whidbey island this would consist of eightyfive aircraft including twenty f tomcats f hornets ae intruders e hawkeyes eab prowlers s vikings and six seahawk helos the last of the urgently recalled ships personnel on leave having readied the ship only forty minutes before shed cast off from the bremerton yard the turners cbg deployment to join mccain was seen by some young americans on the liberal left as excessive even bullying in nature but the beginning of the twentyfirst century had taught many americans and not only those in the countrys armed services that it was best to contain a danger rather than let it fester unchallenged as happened to the taliban in afghanistan and showing terrorists reaching into the heart of america itself had certainly influenced people as well the white house meanwhile was receiving presidential eyes only traffic from the us embassy in beijing general chang having advised bill heinz that the gong an bu believed li kuans terrorists might have penetrated american seaports particularly on americas west coast chang said that suspected xinjiang and kazakhstani terrorists under questioning by the gong an bu had revealed that small suicide inflatable boats and dirty bombs possibly hidden in sealift containers had been smuggled into american and possibly canadian waters aboard the uss turner in what at the time seemed an unrelated and banal incident admiral bressard was told that the fan room located on the third deck port side was experiencing some difficulty which meant air circulation wasnt up to par the world being divided into those who are always too hot and those who are too cold the hot mechanics were complaining so much it was suggested that the two enormous steel doors dividing the hanger into three distinct areas be opened the officer of the deck refused the idea of having the two huge doors closed in these hectic hours of getting underway was that if a fire or explosion occurred in one or more of the planes or from the ordnance of which there was three thousand tons in addition to the ships million gallons of aviation fuel the doors would seal off the hangar into three distinct zones each as survivable as the other two thousand watertight compartments throughout the twentythree transverse and longitudinal bulkheads admiral bressard looked ahead into the darkness of the juan de fuca strait and at the two protective aegis cruisers the one off to his right was all but invisible against the rugged mass that was the southern coast of vancouver island the silhouette of the other aegis on the turners left flank was lost against the coast of washingtons olympic peninsula then came the ton arleigh burke class destroyer squadron two abaft and two astern of the carrier and up ahead one of the two escorting flank attack submarines the smallest vessels in turners battle group but having twelve vertical launch tubes for nuclear warhead tomahawk cruise missiles each of the converted lafayetteclass subs packed a powerful punch the other sub maintaining station farther west moving slowly at sixty feet below to join the battle group was rorkes ton utah none of its crew happy at having been so near yet so far from home alicia mayne was the unhappiest of all keen to get off the boat onto terra firma and back to her lab she liked rorke and the super politeness of the utahs crew a naval tradition whether on sub or carrier where long narrow passageways needed to make room for more equipment and close living quarters demanded exceptional courtesy but alicia yearned for the lavish comforts of a fullsize bedroom the sheer pleasure of a walk outside the sensuous feel of rain on ones face no matter how much modern commentators emphasized the roominess of the footlong thirtyfourfootdiameter virginia sub compared to other subs it was still a submarine a coopedup world in which the normal rhythms of life ashore are lost only the redded out lighting making the submariners eyes more able to adjust from red to the darkness should they have to surface told them it was night in the world above alicia could smell steaks cooking in the galley and she heard the whir of the big mixer mashing potatoes and the thud from what she guessed was something bumping against the hull forward and below the sail then all hell broke loose the explosion shook the utah like a toy things crashing everywhere burned wires smoking and suddenly the pastel blue of the wardroom walls bulged out in huge blisters from the intense heat she could hear men yelling and screaming the sub still shaking so violently that what she took to be dust falling was in fact fine particles of pipewrap insulation squeezing through multiple fissures in the pipes sheathing from a broken elbow joint superheated jets of steam sliced across the passageway in which she could already hear doors and hatches slamming shut turning the long cigarshaped sub into a series of watertight compartments so that whatever section had been hit might be effectively sealed off from all others alarms continued to sound the ood calling for damage reports as rorke ran from his stateroom to control and other men rushed to their stations rorke could feel the sub desperately trying to assume her emergency up angle in order to surface but the forward ballast tanks were obviously damaged in fact there was a gash approximately three and a half by one foot wide on the starboard bow tank between the chins sonar array and the sail the pumps seemed unable to evict the torrent of water required to give the utah the positive buoyancy she needed to rise which she had to do quickly before becoming so heavy shed be driven to the bottom rorke immediately ordered all engines stopped diving planes at surfacing elevation and the crew ready to abandon ship the starboardside bulkhead of the battered forward tank was showing spider fissures visible only on the control monitors zoom and in the few seconds it took for the operator to tell the ood about it the spidery fissures had gone to a visible web the tiny cracks emitting powerful pencilleadthin jets of water rorke quickly realized that with the air pressure coils in the ballast tank ruptured there was no hope of the utah surviving unless he could somehow achieve an emergency blow in its present fragile state the boat hovered dangerously close to negative buoyancy if that happened it would plunge reaching breakneck speeds plummeting past its crush depth and smashing into the seabed its airfilled chambers popping like tin cans under the sledgehammer weight of the ocean in a matter of milliseconds the explosion of the seabedplanted mine had not only ruptured utahs ballast tank but generated a pulsating whitedomed bubble of carbon dioxide and methane gas that struck the aft bulkhead above the prop the speed of the explosions shock waves excited by the props normal cavitation or bubbleproducing motion created a partial vacuum the sudden whack of the explosions pressure wave traveling at mach deformed then oscillated the entire structure of the sub in effect whipping the boat ripping bulkheads away from their longitudinal stiffeners and causing massive flooding now that the integrity of a halfdozen previously watertight compartments was breached the flooding could not be contained and thirtytwo officers and men in departments aft of the sail drowned within minutes of the roaring deluge invading their home the encased pipelike housing for the sosus python was torn asunder from the subs flank like some long worm tube breaking up its contents of black oilencased hockey puck microphones spilling into a frenzy of white water it marked the catastrophic end of one of americas preeminent warships a weapons platform that had contained more than twice the firepower of all the ordnance dropped by all combatants in world war ii rorke had ordered beaufort life raft drums released and alicia mayne to be the first out of the sails hatch shed been through the drill often enough but actually doing it hitting the cold eardinning horror of a battering in total darkness was terrifying her body was caught in the vicious vortexes of contrary forces from the sinking boat and the boiling sea and further battered by debris her arms flailing breath failing her nostrils clogged her chest seemed about to explode and her lips felt as if they were afire in the fierce upstream of acidic effervescence that was now highly poisonous due to the chemical reaction between seawater and the dying subs gutted battery compartment the resulting greenishyellow clouds of dirty chlorine that had already suffocated a dozen or more of rorkes crew were now visible as a smudge on darkstars routine overflight the explosion itself heard by the handful of isolated settlements on both the american and canadian sides of the fifteenmilewide strait some of the submariners who in fates strange grasp had popped through the chaos of swirling sea and debris to the surface of the strait were relatively unharmed the screaming of others was a terrible testimony to the burns and injuries inflicted by the firespill spreading across the previously black surface of the sea its flames illuminating hundreds of pieces of debris the unidentifiable shapes some afire floating around and around alicia and everyone else whod made it out alicia involuntarily opened her mouth to scream as a corpse its head all but severed floating beside the body bumped into her on the downward slide of a cresting wave her mouth however made no sound and instead sucked in the scum of oil and a slippery cold choking substance that made her gag it could have been a mélange of canned or frozen food that had exploded from containers as the utah imploded from the mines pressure wave but convinced that shed swallowed human flesh albeit inadvertently the thought gripped her with an overwhelming revulsion captain she screamed but all she could hear was the agony of survivors and of the dying and then a wave crashed into her pushing her into the burning oil slick through his binoculars high in the turners island admiral keach the overall commander of the carriers battle group could see the oil slick moving up and down like a fiery island illuminating the final seconds of the utah before she disappeared piecemeal below the heaving crimsonslashed surface of the strait keach had already ordered the carriers rescue sea knight helicopters aloft standing firm against the instinctive desire of all his battle groups sailors to rush to help their stricken comrades from the utah keach ordered all other elements of the battle group to stay where they were until further notice on turners bridge ensign myers though trying to hide his disgust with keachs decision murmured his disapproval the admiral took it as a chance to educate the officer as well as to chastise him for not keeping his feelings to himself mr myers he said what would you do as captain of one of the aegis or destroyers go full steam ahead myers surprised by keachs acute hearing given the noise of the last helicopter taking off from turners flight deck had no time to react before the admiral was answering his own question yes youd be the hero and dash ahead to help your fleet buddies a noble sentiment mr myers but what caused utah to go down internal explosion torpedo friendly fire a mine the ensign was nonplused remember the kursk added keach accidental firing in their own torpedo room already the turners sensor arrays were monitoring the air for any radioactive leak from utahs reactor that would be a double whammy a lethal cloud of radiation sweeping over the entire battle group plus the enormous catastrophe that would assault the millions of americans who inhabited the northwests pristine mountains and coasts whats more if the water from the countless streams and rivers that raced down from the high peaks of the rockies and cascade ranges to the seastackdotted coast of washington oregon and northern california were contaminated most of the western united states would die comsubpac on the scrambler line sir turners admiral bressard informed battle group commander keach i think its admiral jensen himself keach took the phone from bressard keachs tone correct but not noticeably friendly they had both dated margaret and keachs ego was as big as any of turners air wing pilots he hated losing admiral jensen told keach ive just received a disturbing message from the oceanographic ship petrel they sent it down by helo no encryption capability what is it asked keach petrel reports a possible hostile in the strait keach was so dumbfounded all he could say was utahs gone admiral dont you know he stopped realizing there was a very good reason jensen wouldnt know what had happened to one of his attack subs the subs didnt make regular checkins such transmissions could immediately give away their position to an enemy i know that began jensen his voice trailing off in a mumble keach was struck by the sudden metamorphosis what had been the voice of a selfconfident commander a moment before had vanished jensen was a man on the edge torpedo or mine id say keach told jensen but could have been internal or a hostile i dont know there was no response from jensen but keach knew he was still on the line i have to go admiral said keach who immediately ordered a warning flashed to every ship in his battle group the captain of the aegis cruiser on his left flank asked for confirmation as to whether it was a mini or midget sub keach said that he had already requested confirmation of this in plain language message to the petrels captain all frank hall could tell keach however was what albinski had written on his attack boardminisubthe diver obviously not having enough time to put anything else down before his life was snuffed out whats wrong margaret asked when walter walked in grayfaced as if he had literally aged overnight a disaster he replied with the kind of deliberation that had always alarmed her a disaster for walter in what she called his worrywart moods had come to mean anything from the possibility of having to replace the muffler on his beloved porsche to hearing that one of his hunter killers was in deep trouble somewhere in the pacific you look awful walter wordlessly he flicked on cnn and there it was the lead story how did those media bastards find out about this stuff so quickly more than a headline the news flash was taking over the entire pm newscast not many details but repetition ad nauseam of a tremendous explosion being reported by seattles cnn affiliate the highprofile anchor marte price claiming that it was believed to be one of the navys icbm boomerstrident submarines normally jensen would have been scornful of the misidentification quick to point out that it was a hunter killer attack boat you idiot but all he could think of now was to say a silent prayer that keach was able to have turners sea kings and every other available helicopter in the battle group rescue as many of utahs men as possible and how he comsubpacgru so recently at large in seattles society circuit as guardian of juan de fucas and puget sounds pristine environment would be offered up by the white house as the sacrificial lamb for the catastrophe kimmels reputation was destroyed jensen now told his wife when fdr fired him as cincpac after the surprise attack on pearl harbor doug macarthur had been just as guilty in fact more culpable of ignoring warnings about an attack on clark field in the philippines parking all his damned planes in clumps easier to guard and easier for the japs to destroy the next day but fate was on dougs side fdr didnt have anyone else available on our east perimeter to take command kimmel he knew had died in obscurity and when macarthur did get fired by harry truman for wanting to cross the yalu from korea and bomb chinas staging areas he came home a hero got a tickertape parade the likes of which new york had never seen he slumped into his tv chair saying theyll crucify me margaret she went to the kitchen and began making coffee it would be a long night finally her hand on his shoulder she asked quietly how many men were aboard the utah a hundred and thirty give or take a woman aboard too one of our scientists torpedo specialist margaret bit her lip thoroughly ashamed of herself torpedo specialist had made her think of a joke shed heard among the navy wives torpedoes and penises how could one think of such a vulgar thing at a time like this same thing she remembered when she was a child went to church every sunday frightened sometimes by the urge to yell out the foulest things the more she tried to block it out the worse it became walter said such things to her only when he began kissing her between her rorke said walter softly hes the skipper margaret nodded as the wife of an admiral she got to know most of the skippers like her husband when he was younger they awed her the responsibility of young men like john rorke who drove the nuclearpowered steam engines that carried the power to destroy worlds impressed even someone from the rarefied air of radcliffe college keach walter said suddenly your old beau hes safe on the turner the carrier oh yes they were both wrong six minutes after the last rescue helicopter had left the turners darkened flight deck three warhead mines their release fuses initiated by the enormous downward push of the turners tons detonated the near simultaneous explosion of the mines caused what alicia mayne would have called a geometric rather than arithmetic progression in that one plus one plus one did not equal three but much more the pressure wave so powerful that it lifted the huge warship into the air it wasnt by much indeed it would have been barely perceptible to the naked eye even in daylight but it was enough to create a fissure running up from the great ships keel or spinal column to several decks above in effect breaking the carriers back many survivors of the utah eight miles to the east foundering amid the floating debris of the sub unable to gain a purchase on any floatable wreckage and who had only life vests were concussed into unconsciousness by the shock waves that sped through the water from the stricken turner at nearly miles an hour below on the carriers flight deck in the cavernous hangar which save for the rescue helos did not yet house its air wing the latters fighters fighterbombers attack and recon aircraft following standard procedure having not yet flown to the carrier from whidbey islands naval station the crew witnessed an astonishing sight one unique in the annals of naval history because their blast door was down separating their section from the other two hangar zones what appeared in front of them on the port side was not the huge wall that normally separated their hanger section from the support structures outside but a jagged tenfootwide gash four stories high running from below the waterline all the way up to the hangar deck through the gash the astonished crew could see the glittering diamonds of the big dipper they could also hear a deluge as millions of gallons of roiling seawater rushed in it sounded like a dam opening its spill gates so at first no one could hear the screams and death throes of over seven hundred men and women who from the deepset enginereactor room through the aft berthing spaces catapult equipment spaces air filter cleaning shop and aviation equipment storage were drowning the aft stern section of the carrier had been split asunder as if some giant had fireaxed the left rear side of the boat despite the superb honeycombed watertight compartmentalization of the carrier the massive damage meant that designated escape routes no longer existed in the maelstrom of twisted aluminum and steel the portside list of the carrier was evident within minutes hundreds among the carriers six thousand were sucked out to sea and drowned others were burned alive in the scores of fires within the wreckage the mines simultaneous explosions not allowing time for these victims to don life jackets and get out in aft bay crew were moving quickly to take advantage of the tenfootwide vshaped gash which like the unsinkable titanic was never supposed to happen given the ships threeinch high tensile steel scores of offduty personnel including sailors still in their boxer shorts and tshirts along with female air mechanics and a female fighter pilot in shorts and tank tops had formed a bucket brigade stretching from the rear of hangar they passed life jackets and white oildrumsized beaufort containers which were quickly tossed overboard falling over sixty feet past the burning smokechoked lower compartments when the beaufort drums hit the water their co cartridges triggered upon impact inflating the orangeglow tent rafts that were capable of holding from six to twelve people or more depending on canister size each raft ingeniously stocked with emergency flasks of fresh water power bars salt tablets morphine syringes aspirin acetaminophen and toothpastesized tubes of nontoxic oilbased sun cream which in a pinch could be consumed as a high source of protein in addition there were a handheld gps unit flares salinegenerated lights palmsized energy beam locator with batteries and providing survivors were in a nonshadow satellite cone a cell phone the sight of the battle groups flagship split keel to hangar deck was devastating enough as the media arrived en masse in port townsend some such as fox and britains itn went farther west along the wild and sparsely populated coast of the olympic peninsulas northernmost boundary to cover the story just east of port townsend a clutch of middle eastern networks and some european correspondents set up their gear barely able to conceal their euphoria at the sight of the worlds only superpower humbled by the grievous damage to the aircraft carrier and the outright sinking of one of its premier warships as if on cue detritus continued to bubble up from the pressureflattened wreckage that used to be the uss utah everything from ragged slabs of the anechoic soundabsorbing tiles that had coated the subs exterior to the crushed body parts of us submariners floated to the surface chapter eighteen the shock hit america with the speed of light on every tv in the country word of it got to incarcerated terrorists as well who were overjoyed by the death and destruction wrought upon the great satan the terrorists immediately saw what the pentagon was slow to recognize that this naval disaster within the home waters of the united states was a catastrophe more serious than the attack of whether or not the number of lives lost was greater bombing buildings by crashing planes into them was one thing the british as new york mayor giuliani had recalled at the time had suffered far worse human and material losses in the terrible nazi blitz of but strategically and tactically this attack on the carrier in the strait of juan de fuca had achieved something that shook the government and the military to the core the enemy had penetrated to the very center of an american carrier battle group despite its overwhelming firepower and stateoftheart electronic surveillance the group whose whole raison dêtre was to protect the carrier had been brushed aside in particular the white house wanted to know how neither of the billiondollar aegis cruisers had detected any unusual underwater activity along with the subhunting destroyers escort frigates and the lafayetteclass submarine which along with the utah was supposed to have made any such attempt a near impossibility eleanor prenty had never liked the war room or what the staff called the basement it had all the gee whiz stuff but though smoking there had long been banned she swore you could still smell cigar ash from time to time and despite its noexpensespared accoutrements the room still felt like a bunker the decor had certainly done nothing to ameliorate the presidents mood cmon gentlemen he demanded what the hells going on twotwo of our capital ships sunk within the turners still afloat the cno corrected him you dork thought eleanor yes admiral said the president but have you seen the pictures its been gutted top to bottom he was correct for by now the v which had reached as high as aft hangar bay had expanded under the sustained strain of the initial separation of the bulkheads and was visible as a tentofourteeninchwide cleft running the full width of the flight deck revealing equipment spaces immediately below and the track for one of the forward catapults was severed it was fast becoming apparent to anyone watching cnn which numbered almost as many who had witnessed the implosion of the world trade towers that the turner might well come apart separating as marte price diligently pointed out along the cross deck line of arresting wire number two the image that caught the publics imagination however was that used by an excited seattle commentator for cnn who opined that the damage to the turner resembled an enormous pieshaped wedge to illustrate his analogy further the commentator displayed the dramatic picture from the sixties showing how an ashaped bow had knifed into a thousandpassenger canadian ferry in the strait of georgia we are witnessing war in our home waters nbc declared solemnly a truth echoed not as solemnly and indeed joyously by stations throughout the arab world mr president interrupted an aide our surveillance flights confirm an invasion force heading from the chinese mainland toward the nationalist offshore islands of kinmen and matsu the president was already visibly shaken by the sinking of the utah and the attack on the turnerno list of survivors had yet reached him the aides news only deepened his consternation well right now richard he said we have to prioritize it was a word he usually disliked but he didnt have the time to think of a better one the american military has been taken completely by surprise and my first job is to defend the united states he had already grasped what the think tanks at the hoover institution and the national war college would soon be impressing upon tvs talking heads namely that if terrorists could penetrate the nations military defenses they could launch attacks against civilian targets at will anywhere in the united states do you think theyll attack canada the army chief of staff asked no homeland defense director harry hawthorn replied canadas immigration policys a joke terrorists love canada they wont attack canada be fouling their nest the president nodded his agreement but he had more important things to worry about than canada besides everybody already knew the score regarding canada its government the quintessential wimps full of good intentions but in world affairs no viability at all the country if you could call its disparate regions that depended entirely on the united states for north american defense droning on about soft power while the government in ottawa continued humiliating its small but brave military through such wanton neglect that when canadian peacekeepers were actually called upon to do something the canadian military didnt have a single airworthy plane to transport them hopeless the president wanted no more discussion about canada how far is the carrier from port townsend he inquired of no one in particular fifteen twenty miles westnorwest in the strait is that all yes sir son of a whos your man up there admiral he asked the cno admiral keach was commander of the battle group you heard anything from him that we dont already know no sir hes missing missing i thought he would have been up in the island he was mr president over by the bridges starboard wing lookout word is the force of the explosions flung them both overboard apparently the lookouts on the fantail suffered the same fate rescue helos hed sent out earlier to pick up any utah survivors hadnt yet returned to the turner anyway it was pitchdark they would have been wearing life jackets though said the president the two lookouts at the stern yes sir but i dont know about the admiral a skyblue folder with the presidential seal containing a thick pile of pages was placed in front of the president on the first of the pages was the heading cvn turner personnel there were six thousand names a quarter of them asterisked with either kiaor mia the very battle group hed intended to use to prevent a war in asia in a world already at war against terrorism now lay immobile in the juan de fuca strait and for one overwhelmingly simple reason the proudest and most powerful navy in the world had been grievously wounded and humiliated by a bunch of mines weapons that the us mining of haiphong notwithstanding elicited the kind of contempt in naval officers as that accorded a backshooter in the old west if terrorists can sink two of our capital warships before we can even reach our littoral seas wrote the wall street journals editorial what possible defense can we expect from the navy us sub sunk was the less erudite but more effective verdict of the tabloids as first editions hit the street on the east coast it was am in the straits of georgia and juan de fuca where the rescue effort of hundreds of small boats together with a dozen us coast guard patrol vessels and canadas two coast guard cutters had begun mayhem quickly followed in the wake of good intentions as congested sea traffic strong tides and fog combined to endanger the wouldbe rescuers indeed the fog was so thick that it obscured even the monolithic carrier which with her power cut the gash in her side expanding till it was now over eleven feet wide seemed beyond saving the crippled leviathans aft section from elevator to stern looked to admiral bressard as if it would detach itself from the rest of the ship at any moment the bonegrinding sounds of more bulkheads giving way mingled with the cries from sick bays now rendered useless as air flows in the carrier superheated by burst steam pipes leading from the reactors made it necessary to bring hundreds of the wounded many already suffering from severe scalding up onto the forward flight deck there as corpsmen and other medics performed triage surgeons did what little they could under the circumstances the navy chaplains all but overwhelmed administering last rites and yet as the cno and everyone else knew there had been no battle in the strait no enemy sighted during the massive if largely ad hoc rescue effort which the media was referring to as americas dunkirk the turners captain like all his fellow commanders in the cvbg were ordered by the cno to remain in defcon defense condition maximum force readiness cautious said the new york times scared said le monde everyone on the remaining ships of the cvbg was increasingly nervous following the fate of utah and turner it seemed that both the times and le monde were right the ships not daring to proceed through the strait for fear of three possibilities that aegis analysis sensors now suggested but could not confirm simultaneous detonation of five mines two against utah three against turner either combinations of pressureacoustic mines or coil rod induction fused bottom mines a much more advanced highly sensitive and comparatively cheap tripleaxis fluxgate magnetometertriggered mine and finally that the utah and the turner had been blown up by sensor mines measuring the electric current sent into the sea by the electrochemical reaction generated when steel hulls slice through ironrich salt water this latter type of targeting however was considered least likely by the aegis electronic warfare officers given the presence of the anechoic coating on the utah which would have minimized the metalseawater electrochemical reaction for the pentagon the question of what type of mines had been used against the two warships was crucial to any planned defense in the future because obviously neither of the comparatively sophisticated underwater defense systems aboard utah and the aegis cruisers had worked all right the cno asked but what or who had laid the mines a mini or midget sub if mines had been laid from an unmanned mini where was the mini being controlled from all us and canadian submersible companies had been cleared and if it had been a manned mini or midget sub then where was its milch cow its mother supply ship amid the winking of scores of rescue boat lights in the mistshrouded strait the sailors offloading wounded into a coast guard cutter saw one of the lights for a second become as bright as a struck match it was the backblast of a missile streaking toward the huge gash on turners aft port side the speed of the missile registered by the computers on the aegis nearest turner was mach which meant it reached the already gravely wounded carrier in seconds the blink of an eye even so the aegiss phalanx closein weapons system with its stateoftheart superfast radarguided response did intercept it was disastrous however the impact of the incoming missile and outgoing mm ordnance resulting in a fiery rain of whitehot debris that showered turners island knocking out its cluster of vital antennae and radar dishes for this reason a second missile fired a millisecond later was able to disappear into the cavernous v cut exploding at the waterline six minutes later the order was given to abandon ship she would not hold at the ton carrier tow lines attached began a twelvesecond death roll to port two tugboats one out of vancouver the other from seattle were unable to release their lines quickly enough one was dragged under and the other its line already taut whipped through the air like a toy as the turners stern inverted the oceangoing tug slamming into the carriers prop like a box of matchsticks the tugs crew flung into the maelstrom of the carriers immense propellers chapter nineteen from chinas coast province of fukien the plas sixty xian h medium bombers that attacked the offshore nationalist island of kinmen about oneeighth the size of rhode island did not come directly from the west as expected following the plas thousandgun artillery assault a prelude to what kinmens nationalists anticipated would be the invasion the chicom bombers augmented by q ground attack aircraft and protected by three hundredplane swarms of pla shenyang j fresco interceptors flew south of fukien not east toward kinmen the chicom pilots using their own hilly amoy island ten miles directly west of kinmen as a screen turned their fighterprotected bombers westward in a sixtymile crescent sweeping in low over the arc of liaolo bay on the islands fortymilelong southern coast thus attacking the nationalists heavy fortifications on the islands northern shore from behind only now did taipei and washington realize that the fast chinese attack boats seen earlier on satpix as white scratches heading east from the chinese mainland had been a feint making the nationalists on kinmen think the chicom fast attack patrol boats were the forward elements of a headon invasion of the island from the west this had duped the nationalists on kinmen to rush the bulk of their north coast garrison to the southernmost shores thus leaving their flank exposed as freeman and the rest of the armys uso team packed up for their flight back to the states the general sent an email to david brentwood who was to be sent home from tora bora for rr telling him ill come to see you back in the states fort lewis is pretty close to this northwest chaos and id like to have a looksee for myself washington sure as hell doesnt know whats going on it just occurred to me that probably the best place to meet would be in port townsend right on the strait of juan de fuca will confirm later by the way i dont think the towelheads are behind this at all if that last phrase didnt get him the attention of homeland defense freeman thought hed eat his afrika korps cap army surgeons at tora bora eschewing the kind of false hope that some of their wellmeaning civilian colleagues often felt compelled to give patients told david bluntly that his military career was over the lower part of your nerve plexus in the right arm has been destroyed unfortunately so badly damaged that even the best vascular surgeon cant repair your arm beyond forty percent of its function better to face that now captain said one of the specialists who as an afterthought asked you a religious man brentwood foxhole convert david quipped a little too flippantly given his sardonic smile for any of the three surgeons to believe him religion sometimes helps patients to adjust the surgeon said david resented his tone he saw it as an atheistic condescension toward someone the doctor considered simpleminded i dont believe in miracles he responded and immediately regretted giving ground well i think youll enjoy your r and r at fort lewis an awkward silence ensued until the doctor added the pacific northwest is big timber country lots of logging one of the most accidentprone jobs in the world a lot of good surgeons and rehab right at fort lewiss doorstep ah i think he wanted his rehab in hawaii joshed one of the other doctors somewhere a little warmer david gave them the smile they expected you ever been in the pacific northwest brentwood david wondered where he should begin obviously they hadnt read his military record yes he said simply approaching washington state the military transport was escorted in from a hundred miles out by two fs out of mccord the northwest under the highest alert since the cuban missile and crises after landing at seatac david walked past the fort lewis driver who was holding the brentwood sign consulted surgeons in seattles yellow pages directory and caught a cab downtown dr paul gonzales a surgeon from the famed brazilian clinic used by many hollywood celebrities was more suave than the three doctors at tora bora and disagreed with their diagnosis surgery he told david could not be expected to restore more than a maximum of thirty percent use in his right armin the fingers no more than twentyfive percent shit said david in an uncharacteristic outburst how about physiotherapy you know rehab and gonzales shrugged youll have to do that just to maintain the minimum range of movement you have if you dont youll lose it brentwood knew the doctor meant his arm but he already felt as if hed lost everything a onearmed soldier of course dr gonzales continued your left arm will take over some of the functions of your right a squeeze ball will help somewhat keep exercising the stiff hand as much as possible to retain what motion remains a squeeze ball a stunning print of cots storm hung on the doctors pastelgray wall the glances of apprehension on the faces of the two lovers fleeing through the foreboding and beautiful forest arresting davids attention despite the danger all around them there was hope in their eyes and he needed hope now the kind melissa had given him through the long months of separation he needed her now but the nightmare of the cave the death of his six comrades was too heavy upon him to go to her yet gonzaless second examination was merely an act of courtesy im sorry he said douglas freeman true to his email turned up in port townsends eastwest café for lunch it was the only place open since the scare but david brentwood wasnt in the mood to eat and neither was the general beset by what seemed an endless mtv video blaring from the tv in the corner of the restaurant agitated but trying not to show it the general was convinced that washington dc was merely spinning its wheels while the west coast burned and that more attacks could be in the offing they think he told david that this damn minisub or whatever the hell it is has shot its bolt well said david they might be right general a carrier and a nuclear sub isnt too bad both men picked unenthusiastically at their appetizers brought to them by a young sullen vietnamese woman who was complaining bitterly and loudly to a customer who looked like a regular is because we asian fbi home defense come here they think we terrorists blow up ships we good citizens mr norman we good citizens of united states i know sally theyre just checking everyone out they check you out she asked furiously wiping off a table at the back of the restaurant well i dont began mr norman see the woman said using her white cloth as a pointer they no ask you they think we terrorists not good for customers neither freeman told david is yelling the general pleased to see that his and davids main dishes were being happily delivered by one of the two vietnamese waiters whose smiling dispositions were a welcome respite from sullen sally the general however always a stickler for personal hygiene scowled in disgust did you see his fingernails he asked brentwood who as unobtrusively as possible pulled his right hand from the table resting it in his lap not sure of the state of his own fingernails goddammit continued freeman those two guys look as if theyve been in a brawl maybe over sally joked david trying to find as many cashews as he could in the mixed vegetable chicken and rice dish well she roughed them up pretty good said freeman look at their wrists and the one who served us looks like she tried to strangle him either that or cut his throat great bloody welt around his neck i wouldnt like to tangle with her said david freeman hadnt realized that sally had overheard some of their comments and she opened up on him i no beat anyone mister they she said indicating the two waiters go down help pull sailors from the sea that how they get burn david was embarrassed hadnt freeman heard about the local dunkirk effort hundreds of people coming from all points on the sparsely populated coast to help in the rescue of the survivors often at great personal risk many of the rescuers having to wade out into burning oil slicks to reach the victims dey have burn all over body helping sailors im sorry freeman said i didnt realize youve done a great job thank you sally pointed back at the restaurant kitchen we give hot food to saved people many hours yes said an abashed freeman im sorry miss i was way out of line david nodded about to give his heartfelt thanks but before he could respond further they had visitors two moroselooking men in shades had entered the eastwest café and were walking toward their table fbi or homeland defense freeman told david who was taking a sip of his green tea the agents identified themselves and without any apology for interrupting the two mens meal explained that a nsa computer phone scan had picked up freemans email to captain brentwood and would the general be good enough to explain his comment of which they had a copy that i dont think the towelheads are behind this at all by towelheads gentlemen i meant arabs freeman told them yes i know that their attack was brilliantly coordinated and executed but they used our planes our technology but do you know how many people this strait thing up here would require what kind of operation you would need for military targets not trade towers gentlemen but two capital ships scores of the bastards thats what it would take to pull it off who then general asked one of the agents dont know son freeman replied but ive been reconnoitering the area on my own not enough towelheads around havent seen one damn arab on this coast not one so you dont think its muslims i didnt say that what i am saying is that with all our carrier groups already spoken for on so many different terrorist fronts middle east east africa west africa the philippines et cetera wed only have the mccains battle group to referee the taiwan strait because were boxed in here the most powerful nation in the world cant move its warships out of the northwest through this choke point because we dont know what the hells going on what would you suggest we do asked the older of the two agents tell the government to give me access to darkstar ill use my own team your team specfor boys you just get me the authority tell this admiral jensen to let me use darkstar ive got a few ideas once hed heard this all david could think of was getting back to fort lewis to see whether the endless exercising he had done since afghanistan would prove the doctors wrong whether through sheer will he could make his hitherto dead right arm specifically its recalcitrant elbow bend enough to support the front weight of the new f bullpup rifle it didnt matter who had started the war in the taiwan strait the prc peoples republic of china or the roc taiwan if taiwan fell the quake through the worlds financial markets especially that of the us was certain to plunge the west into its worst recession since the collapse of admiral the president appraised mccains crowley youre the only flat top weve got in this ball game ill do what i can to bleed off elements from the gulf and elsewhere but if you wait for them to join you i suspect itd be too late i understand mr president well give a good account of ourselves i know you will your boy excited it took crowley aback that a president in the midst of such a clear and present danger to the nation was nevertheless so alert to the fact the non politically correct fact that young men and women from west point to annapolis would see in the terrible act of war in the strait of juan de fuca against their country the opportunity of a lifetime military men understood youths eagerness for combat but for a civilian like the president with no military experience to be equally aware though obligated as the nations chief executive to do all he could to stop the war at once pleased and alarmed crowley however eager the uninitiated soldier might be crowley knew that the more a soldier saw of his grizzly trade up close the less he wanted to see except for those like douglas freeman who in the darkness of his inner journeys had recorded illegally in his combat diaries that god forgive me but like old georgie patton i do so love it the sting of battle beckoned to him the everpresent call of thermopylae of being one of those who on some great and terrible day would save the nation in its hour of peril and here in port townsend in his hotel bathtub douglas freeman contemplated americas present peril the greatest it seemed to him since the nation teetered on the verge of destruction the white house in flames the british columns advancing the continental army in bitter retreat the call reverberated in him as deeply as it had in churchill another great aficionado of bathtub contemplation wet facecloth over his george c scott face the only noise that of his breathing and occasional ripple he tried to put the pieces together like a chess player surveying the board the clock ticking as he attempted to solve the deadly puzzle to forestall the enemys next move he tried to recollect everything like every pawn on the table which alone might contribute little or nothing to the puzzle but which once all assembled brought willfully together in the minds eye might reveal the who what and why of it all the shrill ring of the bathroom phone evoked a curse worthy of aussie lewis whod been the most profane of freemans specops boys whipping the facecloth off he barked freeman it was eleanor prenty he softened his tone though still irritable at the interruption to his train of thought ive been informed of your request for darkstar access admiral jensen has been told to assist in any way possible she paused he refused to fill the silence let her wait about damn time she returned his call weve received a communication from the chinese she continued their intelligence reveals that li kuan the yes i know who he is cut in freeman trying to maintain his train of concentration and struck by the irony that when hed been practically begging the white house to talk to him he couldnt get past operator eight and now precisely when he didnt want to be disturbed they were beijing has information that suggests li kuan is behind the attack on utah and turner if so he could have a dirty bomb then he would have used it not if hes here jesus your thoughts general which told him that as before no one in washington had any more idea of precisely what was going on than he did they were even seeking the opinion of retired generals im going to need some help ill call a few of my boys ill get back to you thank you general well that was more like it chapter twenty the dense white smoke rising from the hilly spine of kinmen island was the result of artillery smoke rounds fired by both communist and nationalist forces as the battle was joined most of the fighting was taking place on the green high ground overlooking the strands of beaches on the less verdant western shore of the island whose pinched halfmilewide waist accorded the island a shape that navigators throughout the mccain battle group referred to as the bow tie its highest point the eightthousandfoot mount taiwu rose in the middle of the bow ties eastern segment here chinese paratroops their transports having skirted kinmens two southside airfields were engaged in bitter often handtohand combat to capture the high ground to quickly establish and secure observation posts and fire bases from which they could lob mm mortar and mm howitzer rounds down upon the nationalist forces dug in along the islands northern and eastern defensive perimeters the bulk of sky bow ii missiles for kinmens defense had been situated on its northern and western shores where the chicom invasion was anticipated but now chicom paratroops who began falling like confetti on the ridges about the base of mounts taiwu and shuhao had attained complete surprise sky bow missiles fired from the nationalist islands more heavily defended northern and western shores did bring down a clutch of six highflying chicom j fresco interceptors but the missile flight arc of the sky bows fired up at the heights of shuhao and taiwu mountains and the hilly spine in between could not execute the abrupt c turn it would need to hit the lower flying chicom interceptors and ground attack aircraft they came in low over the south china sea bombing and strafing the southern shores two vital airstrips while the chicom paratroop transports continued to unload their men mortars and multichute quickassembly howitzers at precariously low altitudes their lowdrop zones pushed safety margins carrying at least pounds of weapons and equipment in addition to their own body weight the paratroopers were jumping from the scores of transport planes at six hundred feet in order to use the bulk of taiwu and shuhao mountains as protection from nationalist ground fire all over the island billions of black beetles known as chun rose in panicked crescendo as the normally tranquil air disturbed only in the recent past by loudspeaker propaganda from the chinese mainland was now resonant with the noise of gunfire the chunk of mm and mm mortars and the unrelenting thudding of howitzers laying down covering fire and fire for effect from both chicom and roc forces the nationalists over dug in along the entire length of kinmens western and northern shores as roc armor moved toward mount taiwu and adjacent high ground in the islands mideast sector here a forward battalion of nanjings armored division one of those in the twenty percent of the plas first class training units now dropped eighteen tripledroguechuted mobile howitzers each gun was capable of firing flat or high trajectory rounds while on the move at mph and was also equipped with upgraded infrared night vision and a mm machine gun initially the eighteen mobile howitzers caused alarm at kinmen nationalist hq the chicom howitzers unleashing a deadly fire on the line of nationalist bunkers and trenches at will then dots began appearing on kinmens east coast radar screens they were the rocs own fighters americanmade fs screaming westward high above the taiwan strait the mile distance between taiwans ching chuan kang air force base on taiwans central west coast and kinmen closing fast the estimated time to enemy contact three minutes a swarm of fifty chicom nanchang fighterbombers and sixty hs chicom versions of russias glazednosed tupolev tu medium bombers were now pounding kinmens defenses with sixhundredpound cluster bombs their aerial onslaught met with dozens of roc surfacetoair missiles from a distance on the big screens of mccains tactical flag command center the contrails of rockets and planes and bursts of oneinfour red tracer arcing gracefully through the mayhem looked like a huge and colorful video game but it was a deadly noholdsbarred struggle over whether communist china with overwhelming if temporary air superiority would take kinmen taiwans first line of defense then the rocs fs engines screaming at mach joined battle coming in from the sun at three oclock low they unleashed their airtoair missiles with such precision and accuracy that the five chicom hs were hit and downed in the first twentytwo seconds of battle it sent the entire chicom bomber swarms planes in all retreating to the mainlands coastal air space which even for the farthest chicom bomber and fighter escorts was mere seconds away and thick with sam batteries that till now had remained silent for fear of hitting their own aircraft once the bulk of the returning chinese bombers and escorts crossed the coast however the scores of chicom surfacetoair missiles opened up the rocs fs in hot pursuit popping orange sucker flares descending slowly like fairy dust that belied their serious intent the flares drew off the chicoms heatseeking missiles whose infraredseeking heads had mistaken the sucker flares intensive heat for that of the fs exhaust theyre running announced a young roc pilot for now his wing commander replied but for how long the roc air commander a pilot of long experience knew that what he was seeing was maos famed hitandrun guerrilla land tactics being ably applied to aerial combat and he was aware as he knew his chicom enemies must be that the overriding problem for the taiwanese fighters was that they couldnt loiter as long as the chicom planes which were much closer to their bases only a few miles away on the chinese mainland when the taiwanese fighter pilots heard their low fuel alarm and turned back to taiwan to refuel and rearm there would have to be other nationalist squadrons to relieve them thus stretching their resources in what was quickly becoming a war of attrition as if to underscore his concern the taiwanese wing commander caught sight of a dozen or so smoking plane wrecks scattered around the base of mount taiwu he had no way of knowing whether they were chicom or roc fighters that had risen up from kinmens two southern airfields before the airstrips were cratered save for one clearly evident red star tail visible in thick green foliage unless hostilities were either called off by beijing or some kind of diplomatic ceasefire came into effect under us guarantee this coastal war situation could quickly escalate to a catastrophic icbm exchange between kinmen and taiwan the standins as it were for beijing and taipei realizing this the taiwanese wing commander knew he must emphasize to taipei that if kinmen was not to fall on one hand a human disaster an enormous strategic and military defeat on the other the roc must keep fighters aloft over kinmen to lose this aerial battle would only encourage beijing to go further as thirty chinese communist j fighter interceptors in reality russianmade sukhois rose from their fukien airstrip to meet taiwans squadrons of mirage s the chicom pilots of the pla air force were confident of victory the two lyulka afterburning turbofans on each of their js could deliver more than twice the thrust of the taiwanese mirages rocketing the communist fighters to mach versus the mirages plus the russian lyulka engines could take the chicom js with their a alamo and aa archer missiles to a service ceiling of plus feet over four thousand feet higher than the taiwanese mirage though both planes climb rates were comparable at around feet per minute when chicom ground control alerted their j pilots of a new development a squadron of taiwanese fs scrambling from taiwans ching chuan kang air base the communist pilots remained unfazed the chicoms sukhois would still outnumber the taiwanese challengers by two to one indeed the chicom fighter pilots welcomed the news knowing that their russianmade aircraft outmatched both the rocs mirage s and their americanmade fs in both power thrust and service ceiling even the highly touted american fs which the taiwanese were holding back in hardshell revetments for taiwans last line of defense were not as fast as the js and studies at the chinafrench friendship polytechnic at harbin had shown that the js would defeat the americanmade plane more than fifty percent of the time in tightturning dogfight engagements but as any driver knows a vehicle is ultimately only as good as its operator and unlike their mainland enemies the taiwanese because of their buoyant economy had been able to give their pilots all the air time they could log they had also been able to purchase the expensive hightech simulators needed to train a cuttingedge air force though in a strange irony even the best aviators it was noticed often became violently airsick in simulators a condition most of them had never experienced in actual flight in addition the best roc pilots had spent time in the united states by means of a politically hushhush usroc pilot exchange program at fallons top gun school in nevada there high above and sometimes precariously low over the nevada desert the best taiwanese pilots from the roc air force academy flew daily against americas elite aviators many of whom had seen active service in both gulf wars and in afghanistan and though relatively few of the americans there had been in actual dogfights that is in oneonone aerial combat many had experienced the reallife gutwrenching adrenalinesurging terror of surfacetoair missile attacks as they fought up to nine gs in the lifeordeath drama of evasive maneuvers where they used all the skills taught to them at fallon from high above the blue of the taiwan strait the roc f pilots could see both the line to the west where the deep blue of the ocean met the brown effluent of the chinese mainland and the dirty greenishbrown haze of the combatpolluted zone above and around kinmen whose eastern sector was smothered by artillerylaid white smoke the usual westerlies however were blowing the smoke quickly back over kinmens western side effectively hiding the chicoms howitzer and mortar positions but simultaneously shrouding the positions of the four taiwanese infantry battalions who were now moving up and away from the islands northern and eastern shore and the very positions they had so assiduously practiced to defend they were moving toward the chicom paratroopers who had come in the back door and now occupied the islands high ground but with neither army on the islands western side able to see one another through the manmade fog the usual confusion of war was exacerbated into utter mayhem both the chicom and roc infantry normally wellconditioned began firing at anything that moved in the smoke the situation was further confused by the close similarity of both sides khakigreen field uniforms which the pla and roc had begun copying from the americans in the late s and which were markedly unlike the plain pla green still used by the chinese armies now routing the muslim fundamentalists in kazakhstan while the new camouflage clothing used by both armies on kinmen was admirably suited to the brownish green foliage of taiwan the chicom coast and offshore islands the allbutidentical uniforms escalated the usual danger of friendly fire to pandemic proportions in the battle with both sides continuing to lay smoke during a lull in the westerly winds the entire island was shrouded in a pungent bruisecolored smoke reeking of cordite and gasoline exhaust from armored personnel carriers mobile artillery haulers and tanks vehicles moving through tinderdry scrub began a series of fires whose growing ferocity was due to the panicborn thoughtlessness of an roc infantry platoon moving up toward mount taiwu to dislodge a dugin section of chicom machine gunners the roc platoon having been already badly mauled by sniper fire and now down to about twenty men found their way blocked by a wide rush of splotchyleafed and highly toxic yaorénmãopeople biting cat nettles and also came under heavy chicom machine gun fire from thick woods on both flanks rather than remain exposed in the relatively open nettle space a corporal the platoons lieutenant and sergeant having already been killed yelled for the platoons flame thrower to torch the nettles probably hoping to use the resulting smoke as a blind as well as to clear a way through as the disembodied orange tongue of liquid fire arced into the nettles the fire fanned by the resumption of the winds blowing westward from taiwan swept forward so rapidly through the trees that it overtook the chicom machine gunners they were forced to abandon their heavy two hundred round box magazines in an attempt at retreat the sickly sweet stench of the chicoms burning alive mixed with the smell of incinerated equipment at the same time billions of the ubiquitous black insects swirling skyward to escape the smoke that covered the island began to explode the resulting rapid firecracker noise mistaken by younger soldiers on both sides for the sound of the chicoms lightweight cq automatic rifles it was a burst from one of these rifles known among us and other nato forces as a pound m ripoff that felled corporal ahmao pan the youngest son of moh pan as he led his rifle section against a chicom sapper unit that had quickly braved an intense overlapping field of roc mortar fire near the rocs big bunker near pupien on the islands northern side the impact of the gram bullets their muzzle velocity among the highest in the chicoms armory of infantry weapons blew away pans chest and stopped what up till then had been his sections spirited charge against the enemy sappers the pause enabled the chicom engineers to place satchel charges against the bunker the detonations failed to wreck the bunker but created such enormous and simultaneous concussions that the bunkers roc defenders were so badly disorientated that they failed to prevent two hundred chicom marines from rappelling ashore from mikhailb heavy transport helos the communist marines captured the huge bunker complex with virtually no opposition within minutes another fleet of mikhail heavy transport helos arrived flying at no more than a hundred feet above an increasingly choppy sea that presaged the coming onslaught of typhoon jane the transport helicopter pilots carefully watching the precipitous fall in barometric pressure had already seen satellite pictures showing the towering green columns of rain and debris that were picking up speed after having been initially slowed from miles per hour to mph as they passed over islands in the philippine sea jane had sucked up houses entire villages and automobiles two days before in luzon spitting them down miles away as the massive weather disturbance siphoning off the power of smaller systems continued its destructive course toward taiwan the cnn anchor marte price echoing reports from the east asian network announced that taiwan was reportedly in for what the chinese traditionally called a super typhoon chapter twentyone douglas freeman heartily despised the media in general regarding them in an infamous address to a graduating class at emory as a bunch of lilylivered liberals who should be told about wars only when they were over on cnn marte price had reported his comments as an antiliberal tirade noting that hed been booed by the student body the general laughed it off he and marte were old friends though diametrically opposed politically as he once commented to norman raft his nd army quartermaster with uncharacteristic embarrassment he and marte price who had been a reporter in the field during several of his wars were what you might call ah chemically aligned what the hells that mean douglas raft replied you screwed her damn woman was going to write some nasty stuff about my sea air land emergency response team freeman said and for reasons of national security i had to launch a ah preemptive strike there you go for the good of the army was she a good fit asked raft like a in the breech a metaphorically speaking freeman responded oh then it was more like small caliber thats enough norman dont you have to order some water pumps it was an old joke between them a reference to the tragic failure of a fivedollar cooling component in the british armys tanks during the initial and disastrous campaign against rommel in the western desert the small defective part had been responsible for terrible losses as overheated engines conked out and became sitting ducks for the afrika korps s it was one of the reasons that freeman to the disapproval of fellow senior commanders past and present occasionally sported his distinctive khaki afrika korps cap the swastika removed the cap reminded him of the two vital attributes of any countrys great lieutenants first the ability to get inside your opponents head to think like him tactically as well as strategically and second to remember that god is in the details the water pumps for instance without which an entire armored division could grind to a halt these were details most overburdened generals left to their armys quartermaster and freeman always attended to himself but now it was time to get a detailed map of the area and to call the team or as he liked to refer to them the old special forces gang there would be no small talk now that freeman was sure that the navy indeed the united states was in even more danger than it feared aussie lewis in los angeles was the first to get the call you in for a job freeman asked him location replied the laconic aussie lewis refusing as always to admit surprise washington state freeman said picking apples you fit a mile with full kit in under ten hows that adequate it was part of the code now this is crucial whats your current waist thirtyone thirtytwo after lunch at hooters so he was fit one more thing said freeman im waiting will mommy let you go lewis ignored the taunt when tomorrow you have your own draeger he meant the special chestmounted rebreather unit and air tank which unlike other diving gear would not release telltale bubbles that could betray your position to the enemy next freeman called sal salvini in brooklyn asking the same question the answer was im packing now choir williams who had settled in the quiet little town of winthrop nestled in eastern washingtons cascades the wilderness mountain chain that ran south of mount baker near the canadianus border received the last call but by the time the general dialed him the welshamerican whod never lost his accent had already been contacted by aussie lewis williams here he answered the phone a fine lick of a lad i am fit as a rugby flyhalf and a devil with the ladies there was a polite pause mr williams its pastor keenheart here perhaps ive caught you at a bad time ah yes well ah no pastor the choir at winthrop st andrews wondered if youd be so kind as to lend us your fine eisteddfod tenor voice for our thanksgiving service ah yes of course sorry pastor i thought i thought you were an old pal of mine yes of course id be happy to assist though i could be out of town oh thatd be a pity because two of our soprano ladies wanted you to bang them general choir answered freemans questions including giving his waist size and as he had with aussie and salvini freeman told him to bring draeger along as if the latter were a person choir inquired about david brentwood the other member of the old team would he be going also no it was so emphatic that choir was taken aback they had always worked as a team he didnt press further and being a single man there was no mommy consideration for choir when eleanor prenty heard a message on her answering machine from freemani know whats going onshe called him immediately her earlier reluctance to return his calls or seek his advice having vanished in light of or rather the darkness of the utah and turner having been sunk no one in comsubpac seemed to know anything other than what oceanographer frank hall had informed them that seal diver rafe albinski had apparently spotted a mini or could it be a midget sub before his suspicious death and that admiral jensen had therefore requested an airlift of the navys small nrb research sub from the atlantic coast to whidbey island where it could be launched to help in the investigation freeman explained to eleanor prenty where he thought the sub was by referring to what he called the reverseseven shape of the olympic peninsulas coastline which appeared in the cape flattery quadrant of the maritime chart of the juan de fuca strait where hed spotted the simple fourword entry hole in the wall it referred to a sea cave in the extraordinarily rockpitted coastline a cave eleanor said struck by the generals perspicacity but she immediately pointed out to him the difficulty of getting enough divers to search almost one hundred miles of some of the wildest coastline in north america all available divers were already needed to scout every port and dock ive already made calls freeman cut in to three or four of the best seal specop guys in the country three or four itd take hundreds more she said youre right freeman replied eleanor was taken aback by his agreeing with her and his friendly tone so she said i suppose you have an alternate plan yes maam this was the problem hed solved in the bath comsubpac group s uav she thought for a moment military types were always throwing around their acronyms for equipment and it gave her pleasure to surprise him unmanned aerial vehicle right the national security advisor felt elated i want to have darkstar do an infrared run west from pillar point to cape flattery then south to a place called father and son fiftyseven miles in all eleanor was trying to locate the place names on her wall map no luck but shed already grasped freemans idea hot spots she said the uav photographs the fiftyseven miles of coast and any hot spots indicating human habitation can be investigated by our divers right youve got it darkstars pix are digital disc so we can get realtime feed ill have the cno contacted right now to order ah cut in the general maybe you could have your admiral jensen call the cno eleanor hesitated itd make more sense for her toyou want admiral jensen to get the credit well hell freeman said poor bastard could use some media everyone wants someone to blame someone to crucify maybe he was derelict i dont know none of usll know till we have time to investigate time for that later right now we need to go after the sub and its hideaway she was beginning to like the gruff bluff legend they sometimes called george c scott because of his uncanny resemblance to the oscarwinning actor who had made such an indelible impression with his acclaimed portrayal of patton one of freemans boyhood heroes thats very generous of you general he mumbled something about there but for the grace of god go i and asked her to let him know when darkstar was airborne and to give him a password for his laptops entry to the uavs realtime ir transmits of its surveillance flight chapter twentytwo at the firing range at fort lewis outside tacoma the setting sun had thrown pine and spruce trees into stark relief over puget sound the strait and the symphony of mountains cumulus and seacoast there was a pinklavender beauty so redolent with the smell of forests and pure air from the perennially snowcapped olympics that it would have seemed the wild imaginings of some fantastical painter but for the fact that it was real america remained traumatized its navy humiliated its selfesteem bombarded by the unrelenting antiamerican foreign press scoffing at the navys continuing embarrassment about what to do in the strait with two capital vessels gone the turners battle group or what was left of it was like a man caught in a minefield the new york times editorialized he can neither go forward nor retreat having seen his most forward comrades on the utah and those behind him on the turner blown up in short the navy is paralyzed but on the firing range at fort lewis david brentwoods only concern at the moment wasnt what the editorialists were saying but that his lame right hand was refusing to play its part its fingers bunched in an immovable stubborn fist the humvees driver who had brought the medal of honor winner to the range opened the back door to grab the only new ambidextrous f assault rifle at fort lewis ill get it said david subdued his tone devoid of any trace of sullenness or illtemper but characteristically quiet showing as much concern for the other mans embarrassment as for his own oh sure said the driver stepping back first problem the assault rifle had no mag rules of the range no weapon to be loaded until shooters were in the stalls or on the mound but even the simplest job snapping in the mag proved harder than david had anticipated as his sister an army nurse had so often said the things you take for granted her work with the wounded having relentlessly driven home the point the f constructed of molded polymer and modern in appearance wasnt a pretty weapon it was thoroughly ugly in fact though ergonomically correct its modular design looked more like a childs stubby gray lego construction despite its aesthetic shortcomings however it had been the bullpups carrying handle allowing the wellbalanced bullpup to be carried with equal facility by left and right handlers that gave david hope he should be able to grip the weapon tightly enough by jamming it between his left arm and side to control its threeround bursts after considerable sweat and remonstrations against his dangling uncooperative right arm he was able to cradle the weapon for burst fire then in an act of sheer will using his good left hand to literally drag the dead lump of fingers that had been his right hand across to the front underside and through the loop formed by a halfinchwide rubber band suspended from the guns barrel he managed to lift the relatively light eightpound weapon high enough to assume a shoulder firing position should he be tested for singleshot accuracy he fired four threeround bursts from the waist position the driver watching the mansize target through the range binoculars while the group of three mm bullets all hit the target they were too widespread still david readied for the shoulder shot trying gamely to camouflage his pain beneath a forced grin good to be shooting again he told the driver uhhuh the drivers attention had shifted from the line of targets to the arrival of another humvee son of a its george patton freeman as usual was well turned out khaki shirt and trousers immaculately pressed together with the snappy peak of his khaki afrika korps cap his gear made him look ten years younger but the general was not a happy camper and his driver loaned by fort lewiss co wisely remained in his humvee davids driver came to attention giving the retired general a smart salute freeman returned in kind without breaking stride as if arriving to inspect the nd army a word with captain brentwood yes sir davids driver replied quickly absenting himself heading toward the other humvee general said david slipping on the safety weve got bad news youre a diver right yes sir good need your advice that was something david liked about freeman he never hesitated to seek the counsel of others those below him in rank particularly those who like him had been in the field whats the problem david asked grateful for the chance to lower the resting it against the gnarled trunk of a ponderosa pine told national security advisor prenty that maybe the sub had its lair in a cave or some other indentation in the coast from port angeles down past father and son david knew about port angeles of course but apart from the bible not father and son father and son are a couple of sea stacks off the olympic peninsulas west coast i suggested jensen comsubpacgru run his uav darkstar along the coastal sea caves for ir hot spots david said immediately extrapolating from freemans remark that what would be needed was a divercapable specfor team to either execute a swim investigation or an abseil insertion from a helo as brentwood and his team had done in the hindu kush exactly confirmed freeman his hand flashing out with surprising speed capturing a fly which he then flung ferociously against the ponderosa anyway darkstar is in pieces overhaul wont by flyable till tonight david glanced at his swiss issue watch thats only four and a no five hours away not long the general gave the grunt of a man whose rationality was losing to his impatience turners battle group whats left of it is still sitting out there in the strait how many planesd we lose on the turner a few none of the fighters thank god hadnt flown out from whidbey island carrier only takes em aboard once the boats clear of the strait and in the open sea if i were the terrorists i wouldve waited opined david hit the carrier at sea likely to get most of the fighters in the hangar deck and topside i agree said freeman taking off his afrika korps cap running his fingers through a shock of silvery gray hair the general slapped his thigh with the cap got any ideas of what to do while were sitting on our bums waiting for darkstar to be reassembled hovercraft said david theyre equipped with ir scopes for night searches helos too but id go for the hovercraft low flying helos even by pilots from the coast guard familiar with the coasts arent as good as hovercraft hovers are at eye level with any cave or indentation helos have to avoid sea stacks especially hard to see at night freeman nodded in full agreement already striding back to his humvee grabbing its phone coast guard hq in seattle told him they could let him have three hovercraft the remainder of the squadron still busy searching for survivors among the more than mias still unaccounted for when asked the general over the phone well need authorization from admiral hey david could hear the generals sharp retort you jokers listen to me weve lost a nimitz carrier a stateoftheart virginia and most of the people aboard them and you want some goddamn piece of paper so you can go look for the sons of bitches who did this if we lose any more because you orders are going out now general cut in the duty officers voice as we speak good ill need realtime digital feed of any hot spots the hovercraft get on their video no video im afraid general straits too rough like most people who hadnt ridden aboard one the general despite his extensive military exposure harbored the illusion that a hovercraft traveled smoothly over the water on the air cushion well hell then have them notify me if they see anything that looks suspicious roger lets hope freeman told david when he put down the phone that nothing hits the fan between now and midnight amen to that said david having rested during freemans têteàtête with the coast guard he now clicked a new mag into the f keen to show his old boss just how well he could handle the bullpup with one good arm freeman eschewing any of the ear protectors in the stalls plugged his ears and shouted go upon which david unleashed three bursts all on target if the target had been a barn door certainly nowhere near a sufficiently tight group for the specops qualification how about the grenade launcher freeman asked casually as he lifted the ropesecured range binoculars and studied the grouping david had been so intent on overcoming the problem of firing the f with one arm hed forgotten about the grenade launcher it was the essential clipon module for anyone using the assault weapon for anyone in a specfor group not yet he told the general ill clip it on now good david smiled but inwardly felt a rush of gutknotting anxiety a condition virtually unknown to the medal of honor winner in the years prior to the disaster in the afghan cave he had good reason to feel apprehensive the fs grenade launcher weighed another two pounds it might not have seemed like much but ask a pregnant woman what another twopound strain on her breast means as a fort bragg drill instructor had once said to him aussie lewis choir and salvini stop it aussie had said youre driving me nuts the di had had their attention when youre aiming a weapon with a launcher attached from the shoulder its like saying hold on a second ill tie a brick to the barrel makes one hell of a difference now davids driver came back down from the humvee to give him moral support in his plummeting mood david illadvisedly pressed the point by adding what other damn module does this thing have clipon bayonet said freeman like me to get one for you captain offered the driver thatd be nice david responded any other clipons ah lessee said the driver not getting davids sardonic tone ill go back up to stores grab the fire control system night vision scope you want all of them sir sure why not dont want to miss any fun the drivers laugh trailed off when he saw the tight grimace of pain that had swallowed the captains smile dont hurry back said david as the humvee took off its dusty wake shrouding him in what he elected to regard as insult upon injury the specfor captain was simultaneously aware that he was giving way to a disgusting wave of selfpity he lowered himself to the ground for a rest pushing his back hard against the gnarled pine hey smiley it was a distinctly australian voice the accent not lost despite lewiss twenty years as an american citizen what you doin mate playin with your dick thought youd be here sooner david replied as aussie gave the general an informal salute so did i but the wife insisted we have a farewell quickie you know me i wanted to skedaddle to seattle right away but you cant deny pussy its unconstitutional david forced a grin which was difficult for either the general or lewis to see now that the light was fading aussie squatted down like an arab posterior well off the ground a lesson learned long ago in the australian outback to avoid what aussie used to describe to his fellow specfor buddies as bloody creepy crawlies i heard about the screwup in ghan not your fault harold bad intel a setup you guys were suckered plain and simple you arent the first team to lose out to that friggin ghost david looked over at his old comrade in arms you think li kuans a ghost i dunno confessed aussie snapping off a stalk of passpalum grass and biting on it tell you what though i ever run across the ghost ill put a long burst through the apparition see if the fucker bleeds in the silence that followed the three warriors could hear the rustling of the grass and pines i lost six of em aussie it was as if the breeze had abruptly ceased i heard aussie said spitting out the chewed passpalum everyone but you right david not known for dwelling on what could not be changed was clearly dwelling on it ive got a couple of kleenex here said aussie trouble is theyre all screwed up into those unusable balls you have to throw away but ill tell you what i can aussie slapped a mosquito dead on his forearm little bastard anyway i can go get a coupla towels and we can sit here all night and have a big cry or we can get off our ass and go have a few beers hear theres a hooters in tacoma tits biggern i have to master this apparently its got a grenade launcher and bayonet module as well as well use your friggin brains captain rig up a friggin sling shoulder or neck could carry your motherinlaw in that david heard the humvee coming back a sling geez i never thought of that geez aussie mimicked him i never thought of that then he segued to an old commercial adopting the voice of its aged actress ive fallen down and i cant get up course you didnt think of a sling you twerp cause youre still in mea culpa mode you believe in god all that stuff dont you the general walked into the woods smiling approvingly at aussies frontal assault on his buddys uncharacteristically fragile psyche yes david said seriously i do believe so well youre still alive mate cause hes not finished with you get up an get goin davids driver was walking down from the humvee with his arms full of cliponaddon modules ah santa claus said aussie right davy boy rig a sling give you my belt but since my waists only a thirtyone me being so fit to dive with the draeger an all david began unthreading his belt oh thats a good idea dave aussie joshed one bum arm and now youre gonna try shooting with your pants down what the hell you doin i said rig a sling not expose yourself it was the first real smile that had graced davids face since before afghanistan salvini told me youd been hit in the arm continued aussie i dunno looks like you fell on your fucking head david and the driver were laughing now aussie handed david a length of polyester rope normally used to attach the range binoculars to the firing stall the rope sling worked well for support but the shooting was still bad nowhere near specop standard in fact nowhere near boot camp level but freeman and aussie knew that anything to build back his selfconfidence was important even if it had to be made clear to david that there was no way he could be designated operational and endanger a team with what was essentially a bum right arm admittedly brentwoods handling of the grenade launcher was a surprise its weight all but nullified by the sling and by david hugging the f hard to his left side the lobbing of four grenades he fired was surprisingly accurate well within the acceptable limits for the firing of mm projectiles the next test however the bayonet which could not be successfully thrust or parried with the sling was a different matter altogether the weight of its steel blade extending far beyond the assault rifles barrel created a punishing torque on davids left arm his forehead beaded in perspiration he was about to try yet another onearm thrust when he aussie lewis and the humvees driver felt a violent rustling above them and were engulfed by a whirlwind of leaves dust and other assorted debris choking the air this was followed by a thunderous clap it had been the magazine of one of the aegis cruisers exploding following the detonation of a magnetic signature mine the ultramodern reinforced blast wall built to protect the ships arsenal of shiptoship seatoland and seatoair missiles had given way the cruiser blown apart with such unmitigated violence that it lit up the strait off port angeles with a fiery intensity that turned evening to midday the rain of whitehot metal hissed so loudly that it startled already shaken inhabitants as far east as port townsend and the adjacent kitsap peninsula the sound raced northeast to vancouver south across admiralty inlet and down hood canal reaching admiral jensen at bangor base seconds before those across the puget sound in seattle tacoma and fort lewis heard it holy shit said brentwoods driver by the time general freeman had exited the woods in such haste that hed forgotten to zip up washington dc government switchboards particularly those of homeland defense headquarters were jammed by terrified callers what in hell was the government doing about it and what about the nuclear reactors on the aegis if the aegis had been blown apart as cnn said didnt that mean its reactor had disintegrated as well and if so wasnt there immediate danger of fatal radiation through the entire northwest for the first time since the american civil war americans began a massed exodus only this time from the pacific northwest something their founding fathers couldnt possibly have envisaged en route they swallowed iodine capsules in the hope that it would either prevent or at least offset what many feared would be the beginning of a massive cancer pandemic triggered by deadly radiation americans on the run tabloids from damascus to paris trumpeted the most sympathetic foreign headlines coming from australia britain new zealand and canada most european papers after expressing horror at the destruction of yet another american superwarship and lamenting the loss of all aboard quickly resorted to tartedup versions of the old root causes blame the americans harangues of post going against the tide of frightened americans freeman having taken his leave of aussie and brentwood returned to port angeles the repaired darkstar due to take off at pm booting up his laptop he saw a flickery blue screen no pictures however darkstar my ass he thundered so loudly his port townsend hotelier heard him from the lounge darkcrapis more like then the infrared feed came through all right then freeman said gruffly against the infrareds grayish coast he could see bubbling dimesized whitish hotspots and fishing boats exhaust heat youve got balls he told the screen referring to the fishermen three ships sunk and you guys are still trawling for dogfish ill be wait a minute he thought fish naval slang for torpedoes were the terrorists on trawlers as well one eye on his computer screen freeman turned to the phone punching in the numbers for coast guard coordination in seattle alerting them to the possibility of trawlers and other fishing vessels factory ships perhaps having torpedofiring andor minelaying capacities when the coast guard commander got a chance to interject which given the generals rapid delivery was not for a full two minutes he told freeman general that was the first thing our divers and boarding parties looked forabove and below waterline we also checked all the beaufort drums on deck to make sure they contained life rafts and not mines we were also looking for terrorists oh responded the legend answering as if he was a member of the british general staff rather than a retired american warhorse good show commander yes said the commander not all of our members are retired what in hell does that mean growled freeman have to go general were running escort for the navys pullback into puget the commander hung up hello thundered freeman hello you cheeky son of a bitch he turned to the laptop and above its screen caught a glimpse of himself in the motel rooms mirror he hadnt thought about the possibility of beaufort life raft drums being used as mine containers huh he said looking at his reflection not so damn smart after all eh general watching darkstars feed he could see more bobbing dimesized white spots contrasted against the serratedgraywall coastline and the huge olympic land mass beyond where the lingering warmth of the land released from the base of mount olympus met the radiant heat of the cooler ocean fog had formed it now began permeating the myriad nooks and crannies and wider bays all the way from port angeles west to the violent surf of tatoosh island off cape flattery as the big pacific swells exhausted themselves crashing in punishing waves of foam against the black precipitous cliffs of tatoosh freeman could hear the mournful sounds of foghorns through darkstars amplified sound feed darkstars bottom screen text informed him that tatoosh was one of the most densely populated wild bird sanctuaries in the world but right now the general couldnt have cared less about the sanctuary or any of the others situated south of cape flattery down the washington coast as far south as cape disappointment off the equally dramatic oregon coast instead his attention was confined strictly to darkstars present eastwest feed the uavs pictures coming in from its low vectored flight between port angeles and tatoosh they were speckled with more than a dozen hotspots in what were supposedly unpopulated areas by the time darkstar reached the end of its flight path just west of tatoosh its ir feed became thicker with hotspots these were smaller than the bobbing hotspots of fishing vessels radar masts and the like but appeared to the general significantly more numerous the phone jangled freeman it was david brentwood calling to ask if he had more details via darkstar about the explosion the officers mess at fort lewis he explained was a hive of contradictory rumors cnn cameraequipped choppers from the news networks apparently not yet on the scene some were saying cnns crews were chickening out because of the fear of radiation the general concerned as he was by the sudden increase in the number of hotspots on the ir feed was nevertheless encouraged by brentwoods tone he knew that curiosity about the world beyond oneself was a sign of recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder perhaps with aussies help brentwood had finally accepted the hard truth that he was finished not only in specops but for the regular forces as well surely the medal of honor winner now realized how downright irresponsible it would be for any commander extant or retired to send an injured man into combat endangering the lives of all those around him because of his handicap or what freeman thought politically correct reporters would call his limbchallenged ability even worse in the generals view would be the danger posed to davids comrades by their preoccupation with his safety rather than with the mission objective david the general said id like you and aussie to get up here to port angeles salvini and choir are due momentarily tell aussie to bring his draeger roger that said david ill bring mine too there was silence on the generals end can you hear me general what ah yes yes bring your tank sorry im glued to an ir printout of the coast said the general and seeing the hotpots multiplying added could do with you boys advice on this something strange going on metal debris from the destruction of the aegis suggested brentwood lot of it would still be pretty hot even in the sea some of that in the sea i agree but this is all over the place on tatoosh island wheres that bird sanctuary no one allowed near it but our uav its showing hundreds of hotspots like damned confetti is this toosh island anywhere near where the aegis blew up no much further west course most of the hotspots im seeing could be body heat from the thousands of birds got every species here from little stormy petrels to giant albatross but theres other stuff too biggern damn houses along supposedly unpopulated stretches of the coast close those drapes freeman was startled by the police bullhorn but he walked over to the window and closed the curtains stealing a glance at the dark strait not a single light was visible where only shortly before it had been crowded with naval ships the remainder of what had been the turners battle group were recalled and now steaming back down through puget sound to its home port in everett the groups remaining attack sub slinking back unheralded to the protection of bangor base in bangor walter jensen was standing outside the blackedout admirals house waiting for the subs return what a humiliation he told margaret who stood silently by his side her hand gently moving back and forth across his steeltense back as he stared into the fogclogged darkness of hood canal battle group didnt even get past the choke point it im finished he said quietly he waited for her to cloister him as she always did but margaret said nothing walter jensen was telling the truth his chances of becoming cno replacing the soon retiring admiral nunn had been destroyed along with the careers of a sacrificial slew of officers unable to explain why on their watch the united states navy with all its billions of dollars worth of computers and other electronic wizardry including aircraftborne forwardlooking infrared scanners and magnetic anomaly detectors had failed to pick up either a heat signature or magnetic disturbance from the midget sub reported by seal diver rafe albinski â â â â a caller into larry kings interview with cno nunn which freeman had on in the background as aussie and david arrived was graciously trying to help walter jensen and by extension the navy and the us armed forces in general by surmising that even with all the scientific knowhow available it must be a much more difficult job to detect a midget sub than a regular one yes agreed nunn and if i could take your analogy further searching for a midget sub would be like looking for a single automobile dumped on the sea bottom as opposed to say looking for an amtrak train the next caller quipped if youre lookin for an amtrak admiral all you have to do is check with cnn see where the latest derailment is theyre goin off the rails bout one a day and if king cut him off obviously displeased with his call screener the next caller identified himself as a former electronics warfare officer and said the mad the stingray tail on any of the battle groups early warning planes or asw helos could easily have missed the midget because mads range of detection was limited to a third of a mile for bout six or seven hundred yards max either side of your track thats only bout as far as a par five thats a bogey ten for me quipped larry trying to ease the tension the admiral smiling the note of levity however backfired the caller becoming irate i dont see anything funny bout it weve lost more americans in that juan de fuca strait than we did on and were gonna lose more if we dont find out what the blip is going on youre quite right king responded how about the other detection gear sir this flir forward looking infrared how goods that its fine said the mollified caller but again how high are you flying best thing is to get satellite surveillance for that didnt admiral johnson larry began jensen the cno corrected politely sorry yeah jensen he said he got satellitereported anomalies in the strait early on and had em checked out yes answered the cno he dispatched a uav a predator no another type answered nunn can you tell me what kind it was no it was began the caller but king used his delay button to call up a commercial cno nunn visibly relaxing and thanking larry during the break a retiree right mused king stickin it to his old employer im gonna get crap though for cutting him off censorship blah blah blah nunn shrugged people generally understand its not a good idea to tell the enemy what kind of surveillance weve been using king didnt comment truth was the navy didnt think it was a good idea to tell anyone anything anywhere except come appropriations time on the hill the red light was back on admiral asked king you think the midget sub is still with us in our waters maybe its gone hit the aegis cruiser thatd be three in a row and ran nunn was caught unawares everyone even the maverick freeman was operating on the assumption the enemy sub was still there ah well i doubt its gone larry a midget sub doesnt move that fast underwater and hasnt got anywhere near the range of a normalsize sub garbage it was douglas freeman who now with aussie and david brentwood was listening to the king interview while still watching darkstars flight south of tatoosh island down the wild beauty of the pacifics pounded coastline here and there streaks of white appeared on the grayish screen not surf but isolated pristine beaches that marked the verdant and rocky edge of america what dyou mean garbage asked aussie cnos saying midget sub hasnt got enough speed or range freeman replied his eyes still fixed on darkstars feed damn piranhaclass midget can do near ten knots and run for over a thousand miles if its one of those it could be halfway to japan by now so you think the midgets taken off general put in aussie no why should it last kill less than twentyfour hours ago still undetected son of a freeman pointed at darkstars feed get a load of this boys the general pulled his head back from the screen to give them a better look there was a knock on the door a pause then four sharp rapid taps freeman pushed back his chair strode quickly to the door looked through the spy hole and opened the door a crack but left the chain on i gave at the office he quipped then slid off the chain and opened the door fully what we got general it was salvini trouble said freeman shaking hands with the brooklyn bad ass as he called salvini choir williams following smiled general the three men walked over to the laptop david and aussie exchanging greetings with the two newcomers aussie asking salvini whos your fat friend choir williams was in fact the slimmest aussie had ever seen him as trim as all of them except the general who as an inveterate jogger was in remarkably good shape for his age despite a slight postmiddleage paunch which he insisted was hereditary muscle there was an awkward moment as sal and choir realized david brentwood could shake only with his left hand well pressed the general his impatience and wish to avoid any further embarrassment to david disallowing his four exspecfor boys any opportunity to catch up on what each other had been doing in peacetimea word they habitually uttered with the same contempt as did a grounded fighter pilot what dyou make of these hed asked salvini and choir before they even put down their bags and heavy draeger rebreathers feed is coming in from south of cape flattery piloted recon asked sal uav explained freeman hotspot feed and we got a lot of small hot spots the salt shaker effect on tatoosh island off flattery birds yes but other big hotspots that aussie thinks are media news trucks among other things more big hotspots down on the pacific coast must be over forty so far and we havent reached father and son yet seals said salvini for a moment the general tired thought he meant seals that so said aussie doubtfully yeah said salvini confidently looking about the motel room for something to drink surprised you havent got more of em on that trace seals said freeman whose vanity habitually denied he was surprised by anything yeah repeated salvini his hands flapping in a bad imitation of the sea mammal you know flipper caves must be full of em seldom had sal choir aussie or david seen freeman so taken by surprise sea caves are full of em continued salvini thats why the ir hot spots youre seeing are so big well freeman began thats no damn good i figured on having you guys swim in and check out anything that might be the size of midget sub but dammit we havent enough people to investigate every damn cave up and down the coast he paused fixing an anxious brow on salvini how in gods name do you know this sal seals youre from brooklyn for gods sake the zoo said sal not seals but sea otters used to take my sisters kids in the evening took my squad ir goggles for fun so the kids could see the critters all nestled up in their lairs big white blobs just like on your ir feed right there they huddle together aw said aussie you dont know dick could be anything in those sea caves yeah conceded sal nonchalantly but if you look at the feeds scale he leaned closer two inches to the mile its got to be some pretty big mammals he paused joshing aussie maybe theyre elephants oh very droll sal said aussie ha ha wait a minute interjected david sal could be right general the midget sub could be using a seal colony as infrared cover choir goodnaturedly dismissed the idea of the enemy whoever they were using the collective heat signature of mammals as ir cover and what dyou know about mammals choir challenged aussie cept for those welsh tarts you used to bed ill ignore your antipodean vulgarity antipodean im an american citizen you welsh turd freeman ignoring aussies joshing pressed choir for his explanation of why terrorists wouldnt use such a cave noise answered choir ever hear the racket those creatures make its worse than aussies snoring so proffered the general what we need to look at are the caves without a hot spot a cold caves where the subs mother ship its milch cow a trawler whatever stashes its food torpedoes mines diesel fuel an otherwise empty cave sub comes in literally when the coast is clear surfaces inside the sea cave resupplies quickly and heads back out maybe suggested david thats why the navy hasnt seen any signs of the midget surfacing for air replenishment darkstar saw it freeman corrected him thats why jensen dispatched that rib with those divers albinski and he thought for a moment dixon he sighed in exasperation that general blackmore had been right when he told the west point graduates that nowadays youd have to be part detective to be a good soldier freeman played back the stored ir feed looking now for cold caves those whose residual daytimestored heat signatures were so slight hed passed them over it was a dispiriting exercise the cold cave count rose to and darkstar hadnt yet reached the big father and son sea stacks south of cape flattery would the navy have enough time to search them all before the sub attacked again or was larry kings suggestion accurate that perhaps the terrorists sub had had its fill of death and destruction now that the decimated battle group had retreated cold caves gentlemen he said with an anomaly near them thats what were looking for chapter twentythree in the hindu kush more fighting had broken out as a resurgent taliban battalion financed out of pakistan was infiltrating back into afghanistan to destabilize the nascent unprotected government in kabul which in fact was mainly a us operation the taliban leaders timing was brilliant to strike when the us homeland defense was consumed by a massive public panic attack even greater than that of if the terrorists or whoever could easily attack americas guardians who could guard the guardians the one qualified hope media pundits such as cnns marte price were saying was that as terrible as the attack on our navy is its so far been confined to military targets and not defenseless citizens silly woman opined freeman one ear listening to cnn the other to the suggestions of his four specfor warriors brainstorming about how to narrow the search for where the sub might be hiding marte should know better than that some poor son of a bitch civilians probably dead already caught in that rain of shrapnel when the aegis blew up the general was right and wrong a civilian night watchman carlito vincennes of cherry point had died three and a half minutes after hed seen a light which he thought was either out in the strait or in the woods across the bay it had looked to him like a camera flash then he saw that it was a narrower beam of white light a missile coming straight for him incoming he screamed into his walkietalkie twelve oclock low the ensuing line of explosions that engulfed the cherry point refinery as row upon row of storage tanks blew killed carlito and twentythree other civilian nightshift workers it also produced an enormous firestorm on land the burning oil disgorged from the destroyed storage tanks flowing into the sea and forming a ten to fifteen acre firespill whose black columns of choking smoke and flames did a macabre dance hundreds of feet into the air the heat was so intense that surrounding forests and bitumen roads caught fire as if by spontaneous combustion trapping hundreds of families in the long lines of refugee vehicles already fleeing the rumored danger of radiation leakage from the sunken aegis carrier and the utah but where had the missile come from incoming twelve oclock low had confounded cherry points head of security as a reserve member of the washington state national guard hed understood twelve oclock meant something had been coming headon at vincennes but from which direction land or sea in short what direction had vincennes been facing sea or land it was only later after square miles of prime northwest trees had been destroyed by the fire and the town of birch bay near cherry point was a charred smoking ruin that the already overstretched coast guard was able to triangulate the vectors from various reports about a flash of light they deduced that the missile had been fired from the sea so much for the midget having had its fill it was in fact even more audacious the reports of two trawlers one canadian and the other american estimated that the shoot and scoot firing of the skimmer had probably taken no more than four minutes including a possible crash dive freeman at least now felt confident that the midget subs pen probably lay somewhere between port angeles and cape flattery aussie lewis brentwood and salvini agreed with the generals hypothesis which revolved around the simple but unchanging requirement in war that the closer you were to your supplies the better no walmarts south of flattery said choir in his lilting welsh accent exactly confirmed freeman calling comsubpacgru to turn darkstar around back toward cape flattery from the cape it could do another run along the seventy miles of coastline to port angeles freeman lowering the ir intensity recognition level cold caves with a nearby anomaly freeman repeated thats what were looking for general wheres that navy nrb research sub asked aussie freeman glanced down at his watch the bags under his eyes evidencing his lack of sleep over the last twentyfour hours it should be here by now in fact the globemaster iii ferrying the us navys research sub had landed at the air naval station on whidbey island one of the most beautiful islands in america and among the longest the highly classified midget sub was the one bill heinz had in mind when he complained to charlie riser about the kind of secrecy interservice and interagency rivalry that prevented vital information from getting to the right people in time as had happened before while in the process of deplaning from the giant transport onto a widebodied mack hauler normally used to move houses up and down the island the marine guard platoon of thirty men aboard ten humvees were ordered to establish and maintain a no go zone even on the naval stations own runway to provide a moving protective moat of a hundred yards in diameter around the small nuclearpowered sub with deadly force authorized anyone uniformed or civilian violating the ngz was to be shot the problem however was that since the arrival of and transport of the sub was designated secret how could anyone be expected to know about the ngz it was bureaucratic nonsense but so worried were the navy and homeland defense about another attack following the cherry point disaster that the rules of antiterrorist warfare in the words of homeland defense director harry hawthorn would have to be amended as necessary whether such amendment however lay within the provenance of the marine guard officer on the spot or with comsubpacgrus jensen or with the commandant of the marines was not clear jensen having arrived and placed himself in the lead humvee had been fretting for hours about the safe delivery of the nrb sub to the launching ramp at keystone he was convinced that not only had his cno hopes gone down with turner utah and the aegis cruiser but any hitch en route to the ramp would mean the lesser but just as personally painful humiliation of demotion when his cell phone rang he started as if jabbed with a cattle prod his driver a gumchewing spanishamerican pfc mendez pretended not to notice margaret he snapped censoriously cnns reporting that john rorke and that scientist alicia mayne yes theyve been found adrift on some wreckage cnn says picked up off vancouver island being taken to port townsends hospital john rorke looks rough but hes all right he vindicated you on cnn said there was absolutely no warning when utah was hit the womans not so good burns from the waist up apparently there was an oil slick on fire after the boat had sunk margaret paused that cnn woman marte price has been calling left i dont know how many messages i think youre going to have to say something dear she called again just before when i get home he said sharply margaret could hear the background noise of the humvee and knew he must be with a driver ill send getwell cards and condolences to all the utahs boys and their families and to alicia payne mayne with an m yes said margaret ill try to see her what a dreadful time it is walter all those families admiral the humvees radio blared bravo one charlie one it was an incoming message from the first of the twenty outriders assigned to protect the nrb on its way to the keystone launch ramp we have a bogey five klicks from you describe cut in the convoys marine commander keep moving jensen told his humvee driver refugee column said the bravo one bout two hundred meters long on the road estimate ten to fifteen vehicles looks like mostly families fifty sixty people admiral said the marine major jensen knew the major was asking him who he wanted to exercise tactical command its your call major jensen told him yessir the major instructed bravo one get all those people out of the vehicles and off the road hundred yards away at least make sure no one repeat no one remains in the vehicles dogs cats nothing ill send replacement riders from bravo three to scout ahead of you while you take care of this roger that confirmed the bravo one leader who had already begun telling his men to move the refugees out of their cars and pickups into the adjacent field what bellowed one of the refugees an elderly man thats a damned cranberry bog in there under two three feet o water we got kids here move off the road now come on ralph a woman told the man do as they say thank you maam said the cop one of the local policemen with knowledge of the area whod been seconded to assist the marines guarding the convoy theres a good reason for it damn well better be growled ralph but the cop and his other four comrades in bravo one were relieved everyones nerves were on edge some of the police riders own families were leaving the island american refugees one of the cops had said it breaks your heart how long we got to wait asked ralph no moren an hour chief jesus christ you know how cold it is in those damn cranberry bogs ralph cmon no sense in arguin they got the guns it was pm and charles riser whod been unsuccessful in attempts to get through to general chang whom he hoped might have learned something more about li kuans whereabouts had caught the redeye flight to nanjing hed been waiting impatiently outside nanjing military district hq since am once more he pressed the button general changs aidedecamp a smartly turned out young captain in sharply creased field greens appeared and again riser asked politely to see the general the response was in immaculate mandarin the general is in conference and cannot be for four hours pressed riser you did tell him it was urgent yes mr riser came the reply this time in perfect english the sudden switch from mandarin calculated riser thought to surprise him it did by the time hed thought of a followup question changs aide had closed the door again riser heard the slide of the dead bolt damn now he was absolutely sure chang wasnt in nanjing had they arrested him meanwhile the us embassy in beijing was receiving complaints about risers persistence military affairs nanjing reminded bill heinz were not mr risers concern finally bill heinz asked to see the ambassador and told him straight out mr ambassador i like charlie riser as much as anybody else and i realize the death of young mandy has undone him but we all have our problems and we have to move on hes making a damn nuisance of himself with the pla thought that was your job bill said the ambassador flippantly bill heinz flashed his diplomatic smile this time he took off to nanjing to see general chang on our time or his ah his took two days leave but our money or his bill havent checked sir but the point is if we dont rein him in states going to get a formal complaint from beijing and well be in deep shit pardon my english and we need all the help we can get from china in this war against terrorism youre right bill ill have a word with him thank you sir ill call him tell him its official hes to come back immediately charlies exasperation at not being able to see chang the only chinese official whod really tried to help him after mandys death got worse with china airs delayed departure to beijing typically there was only one attendant at the china air counter to calm the throng of impatient travelers whats the problem asked an australian backpacker wheres the bloody plane the girl threw up her hands china air all in a mess youre right there sweetheart said the australian how bout some tucker you know food weve been waitin here for bloody hours you owe us a meal i reckon other backpackers joined in most of them trying to leave china as quickly as possible before the war with taiwan trapped them taiwanese missiles could hit all of chinas mainland coastal airports and beijing riser stayed out of the counter squabble the us cultural attaché wasnt hungry the only reason he ate at all was to keep his strength up for his mission to track down li kuan and the thugs whod murdered his daughter the crowd closing in on china airs lone clerk was so dense a wave of claustrophobia passed over him mr riser the voice came from somewhere deep within the increasingly angry mob charles couldnt see her but knew immediately it was wu ling changs mistress who had also been mandys closest friend in china then he spotted her there was fear in her eyes but he sensed it wasnt from the threat of the mob getting out of control a fear every longstay foreigner in china had experienced at least once in china suddenly the crowd withdrew from the counter like a wave sucked back into the sea taking wu ling with it a halfdozen or so airport staff had arrived behind the crowd and were carrying precariously stacked boxes of dinners several people were trampled underfoot and there was screaming and general mayhem it took wu ling several minutes to get free she told charles she didnt have much time that the gong an bu were following her whats wrong he asked as her perfume washed over him he could see mandy they had both worn what was it guilin mist the general she began buffeted to and fro in an eddy of the muttonandricecrazed crowd he has been arrested and put in her english suddenly deserted her prison charles said yes in prison it is very bad why was he the army in kazakhstan is being pushed back by the terrorists so hes the scapegoat said charles hes being held responsible yes responsible i must go she said and disappeared into the throng no doubt charles thought the gong an bu had been following her on the flight to beijing the pilot announced that the pla had won a great victory the island of kinmen had fallen to the combined might of the pla defense forces and the party was confident that total victory over the breakaway province of taiwan would be attained within a matter of days the plane erupted in applause and raucous selfcongratulations what about those bastard terrorists in kazakhstan someone called out a man from first class entered coach class he didnt look like a highlevel party functionary to riser but more like a gong an bu agent there was a thuggish air about him despite the welltailored mao suit he talked to the man whod raised the question about the plas offensive against the muslim terrorists in kazakhstan the man a short pastyfaced individual looked terrified the man from first class bending over him charles ordered a tsing tao beer he needed to relax everything was getting too hyper confusing should the us be backing the pla offensive in kazakhstan if china had started a war against taiwan whatever the situation surely the us in its own interests if not those of the taiwanese couldnt let the island nation be governed by the communists it was americas airstrip in east asia the cold war charlie mused for all its anxiety was at least clearer or seemed so but sipping his beer he concluded that probably in every war including this one the present always seemed confusing as confusing as the jigsaw puzzle of world war i which with benefit of hindsight seemed remarkably easy to understand in fact as any historian knew it had been a puzzling complex of alliances backroom deals and parties who were friends one month and enemies the nextplus ça change plus cest la même chose he remembered his grandfather one of the very few world war ii veterans still alive telling him about the utter confusion during that war when it came to who was on whose side italy was against us then with us the romanians switched back and forth some ukrainians fought with the nazis and france was britains great ally but not vichy france churchill ordered the british navy to sink the great french fleet in north africa killing french sailors allies only weeks before to ensure that the nazis could not use the french fleet once france had fallen louis mountbatten supreme commander of allied forces in the far east accepted the japanese surrender in only to turn around and rearm the japanese using them as an ad hoc police force throughout burma and southeast asia to prevent rioting mobs the very people mountbatten had been fighting for a few weeks earlier great or small charlie decided all war was byzantine and all he cared about was living to see li kuan like saddam hussein hunted down and killed that wasnt confusing chapter twentyfour port townsend i need some fresh air announced aussie anyone else ill come said david sal and choir ignoring scatological insults from aussie about welsh wankers and brooklyn dodgers being lazy elected to catch some sleep in the motel room freeman had booked for them down the hall outside the streets were all but deserted only patrol cars with slit wartime headlights moving slowly to enforce the curfew a few dark shapes were visible in the weak penumbra of police headlights as people scuttled here and there briefly silhouetted as they quickly slipped in and out of stores for emergency supplies the coast guard canadian as well as american were assuring the population via radio and tv that there was no danger of leaking radiation from the sunken vessels that all the reactors on nuclearpowered us warships were built to such rigorous standards that there is little possibility of a split in the reactor a motorcade passed by aussie and david including a navy staff car bearing margaret jensen on a mission of mercy to woodgate hospital her intention was to show fearlessness in the face of the radioactivity scare and visit as many of the victims as she could first she wanted to see alicia mayne and the other survivors of utah also concerned about the welfare of the survivors of the sinkings the commander of fort lewis had called freeman telling him it would be a good idea to have medal of honor winner brentwood make himself useful at the hospital be a damned good morale lift for our men and women and itd take him out of himself good idea agreed freeman thinking you wily polecatcant let the navy grab marte prices attention army medal of honor winner beats an admirals wife any day of the week and the chiefs of staff at the pentagon would like what fort lewis did ill send him up general said freeman howd he do with the bullpup the fort lewis commander inquired not well said freeman bluntly tired from watching darkstars feed so now he knows said the commander not sure about that said freeman have him wear the ribbon douglas freeman called david on his cell phone captain get your butt up to the hospital you are to go about shake hands with those poor bastards and smile you know marte price yes sir skirt with the big tits it wasnt david but lewis listening in as usual lewis general you get back here monitor the uav rerun youve had enough fresh air roger that david flipped the cell phone shut old man he told aussie didnt like that what you said about the cnn reporter aussie shrugged as they headed back past the ferry terminal to the east lay whidbey island where if all went well the navy would be launching the nrb dont shag any of the nurses up there he called back to david who was already ascending the hill toward the hospital pretending not to hear david knew his mission to the hospital was merely to smile and say a few words of encouragement but after afghanistan he felt like a fake the exiting air from the hospitals wards hit him in a toxic blast of charcoalreeking burned flesh oil and antiseptics mounds of soiled and bloodsoaked sheets blackened and singed naval uniforms and ruined clothes that had belonged to civilians caught up in the infernos of the multiple disasters were now piling up in the corridors faster than the frantic staff could dispose of them in already overflowing dumpsters the ash of the hospitals incinerator fell outside like gray snow as the staff worked overtime to cremate limbs and flesh contained in thick recycled paper shrouds designated by hurriedly wielded marker pens as unusable any possible skin graft material being rushed in sterilized containers to the refrigerators it was a scene so suffused with urgency and horror that david turned around to leave the last thing anyone in this hospital needed was some medal of honor winner getting in the way when a split seconds delay in inserting an iv tube or in any of the surgical lifesaving procedures the er staff were carrying out could cost someone their life captain brentwood david brentwood the womans voice was accompanied by a glare of light from a shoulderheld kemo tv camera a scruffy looking gumchewing technician in obligatory faded jeans and what freeman would have called a halfass beard approaching david the reporter despite the long rushed trip from atlanta looked as alert and as wellcoiffed as any wellrested anchor she extended her right hand her left clasping the phallicshaped mike captain im marte price before he knew it david was shaking hands with the woman she was taller than she looked on tv where her legs shapely as they were were not on display unlike her bosom which had stopped many a channel surfer dead in his tracks her height added to her aura of vivacious authority despite his annoyance with her sudden and what he considered rude interruption david felt a surge of excitement in his loins her sexuality her perfume was so alive and contrary to the misery and death surrounding them that he had no control over the kind of excitement she infused in him a kind hed not known since long before his nearmortal wounding in afghanistan would you please move that contraption came a doctors angry voice this is a hospital not hollywood squares marte smiled graciously and asked where she might conduct the interview with captain brentwood who was visiting his wounded comrades the doctor oblivious to the correspondents charm raised his lab coats bloodspattered arm and pointed brusquely to an orderly behind them near the elevator ask him thank you captain brentwoods a medal of honor recipient marte said and but the doctor had already walked away informing incoming paramedics that theyd have to use their ambulance gurneys as beds for their patients no more room marte price worked her charm on the orderly who steered them to a room down by a supply room theyre all dead in there the orderly said itll be quiet though after entering the dark room there was something wrong with the light switch martes cameraman turning on his videos light started in fright so did david jesus said the cameraman a man was standing by one of the beds who are you captain rorke marte prices shock at hearing the strangely disembodied voice in the nearly dark room was immediately pushed aside by her realization that shed lucked out rorke john rorke gold jerry the cameraman told marte pure gold she knew it forget the wounded an exclusive interview with the utah captain theyd have to find his cap she thought or one like it wet and oily if possible would be more impressive can we bring in more lights she asked rorke maybe one no more shes in enough pain already itll blind her david brentwood his eyes now accustomed to the semidarkness the pervasive atmosphere of burned oil and flesh about him and the wokkawokka sound of rescue helicopters still bringing in wounded was momentarily brought back to the cave during the pave lows approach now in the glow of the other light that was brought in he saw the patient her face badly scorched a skull cap of white bandages where her hair had been and a semioval torsolength frame like a wooden cage from her neck down to her waist rorke seeing davids concern explained to him that the frame was to keep the sheet from touching the part of her that must have been burned above the waterline as she struggled like hundreds of others to escape the encroaching firespills spawned by ruptured hydraulic lines on the sub david sensed that rorkes vigil was more than that of a commander trying to comfort his crew what was she doing on the sub he asked softly he knew congress was pushing for women on subs since other countries had already initiated such a program but david guessed this would be the first female combat death on a sub rorke didnt answer and it took a few seconds for david to realize that the skipper of americas most potent weapons platform the exskipper rather wasnt refusing to answer but was suffering from tinnitus the ringing in the ears that so often followed the noise of massive detonations in rorkes case it had been the horrendous roar of explosions that ripped his prized boat apart and killed most of his crew what was her job david asked rorke his voice raised above the noise of the cameraman setting up civilian specialist john rorke replied david nodded knowingly whats her name alicia said rorke softly alicia mayne and david understood in a flash that rorke had been in love was in love with the dying woman in one of those moments that sometimes only complete strangers share in the darkened interior of a night flight or train knowing theyll probably never meet again when the heart is unashamed and free brentwood a man whose natural inclination was to always mind his own business never to intrude asked can she hear you at all if i lean close stay close david told him close as you can david knew rorke didnt want to be part of any interview but probably felt duty bound to do so david walked over to marte price lets do a ward tour he said ill speak to some of the wounded she thanked him but said that first she wanted an interview with rorke no you do me with the wounded captain brentwood ill decide when and who david looked over at the submariner captain rorke will do an interview with you cnn exclusive in an hour he turned to the cameraman then lets go down the corridor try to keep out of the staffs way he had to stop talking until the thudding of a coast guard choppers blades faded from the hospitals parking lot ill give you an interview ill give you my background on the way he told marte price marte saw there was no arguing with this brentwood hed come across initially as a lamb now he was a lion this medal thing had gone to his head ive already got your background she said youre supposed to be the shy and retiring type the aw shucks hero do we have a deal an exclusive with you captain rorke marte asked fox guys are everywhere exclusive agreed rorke before he left the room to join the pr rep marte price and her cameraman in the blinding white light of the corridors heavy traffic of hospital staff david spoke quietly to john rorke you need anything captain i dont think so you were last wounded in afghanistan right marte price asked david as they moved down the hellish corridor yes he told her thats right at tora bora yes can you tell me what happened in the public ward they could hear the desperate cries of the wounded not yet treated with painkillers pending diagnosis from doctors who despite help from the whidbey island navy medics remained overwhelmed were out of morphine a harried nurse reported theyd all begun calmly and professionally but the sheer fatigue of overload was drowning the best intentions use demerol its gone a drugged young submariner was pleading with a doctor not to amputate his leg it had in fact already been taken off but he was feeling the phantom sensation of it his arms and legs bandaged so heavily that he couldnt remove the sheet or bed covers to check and everyone else was too busy with freeman asleep aussie lewis had been monitoring the ir feed from darkstars last leg home between cape flattery near tatoosh island eastward to port angeles when he noticed what appeared to be a seaairinterface anomaly very close in to the coast which was indented by caves both hot and cold the zoom didnt help much because the number of pixels making up the picture diluted the color of the surrounding sea as well so there now appeared a less distinct variation between the color of the suspected anomaly and the water about it but the zoom did show him that the patch hed zeroed in on wasnt so much circular as a tadpole shape on his own recognizance aussie called the coast guard at port angeles keeping his voice low so as not to wake freeman whose sheepdoglike snoring reverberated through the motel room he explained what hed seen and on the generals behalf requested that the port angeles coast guard station send out a fast rib to have a looksee are you nuts he was told weve already lost a guy besides weve got every bruiser out theyre still bringing in sur the man stopped abruptly aussie could hear voices in the background then someone else came on the line have you tried the oceanographic and torpedo recovery vessel petrel ii its been busy picking up people too but its pretty well equipped if its in the area it could probably drop over a bottle im guessing you want a water sample for an isotope match thatd tell you whether its oil or garbage or both you got it said aussie if its an oil spill and theres no match for it in the coast guards isotope register then well know its from an intruder and if thats the case ill bet its the sub i can call petrel if you like offered the coast guard officer no sweat ill do it frank halls the skipper right you know him exseal buddy of mine taught im everything he knows fine said the officer listen sorry about the guy who answered he lost his wife on the turner poor bastard said aussie he shouldnt be on duty i know but we need everyone we can get sides hes hellbent about staying on wants to get even dont we all thanks buddy ill call the petrel whats going on asked the general sitting on the edge of the sofa yawning his shock of silvergray hair disheveled possible seaair anomaly on the darkstar trace lewis told him close inshore chapter twentyfive as tough as he was oceanographer and exseal frank hall could not bring himself to drive petrel as he tersely put it straight through the fogbound waters of juan de fuca strait that he was sure still contained scores of bodies accordingly he had given petrels second mate instructions to strip the sterns aframe of the practice torpedo retrieval tackle and replace it with a quicksnap release line with which petrel could tow her twelvefootlong zodiac with the third mate sandra riley and two men aboard the zodiac it could be cast off from petrel if need be to pick up any survivors or bodies that hall or his lookouts on petrels bridge might see en route or to get a quick water sample from the darkstar anomaly for isotope comparison six and a half miles from the airsea tadpoleshaped patch the petrels starboard lookout did see something orange bobbing up and down in the fogshrouded chop hall doubted it was a body it looked more like a piece of debris nevertheless he alerted the third mate to its position heard the loud twostrokelike roar of the zodiacs outboard then saw it as it sped bumpily past petrel its bow smacking hard against the waves which was the price of being out of sync with the frequency of the swells as a result the third mate and her two crew were jarred from head to foot a splatter of spray thrown up by the zodiac along with a whiff of its gasoline exhaust swept onto the bridge by a westerly wind coming in from the open sea through the choke point between the olympic peninsula and vancouver island the wind starting to disperse the fog couldnt be much louder said the bosun looking down at the zodiac glad were not on a silent mission uhhuh replied frank but i like it loud in our work he meant torpedo retrieval if i cant see it i can hear it true agreed the bosun his legs wide apart his torso leaning forward against the bridges brass rail as he fixed his binoculars on the orange object son of a bitch its a zipup what asked the portside lookout you know thermal survival suit arctic rated like a waterproof sleeping bag zips up to your eyes float on your back right skipper if youre lucky said frank and dont get concussed facedown before you hit the water zodiacs just about on it reckon whoever torpedo screamed the station lookout two oclock two hundred yards which was the limit of petrels visibility frank hit the stern thruster button felt the ship surge another three knots and spun the wheel right to the starboard quarter a fast white streak two feet wide passed parallel to them on the left side less than five feet from petrels hull holy shit holy be quiet hall told the lookout keep a sharp watch there could be a pair jesus said the lookout despite halls admonition he was wheyfaced as was the portside lookout the latters eyes big as saucers staring down at the sea hey it was the cook on the intercom that fucker was a dummy right captain dont know said frank werent notified could be a communication screwup down aft on the stern deck several offwatch crew whod been observing the zodiac fading away in the distance as petrel closed on the anomaly two miles away were also arguing vociferously about the torpedo it wasnt live for chrissake asserted the winch man whod hauled up albinskis grisly remains it was one of ours how do you know an oiler buddy challenged throwing a wipe rag at him you were asleep you fat fart laughter erupted from the group a little too hysterical the bosun thought it was the kind of response hed heard while serving aboard a fleet replenishment ship during desert storm the sort of laughter that was more a release of tension after a close miss than because of anything funny hall appeared on the bridges starboard wing immediately recognizable by his navy toque yellow wetweather jacket and hailer everybody back to work i want six additional lookouts two forard two midships two aft its possible there might be more survivors yes sir any news from the zodiac about the zipup no not yet was that a live torpedo sir asked an oiler emerging from the galley i dont know replied frank ill find out with that he returned to the bridge course it was live said one of the deck crew as they began to disperse thats why he wants more lookouts right dont sweat it he told us hes on to it hell tell us as soon as he knows hes a straight shooter yeah mumbled the departing oiler like the guy who fired that damn torpedo can barely see our zodiac now commented the first mate his binoculars back on the zodiac but it looks as if theyre hauling someone aboard anomaly one thousand yards reported the first mate prepare for station frank announced on the ships pa while punching in slow ahead on the computer console petrels third mates voice crackled into the chart room aft of the bridge her voice of exhaustion and depression giving way to an oxymoronic report to hall survivor dead bring im in said frank who now made a gps check it showed that due to winds and tidal shift petrel was a quarter mile west of the oil spill if thats what the anomaly was he corrected course watching the sweep arm on his amber radar screen picking up the tiny blip that was the despondent third mate and the two crewmen returning to petrel with the bright dayglo survival suit the corpse was of a darkcomplexioned man late forties or perhaps younger looking older because of the bluish pallor of his skin a man whom no one on the petrel recognized like so many of the dead they and the coast guard had fished out from the strait in the last fortytwo hours for a moment as he thought about all those who had died in the frigid waters frank remembered his granddads favorite hymn oh hear us when we cry to theefor those in peril on the sea his thoughts were suddenly put to flight by a voice invading petrel on the radios shipping channel for ferries the voice screaming for help it was the first officer aboard the georgia queen one of the fivedeckhigh fivehundredvehicle twothousandpassenger ferries that daily plied the waters of georgia strait on the thirtymile run between vancouver island and vancouver on the canadian mainland perhaps the canadians whose west coast ferry fleet was bigger than the entire canadian navy had believed that all the attacks so far had taken place in american waters he thought and believed they would not fall victim to whoever was wreaking havoc with their neighbor theoretically their assumption might have been wellfounded after all though some canadians were killed in the assault on america canada itself had remained untouched but no longer for as the torpedo fired at petrel missed the oceanographic ship it continued on at fiftyplus knots by frank halls guesstimate and in apparent free running rather than active or passive acoustic mode for another fourteen miles crossing the uscanada line passing through a pod of orcas that fifty or so passengers on the ferry had braved the foul weather to see among the whale watchers a retired british naval petty officer whod seen action in the falklands war of witnessing the sinking of the argentine battleship belgrano by torpedo raced along the ferrys upper deck to the bridge yelling torpedo starboard beam the mate on the bridge of georgia queen against all intention and training with the ferry corporation became so rattled by the radio officers hysterical mayday that he failed to turn the vessel in time the torpedo struck the ferry starboard aft the force of the explosion lifting her stern clear of the water over a hundred cars suvs and eighteenwheeled freight trucks sliding en masse smashing into a hill of cars trailways buses and motorcycles piled up against the huge curving doors and ramp a flood of gasoline and diesel fuel from ruptured tanks suddenly reversing course rushing aft as the ferrys stern fell back into the sea this in turn lifted the bow at a precipitous angle moments before the vessel broke in half the two sections drifting apart hundreds of passengers on each of the three decks spilling into the sea from the violence of the separation it was as if a buzz saw had neatly cut through the model of a ship only here the avalanche of toysize figures and vehicles dropping into the ocean were not toys the sickening thuds the coast guard and operators were hearing in the background of frantic cell phone calls for help were the sound of men women and children some of whom had jumped striking the hard metal of either sinking vehicles or the metal of the lower decks among the two square miles of oily flotsam and debris the bodies of a baby orca and several sea otters could be seen along with dozens of drowned cats and dogs that by regulation had been required to be kept below in their owners vehicles during transit dead guide dogs were also among the animals hauled aboard by the crews of rescuing coast guard cutters only one guide dog a black lab survived swimming for all its might vainly trying to drag its owner an elderly woman to safety aboard an upturned beaufort raft the exhausted dog unable to get purchase on the oilslicked rubber surface kept falling back into the water the earlier lustrous sheen of her coat now looking like an oilmatted pelt as she drifted further away it was cnns shot of this dog taken by marte prices cameraman after theyd left the hospital that arrested charles risers attention along with that of millions of other viewers for charlie riser the dogs black matted coat bore an uncanny resemblance to the photographs showing mandys hair after shed been pulled from the suzhou canal it galvanized his determination to press bill heinz to find out where chang was imprisoned aboard petrel now within a hundred yards of the tadpoleshaped oil slick picked up earlier by darkstar the third officer sandra riley whose discovery of the dead man in the dayglo survival suit had badly shaken her nevertheless felt duty bound to ask hall shouldnt we turn about sir go help the coast guard pick up survivors from the ferry no said frank not till we get that water sample for freeman that could be crucial to whom the mate snapped freeman that guys just like patton an all those other glory hounds they only care about calm down hall said just as sharply the water sample could save a lot more lives than those lost on that ferry if we dont find an international isotope fingerprint in this slick it means that the oils an outside batch and belongs to some vessel that doesnt want to be identified like a midget sub got it sorry captain no need youre tired we all are go down to the galley grab a cup of java take a breather and frank stopped talking and cut the petrels engines she was in the slick and from the starboard foldout platform just big enough for a man to stand on he saw his bosun hook up the safety chain rail and raise his right hand moving it in a clockwise circular movement the signal for the winch man to start lowering the fiftypound quarterinch cable through the block above the platform frank heard the whine of the winch saw the lead weight penetrate the seas choppy surface and the bosun give the stop signal as he reached out from the platform and affixed the neilsen reversing sample bottle to the wire satisfied that the bottom wing nut clamp was secure on the cable the bosun next attached the grenadesized brass messenger a sleeve weight that once struck by another messenger sent down the wire would trigger the sudden upside down flip of the sampling bottle breaking the mercury column on its sidemounted thermometer and thus preserving the exact temperature reading at that depth albinski had had such a thermometer on his attack board the bosun gave the take her down slowly signal and the neilsen bottle was lowered under the oil slick there was a heavy thud felt by cookie in the kitchen as the winch man braked the bosun fixed the trigger messenger to the wire let it fall down the cable heard the clack of the impact and saw oily black bubbles fizzing to the surface only seconds after the bottle had tripped bring her up he shouted to the winch man who couldnt hear him but followed the up up up motion of the bosuns hand as the bosun unclipped the bottle he almost lost his grip on the bottles oilslicked casing only then did frank hall turn petrel about and head at full speed northward to assist in yet another forlorn rescue task this time around the sunken ferry one of the coast guard ships would be able to do a preliminary isotope presence test if there was no isotope matchup it was almost certain that theyd zoned in on the subs area and the juan de fuca tide flow charts would allow freemans specfor team to backtrack to where the spill had started chapter twentysix moving briskly down the carriers six steep grated aluminum ladder wells that led from the cnn mccains island to the gallery deck immediately below the carriers flight deck admiral crowley walked quickly forward through the quartermilelong creamcolored corridor the six thousand crew members referred to it as the steeple chase due to the scores of ovalshaped and watertight doors that had to be passed through at some risk to knees if you were short like crowley or your head if like petty officer sarah dugan you were among the taller crew members turning at right angles to the main axis of the boat crowley entered a cross passageway that took him farther inboard crew with photo ids clipped to their uniforms turned aside to allow the admiral to pass for despite the enormous size of americas largest ship her corridors were relatively narrow every inch of available space was needed to house the millions of pieces of equipment needed for mccain to carry out its mission to transport americas big stick into the taiwan strait to contain the war between china and the roc before the conflict widened in asia and drew the already overextended us military into what the pentagon told the president would be a logistical abyss crowley now approaching the nerve center of the ton carrier was leaving the gray area of the ship and entering what the crew called blue tile country which housed the highly sensitive datalinked command and control functions of the carrier these included the combat information center where crowley was now headed the joint intelligence center and the ultrasecret sses the secret signals exploitation space a highly sophisticated electronic snooping and worldwide computer spy shop that could provide the captain with links to all us intelligence agencies and infrared satellite surveillance of enemy movements on the ground all the information collected in this relatively small but securely guarded unit could be linked to the big screens and consoles in the other four independently housed command and control units all these units were bathed in a perpetual cool blue light hence the nickname blue tile countrythe temperature kept low in order to keep the banks of computers and electronic equipment from overheating in their high intensity operation the moment crowley entered the combat information center he reached for his wellworn lambswoollined world war ii bomber jacket and zipped it up to the neck whatve we got he asked the cic duty officer john cuso whose calm expression made faintly ghoulish in the cool bluish light concealed his concern his tone was thoroughly professional worthy of the aviators code he still lived by despite having been permanently grounded after a burst blood vessel during a basketball game that had ended his days in his beloved tomcat cuso drew crowleys attention to the big blue situation board its surface crisscrossed with vectors and blips showing the position of mccains present combat patrol the carrier group now leaving the northernmost waters of the south china sea passing into the southernmost limits of the taiwan straits cuso pointed to the biggest blip on the screen it was coming in from the northeast sir this typhoon out of japan is picking up speed lost some energy during landfall over japan but on encountering less friction over the sea of japan its winds have increased to miles an hour by the time we enter the taiwan strait airs gonna be full of all kinds of junk interjected crowley yes sir itll be like a giant vacuum cleaner if it passes over taiwan and were in late fall end of the harvest in the fields on the western side of the islandll mean all kinds of debris plus the damn fires our satellites show over quemoy kinmen cuso corrected his boss crowley was old school had flown skyraider infantry support in vietnam and like others of his generation the old chinese names stuck cuso didnt like correcting him but some terrible mistakes had been made on bombing missions by getting the names mixed up the one the instructors had always used as a warning at the flight school was bangor maine and bangor washington state then well have to make sure everyone in the air wing knows said crowley emphasis brown shirts by which crowley meant plane captains not the brown jerseyed helo captains who wore the same color but sported red helmets to differentiate them from the whitehelmeted plane captains whose job it was to be mother to his or her particular aircraft in fact john cuso the black sheen of his skin speckled by goose bumps from the chilly atmosphere of the cic had posted a dirty air alert it meant that flight deck personnel were to be particularly vigilant for foreign object debris on the walkdown of the flight deck that preceded every launch all the personnels eyes as well had to be protected by goggles and the footlong footwide rubberized nonskid deck was to be closely inspected for anything no matter how small which would quickly destroy a multimilliondollar jet engine if sucked into its intake a beeping invaded the low hum of the cic john cuso hearing we have a leaker one of the electronic warfare officers informing cic that an unknown aircraft coming out of the northeast quadrant had violated the battle groups air space computer analysis vectors leading to and from the x blipping on the powder blue screen put the bogeys speed at mach the mccains combat air patrol of four fs was flying at thirty thousand feet already on an intercept course the intruder up to now having evaded the mccains battle groups radar by flying at plus or minus two hundred feet above the sea a skimmer inquired cuso calmly confident that the mccains combat air patrol on strict radio silence would be within visual contact in ten minutes dont think its a skimmer sir answered an ewo his computers together with the target acquisition system telling him the bogey was too fast for an enemy cruise missile and an intermittent profile of the crosssectional area glimpsed by the carriers radar was too large for faster pilotless vehicles how sure are you crowley pressed the electronic warfare officer that its an aircraft not a skimmer ninety percent sure sir crowley was tempted to break radio silence and take the consensus of his two aegis cruisers and the destroyers that made up the mccains protective screen but his natural curiosity was sidelined by his responsibility to deny any potential adversary the exact position of his battle group cuso knew the admirals decision was probably at odds with the white houses wish to let beijing and taipei know that the police were coming as it were to stop the fighting but with the disastrous events that had sunk three of the us navys ships in the strait of juan de fuca cuso favored his bosss caution both men like the six thousand people in mccain plus the thousands more manning her battle group had personally known many of those killed and missing besides in five minutes mccains cap would establish if the bogey was a hostile and if so shoot it down and if the cap didnt make the kill though why crowley couldnt imagine then either the battle groups formidable aegis cruisers arleigh burke destroyers or the duo of fast attack submarines most certainly would typhoon janes winds had increased speed to miles an hour and admiral crowley returning to primary flight control six stories above the flight deck heard the typhoons advance gusts howling around the carriers superstructure as the huge airfield kept plowing into the taiwan strait at knots the planes parked on the flight deck were chained down as tightly as those in the hangar deck the huge gray ship trembling in its lower regions from the reverberations of its four nucleargenerated steam engines which were driving the four massive shafts of the carrier and all aboard her into harms way the four super hornets of mccains combat air patrol peeled off high above the bogey it was still flying so low that as lieutenant commander chipper armstrongs f super hornet broke through the thick gray nimbostratus that was preceding typhoon jane by miles he made visual contact with the speck moving southeast toward the carriers battle group the blip on his radar and its concomitant altitude reading seemed at odds however his radar was telling him the bogey was feet above the deck or sea level his eyes looking through the sun visor of his helmet telling his brain that the unidentified craft was within arms reach of the wrinkled gray sea in the backseat of the hornet chippers rio radar intercept officer eagle evans socalled because of his exceptional daytime vision flicked on his digital reconnaissance camera selecting zoom and linkup to chippers righthand digital display indicator so that chipper could now receive realtime images of the bogey its an roc said evans taiwanese an f thats a fighting falcon to you what the hells it doing here asked chipper lost his way proffered evans check out its left wings flaperons i see em said chipper armstrong his eyes following the line of dimesize bullet holes that extended all the way forward of the fighting falcons rear ventral fins to the leading edge of the fighters cropped delta wing and up to the planes big telltale bubble cockpit the hornets zoom caught a blinding flash from the falcons bubble which was the gold sprayed inside to stealth the aircraft from radar waves that gold just freaked out the zoom rio evans commented the presence of the pneumonic gray stratus doing little to reduce the gold bubble effect i think his nav equipments shot to hell chipper could be responded armstrong from those holes forward of his ventrals id say he took a full burst in the kidneys can you see him asked evans negative but its the damned gold cockpit armstrong moved the stick hard left to give the hornets disc camera a less direct angle of approach the falcon looking to armstrong as if it was still on a straight perhaps autocontrolled flight path his assumption was confirmed by the hornets left digital display telling him the falcon was feet above the sea and three miles below the mccains cap its speed mph armstrongs four super hornets descending at mach simultaneously moved out of their lineabreast combat pairs into the more open fluid four formation its two leaders armstrong on the left rhino manowski on his right scanning forward each of their wingmen behind them and off to the side their responsibility being to watch fore and aft of the four hornets formation chipper armstrong and his rio on the front left of the formation were ten thousand feet from their caps righthand leader and his rio the distance between each leader hornet and wingman however was much closer this spread between leader and minder no more than a thousand feet this left chipper armstrong and rhino manowski as the front pair of the fluid four formation freer to concentrate on the roc taiwanese fighting falcon that seemed devoid of human guidance hes moving announced eagle evans chippers rio chipper fighting a sudden wind shear that was shooting up in excess of knots per hour it violently buffeted armstrong and evanss hornet for four seconds the strength of the phantoms upblast no doubt having enveloped the fighting falcon with such force that armstrong and his wingman aft left of him came to the same conclusion that any movement theyd glimpsed in the falcons cockpit almost certainly had been due to the roc pilots body being shaken by the hammerlike blows of the wind shear column colliding with the falcons air drag putting the falcon momentarily into boneshake mode before its autopilot computer effected flap and hi stabilizer corrections i dunno chipper said evans hesitantly he thought hed seen the roc pilot move forward from the falcons maximum thirtydegree recline position but he wasnt sure which meant he wasnt sure whether the pilot was alive evanss hesitation was a manifestation of the doubt born the day after he and armstrong had completed their sixweeklong cadet aviation preflight indoctrination course at pensacola florida both men along with dozens of other hopefuls passed their rigorous aerodynamics survival physiology escape and navigation training tests but evans learned that while hed been rated above average hed flunked the test for navy aviator nighttime vision at twentythree he saw it as a colossal personal failure despite the instructors slapontheback advice that the responsibility in the backseat was huge damn pilot cant do much if he doesnt know where the hell he is evans evans had given the appropriate right stuff smile sides added the instructor once your tours are up youre gonna be one helluva lot more employable than an aviator fighter pilots arent in big demand among civilian airlines you will be evans had nodded remaining unassuaged for navy aviators pilots and rios flying a civilian airliner was referred to disparagingly as flying a bus back in the present evans thought that maybe chipper was right perhaps the roc pilot hadnt moved and had the falcon on full auto he hoped so because if the pilot was hurt too badly to eject then the auto was his only hope at least as long as his fuel lasted by now the blue screens in mccains inner sanctums were showing first four then eight twelve sixteen twentyfour bogeys entering the mccain battle groups no fly combat zone at a point fiftysix miles east of oluanpi taiwans most southerly point neither admiral crowley nor his battle group staff had any idea why taiwans air force would be there when taiwans roc pilots were committed to protecting their islands western approaches particularly at kinmen island if the bogeys turned out to be taiwanese they would be classified as friendlies and nothing to worry about either for chipper armstrongs cap miles northwest of the carrier or for the battle group itself but then the mccains sses the ships signal exploitation space the innermost sanctum reported detecting via satellite infrared data uplink an unmistakable triple e enemy electronic emission pulsing from the twentyfour bogeys that were now directly south of oluanpi crowley knew this could mean only one thing that the bogeys were now indisputably hostiles chicom aircraft completing an end run down taiwans east coast and around its southernmost point in order to sandwich the taiwanese pilots who low on gas would be returning from the combat zone over kinmen which meant the twentyfour chicoms had refueled while in the air a feat that given the high advance winds of typhoon jane was not only gutsy but evidenced an inflight fueling capability that neither the mccains battle group nor taiwans air force had thought the pla air force was capable of this despite an intel report that some illiterate mushroom digger up in shihmen had claimed hed seen glints of what he thought might have been lowflying aircraft out to sea admiral crowley ordered his remaining eight hornets aloft to be followed by a fourteenplane fitcompron fighter composite squadron this included twelve f tomcats and an eab prowler already overhead as was an ec hawkeye which could continue to act as an adjunct for mccains ultrasecret signals exploitation space the prowlers crew of four could jam enemy signals and in general cause electronic chaos among the twentyfour hostiles crowley ordered armstrong and his wingman rhino manowski to stay and shepherd the roc falcon while the two other hornets in the fluid four were to break off and head northeast to join the mccains hornets and tomcats the squadrons mission was to get between the returning roc fighters low on fuel and the chicom hostiles shit complained eagle evans who like rhino manowski and his rio had been left out of the fitcompron i want to be in the fight what fight said chipper armstrong rules of engagement eagle remember our boys are supposed to get in between the two chinas to be peacemakers airborne referees who wants that job end up getting shot at by both sides if youre not careful well came in manowski id rather some action than being a shepherd his rio was of the same mind and they both glared jealously as the other pair of the fluid four peeled off and went to afterburner racing to rendezvous with mccains composite fighter squadron but the breakaway duo knew that with too much speed theyd be too low on gas to make it back to the carrier if their loiter time between the returning roc fighters and the chicoms was longer than ten minutes by which time the roc guys from kinmen would be heading back to refuel on taiwans west coast at ching chuan kang air force base seventyfive miles northeast of taiwans pescadores islands the latter approximately halfway between taiwan and the communist mainland for chipper armstrong and evans metallicgray nimbostratus lay ahead chipper doing a visual check of his headsup display for heading airspeed and altitude the advisory caution and warning lights bottom of the hud screen would automatically flash and sound in the event of impending malfunction but ye olde visual as his top gun instructor at fallon used to say was always advisable remember son youre flying the beast beast aint flying you chippers main concern was the super hornets short legsits gastoweight ratio which necessitated operations officers wrestling daily with the critical weaponstodroptank equation the hornets relative lack of internal fuel space compared to other fighters was referred to as ifoif only as a compromise armstrong and manowskis planes had been equipped with a clipon underbelly fuel tank in addition to the two drop tanks one on each wings outer stanchion where they would normally have preferred to carry airtoair sidewinder missiles or two laserguided bombs on mccain the operations officer like everyone in the combat air patrol had no way of knowing how long this bizarro friendly falcon could stay airborne if crowleyd had his way he would have ordered chipper and rhino to join the twentytwoplane posse now vectored to intercept the twentyfour chicom hostiles forty miles west of the penghu island group off southwest taiwan before the chicom planes had a chance to down the near empty roc falcons which were also defenseless having expended all their ordnance over kinmen crowleys other option his wish in fact was to recall armstrong and manowski this was stymied however by a political necessity the president could not be seen deserting a staunch ally in need even if it was just one pilot any reluctance to stay with bizarro would as john cuso advised be a propaganda coup for americas enemies who were already gleeful with the stunning victories of what arab television radio and press were now calling the mighty midget sub that with the massive conflagration at washington states cherry point refinery and the forced evacuations of thousands of americans was continuing to humble the great satan there he goes said evans his voice so loud it startled armstrong in the front seat jesus eagle no doubt about it right hand is definitely moving sliding along the canopy seal for support i guess hand must be shot up pretty bad trying to edge it forward along the seal so he can let it drop down onto the stick the eagleeyed evans though not having realized his dream of being a fighter pilot was recalling that the falcons control stick unlike in most fighters wasnt on the center line but was instead located on the right console now chipper could see it too though it was difficult to spot given the fds near opaque shining gold bubble evans was correct and their hornets wingman confirmed his observation eyes of an eagle ol buddy rhino complimented him eyes of an eagle yeah responded evans but not the eyes of an owl no one but armstrong picked up evanss oblique allusion to his aviator nighttime vision test to the four americans astonishment the falcons pilot managed to turn his head albeit slowly to his right his left hand raised slightly in a thanks salute hey hey hey called rhino excitedly simultaneously giving the falcon a thumbsup you go girl girl it was rhinos rio bullshit you cant tell a guy from a skirt underneath a bone dome shes got her visor up retorted rhino you see that eagle yeah said evans but a lot of young asian guys can look to us like a woman you know no facial hair small physique i can see her boob bumps in the gsuit said rhino pull the other one kidded evans id like to pull em both hey you guys taiwans not the only country with women on the joystick weve got em too remember not many cut in evans weve got em though cut in rhinos rio call signspussy galore titty galore a gravelly voice that sounded right next door but was admiral crowley over three hundred miles away entered the conversation chipper rhino knock it off the mccain was no doubt doing its thing scanning plucking radio signals out of the ether at will alerting crowley to the presence of one or all three of mccains women pilots in the combat information center focus crowley added grumpily report on bizarro bizarro looking good reported chipper crisply possible he paused was it a he or a she what the hell did it matter anyway possible that falcon will be able to make our roof roof wasnt exactly code but using colloquialisms like this instead of saying able to reach our carrier was more often than not effective in confusing chicom listening posts in mccains combat information center admiral crowley was concerned about the rockbottom morale of the us navy after this last week it had enveloped him as much as if not more than the six thousand officers and crew on his boat no one could afford another mistake though just how anyone could be blamed for not having detected the small but deadly predator hiding somewhere in the eleven hundred square miles of juan de fuca and now apparently georgia strait was not all clear of course everyone aboard had his or her own theory of how such a small target lurking in the depths could so easily have escaped detection there were six thousand theories aboard mccain alone though the pointy heads the electronic warfare elite had all but unanimously concluded that the midget sub must be covered in revolutionary stateoftheart anechoic sound tiles with the sonar absorption capability of cottage cheese it didnt surprise crowley hell the us had done it with the radarabsorbing tiles on the latest stealthed fighters and bombers the little black guy as the tall sixfootthree john cuso was affectionately called by the mccains cic staff was also concerned he had become as perennially cautious as crowley despite his life on the edge in his previous incarnation as a fighter jock perhaps his caution like his bosss was in part the result of simply growing older when one began to lose the air of invincibility the universal conviction of youth that they wouldnt be the one to get it that the unthinkable fate would be visited only upon the incompetent and the hesitant cuso his skin still goosepimpled by the cold airconditioning in the cic cautioned the admiral that this bizarroanother informal code word to confuse hostile eavesdroppers might be a chicom pilot in a captured roc falcon from kinmen field for what purpose asked the admiral to decoy our cap away from the chicom hostiles who slipped around the bottom of taiwan and who if everything is on cue cuso looked up at the cic situation board should be encountering our boys pretty soon well john answered crowley if bizarro is a decoy which i doubt he or she managed to sucker us only for a while but were on to the hostiles now yes but if wed had chippers cap farther northeast as the hostiles came around wed have scattered them there ifs dont help us john our cap had to investigate bizarro who they think is a wounded taiwanese pilot my gut instinct is that its exactly as young evans says a friendly shotup scared on auto until he or she recovers enough to be able to land that sucker and my guess is hes low on gas cuso nodded at this last conclusion i think youre right there the vectors suggest he she must have only cap to mother it was armstrongs voice are we to escort bizarro to the roof one moment chipper said crowley if that falcons shot up began cuso goddamn john retorted crowley they can see the bullet holes in it tail to canopy its a miracle the birds still in the air what i mean sir continued cuso is that his auto might be whacked for a landing anywhere let alone a carrier im not risking him landing on the roof john im not risking any of our crew on the deck he grabbed the spiral cord mike mother to cap negative for the roof youll have to have bizarro eject for pickup i say again bizarro to eject for pickup crowley put the mike in its cradle asking his covey of electronics weapons officers whats our caps eta twentyfive minutes sir possibly a little less sses advises satrecon shows strong tailwind that from the typhoon yes sir good for armstrong and manowski coming home but that means strong headwinds for fitcompron yes sir gusts up to seventy miles per hour confirming his officers verbal report the admiral like every other commander in his carrier battle group looking up at their big blue screens could see that his fitcompron was slowing because of the headwinds contact would now be made in fifty seconds the cic computers also projecting a rapidly increasing rate of fuel consumption crowley ordered three of his six sb vikings to be brought up by their elevator and gassed up their antisub warfare crew to ready the aircraft for its other function as aerial refueler should the hornets and tomcats particularly the hornets become dangerously low on avgas after having to buck the winds of the advancing typhoon no way the chinese communists started this punchup with taiwan crowley told john cuso who in their right mind would risk any kind of invasion knowing a typhoon is gonna hit them in the face cuso was noncommittal a lot of the world wasnt in its right mind including his motherinlaw maybe beijing was caught with its pants down didnt believe the weather forecast or maybe the chicoms figured that now would be when an attack would be least expected like macarthur at inchon continued cuso and that freeman retreating with his armor in that blizzard then angels approaching hostiles announced a weapons officer calmly his relaxed tone belying the tension building in the skies over the penghu islands where mccains twentytwo fighters job would be to break westward but not before they made visual contact with what ssess satellitecatalyzed radar had designated as hostiles only then could mccains twelve hummer super hornets and f tomcats break left heading eastward to act as what the white house was pleased to call a buffer zone between the two chinese air forces the pentagon rules of engagement forbidding the americans to fire unless fired upon chapter twentyseven moments after they reached the air space above the penghu islands which had been only mere dots on the hornets and tomcats radar screens mccains squadrons received a shock ahead in the box of twentyfour hostiles red stars emblazoned high on tailfins and wings were two types of aircraft mccains planes were a mix too but the chicom box consisted entirely of russianmade aircraft twelve of them were pale blue waveflecked gray mig fighters nato designation fulcrumthe remainder a dozen sukhois fighterbombers both fulcrums and flankers were as fast as the americans tomcats and over mph faster than the hornet shit russians exclaimed the tomcat leader lieutenant colonel gene p crouper drummer to his fellow aviators negative cut in the nasal radio voice of commander johnny reisman or hummer one leader of mccains twelve super hornets and overall commander of fitcompron those red stars are barred he said by which reisman meant that the red stars on the fulcrums and sukhois had a bar painted on either side of the star the insignia of the chicom air force not the russian air force you sure pressed drummer positive reisman assured him russkies are broke theyve been selling assets off all over okay but why the flankers asked drummer crouper i mean fighterbombers got me answered johnny reisman but theyve seen us got the message lets break east go play referee roger that said crouper i hope we can persuade what the theyre jinxing us drummer was only half right for while the twelve fulcrums the best fighters mikoyangurevich ever produced had broken fast left coming hard at the americans the twelve sukhoi flanker fighterbombers were continuing north northwest reisman saw what was up immediately the twelve russianmade chicom flankers were carrying kh krypton airtosurface antiradiation missiles and tvguided pound bombs on their ten hard points this told reisman and now drummer crouper that the chicom left hook mission wasnt just about flying down taiwans east coast and around its southernmost tip below the rocs radar screen in order to engage returning lowongas taiwanese falcons and mirages headed home to refuel bandits jinxing us thirtyeight miles announced tomcats drummer swing away ordered reisman do not engage i say again do not engage shit observed reismans rio every damn pilot in the world knows jinxings a direct confrontation break right shouted reisman and every fluid four in the american box swung away in a unison that rivaled the navys elite blue angel hornet formation team and every pilot hated the break running away from their sole reason for being to fight and every driver on our side reisman reminded tomcat leader drummer crouper knows our mission were tasked to be peacemakers thats all just let em know were here drummer to hummer one theyre coming at us again thirty miles break due west said reisman his voice sounding tight the increased g force pressing hard on his chest he and his two squadrons making a hard left turn once more and then reisman did something neither he nor many other fighter pilots had done in their career he flicked from his fighter composite squadrons radio frequency to the coast guard mayday channel which all pilots chicom roc and anyone else aloft and most important the carriers would have open if a dustup was about to occur reisman wanted everyone to know who shot first so that no un son of a bitch would be able to complain about us aggression whether he liked it or not reisman was trying to implement the white houses policy a totally unrealistic one in his view of trying to play referee between the two warring chinas cuso and crowley in mccains cic were duly astonished what the hell the admiral began then paused listening crazy to taunt us like that said cuso watching the blue screen dont they remember what happened to the libyans it was a reference to the downing of two libyan mig s in january who were brash and brave enough to jinx a pair of tomcats off the john f kennedy crowley could feel his blood pressure soaring with the sense of urgency in the planetoplane chatter frying noises of static surge and labored breathing of his pilots in their exhausting turns as they ran from the chicoms bogeys jinxing again twentysix miles cuso and crowley recognized it as tomcat leader drummer crouper his again so emphatic that it conveyed all the frustration of the fitcomprons aviators at being ordered by reisman to evade rather than engage crowley was more conscious than anyone on the ship that while pilots might speak to their rio or other crew members in a completely informal manner he or she knew that whatever you said on interplane radio could be heard by everyone in the squadron and on the carrier that it was your reputation on the line drummers again was telling everyone that he thought the squadron had breaked too much already cuso saw his point what kind of referees could expect to do their job without respect he thinks reismans being too cautious cuso said wants us to do a freeman it had slipped out before he had a chance to cage it cuso thought freeman was great had a naval aviators daring oh really replied the admiral caustically his eyes still on the screen his tone a measure of his frustration the frustration of all battle group commanders who despite a military mans instinct know full well that they and their careers are under control of the top civilian executive of the united states he turned sharply to face cuso what do you want me to do john by doing a freeman start shooting get us into a punchup in the strait when were already overextended spread from afghanistan to korea to the drug wars in colombia to the fourthousandmilelong border with canada and in the philippines and never mind were still in the balkans and japan you talk about freeman i cant understand why the president is using an old warhorse like him anyhow should be pensioned off cuso said nothing freeman was being used by the white house precisely because crowley was correct the united states its superpower status notwithstanding was stretched dangerously thin throughout the dangerous world at sea on land and in the air all reserves in the three armed services had been called up including marine reserves everyone including freeman and his exspecfor warriors was needed they heard johnny reisman once more order his fighters to break west the twelve chicom fulcrums jinxing yet again crowley saw an ewo officer at his console glance questioningly at another something wrong abrams no no sir then watch the screen on the ships signals exploitation space intercom the boffins informed cic that the chicom sukhoi fighter bombers were still proceeding northward in air space above the penghu island group thank you acknowledged crowley turning again to cuso his tone though still edgy more conciliatory we can see that on our own screen they think were blind in here or crowley had suddenly divined what reisman had realized a minute or so earlier the chicom fighters were jinxing mccains squadron to protect their fighterbombers heading for penghu the admiral snatched the mike from its cradle his short stature requiring him to perform what the less charitable among mccains six thousand souls called his tippytoe maneuver mother to hummer one do you read me loud and clear came reismans response give bandits warning on two four three repeat two four three that if they jinx again you will engage repeat if they jinx again you will engage do you read me roger that warn bandits on guard channel if they jinx again we will bogeys jinxing twenty miles it was reismans wingman noses on angels nine plus which told mccains cic that the carriers twelve hornets were at nine thousand feet and climbing out of the way instantly crowley gave his aviators weaponsfree independent decision authority to engage not evade roger that began reisman when drummer crouper five miles ahead his eyes on his tomcats vibrant green headsup display saw the flashing master caution light on his right side advisory panel master caution was now replaced by the flashing black on yellow acronym aam an airtoair missile seen as a green tadpole symbol on drummers radar screen the missile fired by a fulcrum and closing fast on the green x that was drummers bird drummer broke hard right hit the afterburner broke hard left left again piling on the g force using his upgraded digital readout that was telling him the chicoms aam was a pla air force r nato code aa adder radarguided active terminal range thirtyone miles speed mach warhead sixtysix pounds he fragmentation it was still closing he hit the cats afterburner again broke hard left left again piling on more gs then hard right ready for chaff he yelled to his rio ready drummer looked for his wingman he wasnt there no one was there but gray stratus his radar showing him that what had been the ordered formation of hornets and his fellow tomcats was now dispersed to hell and gone fulcrums swarming in to attack in the background babble drummer could hear crowleys voice ordering reismans hornets to go after the flankers crowley then cuso had realized that the flankers were not stopping to jinx their intention was obviously to keep flying farther north the real purpose of the russianmade fighterbombers not to help the fulcrums intercept returning roc falcons and mirages but to bomb penghu island prior to invading it the fulcrums providing a fighter umbrella penghu lying only thirtyfive miles from taiwan would provide the chicoms with several thousand taiwanese hostages and an invaluable air base less than two and a half minutes away by air from taiwan closer than cuba was to the united states as drummer used all the capabilities his avionics would provide breaking fast to nine gs and dropping chaff in the hope that the cloud of frequencylength cut aluminum strips would confuse the chicoms radarhoming missile he saw it closing eight seconds to impact the sweet ladys warning voice would kick in at five seconds bogeys mileage he shouted thirty twentyfive twenty the rio could see its contrail streaking toward them in the mirror it was almost on them his gsuit was sticking like saran wrap perspiration pouring down his face steaming up his visor then suddenly drummer went straight up on afterburner the cat on its tail then into a loop the missile passing below unable to turn as acutely its envelope of air swallowed in the tomcats turbulence nice job drum nice job son of a bitch you ran his clock out drummer knew it was fifty percent damn good flying and fifty percent good luck that hed managed to twist and turn enough for the missile to use up its thirtyonemile range son of a bitch has bought time for the flankers though he answered sounding utterly drained as was his rio lets go help the hornets it had been the same all over in and out of the bluegray sky tomcats and hornets defending themselves from aa missile attack the fulcrums though outnumbered losing three the chicoms pilots were brave and their migs were among the fastest birds in the world but the overwhelming superiority of the american fighter pilots lay in their number of hours aloft five to ten times the number of sorties flown by their opponents and the chicoms were still making the switch from dominant ground control to individual initiative the flankers however hotly pursued by the hornets had not yet been caught because of the necessity of johnny reismans aviators to first protect themselves from the fulcrums that had dived wildly into their midst two flankers had gone down but ten were approaching penghu island the flanker fighterbombers specific target was postulated by mccains sses to be makung city on the islands west coast and lintou beach to the southeast as a target makung with only sixty thousand people and virtually no industry other than tourism and fishing seemed to have been selected simply to terrorize the penghu islanders into not resisting the oncoming chicom invasion lintou beach however as reismans rio was able to call up on his compact target location file made more military sense in makung the roc had stationed two battalions about two thousand soldiers in all the regular armys st battalion and the nd battalions reservists manned batteries of usmade m chaparral sam missiles afterburners ordered reisman wanting to catch and keep the flankers from bombing the island he was aware that his hornets fuel consumption would put them beyond the point of no return unable to return to the mccain without refueling from the sb viking which would be a highrisk proposition given the swarm of migs still battling drummers tomcats in the wild freeforall switching off his afterburners reisman immediately felt the reduction in g forces and was encouraged by his rio advising him that a pair of tomcats having broken out of the supersonic killing zone were hustling to assist the hornets at twentysix miles from penghu drummer was about to go in at mach to attack the flankers when he saw one of them break formation coming at him nosetonose master arm on confirmed his rio fear and adrenaline marrying in the rush of excitement am centering the t bandits jinxed sixteen miles centering dot fox one fox one the tomcats aim sparrow missiles detachment from the tomcat powered by its boostsustained solidfuel propellant left its hard point in a sudden hiss the sleek twelvefootlong sparrow reaching mach only seconds after it shot out from its glove pylon drummers rio made sure the missile was receiving constant illumination from the tomcats firecontrol triad of signal processor radar and updated responses computer eight miles cut in another tomcat fox one fox one then another two for lennox tally two tally two meaning lennox had a visual of the redeyed exhausts from a duo of flankers these two sukhois with insufficient fulcrum fighter cover had obviously decided theyd better take time to kill this tomcat on their tail in order to have a successful bomb run on makung and lintou beach five miles said the tomcats rio select fox two then four miles lock im up lock im up shoot fox two fox two good kill good kill it was lennox or some tomcat pilot shouting his congratulations as they saw drummers sparrow missile hit its target or more accurately when the sparrows big proximityfused fragmentation warhead exploded several meters behind the flanker producing a massive shotgun effect the flankers kerosene fuel tank vaporizing in an enormous orangewhite bloom of fire two seconds before drummers kill shot however the flankers pilot had fired one of his rs or russianmade a archer closecombat heat seekers its contrail lost in a wisp of stratus getting out of harms way before drummers sparrow struck the flanker the archer missile was now tracking aviator lennoxs tomcat which at eleven thousand feet had just fired its sidewinder at the second of the two flankers lennox had spotted earlier lennoxs wingman a short wiry twentythreeyearold from waco texas suddenly found himself the pursued his tomcat glove vanes on the leading edges of the fixed wings extended to reduce the more than mach strain on the fighters tail planes made a tight right turn inside the flankers defensive right break and so in classic red baron style lennox was now immediately behind and in the flankers cone of vulnerability when he saw the limegreen arc formed by his guns computer impact line and gun sights green circle move to the middle of his hud image of the flanker he fired the long stream of his tomcats sixbarreled mm vulcan spewing out ninety rounds in less than a second chopped up the flankers turbofans and right tail plane a collision warning sounded in the texans cockpit and he instinctively broke in the opposite direction but didnt climb fast enough to avoid the wake of dirty air from the disintegration of the chicom fighterbomber the supersonic swarm of debris that had been the flankers nose radar and other whitehot debris thudded into the tomcats nacelle housing and was sucked into the huge canted intakes of the fs left turbofan the engine shut down immediately and the tomcats cockpit was so badly pitted by blades from the flankers engines that lennoxs wingman lost all frontal vision through the hud the fighters right intake struck by a piece of the flankers heavy and unexploded ordnance right engines gone shouted his rio eject ordered the texan roger plummeting seaward their bird tumbling out of control the texan and his rio ever faithful to the aviators code still had full confidence in the efficacy of their planes design specifically in the reputation of the martinbaker seats they had been so meticulously made that with the aircraft parked upon a tarmac the zerozero system would still eject the pilots high enough to have their chutes open and bring them safely down now fighting the punishing g forces exerted on the tumbling tomcat the two men nevertheless managed to reach and pull their snakes in a split second the explosive bolts fired releasing the seat both mens necks snapped like twigs the canopys fairing having been severely dented and thus locked by the impact of the flankers supersonic debris lennox glimpsed the tumbling dot of the tomcat on his green monitor saw it swell into sudden luminescence as it smashed into the sea but his attention was quickly hijacked by the tadpole shape streaking in on his radar a missile fired from eight miles behind normally it would have taken the missile seconds to reach him but thanks to typhoon janes headwinds it took seconds time enough for lennoxs rio to drop chaff and pop flares hoping to confuse both the archers radar and infrared the american ruse failed however the agility and maneuverability of the russianmade missile so acute that despite lennoxs and his rios countermeasures the tenfoot archer was able to lock on via the chicom pilots helmetmounted sight a full fortytwo degrees off bore sight lennox his rio and their beloved machine disappeared from the fitcomprons prowlers radar this second explosion shocked the already stunned combat information center in the mccain the room so quiet that only the hum from the air conditioners vents and the whir of the digital disc recorder could be heard four men and a hundred million dollars lost in less than six seconds hope to hell our screens working opined a veteran chief petty officer referring not to the cics blue board but to the carriers protective screen of aegis cruisers destroyers frigates and two attack subs whose sole reason for being there was to prevent a chicom box or missiles getting through to the heart of the cvbg in mccains sses the chief boffin called admiral crowley with more bad news seven possibly eight of the chicom flankers had reached penghu island penetrating its defensive ring of chaparral sam sites in fact fiveman chaparral crews each made up of commander driver gunner and two loaders belonging to the reservists battalion on penghu were still frantically launching chaparrals the fiery backblasts from quads of the eleventon us missiles were clearly visible to the chicoms seven remaining sukhoi fighterbomber pilots quickly going to their lyulka afterburners they rapidly climbed to eleven thousand feet placing themselves a thousand feet beyond the chaparrals maximum altitude from this high ground they fired a rain of airtosurface tvguided missiles at penghu installations and dropped seven pound bombs knocking out six of the quad chaparral launchers in a series of headthudding explosions whose gases created a dust storm that swept across the island before being blown leeward by gusts heralding typhoon janes approach the hurricane of shrapnel from the bombs however was not so readily dispersed scything through the reservists who unlike the regular roc troops in the st battalion had failed to dig enough slit trenches along lintou beach instead the reservists had clumped together in the tactically futile but psychologically understandable belief that protection lay in numbers in makung panic reigned in the fish markets and town itself clustered about the picturesque harbor and families who would normally have fled down to fishing boats to make good their escape from any manmade assault on their small island were afraid to do battle with the huge seas stirred up by jane taipei radio had now upgraded jane to supertyphoon the winds off taiwans east coast reportedly reaching miles per hour with gusts to it meant that even if the families of makung their town ablaze from the chicom bombing and strafing managed to escape the windfanned inferno and reach their boats their taiwanese navy could not help them the windwhipped seas drowning all hope of rescue meanwhile the americans could not help much their rules of engagement requiring them to hold their fire for fear of overshooting the enemy planes and killing taiwanese civilians penghus sacred banyan tree was also destroyed having been used by the chicom bombers as their initial aiming point damn said johnny reisman cant do a damn thing crowley and cuso heard and shared their fitcompron leaders frustration his voice remarkably clear through the crackle and labored breathing of an aviator who had just overseen the worst aerial defeat of american arms in the last quarter century within minutes of the roc st battalion on penghu sounding the air raid warning presumed tourists trapped on the island had quickly sought refuge from the flanker blitz by taking cover in and around the popular fengkuei cave on the rocky southwestern isthmus of the island when the air raid finally ended these tourists emerged from their ad hoc shelter heading toward the fiercely crackling ruins of makung armed with kalashnikov s bandoliers of mm ammunition grenades and light but deadly mm mortars the arms had been planted months earlier by pla navy commandos during clandestine landings by dieselelectric subs that had come in close to penghu during stormy weather the rough seas having subsumed the already quiet running of the subs batterypower propulsion making the chicom presence in the strait undetectable by even the best taiwanese sonar the island was now hostage to the pla chapter twentyeight so pronounced choir williams as the specfor group watched cnns marte price reporting the chineseus conflict in the taiwan straits looks like we dont need to wait for petrels water sample results after all me boyos its the chinese salvini nodded in agreement choir aussie announced triumphantly i think you just lost a bet boyo his tone however was devoid of the usual followup jabs that characterized the relationship between freemans special forces team the bloody animal and human carnage they had seen in the waters of their strait disallowed the usual spirited repartee at least for now what dyou think general aussie asked freemans attention had shifted from marte price to the tv screens sidebar weather map of typhoon jane doesnt make sense he concluded starting a war on two fronts fundamental even for a superpower beijing attacking taiwan and us at the same time anyway if they were going to do that why one offensive in the open the other not maybe suggested aussie their planned invasion of taiwan which we know theyve always had on the shelf was triggered prematurely by the taiwanese firing the first shot chicoms had to react i think so agreed freeman and ill tell you why its that damned typhoon no planned offensive by beijing would willingly battle that bitch and the taiwanese armed forces at the same time so you think taipei did fire first asked salvini dont know sal answered freeman sometimes we never know who fired the first shot he paused bout ourselves war or anything else i dont know if the chicoms started it but something dont ask me what tells me theyre not the ones sinking our ships here in juan de fuca he glanced across at choir i wouldnt claim that wager with aussie just yet then who is it general pressed choir before freeman could answer the phone rang with the coast guards imu test the darkstardetected anomaly was positive definitely isotopetagged there was a problem however in that the isotope matchup was for the oil used by a caribbean panamaregistered cruise ship bermuda star obviously it had illegally jettisoned or leaked it en route to either vancouver or seattle the two major northwest cruise ship ports shit a brick said aussie crushing the plastic water bottle from which hed been drinking and throwing it violently into the wastebasket the mood of the other three no different for a few seconds no one spoke but if choir salvini and aussies silence was a measure of their bitter disappointment in having failed to narrow the search for the killer sub whose sheer audacity freeman couldnt help but grudgingly admire for the utter chaos and humiliation such a small gutsy force had brought about as his own team had in the past the silence afforded the general a moment to think uninterrupted by the others theories he switched off the tv and tossed the remote on his bed which hed remade after the maid service had been in the blankets now so tightly tucked that a tossed quarter bounced off it testimony to the fact that as much as he was an original maverick thinker in the armed forces he also valued the small but valuable drills that reinforced respect for tradition he knew that some of the old ideas in the box could still serve well in times of personal and national crisis going back to the box of boring procedures for a moment he asked salvini to go online and into google to do a search on the net for cruise ships arrivals and departures in a minute salvini saw that the bermuda star had been scheduled to arrive in seattle a week before that is before the sinkings but the entry was flagged with a red asterisk queer observed the general explaining his comment by pointing out that seattle port authority showed bermuda star as delayed having departed lahaina maui for seattle two weeks ago the cruise ship had been compelled to return to hawaii due to an outbreak of a virulent sarslike bronchial virus over a dozen passengers removed to the kaiser foundation hospital in honolulu and the ship had been quarantined so it didnt get to seattle said freeman his earlier fatigue replaced by a surge of energy i dont get it confessed sal the sub got hold of however many barrels it needed said freeman from bermuda star so if the sub sprang a leak from its hydraulics whatever and we took a sample of the leak cut in aussie wed think it was from this bermuda star only our terrorists he elaborated didnt figure on the cruise ship coming down with a bug having to stay quarantined in hawaii freeman was on the phone to the coast guard station at port townsend which was known to have the best supply of rigid inflatables he wanted a twentyfourman rib for his team and any available coast guard divers general the duty officer told him weve had to prioritize this wars being fought on so many fronts the best we can do is a sixteenfooter and we havent got any spare divers prioritize weve found the sub well at least where its been if we can trace the tail on that tadpole spill before its sucked out or chopped up by the tides we may be able to backtrack it to the bastards operating base general im following orders said the duty officer you find a sub base and ill request antisub aircraft from whidbey thats no damn good if its a cave cant drop depth charges into a cave i need more divers specfor guys like mine ive only got threesides myself if you can hold on general freeman could hear someone interrupting in the background then the coast guard do came on again young peter wants to go with you peter dixon said the do well send him over with an rib sixteenfooter fine said freeman who knew the duty officer was right everyone was spread thin it was obvious to aussie choir and sal that the general for all his prodigious memory didnt recognize dixons name dixons the swim buddy of that guy albinski said aussie albinski was the one they winched up on petrel smothered in kelp good said freeman hell be keen to smoke those bastards out how bout david asked aussie maybe he can help choir and sal looked uneasily at the general they were glad it was his decision not theirs he surprised them however by asking what dyou boys think well sal began awkwardly becoming tonguetied he deferred to choir the welshmans shrug like sals silence also a diplomatic abstention aussie the general pressed you know the answer same as these two ninnies dont you he said ninnies with the rough affection born of long team membership he could be a liability said aussie quietly freeman nodded then looked at salvini you asked from loyalty sal i understand that i admire that but we all know that davids gammy right arm can barely hold the bullpup hes been struggling with handling an rib in this sea would be a hell of a lot more difficult than that he paused brentwood would make the same decision the three others agreed but aussie wasnt so sure david brentwood was the kind of leader who probably to a fault would take a chance having great faith in the power of will he had often cited the extraordinary determination of the vietnamese against all odds morale might not move mountains as freeman himself was often wont to say but it can sure as hell climb them then again the generals responsibility was to the team not any one individual call him aussie freeman said hell be back at fort lewis by now tell him to sign out an antitank launcher with he rounds just in case we bump into the bastards itll give him a sense of lending a hand well at least doing something im on to it said aussie dialing brentwoods cell he hoped he wouldnt answer who wanted to be a gofer might piss him off said salvini oh thanks for that sal that really helps well see said choir all of which left aussie wondering why freeman wasnt calling his protégé to aussies relief david didnt answer so lewis left him a quick but succinct message to bring them the antitank launcher from fort lewis chapter twentynine despite the assistance rendered by a coast guardsman who volunteered on his own time to accompany him to satisfy us coast guard regulations dixon had trouble getting the rib out of port townsend harbor on his way to pick up freemans team at port angeles it wasnt so much the gutslamming chop created by the incoming tide that delayed the ribs departure but the disturbing number of oilmatted seabirds that had been washed into the harbor dixon had seen enough dead wildlife and the possibility that some of the gulls cormorants and other birds might still be alive haunted him accordingly he slowed down to no more than two knots while the coast guard volunteer filled the time by doublechecking what few provisions hed been able to second from the already drained uscg quartermasters supplies and the antitank launcher that captain brentwood had dutifully brought up from fort lewis unaware of brentwoods injury dixon had been about to ask david whom hed seen on cnn touring the hospital if hed like to come along on the investigation of darkstars anomaly when dixon noticed the difficulty the medal of honor winner had lifting the relatively light fifteenpound at rocket launcher unit as if reading young dixons mind david had stayed to help push the sixteenfootlong bruiser off from shore but his vibram boot slipped on an oilslicked rock throwing him off balance his immobile right arm instinctively flew out to regain balance but instead he went as aussie lewis would have said a over tit and fell into the oily muck at the waters edge able to use only his left hand to push himself to the kneeling position the injured right arm that had failed him with the new ambidextrous bullpup was draped in oilslicked kelp washing ashore amid an offal of other dieselsoaked detritus out of respect an embarrassed dixon and the guardsman had looked quickly away whats wrong with him the coast guard man inquired looking back dunno dixon replied his attention arrested by the realization that the antitank launcher brentwood had brought to the bruiser was a swedish disposable launcherrocket once you fired it that was it scuttlebutt said the coast guard crewman is that he screwed up on some gig in ghanistan dixon took offense at the green crewman adopting ghanistan instead of afghanistan that was the right of warriors who had been there or was he simply overreacting under the stress of the situation and the nagging doubt that he had somehow screwed up in failing to look out for rafe albinski his swim buddy whod literally had the life squeezed out of him the bloody toothpastelike ooze had been so repellant that frank hall after talking with albinskis wife had the divers remains cremated at port townsends hospital and scattered in a quick burial at sea from petrels stern freeman aussie salvini and choir were waiting at the port angeles wharf loaded for bear by the time dixon arrived they were already in their wet suits with draeger rebreathers and extra pouches of ammunition for freeman and aussies grenadelauncherequipped heckler koch submachine guns as well as kevlar vests stun smoke and he grenades flashlight with its rightangle shape dakine hydrater camelback plus night vision goggles with flipdown infrared visor and what they called other assorted goodies for salvini the weapon of choice was a waterproofed strippeddown lightweight crap tolerant laser dot nightscoped m and a hipholstered sawedoff shotgun in the unlikely event of an enemy in the distance a trawler perhaps this customized m would give the team of six men which included dixon and the coast guard crewman a reach far beyond the shorter but lethal hk submachine guns packed by the general and aussie and choir with his pistolgrip mossberg twelvegauge shotgun its pumpaction mag loaded with alternate doubleought and steelflechette dart rounds would provide additional firepower freeman knew it was probably too much to expect that they would actually make visible contact with the midget sub then again he remembered the astronomically high odds against the winning numbers of the new york lottery being exactly a year after all he could reasonably hope for was to find the general area from which the midget sub was operating and then call in for one of the foot mk iv hurricane b class coastal patrol ships these had a dash speed of knots and bristled with heavy machine guns chain guns and pedestals for stinger sams plus a mm gatling canon with the same armorpiercing power as the famously ugly and deadly a thunderbolt the latter was a highset twinengined tank buster that wiped the grins of derision from its uppity fighter cousins when it virtually destroyed saddam husseins tank corps and anything else that moved in the iraqi desert in the war of but when hed suggested to coast guard hq in seattle that they keep a hurricane craft on standby to assist his team should they find any signs of the midget subs base of operations the reply was polite but firm like all coast guard stations they were swamped and the coast guard admiral took the opportunity to get a load off his chest general theres no way i can release a cp ship weve only three in the whole puget sound area and were using them with everything else weve got to try to bring some sort of minimal control and i emphasize minimalin every marina from seattle to the san juans its sheer unmitigated panic out there do you have any idea how many marinas there are in the puget sound the san juan islands and juan de fuca strait area yes i under began freeman trying to get into the oneway conversation but he realized the coast guard admiral was as much an earbasher as himself over six hundred the admiral went on giving freeman no time to reply and its a mob scene at each one our refugees arent listening to our assurances about tolerable levels of radiation and are bidding like crazy for transport across the sound to the safety of interstate they want out south to oregon idaho nevada utah as long as its away from the strait of juan de fuca local cops are overwhelmed washington dc is trying to get the national guard in to maintain order but the arteries are jammed solid besides washington doesnt understand that the northwest is waterways we need coast guards more than the national guards add to that the fact that the pentagon is calling up reserves all over but dammit admiral the white house surely wants me to general weve been caught with our pants down were getting hit on three fronts theres a resurgence of terrorism in afghanistan terrorism in our own swimming pool here and now were on a knife edge with this taiwanchicom shit weve got a new kind of world war on three fronts general have you seen cnn theyre calling the refugees in the northwest america on the run how about the nrb cut in freeman it should be here by now and there youre in luck general my ic tells me its arrived on whidbey only five to six miles from the keystone ferry ramp its crewll be the next flight in im sure admiral jensenll get it launched as quickly as possible and send it out to you the moment the crews aboard keystone freeman knew was approximately sixty miles to the east on whidbey island he also knew that despite the wondrous gizmology of the relatively small byfootdiameter nuclearpowered sub run by a crew of only two officers three enlisted men and two scientists its maximum speed was said to be no more than eight knots on the surface and ten knots submerged the general had learned from his contacts however that for the nrb it was closer to knots surface speed thirty submerged even so that would mean at least a twohour wait if all went well before it could reach his specfor team do we go on or wait he asked the team i say go said dixon whod remained silent to this point somewhat overawed by the generals reputation though less so now that he was seeing him in his wet suit a little paunchier than the rest of them dixon was also surprised by the fact that a general would put an operational decision to a vote the young seal making the mistake of so many who didnt understand that supremely confident leadership was unafraid to put it to a vote if time allowed and that it was only the insecure machos who needed to be making unilateral decisions all the time if we wait said aussie that oil tail could disappear dispersed to hell and gone by the riptide then well have bugger all to show the nrb and all its superduper sensors choir sal asked the general who then turned to the coast guard crewman and dixon lieutenant dixon jorge jorge alvaro was astonished that his opinion that of an ordinary seaman was being sought by none other than the legendary george c scott nobody including his wife asked him his opinion everyone from his motherinlaw to uscg brass was always telling him what to do he heard the welshman choir williams and the guy from brooklyn salvatore or something like that say they might as well wait for the nrb and the guy they called aussie and his uscg comrade dixon still arguing that they might save time by pursuing the oil spill now the general wasnt saying anything jorge realizing that for once his opinion was not only being sought but that jorge alvaro the son of migrant mexican farm laborers held the deciding vote he didnt want to court danger but it was unlikely theyd see the sub theyd just trace the spill then call in the nrb besides what if the midget struck again this morning and it became known he and the others had been bobbing around waiting for the nrb i say we go look for where that oil came from it was obviously what freeman wanted all right coxswain he told alvaro get this rib moving in seconds the sixteenfoot rigid inflatables twin caterpillar diesels roared to horsepower the twin water jets thrusting the boat forward against the wind the consoles speedometer needle shaking at knots every one of the sixman team except coxswain alvaro who stood at the perspexshielded control panel was sitting on the fiberglass seats one hand firmly gripping the aluminum steady bar their weapons stocks first in the quickrelease gun rack beside them freeman felt the painful arthritic jab in his left knee an old war wound aggravated by the intense cold of the strait and peter dixon had an uncomfortable sense of déjà vu theyre chinese aussie shouted into the breathrobbing wind five bucks choir big spender retorted choir immediately drenched by a fivefooter slamming hard amidships all right aussie yelled back ten bucks choir seemed to nod but in the kidneywhacking ride aussie couldnt be sure you hear me you little welsh bastard ten dollars confirmed choir ooh lah de bloody lah ten dollars anyone else al qaeda shouted salvini youre on brooklyn reboarding the kiowa scout for the early morning hop back to fort lewis david brentwood was shivering so badly from his dunking in the oily scum of port angeles that the pilot a quiet young redhead who obviously felt sorry for him could hear his teeth chattering she tried some small talk as they gained height above the waters of the strait and the wide slab of admiralty inlet but david clutching an armyissue blanket about his oilreeking body had closed his eyes the bunkerc fuel absorbed by the blanket stinging them his anger at the human and environmental havoc caused by the terrorists inflamed by his inability to join his lifelong buddies in striking back the david he knew was not with him instead it was a morose uncharacteristically sullen brentwood who curtly thanked the pilot and ducked beneath the kiowas stillwhirling blades scurrying away like some bedeviled pilgrim for whom the storm had proved too much and hating himself for his sullenness and selfpity chapter thirty a quarter mile from the keystone ferry from which the nrb would slide into the strait where its somewhat cumbersomelooking conning tower and bow would come into their own the advance outriders heard a rushing sound it was as if one said a stream of water from a hose had struck a pile of fallen leaves it was a fuse the blacktop erupted with such a bang that the sound reverberated through the nrb on its trailer as if it had been struck with some enormous sledgehammer the singing of the metal continuing for several seconds after the last of the black pebbleencrusted bitumen had fallen back down on and about the road one lump felling an outrider another two blown off their motorcycles admiral jensen had already said jesus at least five times this followed by an incoherent rage of profanity as leaping from his humvee he raced towards the nrb against the advice of his traumatized driver the marine escorts fanned out speedily in u formation toward the launch point laying down a hail of automatic fire that after six seconds all but denuded the surrounding salmonberry and blackberry bushes only a leaf or two remaining after the savage onslaught of the marines small arms fire there were no bodies to be found only the bulletflayed remains of the detonation cord that had been craftily buried running from the salmonberry bushes through the sodden earth to the road the long slit in which the det cord had been buried was patched and dusted in places with crushed gravel to make it look indistinguishable from a thousand other cracks on highway no one there sir the marine co told admiral jensen who was fighting to regain selfcontrol as several marines rushing from the humvee with its fire extinguisher doused some small fires on the subs wooden trailer frame no one said jensen no sir must have been a remote detonation the marine swept his m across the panorama of gently rolling hills north of the ferry landing that they could now see the big metal stanchions bracing the docking area were turning golden in the early morning sun that was burning off the mist that had crept inland across the fields and cranberry bogs somewhere up there probably said the marine co now signaling his heavily armed men to secure the quarter mile of road that curved gently ahead to the deserted ferry terminal the small waiting room washrooms and chained red pop machine appearing particularly forlorn a marine corporal took his squad to make sure the building wasnt occupied or boobytrapped everyone shaken whether they showed it or not by the sabotaged road the admiral was confused because the marines were proceeding as if the explosion hadnt damaged the nrb until in a joyous moment he saw that despite the sandy soil and lumps of strawcolored passpalum grass that partially covered the subs nose and the elongated conning tower there was no hole or even a dent evident but he knew that if even a hairline fracture was discovered it would mean the integrity of the vessel would be violated this would prevent the navys stateoftheart research sub capable of going to three thousand feet from diving to even a few feet below the surface feeling as if his heart was pushing an obstruction up into his throat his breathing becoming increasingly difficult jensen approached the craft in a state of incipient panic with the help of four marines and his driver he began brushing off the dirt sand and passpalum look carefully he enjoined them each of us take a section and go over it with he paused his breathing shallow and rapid carefully he said you all right sir asked the marine co carefully jensen repeated pricks made a hash of it sir said the marine looks fine they didnt use enough c beat up the truck cabin and the trailer some but everything else looks hunky dory the admiral heard him but didnt answer as if any positive response would jinx his inspection of the one vessel that might find the midget sub and salvage his reputation he closed his eyes for a moment the marine co thinking he was in pain when in fact he was praying he remembered what his mother had told him never ask god for anything for selfish reasons ask that his will be done not yours jensen prayed that the nrbs structural integrity remained sound there was no gash in the nose or nacelle that housed the sophisticated sidescan array sonar no sign of damage on the small conning tower or the mast array housing thank christ he murmured amen you morons jensens driver shouted at the amphitheater of fields and hills to the north you screwed up you al qaeda bastards the admiral felt duty bound to tell him to be quiet but said nothing the truth was his driver was expressing the same surge of relief that the admiral and his marine escort were now feeling a release from the pentup tension wrought by the slow painstaking drive down from the naval air station near oak bay toward the ferry jensen however was too experienced a commander to leave anything to chance he didnt ream out the marines as hed wanted to do when he heard the road explode under the vessel it would have been virtually impossible to detect the fake road repair that had allowed the saboteurs to feed the det cord and c under the bitumens surface instead he simply told the marine commander to secure the small ferry terminal and now decided that hed send a dive pair down to check the water in and around the dock for all they knew the road explosion could be a cover to divert the marines attention away from the dock where earmuff charges could be placed on the pilings and exploded once the nrb was in the water hightemperature oxyacetylenelike cuts from muff charges could easily sever hshaped dock pilings and supports causing them to come crashing down onto the superstructure of the footlong sub unfortunately his call to the coast guard ended in frustration the last of their standby divers peter dixon was with general freeman and like all other divers in the strait puget sound and adjacent waters he was doing triple time trying to cope with the most pressing of the myriad diving tasks created by the recent rash of sinkings including that of the georgia queen most of whose passengers had died the other thing that frustrated jensen was the news that apparently douglas freeman had gone out without assist from the nrb idve thought freeman wouldve waited for the nrb jensen told the uscg admiral in seattle maybe walt but you know how doug freeman is charge jensen held his tongue freeman was a glory hound but he was also the one who had told marte price that it was his admiral jensens idea to send out darkstar for a closein run along the reverse seven of the olympic peninsulas northern juan de fuca shore and down south from cape flattery to the national wildlife refuge it had been an unselfish act jensen knew on freemans part to help a disgraced admiral regain something of his reputation after the disastrous loss of the utah any of you fellas swim jensen asked the marines his question clearly a request for volunteers four marines immediately stepped forward just in for a few minutes guys long enough to check the pilings okay the four men stripped to their skivvies taunted goodnaturedly by their comrades brass monkey balls in there you wont last moren three minutes cowboy the remaining marines used their compact field glasses to zoom in on the pilings and launch ramp seeing nothing suspicious while the four ad hoc divers plunged in they were immediately struck by the extraordinary clarity of these northwest waters they saw thick clumps of barnacles oysters and other marine crustaceans any of which could hide explosive which was infamously easy to camouflage still they could see no wires no det cord the four marines lips were soon dark blue bodies shivering as uncontrollably as david brentwoods had the previous evening at port angeles looks clear sir the marine co informed the admiral adding a caveat for his own protection course you never know jensen hesitated wondered and worried apart from anything else this was a billiondollar machine in his charge whats that asked one of the marines pointing to a dot obviously some kind of vessel coming from the direction of port townsend ten miles southwest across admiralty inlet the dot on the inlets cobalt blue was washington states port townsend keystone ferry due to arrive at keystone in twentyfive minutes what the hells it doin asked a gumchewing marine it was the question on everyones mind surely the carnage unleashed in the last seventysix hours argued against any resumption of normal ferry traffic what if theyve taken over the ferry admiral the marine co asked using it to stop our launch said the admiral now that theyve seen their road mining didnt work no one knew who they might be but the sinking of billions of dollars of us naval ships clearly had been done with the aid of damn good intelligence theyd known precisely where the ships would be and when and it was more than likely that the same humint who had informed the terrorists of this would know the roadblow had failed to perforate the hightensile steel of the nrb jensen wasted no time and ordered one of his comsubpacs two foot coastal patrol ships that normally serviced hood canal and puget sound to intercept the suspect townsendkeystone ferry with all possible haste to stop the ferry and have a boarding party investigate any resistance jensen instructed the coastal patrol ships captain and thirtytwoman crew is to be met with deadly force i say again deadly force the two hurricaneclass coastal patrol ships unlike the three hurricanes commanded by uscg seattle were on picket duty in hood canal their sole responsibility to guard the entrance to admiralty inlet and the waters north and south of the hood canal bridge it was through the hood canals retractable section that jensens us hunter killer and boomer ballistic missile subs had to pass during their egress from bangor base through the strait on their way to open rolling ocean west of cape flattery while one of comsubpacgrus two hurricanes remained on station at the sabotagesusceptible bridge the other the uss skate primarily responsible for the waters north of the bridge set off immediately into the prussian blue stretch of admiralty inlet toward the suspect ferry eighteen miles to the north with a fuelguzzling dash speed of knots the skates estimated time of interdiction with the ferry was fourteen minutes at a point plus or minus three miles from keystone the skates captain and third officer their binoculars glued to them devoutly hoped that there would be no more floaters whom theyd feel they should stop to pick up the best the skates skipper could do similar to what frank hall had done on petrel was to have one of their two inflatables ready with a paramedic and three other able seamen standing by anything lookouts called the captain no sir came the answer from starboard and port just a lot o dead fish they smell somethin very good keep sharp twelve minutes fourteen seconds till eti responded the third mate very good by now the skates radio officer like jensens marine guard contingent was trying unsuccessfully to make contact with the ferry no response somethings wrong opined the patrol ships mate twelve minutes eti every skipper in the northwest was on edge to put it mildly and the skates captain sounded action stations suddenly the ship came alive with dozens of crew who only minutes before had been comfortably in the rhythm of their watch they were now running along with offwatch personnel pulling on helmets and flak jackets manning their stations from the sterns mk gun and stinger launcher pedestal to the ships two caliber machine guns its two mm machine guns grenade launchers and up forward another mk mm chain gun yet despite all this armament many of the skates crew felt uncomfortably vulnerable the footlong twentyfivefootwide ship was in their view grossly undergunned for its size and presented a big enough target for surfacetosurface or airlaunched missiles of the kind that had killed the night watchman at cherry point and set the whole complex ablaze dont sweat it a petty officer assured the young chain gunner its only a friggin ferry were coming to people and cars ol buddy thats all yeah but what nut would take a ferry out when theres a midget sub still around he was thinking of the canadian ferry georgia queen the petty officer shrugged ah hes probably taking stores over for whidbeys naval air station without an escort gimme a break eti nine minutes thirty seconds the captains voice boomed out stay focused stay alert roe no firing unless i give the word i say again no firing unless i give the word yeah yeah said one of the gunners i get it but the captain would repeat his order knowing that given the ongoing trauma of the past few days everyone was on edge no one on skate had been sleeping well it was also a common complaint ashore eti nine minutes chapter thirtyone when wu ling heard the knock on her door in beijings haidan district it was near midnight and she feared it was the gong an bu instead it was a neighbor an elderly woman who had lost a son in the fighting against the terrorists in kazakhstan a member of the pla corrections service she came to wu ling in civilian clothes and gave her a wellworn postcard the card wu ling thought looked as if it had been carried around for some time an assumption borne out by the fact it had been postmarked two weeks earlier wu ling gave the uninspiring picture of one of the forbidden citys rooms only a cursory glance the corrections officer left quickly disappearing into one of the maze of hutongs the note from chang wasnt long twelve lines he wrote that he was fine the prison food bad and the central committee blaming him for the setbacks the army was experiencing in kazakhstan li kuans terrorists had more sophisticated weapons than anyone had anticipated he missed her but he had friends and tell as many of them as you can whats happened to me he was sure his th army and the other pla divisions would soon regain the offensive and then theyd have to let him out of jail he missed her and bamboo in the wind the last a sexual reference to something hed taught her when she first became his concubine then his lover it was his writing all right she made a photocopy and sent it to charlie riser cultural attaché us embassy xiu shui bei jie chaoyang district beijing maybe mandys father could use the information to embarrass beijing and the nanjing military district into admitting the ridiculous lie that her lover and protector wasnt in perpetual conference but was being used as a scapegoatshe remembered the word from mr riser for beijings failures in kazakhstan she wasnt a fool she also sent copies of the postcard in good quality opaque envelopes to those who were still general changs friends in the politburo riser took his copy straight to the military attaché bill heinz bill i knew they were lying he said look at this heinz didnt immediately look preoccupied as he was with the twochina war it still wasnt possible to nail it down whod actually started it not that it mattered now that the typhoons atrocious weather put pay to the idea of any chicom invasion of taiwan at least for the foreseeable future but beijing now had a foothold on penghu as well as matsu a fact that for now the united states preoccupied as it was with the catastrophe in its own waters wasnt disposed to remedy the home front had priority finally he looked at risers copy of the postcard sent to wu ling so well it proves i was right chang is in jail and if i can see him i mean he talks about li kuan being in kazakhstan and get more details about you want me to use my connections to find out what prison hes in yes weve got to use our informants sparingly charlie its like capital you cant spend it on you think its frivolous no no no hell no but right now weve just had a war across the strait which one exactly ive got orders from washington to spend on future prcroc relations nothing else you wont help of course i will charlie but its gonna have to be on the fly cant promise more than that i can ask questions about kazakhstan there was an awkward pause he knew riser was still hurting over mandy but riser would always be hurting and the reality was riser would never see li kuan never get near him ill ask questions he told riser something might come up but riser could tell his embassy colleague held no hope and the truth was despite his own resolve to see li kuan brought to justice he felt hopeless too chapter thirtytwo eti three minutes advised the skates third mate the port townsend keystone ferry was five miles from the keystone dock still no radio response admiral skates captain reported to jensen were going to siglamp very well only a handful of skates thirtyfive officers and crew had ever seen a signal lamp in action the brisk sharp louvered flashes of light in morse alien and amusingly oldfashioned in their nanotech computer age still a young able seaman whod volunteered for the course in signal lamp communication or dinosaur blinking as it was derisively referred to by navy nerds suddenly found himself the center of attention on skate if the ferry skipper they were almost always retired coast guard captains understood the dinosaur blinker and hove to as he was being ordered it might prevent some ugly stuff as skates signal lamp flashed golden above the blue of admiralty inlet and the patrol ship drew closer only a quarter mile from the ferry several gunners checking their laseraiming point boxes were surprised to see that there were no vehicles on any of the ferrys three decks and no one on deck damn ghost ship said a starboard gunner on autopilot suggested an increasingly nervous second mate the third mate organizing the boarding party damn peculiar conceded skates captain slow to twelve knots slow to twelve knots aye sir the sudden decrease from dash speed to twelve knots created a surge of water from the stern that broached the afterdeck but there was none of the gusto of a wave breaking over the bow exiting quickly foaming through the scuppers instead the water sloshing against skate from astern seemed markedly lethargic the starboard door of the ferrys bridge flew open and a heavy bearded individual stepped out bullhorn in hand what in hell are you doin what is your cargo asked skates captain classified came the reply headed for keystone stop your engines and prepare to receive a boarding party from uss skate what in hell for prepare for boarding skates captain instructed the first officer who gave the winch man the signal to lower the rib few reporters had qualms about using their sex appeal and charm to get a story but marte price did it better than most she had even bedded the formidable freeman once because shed confided to a friend she liked his gruff intelligence and manly disposition so much more attractive than the petty selfindulgent young studs of the entertainment world most were more interested in their coiffed hair and makeup than what was going on in the real world where men like freeman and his spec ops warriors were at the sharp end of things so that bel air brats could pout over multimilliondollar contracts she thought and americas kids could go to school without living in the perpetual chaos of hatred that marked the totalitarianism of much of the nonwestern world compared to douglas freeman the fiftyish captain of the port townsend keystone ferry was a pushover for her he redirected his stare from the tightly sheathed orbs of her angora sweater to his radar amusing the third mate who standing behind marte as the skate first hailed them gazed without embarrassment at her curvaceous derriere enveloped in a pair of tan microfiber pants that seemed no thicker than saran wrap the ferrys captain annoyed that the skate was making such a big deal of his radio being out reverting to a signal lamp lifted his bullhorn again and told the skate he was on a tight schedule im transporting highly classified personnel to keystone who are they none of your business this retort snapped the ferrys third mate out of his reverie with marte prices anatomy aware of the guns bristling all over the skate he dared suggest to his captain that he should welcome the boarding party which was now bobbing up and down in their rib immediately aft of the skate i was specifically told by washington the ferry captain told his mate not to allow anyone on board other than the nrbs scientific party and ms prices assistants and she is only permitted a camera interview with them for later broadcast subject to the military censors and were coming aboard stand by to assist admiral jensen watching through his binoculars from the keystone ramp was as perplexed by the boarding party as marte price aboard the ferry but to the marines there was nothing perplexing about it it was fubar situation normal fucked up beyond all recognition a classic case the age of electronic wizardry notwithstanding of one branch of the government not knowing what another was doing in this case someone somewhere had failed to notify the admiral that the military airlift flight scheduled to deliver nrbs two scientists and their crew from the east coast to nas whidbey had been canceled due to anonymous but credible bomb threats instead of having the nrbs personnel from out of newport en route to keystone the new delivery point selected was port townsend as the skates rib approached the bellicose ferry captain reverting to his high school macho in front of marte price was about to call up the four heavily armed military police who had been assigned to guard the nrb team on the cafeteria deck marte quick to see the possibility of tragedy and brushing her hair back its sheen enhanced by the early morning sun said captain youre handling this superbly i wonder though if it wouldnt be just as well to lend them a hand you know everyones so jittery these days besides i was wondering if i could get a shot of you welcoming the navy aboard brothers in arms you know i think the american people need to see that sort of thing what dyou think her smile could have launched a thousand ribs er well began the captain marte was hurrying the cameraman you think you could put on your cap she asked the ferry skipper i think that would give us just the right air of authority what my cap yes huh i guess if you think the skates mate snapped him a salute from the rib that did it marte heard an intake of air the captains chest visibly expanding his waist morphing from a generous to an alarmingly fit possibly even a the captain barked at a deckhand look lively and brusquely indicated that the rib party be given prompt assistance up the rope ladder another deckhand hastily unfurling the woodenslatted ladder against the ferrys side all but knocked the skates mate out of the rib steady on man barked the captain with the authority of a royal navy chief theyre aboard sir the skates ood informed the gunships captain via his walkietalkie i can see that rolston whos he got on board freemans rib was taking punishment alvaro at the console doing all he could to cross the ocean swells that had rolled in through the choke point between vancouver island and the olympic peninsula because of the rain that periodically poured down on the olympic peninsula up to twelve feet a year on mount olympus itself hundreds of waterfalls cascaded here and there over rock cliffs into the sea new falls born overnight as the pacificbred storms caused fresh erosion of the peninsula to the bitter disappointment of freemans sixman recon team when they reached the position the isotope anomaly had disappeared probably sucked out in the high tides drainoff from the strait said sal his voice all but drowned out either that shouted aussie over the crashing of the nearby surf against the rugged seastack shoreline or the spills faded because the subs turned into some supply cove or something no one else commented everyone including aussie and sal were gripping hard on the handrails midships of the inflatable its fiberglass keel smacking hard into swells over unbroken crests then sliding fast into the troughs had it not been for alvaros seamanship the rib would have capsized in a backflip several times over the mexicanamerican saw that one of the specfor warriors the welshamerican they called choir williams was turning a faint yet distinct shade of green made even more sickly looking by the drizzle of rain that continuously leaked from the gray status along the coast and the dreary mist which unlike the cloud cover sixty miles to the east around whidbey had not yet been burned off by the pale disk of autumn sun well go in the quieter water wait till this rain passes alvaro assured choir indicating a natural rockstrewn crescentshaped harbor off to their left on the port quarter the harbor about a half mile across and several hundred yards deep was fed by a massive floodcontrolled waterfall about fifty feet high and three hundred feet wide plunging precipitously from the hundredfoothigh cliffs that ran the whole curve of the beach forming a vine and bushcovered amphitheater it looked as if the side of a volcanic seamount had been blown out eons before choir raised one hand in thanks to alvaro as the rib passed through the pummeling surf his other hand still white from gripping the roll bar the rough fortythreemile trip out from port angeles had convinced freeman even more how difficult and frankly how useless david brentwood would have been in the rough weather in less than four minutes the ribs shallow draft keel passed over a sandbar covered in a foot or so of water and the six men immediately felt the change their grips on the hold bars relaxing the roar of the cataracts plunging all along the cliffs a welcome sound after the constant bullying roar and buffeting of the open sea aussie became excited for a moment pointing to something mansized in one of the many channels that ran out from under the heavily vegetated cliffs in the area a second later he saw the figure reappearing from behind the curtain of the waterfall into one of the water channels seal said salvini sea lion aussie corrected him freeman took his cell phone from its double ziploc bag and called admiral jensen at keystone the muchrelieved comsubpacgru commander telling the general that the nrbs two scientists two officers and three enlisted men had just arrived at keystone jensen didnt bother to bore the general with the screwup as the marine co had succinctly described the fracas between the navys skate and the washington ferry corporations captain now that hed found nothing after having put a rush on the nrb freeman felt a rare of case of embarrassment for his part jensen was annoyed to put it mildly after all the trouble hed gone to get the research sub to the west coast then again freeman had been the only one whod offered to help him when he was getting flak from everyone for not having assured a mine free strait and it was freeman jensen knew whod given him credit via cnn for the fiftysevenmile coast rerun by darkstar so the admiral said nothing other than to tell freeman that the nrb would be ready if and when freeman found anything besides there was still a lot the nrb could do the consensus in the pentagon being that it was the craft best suited to hunt down another small sub freeman glimpsed the sparkle of light beyond the lacy edge of the mammoth waterfall the nanosecond of recognition was followed by his shouted warning to the other five on the rib whether aussie choir salvini and the diver peter dixon like the general himself had reacted more quickly than coxswain alvaro because of their long combat experience was impossible to discern perhaps it was because alvaro was the most visible standing up at the ribs steering console in any event it was jorge who took the full burst of machinegun fire its sparkle of oneinfour tracer now long white darts shattering the consoles perspex and knocking the young man overboard the bloody cavity that a second before had been his chest awash in the wake of the rib the inflatable with no one at its console spun out of control slicing through the smaller but still powerful chop in the bay at such an acute angle that it teetered and would have capsized had choir not quickly moved from his hunkereddown position behind the roll bar and grabbed the wheel he brought the sixteenfooter about smartly cutting through the ribs earlier wake and with his comrades gripping the two hold bars shoved the throttle to full power enabling the rib to surge well away from the waterfall choir then just as quickly cut power at the water curtains halfway point where the waterfall was so voluminous that whoever had fired the burst at the rib would no longer be able to see it rocky island one oclock freeman shouted at choir take us there aussie dixon grab your draeger recon beyond the falls see what were up against sal and i will man the island with the m and at anchor aussie using his legs in a scissor hold around the left stanchion of the roll bar had his arms free to check and put on his draeger rebreather dixon with more recent practice was already in suit the fright hed experienced from the burst of fire replaced with a surge of anger it was the first time hed been shot at and he was surprised how quickly his outrage had evicted fear now he wanted to shoot back freeman was on the radio calling jensen at keystone no response not even the sound of static shot to ratshit aussie informed him indicating the console the radios innards a mess of shattered circuit boards and wiring on the ribs deck with that freeman unclipped his ziplocencased cell phone but murphys law was at large solar flare activity knocking out all satellite bounceoff signals in the ionosphere high above his fogbound environs cursing but undeterred the general grabbed one of the ribs three marker buoys switched on its flasher light and pulse signal locator and tossed it overboard hopefully the nrb now had its scientists and crew aboard and was already under way en route to assist his team choir geared the rib down to quarter speed and made for what freeman had hurriedly described as a rocky island as the rib approached it however the specfor team could see it was in fact no more than a stack of granite thrusting out of the bay an islet thirty feet in diameter its highest westernmost half a serrated wall four or five feet above sea level its eastern half closest to the approaching rib seemed to be awash in choppy water the result of turbulence radiating out from the waterfallsea interface as the falls tumbled from a wide slit halfway up the heavily vegetated cliff face we should be out of sight of that shooter once we get to these rocks said freeman providing he doesnt move farther around the bay replied choir raising his voice above the eardunning roar of the threehundredfootwide wall of white water pouring into the crescentshaped bay with the unyielding power of a dam whose spill gates were opened for maximum runoff fire support for dixon and aussie should they call for it would be blind freeman choir and sal realizing that the best they could do would be to fire a banana arc through the fall in hopes of keeping any shooters head down there was a sudden series of crashes as dark branches and clumps of earth plummeted down in the otherwise pristine curtain of water son of a bitch said sal with our radio kaput aussie and dixon wont be able to call us no sweat brooklyn freeman assured him with more confidence than he felt well do it the oldfashioned way wait for em to swim back and report why the hell would a shooter have just opened up on us like that you been smoking something sal asked the general choir answering the question as he coaxed the rib alongside the islet on the off protective seaward side because he thought we saw something jesus the midget sub a perfect hide said the general falls are a perfect curtain cold water to throw off any infrared snooping uav dont fancy those whirlpools general opined choir looking toward the falls they can swim said freeman tersely sides they can pull their rip cords if they have to he meant that aussie and dixon could activate their mae west inflatables choir nudged the islets side with the rib and despite the foamy choppy water could see a protruding ledge three feet below if there was a sudden suckdown the ribs fiberglass keel could find itself on the ledge and tip piece o cake sal told him salvini sensing choir was worried about what could be a tricky docking in the chop you ready with that line choir asked sal good to go mr williams when i say go right right chapter thirtythree the roc f was escorted by two of mccains f super hornets one of which was piloted by chipper armstrong and his rio evans the other by manowski and his rio evans was still smarting from having been left out the dogfight against the chicoms and manowskis rio was in no better mood as the pair of super hornets continued to escort the bizarro taiwanese falcon toward the carrier battle group admiral crowley though still in shock over his squadrons failure to prevent the bombing of penghu nevertheless had to force himself to concentrate on the bizarro situation his position about not allowing the falcon to land still stood for one thing the taiwanese falcon not being a carrier aircraft did not have sufficient underbelly strength to make a hard carrier landing hence the nickname jelly dick by which hard dick navy aviators condescendingly referred to air force fighters an f pilot at his best trying to minimize the shock of hitting the carrier deck would probably collapse his landing gear the fighter skidding and cartwheeling and either crashing into billions of dollars of mccains parked aircraft or slamming into the base of the island in either case there would be massive fire wreckage which would mean crowley couldnt bring in his lowongas squadrons coming back from penghu it was a nightmare scenario the rescue of one pilot taiwanese or american wasnt worth the risk to the mccain and those who worked on her we could put out a net cuso suggested but crowley shook his head the idea of using badmintona big net stretched across the deck to break the touchdown of a plane so low on gas that it didnt have enough fuel left for a goaround or was in some other way incapacitated still ran the risk of the falcon crashing into mccains superstructure the carriers island before it reached the net no said crowley with an air of finality hell have to ditch have our chopper pick him up cuso nodded assent but felt compelled no doubt because hed been an aviator himself to add chipper says the pilots shot up pretty bad ejection might not be an option lifes tough crowley said brusquely if he cant eject maybe he can ditch stay afloat long enough for our helo to snatch him cuso said nothing they both knew that if the pilot was so badly wounded that he couldnt reach down to grab the snake the fs ejection pull loop then he almost certainly didnt have the strength required to boss the controls to pancake long enough for the jolly green giant helicopter reach him crowley conveyed his decision to the rescue helo chipper armstrong and manowski thrilling mission chip came the wry voice from his backseat well look at it this way eagle said chipper maybe bizarro is the son of one of those superrich taiwanese industrialists and when he gets home daddys gonna be so grateful you and i get a big fat envelope reward for fishing junior out of the chuck your oxygen feed must have dropped below twenty right maybe chipper answered his voice tired but not surprisingly no longer as tense as when fitcompron took off the sight of the carrier and the focus needed for landing on a postage stamp was always a pickmeup the only problem remaining given that the taiwanese fighters radio was out was that either armstrong or manowski would have to make it clear to bizarro that he or she wouldnt be allowed to land on the carrier and would have to eject or ditch eagle evans however already had the potential problem solved using his navigation highlighter on the inside of his cockpit hed drawn a rough simple diagram of an lshaped pilots seat inclined backward showing an arrow curving up and out from it his large drawing clearly visible to the pilot of the shotup falcon outstanding eagle said manowski on the far right side of the falcon i can make that out from here if bizarro cant see that man hes blind chipper brought the hornet in closer to the falcon his thumb gesticulating to evanss ad hoc poster which chipper now knew would pass into the folklore of the boat along with the sadness of having lost so many good aviators in the miscalculation of the chicoms intentions over penghu he sees it manowski said the wingman glimpsing the falcons driver who though grimacing in pain slowly raised his hand from the control stick and pointed a bloodied thumb hes gonna do it chipper advised mccains cic hes gonna eject roger that came cics recognition put yourselves between him and the boat just to be sure repeat you and manowski get between him and the boat mccains two super hornets did so chipper speeding a quarter mile ahead manowski neatly executing a sideslip left over the falcon and into what had been chippers position both hornets were in a shallow low left turn at three thousand feet toward the mccain leveling out two miles from the carrier the three planes now down to knots had been given clearance to pass through the carrier battle groups usual nofly zone mccains jolly green giant was already aloft its swimmers checking their gear as the choppers pilot mccains cic armstrong and manowski verified that everyone was on the same page visàvis the precise gps spot near which theyd like the pilot to ditch can leonardo draw another billboard inquired john cuso with an unmistakable tone of admiration for rio evanss initiative can do confirmed eagle quickly slipping pages out of his knee pad to write out the gps numbers the three jets were aft of mccain beginning a slow wide uturn left the falcon pilot obediently pulling to the outside so the two super hornets were again between it and the carrier now a mile to the west suddenly the falcon pilot began pointing down at his digital control panel with such urgency that the four americans could see he was plainly alarmed hes out of gas proffered manowskis rio and too low for him to eject damn i dont began manowski then they saw the pilots thumb jabbing down again this time toward the sea give him room ordered cuso who then advised the helo go get him but keep clear of debris till hes settled chipper manowski stand by to enter glide path the falcon was trying to go into as shallow a dive as possible toward the sea but chipper and manowski could see thered be no pancake landing but a pelican crash a nosedive that would drive the falcon into the ocean with such impact there would be little chance of rescue god he almost made it cut in evans only a mile out and at a thousand feet the falcon made an astonishing recovery the pilot managing to pull it out of the dive chippers hud showed it leveling off at three hundred feet at knots it was eagleeyed evans who despite the obtuse angle of the hornets aviators to the falcon spotted the twin red dimesized glows the falcon going to afterburner its blip on both hornets radar moving rapidly from knots to breaking hard right hard left hard right from the beginning of what was expected to be its crash landing on the mccain but in fact was a crash dive striking the carriers deck it sent a huge rolling fireball that engulfed the center island incinerating three men on vultures row colored jackets running for their lives the flight deck was penetrated by a jagged fourteenfootdiameter crater the high explosive bomb that had been built into the falcons radargutted nose ripping open the rubberized deck with such force that wouldbe rescuers were burned and blown violently about the mangled deck or over the side many their clothes afire were scalded raw before they hit the water the bleeding mass of wounds immediately attracting the sharks of the straits relatively warm waters everyone was stunned by the sheer fury and unbelievable speed of what was the most successful kamikaze attack on an american carrier since world war ii the two super hornets pilots already low on gas realized there was nowhere to land for either them or the two badly mauled squadrons of tomcats and hornets returning from penghu armstrong and manowski had six minutes fuel remaining and admiral crowley had a monumental problem on his hands the five hundred feet of the designated launching area of the carrier from the rearmost of the four arresting wires to the stopping area three hundred feet farther down the deck at approximately midships had been shortened to feet because of the huge and still smoldering crater caused by the impact of the suicidal falcon somehow with armstrong and manowski making pattern in the fourbyonemile ovalshaped fly zone off the carriers port side and the twentytwo returning planes of mccains fitcompron only twenty minutes away to the northeast crowley cuso and their staff in the carriers air traffic control center had to figure out how to bring their pilots and their billiondollar birds home if the planes tail hooks could catch the first wire rather than the third one which exerted the least strain on a planes body or the fourth wire farther down they could buy themselves vital extra feet and with the hydraulic braking cylinder below deck jacked up as much as possible without risking the tension in the arresting wire literally tearing the tail section off the plane crowley figured he might just conceivably get them all down the net barrier could also be rigged to try to stop those aircraft that failed to be snagged by any of the arresting cables the difficulty with the net however was that it was time consuming the aircraft had to be disentangled from the elasticized net and a blue shirt had to direct the aviator out of the landing zone before the tractor hooked up and pulled the aircraft away to the designated parking areas along either side of the deck or below into the hangar and the whole enterprise depended on the hydraulic cylinders under the flight deck if the two cylinders had been damaged by the white heat from the crashs fires would they be able to provide the counterforce needed against the tremendous pull exerted by a landing aircrafts tail hook on inspection immediately after the deck fire was doused it was discovered that the explosion of the suicidal f obviously one of the roc jets captured on kinmen by the chicoms had produced such intense temperatures that the hydraulic cylinders on the gallery deck for the fourth and the third wire though aft of the crater were bleeding and that therefore the integrity of both cables and their spools was in question cusos conclusion with which the flight director concurred was that only the first and second wires could be trusted to trap the incoming planes successfully bringing them to a stop from mph in seconds this did not eliminate the always clear and present danger of a planes tail hook failing to snag either of those wires for this reason the incoming pilots as usual would push their throttles to full power at the moment of touchdown should they have to bolter down the fourteendegreeangled deck taking off to rejoin traffic for another attempt with the squadrons tomcats and hornets now only eleven minutes away john cuso quickly phoned the landing signals officer on the tiny forward portside platform lso its cuso here give me your greenie board list normally this score list of the pilots carrier landing ability was kept in the relevant squadrons ready room below the roof but cuso wanted a computer readout armstrongs and manowskis super hornets being so close to the boat would be first in but for the remainder of fitcompron now only ten minutes off admiral crowley wanted the hornets and tomcats stacked in greenie board order this meant that the best aviators in the squadrons would be given priority in the wait zone since their previous traps record indicated that they would have the best chance of being able to hook the wire on a first attempt this would allow the colored shirts to clear the deck quickly for the next incoming plane and so the normal nervewracking pressure with which mccains aviators had to contend during carrier landings increased exponentially each battlefatigued pilot knowing there was not the slightest margin for error on the cratershortened flight deck fitcompron eta eight minutes mccains landing signals officer switched on the lenses an arrangement of green red and orange lights to guide in the pilots the first in this case being chipper armstrong hed made the break from the holding pattern coming in downwind of the stampsized carrier deck ahead of him his fuel level was critical since his super hornet hadnt been topped up from the usual standby airborne tanker which was prevented from taking off from the carrier because the tankers props had been demolished by the falcons suicide attack the landing signals officer watched armstrongs hornet lowering its tail hook landing gear and flaps call the ball he radioed chipper in the hornets back seat eagle was straining his neck willing chipper as if by mental telepathy to see the orange blob of the meatball to make sure they were on the right line of approach call the ball came the lsos voice his tone more demanding now an exaviator himself the lso was both more and less forgiving of his charges his eyes glued to the approaching speck in the leaden sky snag it he told armstrong it was critical and every man and woman aboard the boat knew it the lso eschewing normal emissions control procedures in which light signals only were used to avoid employing enemyalerting radio call the ball the lso barked doing my best armstrong assured him best isnt good enough youre a naval aviator snag it roger ball said chipper confirming he had the amber light and row of green okay lights below it in his line of sight it was a technique pioneered by a british official in whitehall who had his secretary sight his desk as if it were a british carrier telling her to keep a ball in sight it required her to lower her torso comically like someone forced to keep walking with some invisible weight on her head pressing her down farther and farther as she came nearer to the desktop in the next nine seconds aviator armstrong eagle evans behind him in silent prayer dropped the super hornet to thirtyfive feet above the wounded carriers fantail the fighterbomber its nose up approaching at knots or approximately mph bit too fast said someone in air traffic control considering the crosswinds armstrong raised the nose a fraction higher his tail hook lowering hitting the deck at mph he immediately gunned the twin turbofanenhanced performance engines to full power the scream of the turbofans and the thud of the landing or controlled crash deafening several offduty sailors up on vultures row armstrong and evans were thrust forward with such violence by the stopping force of the first wire jerking out its cable from the hydraulically reined spools on the gallery deck below that evans would have bruise strips down both pectorals in milliseconds the colors swarmed the super hornet the greenvested hookrunner and blueshirted handlers the first in action the latter guiding armstrong away from the crater area to the second elevator forward of the island get er down hollered the blue shirt boss manowskis about to break armstrongs wingman was in fact already beginning his approach his fuel alarm blinking an urgent warning delivered verbally in the dulcet tone of a woman calmly telling him he was rapidly approaching empty i know it sweetheart dammit said manowski who during long missions was more disposed than usual to what the battle groups senior surgeon called politician gut the agony of his gaseous condition was not helped now by his mounting anxiety about the tiny slab of holed blacktop rushing up at him it felt as if his politician gut was about to explode against the restraint of his seat harness the prospect of the sudden negative g upon landing more frightening than the approach of any bogey dammit all he needed was to fart but no thatd be too helpful and that bastard murphy was clearly determined to make him suffer chapter thirtyfour admiral jensen was happy to hand over the nrb to its two scientists and crew hed issued a huge sigh of relief as he watched the research sub slide off its badly singed but still functional trailer under the watchful eyes of the marine guard inside the small waiting room one of the two scientists a brit grateful to the four marines whod risked hypothermia to check the waters about the ramp now produced a flask of brandy handing it to the marines who were warming themselves up i think ill partake of the medicinal elixir myself he told them his nerves he added still rather fragile following the terrifyingly near fatal confrontation between the ferrys captain and the gunfestooned uss skate outside the waiting room jensen standing with the marine captain watched as the other scientist about to descend the conning towers ladder his eyes shaded from the sunlitmirrored water glanced back at the singed and partly splintered wood of the subs trailer this oceanographer a whitebearded man in his midfifties onetime mentor to alicia mayne who had been so badly burned in the attack on the utahshifted his gaze from the trailer to the nrbs superstructure and ninetysixfootlong pressure hull the blast didnt damage the hull jensen called out to reassure him we went over it with a finetooth comb not even a hairline fracture the oceanographer whom the marine captain had already dubbed santa because of his long white beard waved and took a pensize flashlight out of the pocket of his skyblue coveralls the latter bearing the proud sailingship insignia of woods hole oceanographic institute well take a look anyway he told the admiral with that he and two crew members one a female naval officer with a distinctly mannish haircut and serious demeanor disappeared down into the super hightech research sub whose sidescan sonar the most sensitive in the world was capable according to one marine of detecting a safety pin on the sea bottom the marine captain asked jensen about this claim is that true sir no replied jensen the admirals response accompanied by a smile its like those satellites that are supposed to be able to read a newspaper in red square it can spot the newspaper not the print maybe a fourinch headline or a big photo but not santa reappeared standing waisthigh in the small conning tower its buggered what dyou mean buggered shot back jensen but he knew well enough what the scientist was telling him was that the nrb was out of commission the nacelle said the scientist by which he meant the nose section of the sub has been spalled surprisingly at least to the marine captain the admiral didnt seem to understand what santa meant by spalledthat while the terrorists explosion of c beneath the bitumen road hadnt so much as scratched the nrb externally the tremendous concussion of the explosive against the nrbs threeinchthick hightensile steel had been akin to someone striking a fortyfourgallon drum with a rubberheaded sledgehammer minute flakes of rust from the inside wall of the drum or in this case flecks of paint on the inside wall of the subs nose cone had broken free at supersonic speed from the impact this spalling redhot paintflaked shrapnel had sprayed the delicate if firmly housed electronic array that was the research subs prized sonar in effect the eyes of the nrb which had so successfully searched for and recovered vital parts of the space shuttle challenger wreckage an air force tomcat that had gone down in the sea off north carolina and among its most glorious military and civilian exploits discovered no less than twentysix shipwrecks in twelve hours were now blind and of no use to freeman and his team or to anyone else can we replace it jensen called out on realizing the damage the sonar yes said the oceanographer when two weeks maybe less then wed need sea trials to calibrate the jensen had his hands over his face hiding sheer frustration or tears or both the marine captain wasnt sure same thing when a tanks hit said the marine by way of relieving the gloomy silence that had descended like sudden rain over the sunglinting sea doesnt matter if the round penetrates force of the hit fills the air inside with tiny whitehot metal fragments like a swarm of why the hell didnt you think of that before jensen cut in as if it would have made a difference the fact was the nrb was effectively a writeoff until the navy and its civilian contractor could rush in a replacement sonar and even then the job of extracting the ruined components from the nrb would be a singularly timeconsuming task of negotiating awkward angles in confined spaces the tiny nrb unlike rorkes former virginiaclass sub did not have the advantage of addon takeoff modular architecture whereby whole remotely controlled or mancrewed submersible modules could easily be added or removed as needed for special missions freemans on his own jensen said disconsolately overwhelmed by the bitter irony that the very man who had given him the reputationsalvaging chance of helping to zero in on the cause of the us navys catastrophe in the juan de fuca strait was now denied the assistance of the nrb because he jensen had failed to deliver the boat safely to the keystone dock theyll call me the keystone admiral jensen told the marine captain bitterly but the officer of a younger generation failed to get the analogy to the infamously incompetent keystone kops of celluloid screen you could send the skate suggested the marine captain yes agreed jensen wracked by indecision he knew that to dispatch the patrol craft would leave only one to guard the hood canal bridge and thus the egress of any submarine out of bangor which could invite further disaster aussie was glad that the waterfall and environs were shrouded in fog and sea mist he had heard about the supposed extraordinary clarity of the cold northwest waters but had put all the reports in what he called his fifty pbsfifty percent bs file even with the fog hanging over the surface above him the waters transparence was a shock to him and with every breast stroke he took twenty feet down he feared being spotted by anyone high on the cliff beyond the waterfall or for that matter by anyone on what was probably an apron of rocks and sand behind the crescent bays falls peter dixon only a few feet away on aussies right was more comfortable because of the frequent shower of rain that peppered the surface and the surface disturbance created by the local whirlpools from the turbulence of the waterfall he knew that all of this would make it difficult for anyone swimming on the surface to see more than several feet below them once he was through the thunder and caldronlike fury of the falls churning beneath the surface dixon indicated they go up to recon aussie was unable to see his swim buddys arm signal at first blocked as it was by the effusion of bubbles that momentarily rendered their bubbleless draeger units redundant dixons signal had also been hidden by a silvery gray school of chinook salmon their fluid beauty pocked here and there by grumpymouthed rockfish who refused to move out of the way of their more numerous and streamlined cousins by the time aussie saw the second signal from dixon whose thumbs were jerking impatiently upward dixon was already four or five feet above him he broke surface first deafened by the thundering of the waterfall about ten feet directly behind him when aussie surfaced he found himself amid such a profusion of bubbles and the mist they created it took him like dixon ahead of him a while to adjust his vision it was as if theyd moved from a dull winterlit room to an even dimmer one the water behind the falls significantly darker because of the overhang of the cliffs face the waterfalls effervescent mist also blooming out their infrared lenses still in the gloomy light between the falls and the edge of the bay dixon saw something few men had ever seen seeing it too lewis actually gasped in surprise it was a midget sub docked a hundred feet in from them by a natural rock wall that formed part of the crescent bay and was curtained by the falls dixon counted four guards two at the bow and two at the subs stern in his minds eye aussie had thought of this midget sub first reported by dixons deceased swim buddy as being like the japanese navys small midget sub three of which had slipped through sydney harbors defenses in may torpedoing the ferry kuttabul and killing nineteen but what he was looking at now was considerably bigger a long cigar shape over a hundred feet in length its diameter about twelve feet and the conning tower around eight feet high but after he and dixon swam back underneath the turbulent cover of the seawaterfall interface to reach the rocky islet a hundred yards away their descriptions of the midget differed dixon his weathered warpainted face grimacing with the effort of shucking off the weight of his draeger rebreather flippers and other kit thought that the bow was not so much spherical but a tad wider than it was high maybe it is a tad wider riposted aussie so what must be only a difference of a few inches at that if its spherical said freeman it could be nuclear thats the difference aussie choir raised his eyebrows but sal gave no indication that hed heard the general concentrating on checking his m one cartridge in the chamber his finger resting on the safety if anyone so much as poked their snout around the western edge of the falls he told choir ill take their fuckin head off the boy from brooklyn as aussie often called him had no intention of ending up like the once valiant medal of honor winner one arm as useless as a spent dick to be left dangling by his side for the rest of his life for salvini the shock of what had purportedly happened during the oda mission to take out terrorist chief li kuan troubled him nightly like his persistent dream of not having passed his high school exams which tormented him with the endlessly recurring scene in which he was barred from entering the final examination room american history because he was late having wasted time at a crosswalk bending down while the rest of his buddies caught the light and crossed the street by the time hed tied up the lace of his nike just do it sneaker the pedestrian signal had changed back to dont walk the red signals blink morphing into a stream of paralysisinducing red tracer so what if its nuclearpowered aussie challenged the general in a tone that surprised dixon who used to the yes sir no sir exchanges between officers and men was taken aback by the lively sense of equality in freemans team because freeman answered aussie patiently if its nuclear powered whats it doing needing a dock a nuclear boat doesnt need recharging for fifteen to twenty years needs rearming though said aussie matteroffactly seeing the point and adding nukes can also go a long time without replenishing freezedried food but not munitions not at the rate this suckers been sinking our boats aussies comment made such an obvious yet important point that the general realized just how sleep deprived he was with that freeman did something he normally tried to avoid from his load vest he pulled out a small watertight ziploc bag of dark chocolatecovered roasted coffee beans took four by way of example and offered the rest to the team without looking up sal said two for me sir aussie also took two choir and dixon declining the frigid water had been more than sufficient to wake them up how many guards freeman asked aussie and dixon four that i saw said dixon but i couldnt see shit in there for a while water fogged my ir aussie four and that doesnt make any sense wheres everybody else no sign of a crew aboard the sub suggested choir fine acknowledged aussie but where are the supply donkeys dixon mentioned that hed seen something that looked a bit like a dark canvas awning extending back from the subs conning tower to the base of the cliff but maybe it only covered a gangway that went as far as the rock landing it was so damned gloomy i never saw it answered aussie probably cause i broke surface at right angles to the conning tower could have been a stream of guys coming and going under a tarp and i wouldnt have seen em wouldve thought theyd be out in force choir said after that bugger took a shot at us damn began the general had the caffeine from the chocolatecoated java beans jolted him that fast wondered choir thats why we didnt see a crowd freeman continued bastards are frantically loading the whore so it can cast off and run riot again in the strait were going in aussie lewis had known ever since he was a small boy that he was brave always ready to stand on his dig as the australian prospectors used to call it refusing to give up their claim in the gold field but refusing to give ground and dashing off half cocked were two different things general countered aussie the moment our rib pokes its nose around either end of the friggin waterfall those lookouts are gonna have us cold dead in their sights from either end of the sub and theyll be firing from solid ground if we do get a chance of return fire well be bobbing around like a cork brooklyn here couldnt even hit em with his scatter gun aussie took a breath and said something specfor warriors seldom say its too risky theyll take us all out and then what no one knows where we are no backup nada and were out of radio contact no cavalry nrb should be on its way said choir sos christmas retorted aussie sides all that jensen has is our general area air strike possible asked dixon his own question answered as he looked about at the sea mist and fog hugging the coast like a coat not a single tree visible atop the cliff from which the falls cascaded weathers socked us in said freeman raising his voice again over the sound of the falls anyway by the time whidbey got any asw birds airborne the subd be outta here for several moments no one spoke and in the dreary gray world that had enveloped the crescent bay and surrounding coastline all they could hear was the continuing thunder of the falls and the oceans unceasing attack against their rocky islet freemans mind was racing like a computer drawing on all his past experiences from the steamy jungles of southeast asia to the bonecold engagements on the north german plain and the forays of his specfor teams in the snowpacked mountains of the pacific northwest itself where he choir aussie sal and david brentwood had gone toetotoe against white supremacist militias there is one way freeman announced his eyes fixed on aussie lewis damn said lewis i think you want me to get wet again general freemans weathered face turned to dixon how bout you and aussie strap on those draegers and go under the falls again only this time come up shooting itll be the last thing theyll expect dixon nodded slowly either from a distinct lack of enthusiasm or because of his failure to envision the whole plan you want us to pin them down no said freeman i want you to kill them while you three make an end run around the end of the falls in the rib aussie said right no said freeman we threell do something else they wont expect youre going to attack through the falls said aussie affirmative confirmed freeman full bore through the middle the general slapped choir on the shoulder think you can handle that my friend piece o cake said choir jesus put in sal those fallsll sink us not if we hit em at full power the general assured them with more confidence than he felt true the falls were no more than three or four feet through but with the tumbling force of thousands of gallons a second the impact would be tremendous it would be in the parlance of his british specfor compatriots a close run thing if choir couldnt master the wheel in the crushing wall of water if the good welshman allowed the inflatable to veer slightly one way or the other away from a right angle impact the skew torque as aussie lewis so eloquently warned them would send the rib ass over tit upending it dumping the legendary general salvini and coxswain choir into the swirling water moat between the falls and the midget sub sitting ducks aussie told them thank you riposted choir for your vote of confidence biggest thing youve steered said aussie is one of those dorky piss pots you welsh paddle across a creek he was referring to a welsh coracle the ancient basketlike and portable oneman boat made from the small branches of shrubs and trees and still used by quiet water fishermen hurry up with those draegers the general told aussie and dixon before they cast off dixon easily put the draeger on he and albinski having gotten used to donning their rebreather units with the same ease and confidence of long practice with which aussie lewis handled his heckler koch mp submachine gun these weapons are waterproof right dixon asked lewis well began aussie if you quiet it was salvini his concentration so focused that he was the first to hear the sound a faint but distinct rumbling a diesel proffered dixon anxiously so much for it being nuclear powered synchronize watches ordered freeman we hit the falls at in five minutes five minutes at acknowledged dixon followed by aussie who like dixon was spitting into his face mask quickly rubbing the saliva about to guard against condensation it reminded dixon of his dives with rafe albinski go freeman ordered and both aussie and dixon dropped backward into the sea into the rib freeman told choir and salvini lash the tarp tight over the gear choir was already priming the outboards gas pump while salvini anticipating the interval between the rise and fall of the bruiser adroitly jumped to the inflatable and immediately began securing the weapons ammo and other equipment freeman quickly handed his hk submachine gun down to sal to have it clipped into its rack it was a race before the midget sub cast off and submerged free to resume its unseen control of the straits choke point freemans gungho body language exuded confidence and the instant he was on the prow of the boat he was taken back to the exact moment in which his desire to be a leader had crystallized the moment when as a young boy hed first gazed upon emmanuel leutzes famous painting of washington crossing the icefloechoked delaware the revolutionary general standing proudly in the boats prow freemans confidence however was qualified by his own surprise at the terrorists not having already followed up on the burst of fire by their lookout whose vigilance had unwittingly given away their position it had only been fifteen minutes ago but freeman knew that if hed been in command on the other side of the falls he would already have had his men launch some kind of followup attack against the five americans why hadnt the enemy done so chapter thirtyfive as freeman tried using his satellite phone to no avail the atmospherics still dominated by the fryingfish sound of interference in the ionosphere he caught sight of aussie lewiss flippers aussie had momentarily surfaced to get his bearings before making a deep tumble dive to get well below the underwater turbulence of the falls before swimming the hundred feet or so to the sub the fact that the general choir and sal all agreed it was aussie although his gear was exactly the same as dixons bore testimony to how closely they had worked over the years they were like friends distinguishing each other from a crowd not by physical features but merely by the way they moved reading one anothers body language with an unconscious certainty that amazed dixon the newcomer the coast guard diver having more experience in the strait than aussie lewis had not felt the need to surface to make sure of his bearings now he was waiting on the other landward side of the falls in the darker water that served as a moat between the falls deafening torrent and the sub whose type other than it being a midget was still a matter of speculation not even the identity of the balaclavamasked terrorist he and aussie had spotted earlier was known though dixon was confident that he and the rest of the specfor team would soon find out it was three minutes since he and aussie had left the islet another two minutes and freeman choir and sal should come through the falls like gangbusters and then the five of them would open up aussie for his part estimated that freeman sal and choir should reach the sub in short order a couple of he grenades down the hatch from either sal or the general would do nicely he thought certainly enough to delay the bastards until either the nrb or a coast guard gunboat could arrive for the coup de grace relying on the waterfalls turbulence now a mere fifty feet behind them neither aussie nor dixon anticipated any problem surfacing any anxiety freeman might have had about the fog rolling in now completely obscuring the falls was not evident in his brisk eager preparations he assisted sal in mounting the strippeddown seal version m on the bows pivot mount as the noise of the falls smothered all sounds save the deep pulsating rumble that he and the other four men assumed was the subs dieselelectric warming up readying for imminent departure two minutes shouted choir keeping the ribs volvo penta inboard purring while sal the m now secure took the fourteenfoot spiked pike from its quickrelease rack that ran along the port side pushing the pole against the islet to keep the rib clear of the dangerous barnacleclad projection of rock that appeared and disappeared threateningly with each suck and surge of the sea for sal the kind of vigilance needed to keep the sixteenfoot boat from being tipped over through contact with the protruding ledge proved more stressful than combat and he remembered that for david brentwood the most trying part of a mission had always been going over the rules of engagement the medal of honor winner was always concerned that he might commit a blue on blue an attack on his own forces sal knew it was a different source of tension than he felt but the effect was the same they almost welcomed combat as a release not only from the immediate anxiety of the situation but from the tension of life itself as choir gave the rib engine its head the waterfall speeding toward them sal quickly left his roll bar position to reach the bowmounted m hold on and duck yelled choir the rib struck the waterfall at thirtyfive miles an hour all three men fighting against instinctively closing their eyes the icewhite thunder collapsing all around slamming them into the swirling maelstrom of foam on the deck then they were through freeman heard the unmistakable rip of kalashnikov bullets peppering the whirlpools about the rib the crafts series of neoprene inflatable cells along the starboard midships section exploding like popcorn choir seeing the teams hopedfor surprise popped along with the inflatable cells opened up the volvo penta the ribs bow fairly leaping out of the salt chuck hitting knots as it sped past the sunsparkling curtain of falls with only ninety feet to go to the sub turning choir yelled then hard right so loudly there was no possibility of either freeman or sal not hearing him despite the rip of the ms oneinthree tracer almost a red line at that close range with barely forty feet to go sals m fire was wild and unavoidably inaccurate in the ribs hard brainpummeling progress against the relatively calmer but still rough water between the rib and the sub choir dropped the speed to twenty knots simultaneously wrenching the wheel astarboard further confounding the enemys aim salvini given forewarning of the turn and having seen that his previous m bursts were too high dropped the barrel down an inch or so and raked the upper lip of a dark thirtyfootwide cave mouth he could now discern immediately behind the docked sub he also raked the long black floating log of a sub the midgets tenfootlong sail or conning tower was a black lump that sparked with the fiery orange hits of his sustained burst which was completely ineffective as sal knew it would be against the hightensile steel but his firing had at least forced the subs akarmed lookouts to run for cover two of them were hit as they raced from the subs bow along its deck heading for the narrow covered walkway that led inshore from the subs sail toward the cave salvinis m rounds kept coming and he cut them down one man toppling into the water thrashing about in an agony that ceased with a quick burst from freemans hk the other one up and running again until the generals mm bullets finished his desperate sprint normally the parabellum rounds hed just fired had less stopping power particularly when sprayed at obtuse angles but the general had fired a tight group of three rounds more or less straight in over the fortyfoot range the other reason the bullets had proved so deadly and werent bee stings as freeman was wont to say was that in direct contravention of the geneva accords hed used hydroshok ammo rather than legal hard ball the frangible head of the hydroshok expanded inside the recipients body the nanosecond he was struck where the hell are our swimmers sal shouted underwater replied freeman where id be with all this crap flying his sentence went unfinished as choir drove the rib through a dangerously unstable s pattern which further confounded the enemys aim and forced freeman to grab the roll bar letting forth a burst of obscenities which only a longshoreman and aussie lewis if he was still alive could have fully interpreted at the moment however aussie lewis and dixon were fighting for their lives theyd seen two dark shapes diving from the subs deck both bearing knives not the standard kbar blades or expensive randalls but eighteeninch bayonets that would pass right through a man with steel to spare alarmed dixon glanced across at aussie who pointed down and drew his hand across his throat a move that caused dixon to gulp and swallow a huge bubble from the fierce wash cycle churned up by choirs effective but bonebusting evasive antics the welshmans crazy pattern wake all but covered the moat area with bubbles which temporarily kept both pairs of divers from each other as well as from their respective surface combatants the rib careening successfully at first crisscrossing the moat behind the falls and sub now came under steady and heavy automated fire from the cave behind the sub below the two pairs of divers engaged without circling each other or using any of the fancy energywasting tricks and turns imagined by some who have never been swimming for their lives in the sandstirred undersea world bounded by the falls and the submarine the soft sound of rubber fins was obliterated by the high whine of the ribs engine and the increasing rumble of the subs diesel aussie intending to take the initiative closed with his opposite number who kicked hard in a burst of speed trying to drive home the overreach of his bayonet through lewiss chest aussie slowed trading speed for accuracy of impact the enemys first righthanded bayonet thrust was short a feint that drew in aussies kbar which aussies opponent smartly deflected with a smaller blade that had suddenly materialized in his left hand aussie against all logic released his grip on his parried right hand gripping the enemys knife wrist instead the enemy diver driving his bayonet in a flurry of effervesced water hard toward aussies chest aussie twisted the bayonet slicing clean through his draegers leftside hose and ricocheting off the draegers chestmounted housing then aussie kicked once bringing up his free left hand thrusting hard striking the other swimmers mask with such force it was knocked away from the mans face the expelled air momentarily blinding both him and aussie but with his mask still on aussie had the better of it when his opponent turned frantically to retrieve his own mask aussie brought his right knee up hard into the mans scrotum the mans mouth agape with the shock of the hit he involuntarily gulped in seawater which lewis knew would drown all discipline and training his opponent might have in an intuitive act of survival aussies opponent rose quickly toward the surface for air any breath his lungs might have had in reserve was now depleted the bubbles rising from his transit to the surface joining those coming from aussies left hand as lewis grabbed the mans right leg as it passed in front of him and with one savage slash of his kbars blue steel sliced through the mans neoprene sheath with such fury that it cut to the bone a cloud of cherryred blood obscured aussies view before it was quickly diluted to a watermelon pink through which aussie glimpsed the tail end of a school of salmon which he now realized had been all around them and were fleeing perhaps aussie thought because of approaching sharks he kicked with all the energy he had his fins propelling him fast toward the surface the whine of the rib engine piercing his eardrums as he crashed into the frenzied body of his opponent at the surface the wounded man gulping in the icy pristine air above the roiling blue had realized he was no longer able to swim to aussies astonishment he and his opponent were no more than twenty feet away from an enormous floating log which lewis quickly realized was the midget sub his vision impaired by the turmoil created by the other mans panic aussie grabbed at a black orb that was his opponents head stabbing it repeatedly with his kbar aussies enemy meanwhile charged with fear and adrenaline was like a writhing swordfish and still dangerous so instead of going for his heart as ancient greek warriors had and would have been his preference aussie did it the most effective if messy way puncturing him wherever contact could be made he dragged his opponent under and stabbed him repeatedly until the mans body went limp exhausted aussie then released him the only sound he could hear apart from the falls being the rapid fire of machine guns hed seen a dozen or so men casting off lines from stakes that had been driven into crevices along the rock shelf in front of the cave and here and there in a crushedshell beach just east of the rock ledge but he couldnt contact the rib he looked around for dixon but all he could see was the sub moving out and beyond it on the rocky ledge in front of the cave a pile of discarded cardboard boxes large sheets of torn paper plastic wrap and assorted rubbish littering the beach the paper alternately billowing and collapsing from phantom breezes that seemed to be coming out of the cave freeman sal and choir had returned to the islet ignobly but sensibly taking cover behind the small jagged sixfootlong fivefoothigh rock wall the guano that had remained undisturbed atop the wall now rose like chalk dust as the subs defendersabout fourteen of em sal told freeman continued to rake the rock with light and heavy machinegun fire where the began sal his words drowned out by such an enfilade of heavy caliber and light machinegun fire that the salt air above the small islet sang with the discordant noise of ricocheting rounds which had it not been for the small rock wall would have literally chopped the general and his two compatriots to pieces you see dixon or aussie it was choir his welsh accent always more pronounced in the taut crackling air of a firefight i dont like this said sal in one of his more memorable understatements i dont like it at all choir crawling along on his belly ignominiously peeked an inch or two around the end of the rock wall shite the subs moving goddammit sal bellowed freeman pointing to the lasheddown hump of equipment in the rib which slapped noisily and annoyingly against the protected sea side of the islet gimme that at wont stop it with that general sal said as he passed the oneshot selfcontained antitank launcher freeman had eschewed using earlier from the islet because it would have been a wasted shot given the impediment to his line of sight formed by the falls hed also known that had he tried a blind shot the swedishbuilt rocket would have exploded in transit the second its warhead struck the water wall but now the subs fiftyfootlong forward section from sail to bow was nosing out beyond the edge of the waterfall got that at round ready freeman shouted answering salvinis skepticism about being able to hit anything worthwhile given the impediment of the sub countdown from ten to fire he told salvini and choir ten to fire confirmed sal ready to heave up the strippeddown but still substantial m the terrorists fire increasing as if they had divined freemans intentions the general his left side hugging the western edge of the islets rock wall was ready to swing the at launcher around as choir and sal prepared at great risk to lay down covering fire the enemys enfilade whacking loudly into the islets protective rock wall and surrounding water other rounds whistling ominously overhead ten freeman began nine eight seven son of a hold it sal crouched poised to come up with the m firing before its folded bipod even had time to rest on the top of the islets protective wall gave a snort of suppressed laughter despite the precariousness of their situation the sub nosing out from its cliffbottom berth behind the waterfall and despite the worrisome fact that none of the three had seen any sign of aussie or dixon since the two divers had disappeared under the fall the fact that in the middle of this murderous encounter freeman should be so conditioned by modern technology that he stopped his countdown because his cell phones vibration had put him off his count struck sal as singularly hilarious yet part of the reason freeman answered the cell so promptly was that it was obviously working now the atmospherics having improved sufficiently for communication to be reestablished it might be jensen said choir hoping the nrb was en route that the news wasnt good from jensens end was evidenced by freeman cursing above the sound of the terrorists fire and the increasing bass of the midget subs diesel engine the goddamned nrbs kaput he yelled the only thing that might be available jensen had told him is the patrol craft adding whats all that noise a damned firefight freeman bellowed his voice whipped away by gusts that were turning the previously calm blue bay into a spindriftveined caldron weve found the goddamned midget sub only its not such a midget after all better send your patrol boat send anything youve got fast as you can admiral with that freeman gave jensen the gps coordinates on his cell subs coming through the falls general sal warned bow at eleven oclock it told freeman still holding the at launcher that the bow had now moved away from its earlier two oclock berth position to a point a hundred yards left of the islet which in turn told him that if he didnt fire soon the sub would be through past the falls and heading unhindered out to sea and that the protected space behind the islets sixfoothigh wall would then be exposed to unhindered lateral fire from the sub at virtually pointblank range freeman shouldered the launcher ten nine eight seven six five four three two one a vicious gust punched the islet combining with the ferocious backblast of the rocket motor as the coneshaped mm warhead shot out from its fiberglass tube at sixtyfour miles an hour metal whacked metal the subs progress so inhibited by the buckled steel basket around its prop that freeman estimated its speed at no more than a knot with its steering likewise affected it was crabbing toward the eastern sandbank of a twentyfootwide exit channel choir reading the situation as clearly as freeman and sal was already in the rib the three warriors anticipating the consternation in the sub and preferring to take their chances in the rib as a fast mobile target rather than remaining on the islet freemans shot disabling the sub ironically had also exposed the islet as a target should any of the terrorists mount the midget subs sail to pay back the americans for their audacity where the hells aussie and dixon called sal as choir gunned the rib calling on all its horsepower i see dixon yelled choir hes stuck on that sea stack over there choir indicated a stubby dumpstersized starfishcluttered sea stack fifty yards west of them the seal diver having clung to the sea side of the stack had now inched his way farther around it while it didnt afford any flat areas upon which he might rest it was nevertheless scabrous enough with crustaceans that he had no difficulty hanging on to it out of the subs line of fire heading for him the rib began taking fire from a dozen or so of the hooded terrorists who positioned themselves along the docka crescent of crushed shell and sand to the left of the cave inaccurate though it was given the fastmoving rib neither freeman sal nor choir had much more success at hitting their terrorist targets once theyd looped dixon aboard one second they were firing from atop a fourfoot chop the next they were shooting on the downslide the loud crackling firefight coming from both sides unable to exact any serious punishment then aussie having successfully sought the turbulence of the waterfallsea interface to hide in saw the sail of the midget which had appeared much larger from the water coming alive with men wearing black balaclavas and overalls like soldier ants erupting from their hive half a dozen of the terrorists were already on deck another cramped four remaining in the sail two of the latter aussie could see were a machine gunner and his feeder of the other duo one was obviously what us military attachés around the world colloquially called the tic terrorist in charge his authority evident as he directed a work party hurriedly toward the stern the other man held an ak while the tic continued to instruct his minions aft via what aussie guessed must be a throat mike two of the six soldier ants opened up with kalashnikovs the sound augmenting the tarpaperripping noise of the sails heavy caliber machine gun whose fanshaped sweep of fire moved unhurriedly but with relentless intensity through a seventytoninety degree arc from the rib that had picked up dixon across to the interface of the waterfall and the open sea it was as if the tic had anticipated that the remaining american diver aussie possibly wounded would seek the camouflage of the falls perhaps using its noise as a cover in the event that he was so badly hurt he could not silence his pain freeman unable to see aussie lewis nevertheless refused to risk losing the rib in looking for him he knew aussie would have made the same decision no point going after one man when it was critical that the rib by using the sea stack and islet as protection could continue to harass the sub to buy time until jensens patrol craft andor aircraft could arrive and should the sub despite the violent cavitation of its shaft somehow manage to get to deep water and dive freeman knew it was imperative that he choir sal and now dixon mark its position for the massive antisub attack that would be launched in any event even if it managed to maintain a knot or more should the soldier ants repair the props basket the four americans seriously doubted that the sub would get beyond the main channel freeman choir and salvini also understood that despite their ribs maneuverability and firepower now that theyd expended the at launcher their collective small arms fire would be no match for the sub though a midget it nevertheless dwarfed and outgunned them with the big mounted on the sail aussie his strength waning as he trod water in the sunlit mist of the falls also understood the necessity of the rib biding its time now using the protection of what would afterward be known as dixons sea stack aussie further understood something his four companions couldnt because their line of sight was obscured by the waterfalls mist and the islet east of them a work party of four of the blackclad submariners was already busy with monkey wrenches a man with a sledgehammer standing by the four men were obviously trying to unscrew the four bolts that held the props protective basket in place one of the two starboard bolts already undone if they managed to remove and jettison the protective basket in time the props shaft free of the warped basket could surge to full power then the sub even at six or eight knots would be out and crash diving in minutes aussie knew that even if the general had reestablished contact with admiral jensen and comsubpacgru had dispatched the cavalry it was highly doubtful theyd detect the midget because the sub was sheathed entirely in a kind of soundabsorbing anechoic tile hed never seen before the tiles so barnaclefree that aussie guessed they must be virtually brand new and impermeable to antisub sonar added to this was the one great advantage the dieselelectric subs had over the nuclear super subs such as captain rorkes late virginiaclass utah the oldfashioned diesel electrics were able to shut down completely able to sit somewhere on the vast ocean bottom in absolute silence while the nukes for all their noisedampening independently suspended compartment technology could never be totally noisefree because of the necessity of keeping the reactors cooling pump going at all times the giveaway heartbeat however faint of every nuclear navy aussie intuitively flinched as another long burst of the subs heavy caliber machine gun raked dixons sea stack the rounds zinging off the basalt rock sending beehivehumming fragments of starfish and crustaceans into the air perhaps aussie thought if he could muster enough energy to dive and swim to the sub coming in on its eastern flank where the terrorists were least likely to expect an attack he could toss two or three of his he and flashbang grenades and take out the allowing the rib to speed in and unload all the ordnance it had on the work party as if his comrades two hundred yards off to the west behind the sea stack had the same intent in mind sal dixon and freeman choir steering the rib as it darted out from behind the stack opened fire sal was on the bowmounted m dixon feeding its belt and the general was firing his mp thin high plumes of water were leaping up about the subs stern from the fusilade one of the terrorists fourman work party dropped away from the props basket his body spurting blood as gulls screeched in alarm and expectation above the sub whose sail seemed to explode in an outrage of return fire that sent the rib in a tight uturn back behind the stack what gave aussie pause for thought was the extraordinary bravery of the work party only one of the remaining three flinching under the ribs attack even so there was no pause in their work none of them deigning to turn around the only visible sign of their concern being the increased activity around the basket their remarkable concentration projecting an air of contempt for the nuisance americans seeing the same insouciance the general admiringly muttered by god as he helped sal and dixon secure the rib to the stacks barnaclecrusted hide id decorate those sons of bitches every one of them id rather shoot em general said sal the general slapped salvini heartily on the shoulder so would i brooklyn so would i but all we have to do is worry them for another ten minutes then we should have close air support sink the bastards thats for me said choir dixon said nothing the delayed shock of his underwater fight now hitting him full force leaving him unable to join in the banter that seemed to come so naturally to these combathardened warriors the loss too of his mentor and friend albinski was still too recent along with the scenes of floating often eviscerated dead hed seen littering the strait east of the uscanadian choke point and the smell of the dead something that none of the training films or movies had managed to convey a stink that evoked feelings of revulsion then guilt for feeling such revulsion all this had at once frightened and confused him if only he had the guts to dive he thought to swim out and pop up close enough to the subs stern dixon freeman said the generals left hand acting as a pike for the rib against the stack sir you see what nationality the guy was no sir was all i could do to stop the bastard from killing they both instinctively ducked together with choir and salvini the subs machine gun punching its heavy caliber rounds into the stack the wind behind them made their impact so loud it sounded as if they were going to come straight through the rock the ricochets went every which way one of them clipping the ribs defunct radio mast which the man on the sub could see now and then as the inflatable rode up and down in the chop nothing particular about his weapons freeman asked dixon the generals cool under fire remarkable to dixon whose first kill had happened only a half hour or so before nothing particular that i saw on him general knife freeman pressed son of a began dixon in surprise when another of thes bursts found its target keeping the americans heads down buying time what was it you saw demanded freeman it was a tak teninch blade with a yeah a drop point i recognized it because some of the canuck jtf guys use em jtf was the canadians select antiterrorist commando force canvaslike grip continued dixon a cutting edge i dunno about four or five inches i know it said freeman what we need to know said choir is what kind of sub it is oh i know that said freeman its a midget shit said sal shaking his head this time the three veterans laughter was joined by dixons he liked these guys a hell of a situation they were in unable to stop what might have been the biggest threat to american security in the history of the republic and these guys could crack a joke a weak joke sure but a joke this he thought was what the drill instructors meant about staying calm under fire for my money said freeman still talking about the tak knife it means this damned sub might be supplied locally from across the line from terrorists in canada not the subs ordnance thats been dropped off probably the same freighter that dropped off the midget in the first place so pressed sal his tone of cheeky informality still capable of surprising dixon the outsider a welcome one but an outsider nevertheless whoever those bastards are on the sub freeman said to dixon you think you could get close enough to delay them a bit longer the generals question was just that a question not a command the subs paused for a moment barrel probably getting too hot said freeman adding remember son laudace laudace toujours laudace it means began sal i know what it means goddamn it replied dixon hotly yeah i might get close enough with a swim buddy but i havent seen aussie have you none of them had yeah said sal keeping his head low youre right pete itd be pretty dicey thatd be just what theyd be looking for two hundred yards away aussie cinched the strap on his flippers and descending below the undulating and sunlit surface beneath the falls went deeper but not so deep that he couldnt see his he and flashbang grenades and his mp he swung the submachine gun around to his front and loosened the sling so if they spotted him as he surfaced he could squeeze off a burst get the bastards heads down long enough for him to toss a couple of the grenades at the work party by now hed seen that they had two of the bolts off the props basket one of the terrorists working so hard and fast hed slipped on one of the anechoic tiles and into the sea he was quickly jerked back up to the deck monkey wrench still in hand resuming work in seconds the next deep thumping sounds of the subs machine gun and the crackle of lighter ak fire echoed off the stack the base of which absorbed several hits fistsized chunks flew off some smacking loudly into the water other fragments tearing into the ribs stern which despite choirs best efforts had been caught in the constant wash behind the stack and sucked out from it long enough to make it at times a clearly visible target rock fragments from the stack had already taken out three or four feet of the inflatable flotation cells and the resulting holes immediately flooded with seawater then freeman was knocked back into the stern and sal crashed into choir the general temporarily underwater was spluttering obscenities as he surfaced goddammit thats enough dixon there was no answer dixon hes gone said sal nodding in the direction of ten oclock at a point about twenty feet out hes under general he slipped under during our scramble freeman was dragging himself aboard can you still see him sal no was he hit sal and choir considered the question they realized they didnt know maybe he hadnt dived in at all son of a goddammit it was the general holding pieces of what used to be a functioning cell phone goddamn it thats unreasonable sal was checking dixons gear bag to see if there was any blood on it there wasnt but he saw that the bag contained what was immediately recognizable as a threefootlong spear gun collapsible so put in choir thats how the laddie took care of his underwater nemesis never said a word did he no said sal he didnt where the hells aussie chapter thirtysix charles riser was going home sent home by ambassador rogers who had been his staunch defender at the embassy more willing than most to cut charlie some slack as he put it after the tragedy of mandy risers murder by li kuans terrorists in suzhou it wasnt so much charless behavior at the embassy in beijing but his unauthorized forays into chinese officialdom such as his pestering general chang which had resulted in a plethora of complaints from the chinese beijing used the complaints to deflect the us ambassadors enquiries about why the pla air force under the guise of redcrossflagged ships supposedly supplying the people of penghu with urgently needed food supplies and rebuilding materials had in fact been unloading more crates of migs sukhoi flanker fighterbombers charlie was fuming but in those rare moments of objectivity he forced upon his grieving soul he knew that the ambassador had made the correct decision for the embassy as a whole while waiting for the china air flight to seattle via narita he took the photograph of amanda from his wallet there was something important about actually holding it merely looking at framed pictures of her had never been enough intellectually absurd he told himself but nevertheless it somehow drew her closer the only photo of her that he kept in his wallet was one of her with their chocolatecolored spaniel mandy had called him truffles because of the dogs ears truffle had habitually refused to surrender a grungy old rag charlies wife had used to wipe the dog down when hed rolled ecstatically in the piles of bitchscented fall leaves from the border collie next door everyone said it was because of the collies scent that truffles had refused to give up the disgusting old rag but charlie knew it was because of the dogs memory of his wife truffles had held on to that rag until the day he died of grand old age everyone fondly remembering the faint deathbed growl as the vet tried to move it during his final examination the family in fact had erupted in laughter and it had smoothed the beloved pets passing but nothing could ease mandys passing in his mind there was never socalled closure but at least hed hoped and prayed for the possibility of justice and now even that seemed lost it was meager solace but charles riser had treated himself paying the substantial difference between the embassys economy allowance and first class it didnt make being sent home to the doghouse any easier but at least it allowed him to be miserable in comfort he did not mind airline food though as a cultural attaché in the foreign enclave of beijing it was mandatory for him to voice detestation of airline and especially american fast food particularly at a frenchhosted soiree in fact it was mandatory for cultural attachés never to offend any other culture but going home had its compensations to hell with the french he thought now and their pompous posing as the moral arbiter of european interests theyd sell their mother for a sou as quickly as pétain caved in to the nazis to hell with the whole antiamerican lobby and their root causes aid and comfort to the terrorists only the british and the aussies had immediately allied themselves with america in iraq even canada once americas dependable ally had degenerated under what he considered an unbelievably incompetent and fencesitting antiamerican government into one of the undependables all the time secure under the protective american umbrella what was it barzun had said so well democratic civilization is the first in history to blame itself because another power is trying to destroy it well to hell with them all that mattered now in his life was seeing li kuan and his terrorist legions who had murdered amanda who were attacking america right now punished on china airs screens however cnns war in america held little hope the updates from homeland defense director hawthorne admitting they still hadnt found the terrorist submarine the department had received so many false reports and predictions of the subs whereabouts from rumorrife refugees that hawthorne said sensibly thought riser the only updates about the midget sub from now on would be of its confirmed demise clever too charlie acknowledged as he washed down another of the ceruleanblue zopiclone pills that would take him out of the savage world at least for the duration of the flight back to the happy world of his sweet mandy his recurring image was of her shrieking with delight as he took her on a horse ride along the wide white strand of cannon beach the breeze in their faces the whiteslashed blue of the oregon surf pounding down exhausting itself in floods of lacy foam that swirled about his feet the gulls screeching were so real he believed he could smell the sea as mandy laughed urging him on cmon daddy giddyup fast twot faster by the time the flight attendant had begun to distribute the firstclass sections meal charles was asleep smiling to the unspoken amusement of the attendant who switched off his tv console the faces of wanted terrorists gone in an instant if only it was that easy said the passenger in the seat adjacent risers pardon said the attendant the passenger pointed at the blank screen if only we could get rid of those bastards so easily it was a strict government policy adopted by all the airline and other industries these days that employees not become involved in any dialogue that might offend specific religious political andor minority groups the flight attendant looked at the passenger im afraid i cant comment sir have you ever heard of cofer black no whos he used to be one of george bushs inner circle at the white house and he said when were finished with those terrorists theyre gonna have flies walking across their eyeballs i like it said the passenger passing his menu back to her i should tell you she said its not on the menu but if you prefer we have a vegetarian casserole fuck the vegetarian ill have the steak wheres it from nebraska us first grade there you go as charles riser was heading back to the united states commander john rorke was leaving it on a military transport not a commercial airline his thoughts for the moment not on the coming mission but on alicia mayne whom he decided to write dear alicia i hope youre feeling a lot better than when i visited you in the hospital i feel a terrible sense of responsibility for what happened to you wracking my brains for what i could have done differently my mom and dad were fond of saying everything works out for the best cant say i feel that way sure as heck dont feel that way after the last little while seems like the roof has fallen in on us my uncle leroi in panama city the city in florida called the other night on my way to la and said he was a boy when the japanese attacked pearl harbor and after that he grew up thinking nothing worse could happen to america i guess ill never get over the shock of whats happened since so many good men and women lost and then whats happened to you one thing its taught me alicia and i guess a lot of others is that life really is short and we shouldnt put things off till tomorrow and should tell people who mean a lot to us just how much they mean to us before its too late which brings me to thinking about you truth is ive been thinking about you all the time i love you there ive said it i used to laugh at those guys who said they knew it right away the moment they saw her etc well i knew it the day you set foot on the boat id heard about this knockout woman scientist we were going to have to take aboard and at first i thought right thats all i need a boatful of horny guys and a goodlooking woman ill have to walk around with a bucket of water and then like the old beatle song says when i saw her standing there sounds corny i know but i hope you can make allowances im trained to run a boat not write love letters but i guess thats what this is a love letter ive never written one before i guess that shows but i wanted to get this down before i get to my new posting youll understand i cant tell you where it is except its out of the states big clue ive got to hurry this up were about to land and knowing the navy ill be expected to get right to my job its true alicia ive never written anyone like this in my life okay ive had a few girlfriends some pretty serious i guess but youre the one i love you and if youll have me i want to tie the knot how original is that but im rushed at the moment and i have to submit this to the unit censor it being wartime and all so i really cant tell you about where or when well see each other again honey but hold tight god willing ill be back all my love john ps maybe my mom and dad were right at least for me love john he read over it quickly damn too many i guesses he thought it made him sound like an aw shucks grade school kid but at least hed told her before leaving the states he had wrestled with the idea of telling alicia that her burns would heal that hed be there for her that it truly didnt matter to him and it didnt but hed decided against it it would have sounded as if he was loving her out of pity out of a sense of responsibility for her terrible ordeal as the military transport hercules landed under fighter escort in okinawa john rorke looked out of the window to see if he could locate the sub base but the perspex was streaked with rain the lush fields of the japanese island a dark greenish smudge the roar of the herks engines was so loud he wondered how the bus drivers could stand it much better whatever the danger to be on the standoff weapons platform the uss encino hed been ordered to the los angeles subs mission was to position itself in the bashi strait between the philippines and taiwan well off the mccains carrier groups eastern flank which was coming out of the south china sea it was only after hed submitted the letter to the base censor confident that the censor would not see any indication of where one of the uss supreme weapons platforms had been posted that rorke realized alicia probably wouldnt be able to read it without someone holding it for her since her hands like her entire upper torso were swathed in bandages well he thought so what if someone had to read it to her better to have said it than not if she didnt feel the same about him better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all he could see people saying he wanted to marry her out of pity and how could a man want a woman who was so well disfigured but all he knew was what he felt he loved her now all he had to do was survive chapter thirtyseven if the subs dieselelectric capability of attaining absolute silence made for evasion of sonar signals amid the cacophony of competing ocean noise the four terrorists banging and otherwise working at the subs stern did exactly the opposite which was why the subs captain continued to exhort his men to hurry aussie could see that at this rate by the time the patrol craft out of keystone or an antisub plane from whidbey island reached the sub it would have jettisoned the basket but neither the sub captain nor freeman who was totally occupied by the dangerous business of staying alive long enough to delay the sub had factored frank halls petrel into the equation the moment his highly sensitive sensors normally used to detect the whereabouts of dummy torpedoes fired on the test range picked up the loud banging vectoring in the subs exact location hall had decided to investigate to see if it was friend or foe if the latter he would lend a hand as he put it to his first mate and crew besides as an exseal hall had a personal aversion to people who fired torpedoes at civilian vessels lend a hand asked the bosun hesitantly what exactly does that mean captain dont know exactly but im working on it answered frank having already instructed the petrels helmswoman to swing about putting the vessel on a course for the banging noise that was still blipping as an amber dot on his sonar screen its close inshore said the first mate between pillar and slip points this is voluntary pursued the bosun adding quickly ill go but some of the crew the crews american arent they said frank yes but i want to be fair answered frank if any of the crew want out ill understand theyre free to go overboard into the rib said the bosun five second fuses for the ballooncarried charges asked the first mate no hall corrected him if this bogeys the terrorist sub which im sure it is given the location of that fish that was fired at us were going to need our rib and our whirly bird in he glanced up at petrels chronometer in about ten minutes at full speed so batten all hatches and get the helo ready to fly sir interjected the mate doppler scope shows fog moving in quickly along the coast hall acknowledged the meteorological information this time of year fog was always moving in then out then in he turned back to the bosun ill fill in the pilot on the gps et cetera while im doing that i want you six crew and the chief by whom he meant petrels chief engineer a man of fertile imagination and outstanding mechanical aptitude to mold a dozen or so fivepound blocks of loshok fivesecond fuses and jerryrig four slingshots for them big slingshots got it before the bosun could respond hall turned to the first officer mate i want you to organize a few charges for our helo about seven pounds apiece then tell the pilot i want a word with him the bosuns earlier sense of excitement gained from his skippers infectious enthusiasm was suddenly arrested he wasnt concerned so much by the prospect of handling the packs of ammoniadynamite cartridges but by having to insert the fiddly thumbnailsized blasting caps used at the end of the fuse or primacord that would have to be attached to each loshoks primary charge hed never seen anyone killed by an accident with cartridges of loshok but he knew a few exmarine geology seismic technicians who were missing fingers from having to handle the tiny blasting caps under this kind of time pressure cut fivesecond fuses for the fivepound slingshot packs frank told the bosun how long for the helo packs asked the first mate i dont know said frank well have to cut them to order depending on the wind no wind now said the mate doppler shows fog shot back frank yeah i know you told me before well just have to do the best we can the bosun and mate exchanged worried glances it was the first time hall had implicitly confirmed that he was playing all this by ear that he wasnt at all sure that whatever he had in mind would work well thought the bosun hell have to explain his general idea in a couple of minutes at the most short if not so sweet because in another six minutes theyd be closing on the sonars blip hall grabbed the pa mike attention all hands this is the captain speaking a slingshot the chief engineer asked the bosun yeah said the bosun making a skeptical i know face to the clutch of oilers whod also been summoned to his surprise however the chief turned casually to his engine room watch raising his voice to compete with the thunder of petrels horses while the normally offwatch engine room crew attended to the engines glistening oilslicked pistons they were pounding hard to spin the prop to maximum revolution the oceanographic vessel shaking so violently at fifteen knots that every rivet seemed on the verge of popping the chief was holding up two twelvefootlong pieces of aluminum rod take these to the pipe bender guys i want you to turn out four y shapes no soldering to get a single stem havent got time means youll have a long skinny uhandle for each slingshot well use some of our quarterinch rubber tubing for the slings okay yeah chief but whatd we use for that part you know thatll actually hold the loshok as we pull it back for chrissake retorted the chief i have to tell you everything i dunno use your initiative cut sections of leather from your belt he pointed to tiny petrels big overweight diesel mechanic use tinys belt enough for twenty slingshots right tiny yeah very funny go commanded the chief i want you back in five fastest gets extra shore leave gimme that friggin rod said one of his crew a few seconds later he was spinning one of the vices handles the jaws opening like a gopher hurry up his helper jimmy said adding youre like an old woman up yours retorted the other crewman malcolm already having made the first bend in the pipe this suckerll throw a baseball a hundred yards you wont be throwing a ball jimmy said you take time winding up with that loshok like you do at baseball youll blow your balls off malcolm didnt answer for a few seconds he was already making the second bend in the aluminum rod sweat pimpling his forehead tongue squeezed hard between his teeth in concentration as he made the third bend he then swung the fourfoot unbent section wide its end clipping jimmy on the stomach i wont be firing the slingshot jimmy youll be no way josé frank halls voice couldnt be heard on the pa system in the engine room and so he sent down a crewman to tell them petrel was bucking the incoming tide reducing the ships speed by two to three knots even so the eta was about seven minutes can you finish in time inquired franks anxious messenger neither malcolm nor jimmy bothered answering him not a second could be wasted in superfluous conversation tiny yelled jimmy we need your but the big oiler had already taken off his leather belt and cut four sixinchlong strips from it atta boy next jimmy turned to malcolm tubing mal malcolm handed him the flexi quarterinch rubber hosing jimmy his face now streaming with perspiration couldve kissed tiny when he saw that the big mechanic had already punched holes at either end of the four sixinch sections of belt leather because all he had to do was slip the rubber tubing through both holes and tie a knot he gave the completed slingshot to franks messenger try it out topside lose it and ill i wont said the messenger scuttling up the grated stairway use somethin that weighs about five pounds jimmy hollered after him meanwhile malcolm was halfway through the series of bends required for the second slingshot his job made easier because a crewman had already cut the second twelvefoot rod into the required lengths ten feet below the surface of the crescent bay and six feet ahead of him in what would normally have been the crystal clear water of the bay peter dixon saw a huge inky stain in the dull fogfiltered light unlike an oil spill it swayed back and forth in an underwater ballet it was kelp he realized extending left and right of him as far as he could see he couldnt help but recall the bloody ooze that had once been albinski his swim buddy and momentarily he panicked turning to go back to the stack to rejoin freeman sal and choir then he saw that an arm of the kelp had moved around in back of him he might have to surface right here at what he guessed was about fifty yards from the sub and take his chances knowing the mps maximum effective range was fifty yards surface or run by feel alone dixon switched the safety off selecting the automatic position and pulled the cord on his co cartridge to inflate his flotation vest to relieve him of the necessity to tread water in the chop as he fired the moment he surfaced the gunners feeder on the sub spotted him the dark green kelp black in the fog having drawn his attention what saved dixon from the first burst was the height of the gunner he was short and the few seconds it took for the gunner to up his hand grips to sustain closerange fire dixon got off two threeround bursts the mm thudded into the work party two of the men splashing into the water dixon waited in a trough in the bays chop before firing again and hit a third terrorist freeman manning the ribs bowmounted m as it now shot out from the sea stacks protection to assist opened up with oneinfive tracer the white streaks flying high over the sail before he heard his rounds striking sparking on the sails port side the m failed to penetrate the hightensile steel but the tracer was worrying the subs gunner and his feeder who pushed the ammunition belt so high above his head while ducking to avoid being hit that freeman thought his gun would jam it didnt the next burst from the cracking in the air missing dixon but raking the peaked bow of the rib another fifty yards to the west it splintered the inflatables fiberglass keel the disintegration at a choppounding thirty knots sounding like the multiple splitting of thawing spring lakes rather than chunks of ice disintegrating however the fiberglass came apart in lumps that bore an uncanny resemblance to cotton candy the rib was sinking but freeman doggedly squeezed off a threesecond burst even as the inflatable sank nose down into the choppy sea the burst was so long that the ms barrel turned dull red as it was wont to do after a quick hundred rounds sal was convinced that if hed been able the general would have snatched and fired his mp or thrown a couple of his grenades at the sub except for the fact that he was sinking cmon general sal shouted head for the falls three oclock as the overheated barrel sizzled releasing vapor into a fog that was quickly growing thicker obscuring the sub choir and sal saw the general with his hands still on the m seawater spurting up through the multiholed deck as freeman was obscured from sight the fog was pierced by tracer which given the ribs acute angle had no possible chance of hitting the sub aussie lewis hearing the noise of the firefight along with the surge of the ribs prop as it raced through the water dived and kicked furiously to clear the turbulence of the falls submerged and without an attack board he was keeping the distance count in his head usually a simple enough task but under fire demanding when he judged he was within range his vision blocked by the inky droop of what had become a baywide blanket of kelp he came up wiping kelp off his mask glancing quickly to see whether sal choir freeman or dixon was in his line of fire he saw nothing but fog and the dark stain of kelp off to his left beyond which he then spotted his four specfor buddies they were swimming toward the now deserted beach where discarded boxes and drums were afire suffusing the fog with an orange glow the fierce crackling noise of knotted pine packing cases going up in flames made it sound as if a distant firefight was in progress when in fact no one could be seen in the cave or along the sand and rocky shoreline like the others still swimming toward the shore aussie had lost sight of the sub in the dense fog that kept rolling in all he was aware of now was the soft whir of a helicopter that was already above him before he recognized its telltale muffled engine sound it was a twoseater little bird petrel ii stenciled along its tail boom the chopper swooped over freeman choir and sal as well as dixon who was in the process of joining his comrades still about forty yards from the bays shore aussie guessed correctly that the little birds infrared homer had been drawn into the bay by the heat of the fires on the beach he dove again and kicked hard for the beach making better time submerged than his surfaceborne comrades he was slowed however by more kelp and when he surfaced again his ears were ringing from the noise of the two approaching ships that the others had also heard and also were as yet unable to see as aussie drew closer to the other four members of the team he surfaced his kelpdraped head startled the nerverattled dixon who was about to fire when he recognized the floppy seal hat above the mask of the creature from the black lagoon as salvini would later call lewis now however salvini the general and choir were not watching aussie but the cliff face like a motorist seeing an onrushing car too late everything had slowed to breathstopping slow motion as the little bird pilot his helmet visible despite the fog realized the fire his infrared had detected was just that a fire on a beach and not a burst of radiant heat from a fleeing sub he took the little bird up sharply avoiding the caves mouth and most of the soaring green cliff face but not its overhanging lip of vegetationcovered rock the helos blades sliced into the hidden underside of the overhang then dropped tail rotor first plummeting down to the beach freemans team involuntarily braced for the explosion they all expected and it came a few seconds after impact the flames belching upward illuminating the cave mouth for the first time they saw an aluminum ladder about twelve feet long leading up from the beach to the cave clearly visible as the heat of little birds conflagration which included the three packs of loshok melted the ladders struts the struts drooping like strips of spaghetti as the ladder collapsed into a whitish stringy pile of molten metal while freemans swim team approached the beach they could see the fiercely burning hulk of the helicopter and two dead terrorists floating just out from the beach their oilslicked bodies reflecting the fiercely burning remains of the chopper as the pilots khakigreen uniform turned black his stomach bursting the general looked away it wasnt squeamishness hed seen much worse rather it was a habit adopted years before the war on terrorism when a suave young grand prix champion had been invited to address a nato officers mess in heidelberg whenever there is the catastrophe on the circuit he had told his american hosts most of them officers from armored units you must never watch you understand you must watch your bottom because in that moment when you are watching the catastrophe in front of you the driver on your rear will take advantage of your lack in concentration and voilàwill attack from behind and win the race yes there had been a lot of belgian beer drunk that night and a lot of drunks bored with the routine of guarding the fulda gap through which soviet armor was expected to pour if the communist warsaw pact attacked no one had even heard of jihad bin laden or li kuan in those peaceful cold war days but douglas freeman then due for his bird his promotion to colonel had remembered every word that the bottom belgian as he was called had said and now freeman though sorry for the pilot watched his rear turning seaward and caught a glimpse of the sub as the thick fog in the bay momentarily thinned burned off by the heat from the helo and beach fires though freeman now swimming to catch up to the others couldnt hear the sound of the prop yet the sub seemed to be moving perhaps using its battery power not wanting to be heard leaving the bay subs escaping he yelled yet he felt a surge of hope the fact that the sub was still on the surface could only mean she hadnt yet reached water deep enough to submerge and the fog was too thick to permit the terrorists to see the landmarks theyd used as channel markers by the time freeman had called to his comrades above the noises of the beach inferno and crashing waves the sub had vanished no one except dixon doubted him the rawnerved diver remembering as freeman did something he had been told at the beginning of his career and seen verified by his own experience that under high stress combatants become powerfully predisposed to see what they expect perhaps freeman had projected the image of the sub in his minds eye out into the fog after all dixon had seen two terrorist underwater swimmers in the kelp that turned out to be peripheral trails of submerged kelp you sure sir he called yes general it was sal hauling himself ashore on the beach one oclock it was a small fifteenfoot aluminum boat on pushcart wheels a golfcartlike handle stuck up from under the bow a goodsize creamcolored outboard was on the stern and the paint was blistering from a combination of radiant heat from the fires to the left and from the little birds crash the helos explosion had created a firebreak in the scattered line of burning debris a break without which the aluminum boat its wooden trailer already smoldering would itself have been engulfed in flame time we got a friggin break shouted aussie unconscious of his pun until after hed said it in any event no one laughed the pilots torso now a cinder block toppling forward into the taffylike blob that had been the little birds plexiglass bubble salvini being closest to the beach about ten yards off and having deflated his mae west struck out in an australian crawl toward the trailer and boat his powerful strokes testimony to the superb training that freeman insisted upon and was so proud of dixon the general commanded between intakes of air check out the beach we still dont know where these bastards are choir you me and aussie into that tin boat chapter thirtyeight salvini emerged from the sea in a tangle of kelp that had formed a wide dark margin around the bay exhausted running on adrenaline alone he lumbered across a thin sliver of sand up over a waisthigh rock ledge and across more sand to the aluminum boat cupping his hands he then began dousing its trailers flames with sand he worked hard and fast and had the fire snuffed out in less than five minutes by which time choir the general the kelpcovered aussie and peter dixon had all reached the beach fifty yards east of sals superb oneman fire brigade sal could feel his knees hot about to buckle as a distance runner in his offduty hours he knew this was a dangerous sign realizing hed have to stop for a few minutes and rehydrate or hed be of no use to anyone for the next twentyfour hours taking a little nap are we aussie asked him brooklyns bust aussie told the general and choir while leaning on the boats gunwale to take a rest himself and eat some of the emergency rations theyd managed to salvage from the sinking rib all right said freeman shifting the weight of his mp lets see if this outboards still alive after just one pull of the mercurys starter cord the engine purred like a sweet old tabby the most welcome sound the specfor warriors had heard since picking up the faroff sounds of the approaching petrel from which little bird must have been launched the aluminum boat had become a junk drop for fishing tackle used pop cans paint cans and brushes the latters bristles now stiffened the failure to have soaked them evidence of the haste with which the subs quick patchup jobs had been done the minor repairs no doubt speeded up by the appearance of freemans team mother of god it was choir unusually profane and all work stopped the bundle of paint rags hed just tossed out of the boat revealed a long roughedged gash in the bottom about four inches wide and a foot long as if an axe had been used to frantically sabotage the bottom of the boat tape shouted freeman intolerant of the slightest delay cmon move aussies roll of the superstrong militaryissue duct tape had been badly slashed by his fight with the underwater terrorists but sal choir dixon and freemans waterproofed rolls were intact cut rubber slices to fit off the trailers tires freeman continued stuff em into the gash and tape the whole lot inside and outside the keel wont last moren an hour opined dixon whose hands were shaking from the cold despite the insulation provided by his wet suit he was retrieving the rags tossing them on the beach fire to warm up the team half an hours all we need said freeman choirs kbar made short work of the boat trailers tires the rubber still so hot from the beach fires heat that it couldnt be handled with bare hands get some water aussie he said lewis heading down toward the line of kelp that fringed the fogbound beach choir cut the engine and now they could hear the low pulsating sound of a vessel three to four miles off in the fog it was either the oceanographic vessel petrel freeman told them or the bigger and faster hurricaneclass patrol ship the skate that admiral jensen had told him was being dispatched from its keystone station despite having to travel almost twice the distance to the darkstar anomaly the footlong skates speed of forty miles per hour against petrels fifteen would mean they should both arrive around the same time i heard two ships before said aussie returning with water to cool the rubber tires so did i added choir who with salvinis help had now sealed the gash inside the boat dixon and freeman still working as fast as they could on the keel the combination of odors from fires in the cave and the pungent now empty diesel drums their hand pumps still attached mixed with the sweeter smell of burning pine and the lingering odor of cordite and expended tracer casings to create a cloying mix that made choir feel as if someone had stuffed his nostrils with cotton batting forcing him to breathe through his mouth and the warmer atmosphere on the beach that had pushed the fog offshore for a while was gradually disappearing adding to the general discomfort of the team lets hurry this up lad choir told dixon sooner i get some fresh air hey shouted dixon get off my back aussie and salvinis silence seemed to thunder up and down the beach peter dixon did have an attitude anyone seen any weapons ammo lying about cut in freeman saw an m put in aussie where i came ashore but its useless they spiked it so said freeman we make do with what we have dixon scrambled out from under the trailer finished outstanding the general told him slapping him on the shoulder you stay here and hold the beach in case we need a hand when we return right dixon nodded grabbing his camelback and taking a long drink through its flexi tube lets go sac said the general his acronym standing for salvini aussie and choir it had once been bacs but this was the first time brentwood was missing from the roster forced to stay behind at fort lewis where freeman knew that the only outlet for his frustration at not being with his old team and for the guilt he felt over his failure to get li kuan in afghanistan was to spend hour after hour firing small arms on the practice range but even then freeman guessed the exspecfor warrior must be frustrated by the fact that his left hand couldnt master anything bigger than a handgun at fort lewis his proficiency with the colt and hk mm pistol was so good it had earned him the moniker wyatt earp but brentwood like freeman like everyone else in a modern army knew that the day of the handgun was over in war it was merely a backup piece rarely if ever used in this world war against terrorism sidearms were used only by pilots shot down behind enemy lines if such a line could be found in a war marked by evershifting and remarkably fluid fronts as their aluminum boat glided over the kelp at the waters edge freeman standing up in the bow bracing himself against the chop fixed his binoculars on the fogbound sea beyond the roar of the falls helping choir navigate past the sandbars theyd seen when first entering the bay think he saw the sub sal asked aussie both of them kneeling behind the boats midline got eyesight like a friggin eagle the old man has said aussie and ears if he says he saw it he saw it mate hush said choir also straining to hear hush sal whispered to aussie hush its gone proclaimed freeman maybe a chopper from that tub jensens sending proffered aussie freeman shook his head and without turning around said no hurricane class doesnt have a chopper could be a navy chopper out of whidbey but theyre all but useless in this pea soup no one answered the fog was rolling in on them in huge banks of bonechilling air the warmer convection currents generated by the beachs fires replaced by colder sea air for choir it felt as if someone had opened the doors to a gargantuan freezer the resulting wind chill factor evicting any residual warmth the specfor warriors had absorbed from the numerous small fires while on the beach cant hear those ships anymore said choir in fact they hadnt heard the subs quiet electricsmooth exit from the bay but had all heard the unmistakable underwater throb of two approaching vessels cut the merc ordered freeman ill go over have a listen he went in and sank beneath the surface then sal choir and aussie waited anxiously to see whether the general taking advantage of the speed of underwater sound propagation could pick up the sound of the two vessels after a while the three veterans in the boat grew worried the fogbound sea was calmer than before and there were no whirlpools to be seen in the twentyfoot radius of visibility around the boat maybe it was just their fatigue but it seemed that the general should have popped back up by now you either heard something or you didnt what now said aussie disgustedly sal trying to see through the fog shrugged that bastard murphy again their string of mishaps and near misses had been no different than in any other war theyd been in victory wasnt a matter of rambos going crazy but of a team working through the screwups having the will equipment and training or wet as the general called it to see it through then freemans head popped up right beside choir jesus began the usually sanguine welshman hide and seek said the general spitting out a fringe of kelp sound vectors coming at you from every direction down there decoys suggested aussie as he helped the general aboard thats my read replied freeman damn subs dropped sonar sub decoys along the way decoys are sending out sub engine noises all over our boys on petrel and the skate have obviously stopped and cut engines and are listening trying to figure out which sub sound is the real one how long do those decoy batteries last asked salvini two three weeks said choir oh shit meanwhile those chinese are sitting all quiet and cozy on the bottom said aussie the others ignored aussies certainty that the terrorists were chinese theyre not so cozy said freeman their airll run out sooner or later but before the co scrubbers are exhausted said choir they could last what three to four days something like that agreed the general oh shit wish youd stop saying that boyo said choir oh hush said aussie yeah joined in sal hush you little welsh knock it off the general ordered which he rarely did but even among the most resistant specfor teams nerves could get frayed fatigue and cold misconstruing friendly abuse lets head back to shore freeman added id hoped we could tag that bastard midget but were only spinning our wheels out here as they returned through the everthickening fog no one could see dixon not even when they were practically at the beach hes drying out said aussie by one of the fires i cant see him said sal shouldnt have left him alone said the general hes a big boy sal assured him choir said nothing but remembering how dixon had been shaking so badly feared what no specfor ever wanted to contemplate that dixons handtohand combat had undone him that spooked by the beach hed decided to bolt instead of doing what freeman had ordered stay on the beach to lend a hand to his comrades upon their return choir whod seen it happen a few times before on special operations was pretty sure dixon was hiding somewhere in the cave shivering uncontrollably from the twin demons of a combat swimmers lot cold and unspeakable terror the one thing you always remembered was the blood in the water engulfing you in your sin as much as it did your dead foe haunting some men for the rest of their lives circumventing the floating kelp bed choir almost ran aground on a sandbar along the shoreline an army of winedark kelp crabs moved en masse ready to swarm any detritus trapped by the kelp it was one of the ugliest things choir had ever seen choir was right dixon was in the cave there were no distinctive footprints to guide the specfor team the sandy apron below the cave had obviously been main street as the team habitually referred to the main trail or thoroughfare used by the enemy in this case by the terrorists to hurriedly replenish the sub dixons eyes widened when he saw choir who had followed the speckled trail of blood from the beach and his intake of air made an annoying laborious sound as if he were inhaling through straw what neither choir nor his three comrades had seen in the caves dripping gloom was the duct tape across dixons mouth which they now saw while approaching thisll hurt boyo choir told him as the welshman resting his hk against the nearby boulder knelt down to unbind dixon freeman aussie and salvini as if by instinct rather than training formed a protective c around them mother of god it was choir in shock realizing that dixons strained breath had been his last that the damp sand the welshman was kneeling in was wet with blood boys choir said softly in a tone of a sadness that physically seemed heavier than his pack whats up asked aussie eyes still to the front there was no answer from choir and aussie glanced back froze then looked away at anything rather than the young swimmer whose mouth had been stuffed with what remained of his bloodsodden genitals he had choked to death aussie who would later chastise himself for his morbid curiosity or had it been the simple human need to confirm what he thought hed seen looked down in the gloom at the dead mans groin area jesus dixons corpse voided the stench vile even freeman whod seen his share of death felt as if he would throw up but as usual he maintained command and control of himself and before he gave any order to the others turned and steeling himself went over to the dead american and took off the warriors dog tags sal you and aussie wrap him up place him on one of the beach fires no one should see their loved one like this sal being catholic had an aversion to cremation and funeral pyres in particular but right here right now he agreed with the other three those bastards said aussie thats pure evil no one disagreed and as freeman led them in a short prayer they piled the fire with any other wood they could find from what had obviously been torpedo crates for several minutes afterward no one spoke each counseled by his own thoughts as they desultorily checked the splintered wood on the pyre but each of the four were ready to exact revenge the general was standing at the waters edge listening he heard no sound of ships moving or the earlier chopper he looked up into the gray sky and saw and heard nothing but the continuing roar of the bisected falls in front of them sal you and choir stay by the boat he finally said breaking the silence whoever was here has probably gone by now but keep a sharp eye aussie you and ill recon the beach halfway along the rock and crushedshell shore freeman stopped several times to stare up into the fog and around the bay hear something general asked aussie whose tone still conveyed his anger over what had happened to young dixon no answered the general and stopped walking you ever been to san francisco one summer answered aussie his dark mood momentarily arrested by freemans inquiring tone a giveaway to those who had fought with him that he was mentally flicking through the thumbworn codes the precomputer card index files that held his vast repository of what sometimes seemed to others useless and unrelated information i lived down by the bay for a few years freeman continued sometimes the fog would come in like this roll in and lie there for hours in a layer right across the bay it was so layered you could drive right over it on the bridge well general theres no bridge here we can drive oh you mean the fog mightnt be as high as we think freeman had turned around craning his neck to look up at the darkgreensheathed cliff face veiled in an everchanging curtain of fog and fire smoke a lost world a remote enough part of america in normal times but now even more so as a result of the panicky evacuation of entire populations in the northwest to all points south fog cold and lonely see that line kind of an s shape about eleven oclock aussie looked to the left and saw the trail winding up the eastern end of the cliff away from the falls and about two hundred feet east of where the little bird had come down pieces of its tail rotor assembly faintly visible in the ghostly fog that rolled down over the cliff face you want me to have a go said aussie ill go freeman said ah im still stiff as a prick from crouching in that damn tin boat i could do with a stretch think im past it freeman said challengingly i can still press two hundred and hell general youre in better shape than anyone here it was close to the truth like i said i need the stretch very well watch for mines though i would think the last thing the terrorists would do is plant mines around have some wild goat wandering about getting blown up and drawing attention to the place aussie took off his pack tightened the hks sling on his back and put on his gloves freeman glanced at his watch thirty minutes thirty minutes confirmed lewis and set off the last he saw of the general the legend was busy one hand on his hip the other directing a steaming thin stream into the kelp chapter thirtynine charles riser awoke from his zopicloneinduced sleep to the nerveslicing screams of children the boeing jumbo having plunged two hundred feet in the worst turbulence the airlines pilots had experienced in a decade of carrying passengers over the pacific riser felt faintly queasy but in his semisomnolent state he truly didnt care whether the aircraft crashed death would be virtually instantaneous and a shutter would slam down on the window of his grief and hatefilled life he knew he never used to hate like this and he despised himself for it hed had always taken the high road the one supposedly traveled by the cultured educated elite who disdained the vulgarity and eschewed the banalities of the masses for whom an eye for an eye was the guiding principle of justice for whom rehabilitation of criminals was despised as the philosophy of effete academics who worked in tenured castles and lived on the safer side of town it was a shock for charles to discover that he was at one with the masses in the matter of murder the seat belt signs stayed on for the remainder of the flight to seattle some parents complaining that the cnn newscasts of the terrible situation in the us northwest should not be shown we cant censor the news the planes purser told one of the angry mothers we just bring in the signals then send them back maam some of the other passengers want to see it they have loved ones in the northwest besides all you have to do is change channels or turn it off its no good turning it off retorted the woman the children can see it on all the other screens in the plane theres a cartoon channel cartoons snorted the mother have you seen the cartoons theyre not funny theyre full of violence have they got li kuan charles asked the man next to him no they say hes left that kazak kazakhstan said charles whatever some guy on pbs reckons that seeing as how beijing couldnt beat the terrorists in that kazak place that beijings done a deal with that bastard theyre gonna split the oil put in the man across the aisle i want to speak to the captain the woman demanded ah maam hes kind of busy right now were approaching seatac then the purser said something he knew he should not have but it had been a long rough trip from beijing with long hot stopovers at shanghai narita and honolulu maam the cockpits on total alert during approach you know terrorists have been firing handheld sams at us carriers whats a sam blurted out one of the kids are the terrorists gonna kill us mom are the see snapped the woman see what youve done im sorry the purser said and excused himself the woman threatening massive lawsuits against the airline yhear that risers companion asked guy says the cockpits on total alert during approach what the hell they doin the rest of the time on half alert too many damn computers said another passenger thats the problem meanwhile one of those arab bastards can shoot and scoot whats homeland defenses computers gonna do about that we need men on the ground weve got men on the ground said charlie riser surprising himself with his vehemence yeah well what the hell are they doin the other passenger pressed riser didnt answer he knew what they were doing bill at the embassy had kept him up to date about that had even told him that the unconventional general freeman had been called in to see what he could do and the first thing riser intended to do was contact the general even see him if he could tell him about changs imprisonment explain that chang as well as being blamed for the chinese military defeat against the terrorists had probably heard about a deal with li kuan and now beijing wanted to keep him quiet he mused about what kind of oil split beijing might have offered the muslim fundamentalists who were fighting the pla who were no doubt urgently needed for an invasion of taiwan riser sat back and closed his eyes again not in repose these days he was never naturally relaxed only artificially with the zopiclone at night and the antidepressant celexa during the day hed closed his eyes to shut out any distraction milking his memory for anything the distraught wu ling had told him at the airport nothing more came to mind he hoped he might get a postcard from her indicating where the general had been taken all he needed was a single word a phrase so he could tell washington where chang was so a specops team could execute what bill heinz dryly called a snatch and grab over the fencea blatant violation of another countrys sovereign territory it would be a snatch to either rescue the general and find out if he knew where li kuan was or a snatch and grab to kill li kuan on the spot better yet a snatch and grab to capture li kuan unlike the botched afghanistan attempt led by that medal of honor winner david drentwood or was it brentwood charles couldnt remember a snatch and grab to get li kuan and then torture him put his feet to a fire cut off his penis mandy had been raped see if the seventytwo virgins in islamic heaven would want him then and do it slowly make the scumbag scream take hours and hours and then lock him up with starving rats and you okay the other passenger asked youre shaking riser wasnt actually shaking but he was grasping his armrests so tightly his hands were white his hatred having drained the life out of them im fine he lied thank you ah dont sweat it well be down in a few minutes listen i used to be a whiteknuckle flier then i took this course called who am i the man was fishing in his wallet for a card for the new age guru who had a phd in wellness from a california institute and whod studied in india for two years at canadas peace and wellness university yoga guru and exposure therapy worked great you oughta try it uhhuh replied charles as the stream of tired passengers entered seatac customs and immigration riser walked toward the quickexit consular gate and was met by a junior state department official her greeting polite rather than warm she told him that the information he had requested through his email from beijing namely freemans private cell number was not available riser smiled wearily at the tall gangly young woman who wore a gray suit and printed scarf buttoned down state department intern he thought full of nervous enthusiasm and willing to lie for foggy bottom as shed just done about freemans cell number how could state not know his number he wasnt important enough to be on the not listed disk i heard li kuans organization might have penetrated the states he said ah yes ive heard that rumor too the department doesnt want me to contact general freeman he said bluntly correct we dont have his number sir did you try information she laughed awkwardly i dont need to see him personally charles told her and could see the relief in her face her shoulders visibly dropping well of course we wouldnt know exactly where he is at this moment how bout somewhere at this moment like the northwest i wouldnt know ah do you have much luggage no we have you booked in at the four seasons fine the situation at the hotel shocked him it was so foreign so choked with refugees pouring in from the olympic peninsula that for several moments he expected to hear some movie person instructing the mass of extras on how to prepare for the next shot only this was no film rehearsal but the reality of frightened begging and pleading people some waving wads of cash good lord it was like the airport at nanjing better dressed but reeking of body odor and fear charles and the intern managed to get the attention of the harried sweating concierge by holding up their state department badges which charles hated to do among fellow americans but hed been too long in china where push shove and vip status always won the day by way of atonement for pulling rank he offered to share his room with three of the refugees his assigned room having one queensize bed and a pullout thats very nice of you the intern commented it was the first genuine thing shed said charles shrugged nonchalantly another point with the man upstairs its what amanda used to say the intern was nonplused not knowing who the man upstairs was a grateful young family of three accepted charless offer and while they were getting settled he excused himself went to the bathroom overloaded the toilet with toilet paper and depressed the flush button immediately clogging the drain he called the front desk reported that his toilet was backed up and hed need another room right now this was unacceptable he told them no he couldnt wait he was exhausted in the air for twenty hours a desk clerk looking as harassed as the concierge and miffed into the bargain told mr riser they had a single room without a view single bed only by the elevator best we can do sir fine said charles and when he got to the new room immediately dialed cnn atlanta the toiletstuffing ploy for a new room had been an old china hands trick to escape the electronic bug that the authorities in this case from either homeland defense andor ashcrofttrained fbi agents had no doubt planted to listen in on phone calls the friendly young womans voice in atlanta told him that marte price was on assignment would he like to leave a voice mail no he wouldnt tell her i have a good story visàvis the plas general chang that chang may have stumbled upon a deal between beijing and li kuan what was that about a visa sir visa asked riser yes sir you said you had a good story riser could hear the shuffling of paper on the other end then the voice came on again yes something about a visa you mean a travel document sir or a credit card a credit card scam riser rubbed his forehead in frustration no that was visàvisit means with regard to a story about general chang being important because he found out about look would you please call her give her this number he read it out slowly adding its urgent if i dont hear from her in an hour ill call fox point is if she hears later that i called and its been on another network shell be totally freaked i understand sir riser hoped so mr riser yes charles riser cultural attaché yes is this marte price it is returning your call im actually not that far away in port townsend covering or rather trying to can we meet ah can you tell me on the phone email riser laughed uncharacteristically rude are you serious its difficult for me at the moment to drive down to seattle the roads are clogged with people traffic jams no flights either the fog is well very bad then how am i supposed to tell you beam myself up there marte price was a tough veteran of the media but she was taken aback by the mans aggressiveness her assistant at cnn had said hed been pleasant enough actually a rather timidsounding man not this guy mr riser there are no civilian helo charters up here but in a city the size of seattle im sure you could get some local pilot who knows the terrain well enough for the right price she paused how about this cnnll pay half the charter and if the storys as important as you say it is well spring for the whole lot charles was gazing at the plumcolored brick wall opposite his hotel the wall festooned with spiderwebs moths trapped in many of them some still alive he turned away looking instead at his single rooms flickering tv its ribbon report giving details of an american battle group its carrier mccain having been attacked typically the first reports of the carrier having been bombed or attacked by missiles were being corrected by updates it seemed that only one plane had been involved extensive damage cnn reported but no pictures as yet mr riser came marte prices voice are you still there im not worried about the money charles told her ill find a local and come up good they arranged to meet at a port townsend hotel one thing more mr riser why did you insist on seeing mewhy not call the local cnn affiliate or everyone watches you well thank you i look forward to seeing but all she could hear now was a dial tone what a rude bastard she announced to her cameraman slamming down her phone risers truculence had come out of a bottle of jack daniels used to neither spirits in general nor fortyproof whiskey in particular and given mandys murder the terrible state his homeland was in and being recalled like a loser as hed heard an embassy colleague refer to him in the final days had all proven too much hed begun drinking heavily which to his surprise had not relieved his acute anxiety and depression instead it had brought out the worst in him behavior he was thoroughly ashamed of a few hours later at seatac as he strapped himself into the chartered helo then put his head back staring at the surly gray fog outside dont worry said the hefty bearded pilot cheerily ive been instrumentflying in this soup hell in nam excuse me said charles gently massaging his throbbing temple with an ice pack hed gotten from the hotel i dont mean to be rude but would you mind not talking im feeling kind of tie one on did you replied the pilot grinning know how it feels buddy yes said charles whose senses were suddenly assaulted by a blast of rap noise do you can you please turn that off the pilots face was close to shock dont like music charless eyes closed okay youre payin for it have you any water charles asked you betcha the pilot said though the frown of mystification remained on his face charles took two more aspirin it turned out to be a surprisingly smooth ride compared to the violent last leg of the flight from china the pilot yelling only twice first to tell charles that he was following the line of puget soundgods country course cant see a friggin thing todayand later to announce be down in about fifteen charles merely nodded the aspirin hed taken causing the headache to abate but now making him feel nauseated his hands were shaking chapter forty aussies special forces training had instilled in him a love of climbing up things but a fervent dislike of going down them finding the restraint his muscles had to exert during descent often was more taxing than when he was ascending i like going down sal had once quipped if shes good looking aussie had affected such an air of propriety and shock that even david brentwood who ignored sexual ribaldry had joined in the teams laughter at aussies performance but now there was no humor in aussie as he ran back down the precarious sshaped path on the side of the cliff his vibram boots gripping and braking hard in the damp loamy soil his gloved hands did their part as he slid on his backside here and there and grabbed released and grabbed again at the thick vegetation to brake his rapid descent freeman seeing aussies fast controlled descent wondered if he could have done it as speedily in the final segment of the s curve aussie came off the cliff as if from a short steep waterslide his boots sending warm ash from the edge of the fires into the air like gray talc fog and more fog correct said freeman handing aussie his canteen no answered aussie his macho streak trying but failing to contain his excitement you were right general fogs layered tip of a high radio mast spiking through it not all the time but i spotted it twice you get a gps aussie took off his left glove having written the latitude and longitude on his hand sal and choir could tell something was up as freeman and aussie ran toward them we go the general called out with that the two grateful for the relief from the outrage and helplessness theyd been feeling since discovering dixons mutilated body in the cave quickly pushed the aluminum boat on the wobbly trailer to the kelp line choir pulled the mercurys cord rather than use up the starter motors juice as he and his three comradesatarms got aboard heading out to the masts position was it the skate or the petrel the position of the mast that aussie had pinpointed by the gps was miles due north well and truly out in the strait keep your eyes peeled freeman told them were not gonna miss her general sal assured him i know that freeman replied but keep your eyes on the water as well see if that sub jettisoned anything remember we hit her quite a few times nothing substantial other than buckling the prop basket i agree but we sure as hell chipped her paint and tiles stuff thatd float aussie shook his head smiling to himself in sheer admiration of the generals attention to tactical detail which hed fused to his philosophy of audacious strategy the petrel was proceeding so slowly that her props barely created a wake all her offduty crew out on deck frank hall was on the bridge the oceanographic ships two sidescan sonar technicians in the aft dry lab two decks below the side scans pictures did not come in via the clear color tv screens so beloved by hollywood producers to make them more visual and more believable but rather in a dull monochromatic series of dark gray lines on lighter grayishwhite paper each line recorded the depth of the sea bottom which at times was flat and at other times creviced by canyons formed millions of years ago the end result was a twodimensional view of the sea bottom as if someone with a very sharp pencil in this case the recorders stylus had drawn a lookdown sketch of the straits seabed nothing but seabed was turning up on the return pings the echoes of the sound strikes sent down from the electrically buckled plates in petrels fisha squashed and singlefinned tearshaped transponder towed astern its fin barely visible in the huge breaths of sea fog that one second seemed to swallow the petrel only to release her moments later cookie the cooks helper en route to delivering a late lunch sandwich to jimmy and tiny on the stern deck sneaked into the aft dry lab manned by the two sonar technicians to take a peek at the sidescan profile any sub guys six so far one of the technicians replied dryly how bout bringing us some coffee stead of asking us dumb questions cookie sullenly retreated shouldnt piss him off the other technician told his colleague hes a dumb ass i dont care you get on the wrong side of these guys they can make you sick piss in your coffee i know one skipper grumpy old bastard all he did was criticize so one day when cook was making custard this kid grabbed a playboy centerfold took the old mans bowl and went to hey what you see what i see his colleague watched the stylus racing back and forth with the speed of a weaving machines shuttle giving them a profile from thirtytwo fathoms feet stuck in the background of a mud slope and looking like a blurred double exposure was an outline of what could conceivably be a slab of metal either that or a slab of rock one of the techies called the bridge captain you better come down and see this frank hall walked in less than a minute later took one look at the profile and told the technicians zoom in high resolution the zoom made it bigger but not as sharp as theyd hoped theres no base to it sir i mean it looks like its a slab sticking up from the mud maybe an old bulkhead a wreck hall thought that the technician was right the strait of juan de fuca was littered with the metallic skeletons of marine disasters from long ago and it would be much worse if navy salvage and retrieval ships such as the petrel didnt clear the massive hulks of the ships sunken by the terrorist sub its base could be a sub proffered frank looking at the slab profile some anechoic tiles could have fallen off the subs sail water flow is powerful at that depth at any depth in the strait if the tiles on the rest of the hull are still intact sucking up our sonar signals we wouldnt see the base of this slab the recorders stylus never ceased but the machines amber light was flashing the roll of paper almost used up not now said one of the technicians his exasperation echoed by his colleague who ran toward the labs paper locker situated high up to avoid any possibility of water damage in the event of the ships scuppers overflowing on deck and flooding over the dry labs sill and into the lower cabinets frank said nothing calmly watching the stylus keeping up its busy work dashing from one side of the recorder to the other like some frenzied animate being sometimes it had made him smile like the busy little office assistant in the corner of his computer but the oceanographer wasnt amused now his eyes focused on the profile his heart punching the wall of his chest what are the dimensions of that slab he asked the attending technician who quickly worked the recorders control panel its about the size of a garage door not very big captain for a sub i mean no frank agreed hands behind his back in what the crew he knew referred to as his horatio nelson bit slab isnt big for a fullsized sub the truth was neither of them knew how big the sail of a midget sub would be theyd never seen one up close few people had wheres that friggin paper the technician called out were almost out here easy said frank lets not get excited thats what nelson would have said he knew but like the two technicians he knew too that when they changed the paper which had only about four inches of lateral scroll remaining they would have no picture at all for ten to fifteen seconds frank calmly summoned the bosun telling him to cut a length of fuse for a hundredpound pack of loshok set to detonate at thirtytwo fathoms sheesh skipper thats about all we have on the ship it had been a measure of the mens discipline and perhaps their distance from little birds demise that it had not preyed on their minds instead theyd done what they were supposed to do without either protest or secondguessing the captain even so now was not the time for the bosun to point out what he must know the captain already knew that a hundredpound charge would just about exhaust their supply of the explosive and so instead of commenting either verbally or by facial expression frank maintained his steady gaze on the stylus it helped that the stylus had a mesmerizing effect like watching highway lane reflectors at night bout two minutes of paper to go captain said the technician next to him when the amber goes to red frank instructed quietly his voice barely audible above the sherp sherp of the stylus amber to red said the technician right his lips so dry that not even the moisture of the ghostly invasions of fog could prevent them from cracking the faint metallic taste of blood in his mouth captain it was the mate on petrels bridge looking quickly from the radar out into the late evening fog and calling down to the aft dry lab we have a surface blip small no biggern a dory coming in on the starboard aft quarter five oclock at that moment frank saw the sidescan recorders light go from amber to red the machine emitting a piercing squeal it was a sound some of the loshok slingshot party outside the dry lab hadnt heard before and they momentarily thought it might be a fire alarm fire flares starboard aft ordered hall his voice so loud that it seemed to those on deck as if the whole world could hear including the crew of a submerged sub have slingshot packs ready to damn he remembered hed told the bosun to pack a hundredpound charge for what might be the sub the insistent squeal of the recorder had panicked him something hed always believed his seal training would override admonishing himself to get a grip and on the verge of telling the sidescan operator to hurry the fuck up and finish changing the damn paper he paused then with a face suffused with selfassurance he strode briskly to the lab door hands behind his back bosun hall said have you made up that hundredpound pack just about finished sir the bosun replied busy recounting the fuse length for the loshok pack that would serve as an ad hoc depth charge to be dropped atop the sub if it was the sub i made it about seventy pounds captain the bosun added that leaves us with about half a dozen slingshot charges of better call than mine bosun cut in frank well done halls admission to the bosun impressed jimmy malcolm tiny and the other slingshot party on deck captain the sidescans squealing had stopped the stylus busy again converting petrels ping echoes into more dull gray lines the flat section that might either be a slab of sheared coastal rock or the midget subs sail still standing alone as if anchored in mud there were no sound echoes that would signify anything else but ooze the thump of the flare gun made tiny jump did you fart jimmy asked malcolm but malcolm was too wound up to see anything remotely humorous in jimmys comment no doubt jimmy wanted to appear cool but he didnt mind voicing his fear of the boat the radars dot coming in from the starboard aft position at about five oclock if the terrorist sub had been damaged by the specfor team flooded maybe and some terrorists were making a run for it in the subs inflatable well everyone knew how fanatical terrorists were fight to the end and what terrorists would want to be captured by the americans after what the cia boys did to their al qaeda prisoners at the us bagram base in afghanistan as the cia guy had told marte price on cnn there was before and after after the gloves came off the first parachute flare had deployed and was slowly descending the fiercely burning flare suffusing the fog around the petrel with a flickering orange light the thump of the second flare making tiny jump again no jokes from jimmy now because the light from the second flare allied with that of the first had illuminated the approaching boat not a dory as was thought but a long twentyfourfoot inflatable up on petrels bridge halls first mate looked through his binoculars at the approaching craft and rang down to the dry lab where frank took the call captain the first mate informed him its an rib about three hundred yards off barely visible but looks like a landing party uniforms hall asked greenish khaki thats not coast guard no could be that specfor team they armed like pancho villa answered the mate bandoliers can you make out their faces no only war paint camouflage caucasian hispanic what pressed hall knowing the moment he said it that it was a silly question canada and the united states were full of minorities particularly in the northwest racial features wouldnt prove a damn thing but they sure as hell werent seals all that bandolier crap looked good for the media and in the movies but was scorned by all special forces bandoliers in a firefight as halls old buddy aussie lewis used to put it were about as useless as tits on a bull by the time you unraveled the macho crisscross bandoliers to reload youd be meat if theyre ours said the first mate why havent they tried to radio us on sixteen theyre moving slowly im coming up frank told the mate he took the short route straight up the ladder from petrels stern deck to its little bird hangar deck then up the four steps to the chart room immediately aft of the bridge doesnt add up frank told the mate taking up the binoculars if theyre terrorists and they dont know sixteens the open channel in these waters they havent done their homework but theyve caused more damage to us since pearl harbor and so they sure as hell must have done their homework well who the hell theyre within hailing distance now cut in frank snatching the megaphones mike he moved quickly to the bridges starboard wing the first flare now fizzling out in the fog stop your vessel identify yourself wanna bet they speak arabic said the helmsman the megaphone response startled everyone on petrel were coast guard from the uss skate stand by for boarding screw you came the voice of one of petrels crew audible to hall but probably not to the inflatable carrying what looked to be six or seven men what are we going to do asked the first mate then answered his own question with a nervous laugh let em board i suppose not yet said hall whose greatgrandfather had regaled him with tales of the awful pacific war after pearl when americaneducated japanese who spoke american english had on more than one occasion duped gullible young gis into coming out into the open the nazis had done the same thing even more effectively since they were caucasians dressed up in american uniforms penetrating the american perimeter in the fierce counterattack through the ardennes in all right so hall knew it would sound corny but better safe than prepare to be boarded came the insistent voice from what was now yards away the rib a black shadow in the fibrous fog screw you yelled one of petrels crew hall strode back to the stern edge of the hangar deck shut up he warned his crew get ready to fire those loshoks when i give the word stand by to be hall raised his megaphone you come any further and well ram you to make the point he ordered the chief to bring engines to full power but as yet did not engage the prop hoping the sudden rumble of the engines would produce the desired effect looks like theyve stopped the mate said unsure and wondering aloud what sort of trouble petrel would be in afterward if it was a coast guard officer whod hailed them and not an englishspeaking terrorist frank brushed the mates concern aside navy trumps the coast guard frank pressed the megaphones button and asked who won the last world series there was silence from the stopped boat and frank uncharacteristically turned to the mate with a selfindulgent smile of victory but the mates puzzled expression killed his smile hall seeing that the mate didnt know the answer confounding his corny tactic further hall could hear what sounded like an argument on the stern deck someone yelling it was the yankees goddammit was it asked the mate i mean the yankees yes said frank his cocky assurance of a few minutes ago quickly evaporating apart from the improvised loshok packs the petrel was unarmed yes it was much bigger than the other vessel but it had no armor whatsoever plus despite his threat to ram them frank and everyone else aboard including the cooks helper knew an rib could easily outmaneuver the bigger petrel dry lab to bridge come in lab said the mate were picking up some funny spots on the sidescan since we changed the paper frank spoke into the intercom an edge to his voice what do you mean funny echoes not many but some sort of squareish aft of that slab we saw yes sir like i said after we changed the paper roll frank noticed that the inflatable off the starboard quarter had stopped for the moment gyrating slowly in the offshore currents keep an eye on them frank told the mate as he quickly left the bridge and went through the helo hangar he slid down the aft ladder to the stern deck without his feet touching a single step the metal rails giving his hands a friction burn his senses so alert that in addition to the salty tang of the sea and the peculiarly distinctive smell of fogsaturated air he could detect the faint odor of the sonar recorders paper before he stepped over the labs doorsill frank saw that the spots on the trace when they were magnified did look squareish but that was all it was a fiftyfifty situation neither of the technicians had said anything yet unwilling to commit themselves one way or the other suggestions he asked the two men any at all ii dunno said one the other teeth clenched giving his jaw an unappealing undershot look shook his head frank had left the labbridge intercom open for immediate communication what are they doing he asked the mate just circling circling us frank asked in alarm no i mean just you know going around no i dont know thats why i asked you you idiot be specific dammit there was an awkward silence bridge frank said yes sir i apologize i was way out of line thats all right sir ive tried to identify any name on the inflatable but cant see anything good man keep looking yes sir loshok packs all ready to go the bosun announced from the lab door very well franks arms were back in horatio nelson mode whatd he say tiny asked the bosun as he returned to the deck he said very well very well yeah like he was captain queeg whos that asked the cooks helper tiny tightening the rope length hed used to replace his belt grunted queeg was an old man on a cruiser destroyer the bosun corrected him whatever said tiny so what happened pressed the cooks assistant what happened is he went nuts under pressure caved in paranoid talked to himself the cooks helper looked disquieted i do that sometimes yeah well youre nuts too bosun called frank lower our runaround im going out to talk to these jokers see what the score is i dunno sir said the bosun uneasily if you dont mind my sayin so theyre what would you suggest asked hall if theyre terrorists they probably wouldnt try this caper unless they had antitank ordnance one round of that could easily split us open at the waterline you know well as i do that we havent an inch of armor on petrel wed sink in minutes ive seen enough dead americans more dead bodies than when i was on tour the tension increased when the two sidescan technicians reported that the roar of petrels engines being brought to full power to bluff the interlopers had scrambled the sidescans signals to the sea bottom and the return echoes all they could see now was a massive earthquakelike trace as if the stylus had lost its head ill get back to you in ten minutes or so hall told them then ordered the bosun to have the crew lower petrels zodiac inflatable despite franks somber mood a mood that pervaded the entire vessel frank calling the bosun by his first name tried to inject a little moraleraising humor jesus tommy he said ill be back for dinner there was forced laughter from the crew the cooks helper the only one to think it was a contender for petrels best joke of the month you take care the bosun said frank shoved off the zodiacs outboard a little rough spitting now and then as he headed straight for the other bigger inflatable of course they wouldnt be terrorists everyone was becoming too paranoid as if america had been invaded looking back as sailors always do to the vessel from which hed just departed he saw the bosun standing alone on the hangar deck holding up a white rag pointing downward frank looked down and saw a white rag tucked into the space between the zodiacs gunwale and floor it contained a suspiciously genericlooking revolver a small hastily scrawled note said hollow points remember hold your breath and squeeze dont pull frank didnt know whether to be furious or grateful hed told these jokers now only a hundred yards away that hed come unarmed squeeze dont pull who the hell did tommy think he was talking to some firstweeker at coronado he stuck the gun between his thigh and the zodiacs floor the outboard was spitting again frank gave it a little more throttle it choked and stopped dead in the water what had he learned at coronado all outboards will fail precisely when they are most needed chapter fortyone freeman had his nose in the air like a bloodhound smell em he asked softly aussie and sal nodded choirs sense of smell sabotaged by the exhaust of the mercury engine and the bad air mix hed been inhaling back on the beach but for his specfor comrades the faint yet distinctive odor of aftershave cologne and underarm deodorant told them someone was upwind of them in the fogshrouded sea probably no more than two or three hundred yards the odors were the kind that had betrayed a younger generation of americans in the jungles of vietnam making the same giveaway mistake as david brentwood had made by not ordering his team to eat only arab food freeman now went to hand signals his acute sense of smell indicating there must be at least four of them or maybe half a dozen up ahead then choir detected the hushed slurr sound of another motor he tapped sal on the shoulder sal doing the same to freeman the general hoping that the invisible perfume boys somewhere up ahead had not yet detected them freeman made a throatcutting gesture and choir killed the engine everyone silent motionless listening intently the current taking them forward which way were the bogeys heading it was then that petrels tiny saw it happen the sky opened the fog riven by sunlight like bloody moses said tiny indeed the sky suddenly seemed to expand the common optical illusion at sea when landgenerated thermals win the evershifting battle with the oceans air currents the speed was such that just as during freemans battle tour in iraq when an artillery round had collapsed a battalions row of showers to reveal a line of astonished naked bodies his aluminum boat frank halls zodiac and the sweetsmelling visitors circling near the petrel in their rib all suddenly saw one another and a half mile to the east the coast guards skate for a frozen moment no one did anything not even freeman who had experienced a similar unexpected standoff with a republican guard platoon when a dust storm had suddenly lifted near hindiya then hed fired first now he hesitated the nanosecond lost perhaps because of a fear of committing blue on blue friendly fire had caused more than half the coalitions casualties in iraq the mm burst from one of the six fake skate war party unzipped the deadlock the rounds hitting the sea only three feet in front of freeman shocking the general and his team choir making a crucially correct decision steered at full speed toward the enemy inflatables bow only freeman was firing since there wasnt enough room in the boat to permit either aussie or sal to shoot choir knew that the slightest variation in the their course would give the enemy rib a broadside target his quick action confounded the warpainted crew now only fifty yards off their coxswain instead of calling choirs bluff and going full speed at the approaching boat intuitively but imprudently steered hard astarboard trying to avoid freemans shots but the generals tracered mm hit the front two men their collapse abruptly shifting the weight in the inflatable so its left gunwale was momentarily submerged the other four men trying frantically to regain balance one got off a skyward burst before freemans continuing enfilade punched him out of the boat which heeled farther to port the remaining three attackers trying to right themselves it was only two seconds before the three were on their feet or rather their knees and stable enough to return freemans fire but it was too late for in those two breathseizing seconds an eternity in a firefight or car crash freeman had ample time to change mags the steam rising from his hk barrel seen by frank hall who had been banging away with the bosuns gift of the saturday night special reopening fire at twenty yards freeman pierced the trios chests with such rapidity it was like a madman frenetically stabbing his victim with an ice pick the jets of bright arterial blood macabre and freeman thought beautiful against the green of the mens uniforms and beneath the ceruleanblue sky petrels first mate rang petrels telegraph for full ahead to assist frank and the men firing from the aluminum boat at the interlopers now as petrels bow wave creased the otherwise calm sea the first mate and his crew braced for what they thought might be a storm of fire from the skate if in a terrible blue on blue petrels skipper and the aluminum boat men had mistakenly opened fire on a genuine landing party from the skate the guns on the coast guard vessel would open up well shit opined cookie what were those guys with the tin boat supposed to do those guys in the rib started shootin first it was selfdefense man if it was me shut up the bosun said but tommy knew the kid had a point jesus jimmy told malcolm indicating the floating bodies from the rib as well as the oncoming coast guard vessel maybe they were from the coast guard patrol boat i mean the guys who opened up first old man on that coast guard probably didnt fire back cause itd be killing americans for killing americans if you know what i mean you mean two wrongs dont make a right malcolm answered yeah said jim appreciative of the phrase thats exactly what i mean geez he added not wanting to watch the floaters but unable to look away you think they were from the skate malcolm shrugged well soon find out frank wasnt going to second guess his first mate after all the officer had good intentions in bringing the petrel forward but he knew the underwater ruckus made by petrels props would destroy any hope of a clear sidescan trace for a while and so the only comments he made climbing up to petrels deck following the short fierce firefight on the water were directed at the bosun thanks for the weapon tom he said handing the white bundle up to him the bosun gave the bundle to tiny to hold a second later a fullbodied oath greeted frank hall tiny dropping the hed noisily retrieved from the cloth jesus its hottern a twodollar shotgun howd it go the bosun asked solemnly the gun oh lied frank went great sure as hell glad i had it i can tell you one of those bastards holed our zodiac couldnt pick up anyone frank was on the deck phone now the mate telling him he was arranging a deck party to help freemans team with the floaters the skate was back on channel the jamming by the unknown craft having ceased the moment freeman had finished off the six attacking his tin boat the bosun was beaming hell he hadnt been able to do much to help out in the firefight and was glad his had been of some use confiding proudly to tiny and malcolm it was probably our skipper who dropped a couple of those bastards tiny watched the bosun walk into the dry lab to join frank anxiously standing by the sidescan recorder whats he worried about asked cookie smoking beneath the aframe he sounded nonchalant but malcolm noticed that his legs were trembling so much that his stained white apron was shaking as well cookie saw that malcolm had noticed cold malcolm asked huh what oh yeah freezing what you expect cookie you havent got enough on for chrissake put on a windbreaker cook doesnt like me wearing em around the mix fuck the cook put on a windbreaker yeah hed obviously forgotten about what was worrying the captain malcolm put his arm on the young mans shoulder were all cold cookie youll be all right cookie nodded sharply tossing the cigarette overboard which was just as well malcolm told jimmy who was standing over by portside rail at the moment hall was preoccupied in the dry lab by the fact that the petrel had lost over three hundred yards of trace due to the first mates full ahead order but if he came out on deck and found cookie smoking anywhere near the loshok hed likely shoot him with the bosuns amazing isnt it began malcolm he and jimmy trying to keep out of the way of the guys who were putting over the rope ladder for the approaching specfor team the ropes and wooden steps whacking the side of the ship whats amazing asked jimmy tommy first rate bosun knew just what to do he wanted to use the slingshot loshok to try to help the old man but he knew one slip and hed kill the old man or these specfor guys were gonna take aboard but the same guy thinks that dinky hes been haulin around is accurate its a piece of crap agreed jimmy couldnt hit a barn door at two feet maybe it saved his life one time malcolm mused out of a sense of fair play maybe conceded jimmy watching the urgent preparations on the increasingly crowded stern deck while safeguarding the pallet of loshok charges by the aframe maybe he used it as an oven fire three shots out of that thing and you could cook a threecourse meal malcolm grinned broadly it was hardly the time or place for a joke even a weak one but sometimes it just happened like that im gonna tell im you said that he kidded jimmy put you in the shit thanks jimmy kicked the halfdozen small packs of loshok think well ever get to hey said malcolm stepping away dont do that what inquired jimmy feigning doltlike innocence oh you mean dont do this whereupon he again kicked the seventypound mother of all depth charges jesus jimmy knock it off relax mah boy friggin midgets skedaddled by now under cover of all our prop wash and that coast guard tub steaming toward us the skate was now only two hundred yards to the east but slowing its own prop wash slopping forward to overtake and mix with its decelerated bow wave along with the petrel it created a localized chop in which freeman sal and aussie found it difficult to haul the dead aboard their commandeered aluminum boat their outrage at what had happened to dixon having cooled somewhat by the possibility that theyd perhaps been involved in an unavoidable friendly fire incident it had been unavoidable to them the men on the spot but they knew it never appeared as unavoidable to the media or the armchair critics who always knew what you should have done in the millisecond you had to decide freeman was understandably tightjawed as they hauled in the third of the six bodies look he said sternly no identification aussie wondered if the generals cryptic comment was a criticism of the dead men for not having identified themselves before opening fire or whether he was commenting on the fact that none of those hauled in so far had any id whatsoever one of them looked central asian to him another chinese and the third was racially unidentifiable having been hit in the upper chest and face where in hell did they come from asked salvini i mean were they sent from the sub to run interference maybe they came out of that cave said choir ill bet aussie began and paused for breath as he braced his feet against the inside of the tin boats starboard drop seat and aided by freeman began hauling in the fourth floater ill bet choirs right that these pricks are the same ones who did the sicko job on young dixon probably came down out of the cave then dragged their rib from a hide on the beach and came out in the fog to do the petrel fore she could find their mates in the sub the fourth floater another asian now tumbled into the boat which rocked precariously watch it cautioned choir ive had enough dunking for one day he added why not let petrel haul these shit bags out no one answered his question but their silence was a reply their earlier guesstimates notwithstanding they were not sure whether these bodies were hostiles or us special forces like themselves caught up in a tragic blue on blue aussies hypothesis that the bodies were those of the hostiles who so savagely murdered and tortured dixon was no more than that a hypothesis special forces like freemans like david brentwoods failed team in afghanistan always went on foreign operations without any identification that might cause political embarrassment should they be captured or killed and the fact that two different branches of the armed services often sent out their own without telling one another was no help plus as choir acknowledged foreign terrorists teams would certainly use someone fluent in english whats this one aussie asked as they hauled in another body chinese no said freeman japanese proffered choir vietnamese suggested aussie theyre heavy as a brick in the water but you can see theyre all in pretty good shape no extra weight damn look at that fogs rolling in again it came in like a giant billow of smoke and within a minute the petrel and the skate each vessels radar allowing them to maintain station two hundred yards apart were at times completely hidden from view with the sixth body nowhere to be seen choir sped up the mercury before they lost sight of petrel unintentionally just as petrels and skates engineers had done he further sabotaged petrels sidescan outgoing sonar waves not surprisingly the disturbance angered hall who as tired as everyone else on the oceanographic vessel now learned from the skates captain that the five unidentified dead men killed by freeman had definitely not been sent from the skate this told frank that the sixman commando unit sent so cunningly to board petrel would not have been dispatched unless the sub was still in the area lying low mate he ordered the first officer get the gps coordinates for that slab we had a trace of a while back gps as good as it is has a possible error margin of a hundred feet thats not much on land but out here it can be like looking for your car on the wrong parking level and like the seinfeld show said the mate when kramer i dont watch tv frank cut in abruptly take your steering directions from the dry lab ill stay down here sir yes i have to take a dump wheres the third mate feeling sick shes pretty upset about what well you know began the mate awkwardly she told me she signed on to do you know retrieval oceanographic work not a war guess she wasnt ready for this he indicated the bodies being hauled up from the tin boat by the sterns hydraulic arm new york wasnt ready for retorted frank punching the intercom bar for the third mates cabin a groggy sickly voice barely managed to say yes riley its the captain speaking get your ass up to the bridge now the third mates silence was a tacit recognition of halls zero tolerance for malingerers frank telling her everyone on the ship was needed if the fog kept socking them in it would be an ideal opportunity for an injured sub awaiting its chance to make a run for it come nightfall when the third mate dragged herself up to relieve the first mate she was wheyfaced a tall lithe young woman who normally looked as if she could handle anything her male counterparts could see that sandra riley looked bedraggled after her ordeal dazed by the bridge glasss reflection of the bright shaded stern light that formed a sharply defined cone in the swirling fog frank who had just come up from the dry lab tapped the gps coordinates on the chart soon as we get those bodies aboard sandra well come about and backtrack to this gps location see what we get in the trace we lost a gob of it during a damn paper change sandra took halls use of her first name as a good sign more often than not he simply called her riley if its the sub she mused aloud maybe theyll take advantage of all this noise franks usual equanimity was edgy with fatigue you an authority on antisubmarine warfare now he knew better but the perversity that runs with bad temper and the feeling of his own impotence regarding the sub was venting itself i just meant that with all the noise the skates engines are making screwing up our side scan it would be a good time for a sub in trouble to surface yes i know make a run for it in the fog exactly it was said in a gutsy uncompromising tone frank turned to watch the work crew bringing aboard the general and his three comrades all of them old friends whod trained at one time or another in specops at elgin in florida as well as at the seals school at coronado in california theyd all carried the monstrous logs at coronado running along the public beach while young beach beauties sandras age only a few feet away sunbathed in the scantiest thong bikinis the sweating grunting seal trainees had ever seen what beauties the seals instructors had barked their faces masks of incredulity aint no women here youre hallucinating pick it up salvini hup two three frank made a mental note to apologize to sandra later but now her selfassertiveness her tone which some skippers could easily have convinced themselves was bordering on insubordination was too recent for him to humble himself it was a trait which he did not admire in himself well need to be right on the spot he continued businesslike we spotted a slablike shape against a slope unless were on the southern side of it our scanll miss it the sandy slopell wall it off from us i understand sir very well ill be down in the lab once were there ill give you helm instructions from the lab very well very well was she sticking it to him he saw freeman who entered the dry lab strode over and shook hands vigorously good to see you frank i need room for my men to rest that goddamn sub is still here i know it get that coast guard ship to do a search grid but no overlap with yours cant afford to waste time thats the general thought frank hasnt seen you in ages and right off the bat hes telling you the ships master no ordering you what to do youre assuming petrels going to do a grid said frank of course arent you yes i agree with you those people are still people freeman cut in crossly his body odor dominating the dry lab they arent people theyre goddamn animals as yet hall hadnt heard about what had happened to dixon who he remembered had aged overnight after his swim buddys death frank didnt press the general for any details of what exactly had taken place it wasnt the time freeman left frank to it and turned his attention back to the five bodies laid out on the stern pulling back the blanket from each one squatting down staring at them i think hes enjoying it malcolm commented to the bosun who was looking down at petrels barely visible wake as it proceeded slowly into the general area of the problematic slab sal and choir also on the stern deck were wondering aloud what had happened to the missing floater still lost in the fog i think that floater was a swimmer cut in aussie faked us out big bloody drama clutching his chest and falling from that rib bastards probably ashore by now draggin imself up that s trail possible said freeman but the general as sal choir and an equally perplexed malcolm looked on was still looking at the five whose floating days were over aussie meanwhile carefully went through the dead mens sodden camouflagepattern uniforms for any id definitely not all chinese said choir glancing over at aussie from the portside rail youve lost your bet boyo the hell i have they all look chinese to me guy looks like he tried to hang himself said sal leaning over and pointing to a dark bruise ringing one of the dead mens throats should have said aussie as sal let the bloodsoaked blanket fall back over the corpses face wouldve saved us the trouble yeah agreed sal standing up arching and massaging his back yawning malcolm couldnt tell whether it was the way salvini arched his back that angered him or the specfor warriors yawn the soldiers manner appearing to him and jimmy as inappropriately cavalier downright disrespectful in the presence of the dead freeman was now pulling the fogshrouded blanket back from the man sal had referred to i know theyre terrorists malcolm told jimmy but jesus know what i mean yeah jimmy said lowering his voice and looking across the deck toward freeman hes supposed to be a legend tiny says his troops used to call him george c scott malcolm looked blank you know general patton oh yeah scuttlebutt is that hes been sidelined ever since clinton apparently criticized bill in ninetyeight told him the white house didnt know dick about handling a terrorist situation said they were wasting their time firing a cruise instead of sending in helo snatchandgrab squads take some of the towel heads up an tell em talk or youll be the first arabs to walk in space so clinton canned him asked malcolm no the pentagon did said freeman was a loose cannon now theyre beatin the crap out of towel heads so how come freemans still sidelined pressed malcolm jimmy shrugged pentagons like anywhere else i guess once youre out you jimmy stopped as freeman made his way to the sterns aframe and standing by them stared thoughtfully into the fog as if willing his tired deep blue eyes to see farther whered you say the skate was malcolm asked jimmy in case the general suspected theyd been talking about him the general remained staring intently astern he turned looked directly at the two men frowned darkly then resumed staring out into the fog the two men moved away toward the dry lab he must have heard us said malcolm softly jimmy turning for a last look at freeman almost tripped on the dry labs doorsill no he told malcolm i dont think he heard us cmon jimmy did you see that frown it wasnt meant for us replied jimmy somethings bothering him jimmy was right something was bothering freeman something hed seen but couldnt identify whatever it was it was like a wasp hovering about worrying you when all you wanted to do was rest right now however his first priority was to secure sleeping space for sal aussie and choir and order them to rest as if the three veterans of a dozen foreign wars needed a command to sleep after their grueling hours afloat and ashore and the generals second priority was to get rest himself besides the last thing he wanted was to discuss with hall or anyone else his failure to stop the sub in the crescent bay his teams failure everyones failure so far stalked his sleep as he lay on a mattress brought to the dry lab his snoring so loud that one of the sidescan technicians put on a pair of cranials goddamn the technician muttered i can still hear him as a sailor one of whose qualifications is the ability to live with constant closequarter noise the techs complaint about freemans trainwhistle breathing was evidence frank thought of the extraordinary tension aboard the petrel in washington dc public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of taking out penghu both the joint chiefs and the taiwanese government pointed out the extraordinary danger of allowing china to have a massive air base only fifteen miles from the island nation two and a half minutes away by fighterbomber and as many other american leaders and newspapers pointed out most noticeably the new york times if taiwan the only other democratic bulwark in asia besides japan were to be lost american power and influence as well as its strategic and economic interests would suffer irreparable harm and the french were gloating le monde commenting in an editorial that once again washington has to recognize that in its war against terrorism in a conflict of such elasticity its conventional force is passé and its navy has become what the chinese call a paper tiger the president said he didnt give a damn what the foreign press said especially france and germany the american people however did give a damn and together with the penghu military danger being pressed home with increasing fervor by the pentagon state and taipei the president sought and received congressional approval to neutralize the penghu threat and so as petrel approached the halfway mark of its search grid the president ordered all battle groups to stand by pending imminent action against penghu collateral damage notwithstanding which meant that whoever was to be tasked with the action would not allow the presence of taiwanese hostages to impede the mission chapter fortytwo admiral jensen and admiral crowley had something in common jensen had been plunged further into depression over the promise of the nrb failing to materialize to rescue his all but fatally wounded reputation crowley on the mccain watching cnns report on the mounting public pressure dared to hope that he might now have the chance to redeem his reputation as a superior decision maker following what had already become known among those whod survived the kamikaze attack on their beloved boat as crowleys clanger in the mccains bluetile inner sanctums officers and other ranks quietly wondered aloud whether theyd get a chance to avenge their dead with whatever the boat had left in her vault situated deep in the boat these vaults or fortified ammunition magazines held over four million pounds of payback there was everything down there from sparkling virginsstandoff land attack missilesexpanded response or slamers to cmodel airtoground joint standoff missiles each armed with a fivehundredpound warhead with a midcourse accuracy of plus or minus fiftytwo feet that would do it said an ordnance chief petty officer in the vault got enough here to turn that friggin paygoo penghu one of his fellow red jackets corrected him paygoo continued the cpo looking about at the bright metal coffins that contained the virgins and the plethora of other land attack and airtoair ordnance as yet none of it was armed but they were ready to go if we get the call said the other red jacket well get the call the cpo said confidently that cnn skirt one with the hooters said theres protest mobs outside the white house demanding we do somethin protests for war man thats a new one the cpo was still thinking about paygoo could turn it into a parking lot after were finished with it after they fill in the craters chief said a greenshirted cargo handler yeah the cpo smiled yeah joined in the ordnance tracker if we get the order well get it the cpo replied his tone not brooking any dissent who else is there were johnny on the spot besides were the ones who got whacked admiral crowley anticipating knowing hed soon be called in to launch americas counterattack against penghu retired to what the navy grandly called his stateroom for his daily tenminute deepdiaphragm breathing taking advantage of the lull in the normally thunderous roar of the roof directly above him he switched on the tv pressed mute and lay flat on his back his pillow under his knees his son had got him doing the destressor routine the admiral rejecting the idea at first huffing and puffing about new age cults its not a cult dad his son had said deep breathing meditative techniques are as old as the hills will you just try it youll feel better when you do it so the admiral was trying it but with the door closed he didnt want the crew to think he was one of those damn yogis and it was relaxing him he could feel the tension of this terrible day abate somewhat of course he had yet to write the families of all the men and women who had died and that wouldnt help his tension level john cuso had offered to help and crowley had accepted they both agreed there would be no computergenerated crap or fake original signatures theyd write every one of the letters shipmates of those killed would as usual be a big help providing personal details and where appropriate a humorous little anecdote to give the letters a more human touch the padre would help too but right now he was giving last rites to the dying and preparing for what would be the massive burial at sea cnn was doing its entertainment section hollywood celebs caution a rush to judgment was about one wellknown singeractor whod apparently terrified her fans by threatening to leave america if bush invaded iraq she was now threatening to do it again a mob of screaming adolescents jabbing the air with peace for penghu and burning old glory near the perimeter rope in lafayette park across from the white house another smaller but just as vocal group was holding signs promising to pay the singers fare to the penghu neither group marte price reported is clear on exactly where penghu is the mccain was sailing into night as the show was broadcast the ship darkened all lights below rigged for red admiral crowley entered the combat information center and in a voice as calm as ice told john cuso ive been thinking john if i were terrorists id attack us at first light the incoming secret threelettercoded message was received by john rorkes uss encino at four hundred feet below the surface of bashi strait via the attack boats extremely low frequency aerial which it periodically played out hundreds of yards behind it from a keelflush integrated spool set on its port side elf was secure being out of view of aerial reconnaissance or other shipping that might be in the area but it was so slow its transmission rate this morning one letter every twentysix seconds that it was used more often than not to instruct a submarine to come to periscope depth and raise its communications mast in what encinos crew called the quick popout at periscope depth encinos radio mast quickly pierced the seaair interface and hopefully before any hostile got a chance to discover the mast by satellite infrared recon received a threesecond burst message from comsubpac hq in hawaii must be urgent encinos executive officer said it had better be said john rorke i dont like exposing myself for anything less how bout your honey skipper quipped the navigator rorke gave an obligatory grin but when the navigator had said your honey rather than a honey it made him inwardly wince and he saw that the executive officer sensed it a certain amount of sexual innuendo was part of a navy mans life hell any mans life he thought but coopedup men sometimes went over the line it wasnt the words they used rorke knew the lexicon from bangor maine to bangor washington and he was no prude but hed found that whenever hed started getting serious about a woman the innuendos and unending sexual jokes made him feel defensive no protective about her alicia evoked in him a respect for women that usually waned when he was simply chasing poontang the xo had shot the navigator a warning glance but the latter was busy confirming encinos position having taken advantage of the brief popout of the ultrahigh frequency mast to get a fix before the masts were retracted into the subs sail this would allow him to correct for the ships inertial navigation system which despite twentyfirstcentury computers linked gyroscopes and movementsensitive accelerometers could often drift up to yards it was an important correction enabling the subs captain and the handful of officers privy to such information on the boat to know exactly where encino was this was especially useful as rorkes mentor admiral jensen had once said if you actually want to hit something with a torpedo once submerged well below periscope depth rorke and the xo watched as two weapons officers from the subs missile department simultaneously opened two small green combination safes both officers extracted one of a halfdozen black plastic capsules from each with the number on each of the nontransparent capsules received via the uhf burst message being the same the code phrase within each of the two extracted capsules was also the same in this case blair keith the fact that both capsules contained the same name as duly witnessed by rorke and his xo allowed all four officers to concur that the presidents order for encino to fire all twelve of its tomahawk land attack missiles at the target identified only by coordinates was valid none of the crew would know what the target was not even the weapons officer who now with deliberate yet unhurried pace punched the given coordinates into his redeyed firing procedures console only the navigator his computer verifying his manual chart plot knew the coordinates were for an island off southwestern taiwan but he did not know exactly what on that island was being targeted in this war as in peacetime patrols the sub had remained submerged cut off from the world and news of it for months at a time night and day distinguished only by whether sections of the sub were rigged for red not even the coveted fiftyword familygrams whose delivery could give the subs position away were being received only rorke whod been rushed from the plane to the subs dock to take command of encino after the subs captain had unexpectedly died at sea from a heart attack knew about the present situation between the two chinas his mind no longer on alicia on women on anything but the care he must take to arrive secretly at the launch point an hour away rorke reviewed all the known idiosyncrasies of the encino the crew was already in ultraquiet mode signaled by simple voice command from rorke no klaxon had sounded his order and no klaxon would sound battle stations at launch point there would be no noise on the sub that might alert hostiles all mixing machines in the galley all washerdryers and so on no matter how quiet their rubber mountings were to be turned off in the galley the cooks menu changed to ground prime beef hamburgers better than any in the civilian world ready to be quickly cooked in a silent microwave its earpiercing done alarm permanently silenced replaced by a colored light indicator those not on duty had to be in their bunks and if using discmans walkmans and the like were allowed the use of only one earpiece the chief of the boat otherwise known on encino as old testament ritually informed every newcomer to the boat god help the man i find curtained in his bunk who doesnt hear an order because his eardrums are being bombarded by some rap crap a towel hastily pulled around his waist an auxiliaryman caught in midshampoo all water noise cut off as ultraquiet was answered emerged from the stall mumbling obscenities his hair still streaked with suds a torpedo tech made way for him flashing him a mocking come hither look that the suds man returned with a murderous glare every one of the fifteen officers and enlisted men now knew this was no drill and in their bunks men turned to their private comforts a picture of family a bible girlfriends and for some a passage from the koran for others there were dreams of what theyd do if god or fate spared them from fatality in this strangest of conflicts of constantly shifting trouble fronts rorke had not told them that america had been attacked in the northwest some were bound to have loved ones there and why burden men on the boat with the anxiety of not knowing of being unable to do anything out here deep in the netherworld of ocean the best they could do that he could do rorke knew was get on with the job though badly shaken by the loss of the utah he was confident that he could get the footlong boat to launch point at precisely the right time providing he could keep encino in perfect trim encino did not have the bow thrusters some other boats had which allowed them to hover at launch point but barring any unforeseen circumstances he told himself he should have no trouble the more superstitious among the crew however who nursed their captains death and recalled rorkes clumsy arrival hed slipped and fallen while coming aboard on the rainslicked gangway took these as two very bad signs several of the crew believing in the theory that things come in threes eternal father strong to save was the hymn played over mccains pa to the carriers fivethousandplus men and women the boats starboard aft elevator space crowded with offduty personnel for whom the ships quartermaster had distributed song sheets the religious and nonreligious who had gathered here were as diverse as american society itself but all were bound by a patriotism so deeply felt and honored it aroused sniggers and embarrassment among other western nations except ironically in russia once its bitterest foe but no one could be embarrassed now as the stentorian voice of the padre led the huge ad hoc choir in rough unison with such feeling that no one but the most selfindulgent cynic could fail to be moved by the swell of love for fallen comrades so intense it could be heard by lookouts aboard the aegis cruisers guarding the flanks of the huge manowar admiral crowley had determined that there would be no burial in the light of day for the enemy to take advantage of when morning broke he and the entire battle group would be ready to attack penghu the president surely giving first licks to mccain whose air wing had been so grievously harmed by the pla air force and for which everyone on the carrier held beijing its protestations notwithstanding totally responsible a complaint was brought to commander john cuso that eternal father strong to save was sexist said it referred to the creator as being masculine what do we do asked the chief petty officer from the section in which the complainant originated ill file it promised cuso consider it later yes sir when the cpo left cuso balled the complaint in his fist and chucked it into his wastebasket filed chapter fortythree marte price didnt like the cnn makeup studio in port angeles she said it reeked of fish everything reeked of fish her producer told her the smell coming from the thousands of dead fish in the strait when charles riser arrived in the cab the odor of jack daniels was still on his breath though hed vigorously brushed his teeth he knew he would have to begin with an apology it wasnt only good manners but a tactical necessity if she was to believe what wu ling had told him that general chang must have discovered the rumored deal between beijing and li kuans fanatically americanhating terrorists what surprised charles was marte prices immediate and goodnatured acceptance of his contrition a woman who clearly didnt hold petty grudges he thought he told her the story about how mandy was murdered by li kuans thugs in suzhou and this general chang tried to help you find out where li kuan was yes then he disappeared his girlfriend wu ling right yes charles was impressed by her attentiveness and memory you told me you told state she said but that they dont believe you or rather they think youre making a mountain out of a molehill not of amandas death but that your bereavement has made you paranoid something like that she was remarkable insightful and quick she paused and patted the pockets of her jeans her top oncamera half was captive in a nononsense genderequality black business jacket and a highcollared almost prudish white blouse which was mocked by her lower more casual attire he liked her a lot he could tell she believed him about changs discovery of a beijingkazakhstan deal which if it could be proved would result in crippling trade sanctions against china the removal of its highly coveted us preferrednation status mr riser i have contacts good contacts at state she said theyve suspected china of making such a deal with li kuan for months and they have cut in charles then why on earth charles may i call you charles of course charles riser she saw was a decent man a genuine cultural attaché not a spy using the cultural cover but he obviously didnt understand the enormous economic war between the us and china that was going to be one of the defining us strategies of the twentyfirst century as the battle between japan and the us had been in the latter half of the twentieth the problem charles is that state the administration needs concrete proof of such a deal before they can act riser fell silent for several moments and she saw there were tears in his eyes they always get away with it he said they should have got that bastard kuan in afghanistan marte didnt respond at once there was no need she knew what he meant why did the li kuans of the world who murdered raped his child so often evade punishment six americans the best of the best led by david brentwood had died inside some damn cave in afghanistan and still li kuan was at large marte touched risers hand im sorry i cant do any more you understand rumor speculation is one thing its concrete evidence we need he felt selfish and after a long pause nodded he understood he turned attention away from himself how are things up here not good jensen is dispatching two new stateoftheart subhunter hydrofoils from san francisco in a couple of those monster globemasters but all our ships that were sunk including the utah were supposed to have stateoftheart antisub stuff aboard this jensen charles asked hes the sub admiral right he didnt really care he just wanted to hear her talk the last woman whod touched him like that had been his wife elizabeth it seemed a thousand years ago he felt utterly exhausted unable even to will himself to move jensen iswascomsubpac group replied marte he sent a coast guard ship the skate in to help in horrible search conditions everything socked in by fog there was a pause look she began her producer was anxious and gestured at her in three minutes she was to give a report on the sea of refugees still moving south into oregon and california have you got a picture of amanda she asked charles anything we might use if something breaks it was a question shed asked scores of bereaved parents during her reporters career he had a lot of pictures of mandy one with wu ling course said charles youve got one of this he paused animal it was the same computerenhanced photo of li kuan that the cia and other agencies had the terrorists pockmarked bald scalp and hazel european eyes in stark contrast to his otherwise distinctly chinese features the pockmarked scalp gave kuan what charles told marte was a particularly sinister appearance even for a terrorist in her twenty years as a correspondent marte had seen terrorists and other coldblooded killers such as ted bundy who looked almost angelic so li kuans appearance did not unduly affect her yes she said handing the photo back to charles we already have this on file everyone has charles its the only one and as you can see not a particularly useful one she was trying to explain to him that you just cant stick someones photo on tv even that of a terrorist and say theyre linked to beijing that theyre in cahoots without proof and there had been absolutely no evidence from any of the media feed she was getting that the muslim terrorists had anything to do with chinas push against taiwan but charlie riser countered muslim terrorists everywhere hate americans yes she conceded they do but she knew it was a non sequitur charlie riser understandably fixated on the terrorists because of his daughters murder marte empathized she remembered the terrible murder of daniel pearl the wall street journal reporter whod been captured by the taliban in horribly tortured and then executed his grisly death videotaped by the terrorists pearl left a grieving wife and an unborn son behind even the hardbitten types amongst the international media had been shocked charlie riser looked over at her and said i have a gut feeling that li kuan is behind these sub attacks you know he told marte he tells beijing you help us hit the great satan and well be no trouble in kazakhstan marte prices producer gave up on his earlier polite tone marte ten seconds he shouted she put her hand on charless ill do what i can talk to freeman see what he has with that she rose quickly and got back in front of the universal eye five seconds marte proof she said to riser concrete proof if your friend chang manages to smuggle out any concrete proof to wu ling call me then she was back on air state had been looking for charles everywhere and when he got back to seattle the tall girl was waiting trying to be very stern washington expected you in dc today did they yes and ive been told youre to leave on this evenings flight from seatac im embarrassing the department well yes all right he sighed what else could he do hed been trained in diplomacy it was all he knew ive done my best he said the tall girl from state could have sworn he wasnt talking to either her or himself it was as if someone else was in the room chapter fortyfour freemans jimmy leg as his team had always referred to the sudden jerks the generals limbs would make while he was asleep was getting worse and alarming to anyone whod never seen the medical condition is he okay one of the sidescan techs asked frank hull hell be fine responded frank whose eyes were glued to the profile coming up on the new roll of paper geez i wouldnt want anyone to see me like that he always wants to be near the action said frank besides i dont think anyones told him you could if you want i dont think so the other technician like hall was watching the slowly emerging outline of the sea bottom never tiring of the sidescan sonars magic you sent down an invisible sound wave and back it came morphed into a visible line that formed a part in the larger jigsaw pattern of echoes whose overall picture should soon tell them if there was a sub down there or not the tech hoped not hed witnessed enough action for a lifetime the sight of the terrorists that freeman had killed ironically more troubling to him because unlike the american dead from the multiple sinkings rigor mortis had not yet set in the one freeman had been staring down at looked as if he was still alive eyes open the pennyontheeyelids thing one of petrels crew had tried failed to keep the eyelids shut the coins falling off because of residual muscle movement that had sent the pennies running across the deck which tiny confessed had totally freaked him those hydrofoil sub chasers jensens sending up to everett the tech said to frank they should be here soon right half an hour maybe more replied frank eyes still on the trace everyone goes slow in the fog and put in the other technician unhelpfully itll soon be dark freemans leg shot out jesus christ settle down frank told the tech if that slab we saw earlier was the sub lying low it might be gone by now under cover of our prop disturbance during the firefight looks like were back at the site captain one of the techs said excitedly frank nodded freemans jimmy leg had started up again which caught young cookies attention overloaded with a tray bearing thick white mugs of coffee and hot chocolate for dry lab and stern watches he stepped over the labs door no beer im afraid gents he announced cheerfully resolved to show that corpses on deck didnt scare him he could handle it thanks said frank without looking up away from the recorder son dont have to worry cap stop engines frank shouted into the intercom barely any movement resulted but in the slight yaw of the ship cookie lost his balance an avalanche of white mugs spilling chocolate and coffee crashing onto the dry labs floor wha freeman was up one arm around cookies neck the other holding the kbars blade an inch from the mans throat could be the sub hall said loudly the small black soundreflective sixbysixinch squares on the mud bottom just a few feet east of the slab the squares were not rubberized anechoic tiles or they would not have reflected the sonar signals like the gaps seen on the space shuttle that had shown where the heatshield tiles had fallen off frank believed he was seeing bare metal squares on the sub that the tiles had either fallen off through wear and tear or been shot off earlier by freemans team during the fight at the falls freeman had sheathed his knife quickly apologized to cookie and stepped to the left of the recorder the stylus was flashing back and forth now under the labs night lights he said nothing his attention riveted on the profile bosun frank called you have a weight on that loshok pack yes sir its ready to go same depth sir yes thirtytwo fathoms stern party stand by to lower minimum noise they can hear us but i dont want their passive to pick up the splash when we drop the loshok ill start petrel slow ahead make them think weve found nothing and decided to go on yes sir the bosun strode out onto the stern jimmy mal tiny over here frank called sandra riley on the bridge i think weve found the sub he said can you see the skate no sir fogs too thick but ive got her on radar shes about a mile to starboard on the northsouth leg of her search grid any sign of those two hydrofoils frank asked conscious of the fact that while the skate was heavily deckarmed she had no depth charges of any sort i dont want to use the radio to contact skate he continued if it is the sub down there it could be trailing an aerial to pick up our transmission i assumed that it would have made a run for it under cover of our engine noise during the yes agreed frank i dont know why they havent freeman cut in telling sandra i think we winged the son of a bitch sweetheart not on the hull proper but its ballast tanks like having puncture holes in your inflatable you can still move but slowly and youd have to send a swimmer out through the subs air lock to repair the holes you cant do that quietly frank was nodding his agreement anyway the general concluded this loshok of yours should do it rip the damn boat open like a can o sardines on deck tiny was on standby ready to lower the seventypound pack of explosive overboard once frank gave him the order he didnt like it the captains assumption that it was definitely the sub and the flamboyant generals talk of what should happen made him nervous so did the dynamite truth is he told jimmy you dont know from one minute to the next whats gonna hey cut in the bosun rainintheface knock it off you have that loshok chain weight taped down i dont want that friggin chain to rattle and roll on the way down it wont tiny assured him lifting the combined weight of pounds with one hand as if it was a bunch of grapes jimmy checked the fuse length for the sixth time the primacord calculated to assure detonation of the loshok just above its hull if in fact it was the sub whatd you call me tiny asked the bosun rainintheface yeah well i dont care im tellin you guys i dont think that profile is the sub its a slab of limestone and a few flakes fell off slab of limestones like assholes in these parts everyones got one what about those loose tiles theyre talking about countered jimmy tiles smiles bs said tiny i had a peek at that trace when cookie lost our drinks i didnt see anything those spots the old man saw could be anything this straits full of shit that peoplere chucked overboard you know how many coke cans and crap we pick up on sonar ah said jimmy dismissively youre just scared tiny you bet your ass im scared those hydrofoils hear a bang whatre they gonna do everyones so trigger happy these last few days did you see the sonar trace jimmy shook his head malcolm asked tiny no lower and cut called out frank carefully the bosun lit the fuse and tiny played out the charges line the weight barely causing a ripple as it broke the foggy seas surface and was released in free fall full ahead ordered frank calmly the petrels sonar immediately picked up the echoes from the bunched chain weight going down directly below the loshok and it seemed off course had the turbulence of petrels engines combined with the deep currents to create a side push frank wondered would it make any difference was it the sub or the detonation sent the stylus crazy a second later the seas surface exploded in an enormous eruption of green bottom ooze sand and pebbles whooshing high into the fog sending a shock wave against the petrel the profusion of dead fish and other marine life that rose to the surface added to everyones surprise as they watched intently for signs of a subs wreckage the skate now notified by radio about what frank had assumed was the sub reported she was steaming toward the oceanographic vessel to assist but at only onethird of full speed in the event of striking unseen wreckage in the fog frank could feel his heart racing in expectation but the only thing identifiable in the dirty slurry so far was the mass of crustaceans and rock cod theres something shouted young cookie calm down tiny snarled theres nothing but no i see it too said malcolm starboard aft me too added jimmy snatching one of the slingshots and one of the baseballsize lumps of shortfuse loshok packs sandra focused her binoculars in the direction the crew were pointing an irregular shape with a metallic appearance could be seen despite the muddied sea that was spreading like a huge blanket in the chop created by the loshoks explosion sandra called the dry lab its a ray she told frank a manta ray a cephalic fin missing relief and disappointment swept through the crew cookie suddenly began throwing up frank hearing him dispatched one of the techs to help the youth but dont let him mope around tell cook i said to go easy on him but to keep him occupied light duties yes sir soon the chaos of sound from the loshoks bang subsided and the petrel having turned about headed back a hundred yards or so sandra doing an excellent job of using the ships bow thrusters to relocate the exact gps position the slab was gone then there was another metallike sheet in the fog it was vertical and from mere inches above the seas surface it suddenly rose to four feet high then six holy sub astern tiny shouted so loudly that third mate sandra on the bridge heard him clearly as did frank in the dry lab intuitively sandra brought the petrel sharply about in a tight uturn the ship heeling hard aport toppling aussie sal and choir against their bunks side boards and bringing the petrel facetoface with the ominouslooking and fogshrouded black sub surfacing a hundred yards off frank quickly organized one of the most primitive and ancient defenses known to man on the stern of his stateoftheart oceanographic vessel grab the six slingshot packs and run up to the bow he hollered to the stern work party but there were only four packs left freeman having grabbed two of the baseballsize lumps and quickly stuffed them into his battle vest with a sharp tug on the bowknotted davit lines holding the zodiac to petrels side the general rapidly played out the line lowering the zodiac a sleepdazed aussie appeared on deck holding his mp whats going get in the boat freeman said were going fishing be careful frank cautioned freeman it might be surrendering its turning petrels bow lookout shouted and everyone including the approaching skate a mile off which sandra had alerted heard the noise it was a tortuous creaking sound of metal against metal the kind aussie and freeman had heard when they faced the russianmade t main battle tanks in the iraqi desert it made the four slingshot crewmen even more nervous through his binoculars the bosun whod momentarily given freeman a hand by passing down the generals gun could now see the source of the nervegrating sound the submarines prop rubbing against its tapered metallic sheath which had collapsed under the pressure wave of the seventypound loshok depth charge where the hells the skate someone shouted another startled by the sputtering then quickly ensuing purr of their zodiacs runabout skates coming the bosun assured the crew she was but on her radar the two blips were so close together the captain couldnt tell which was which and it was too risky to open fire in the fog and noisy confusion the skates heavy machinegun operators however were itching to fire so much so that the captain repeated his earlier order hold your fire following the subs carnage in the strait everyone wanted so badly to get even that blue on blue remained a constant danger one of petrels sidescan technicians ran to the dry labs door no one was there son of he realized they must all be up at the bow though hanging on to the labs roll bar at the time hed forgotten the violent uturn glued as he was to the trace he snatched the pa mike from the wall captain dry lab a bubbling sound from the sub as well as the prop noise could be flooding her tubes maybe answered frank but what should he do he wondered it would be impossible to see a torpedo running at them in the fog anyway the sub was only a hundred yards off now nosetonose with his boat even if the petrel moved left or right the sub could get an angled shot or if she opened up with small arms fire the petrel would be virtually defenseless get the packs ready he told jimmy malcolm and tiny while taking up one of the slingshots himself then he shouted up to the bridge to sandra go full ahead close as you can for us then veer away she signaled with a thumbsup frank asked wheres the bic tiny handed him the cigarette lighter high tech the small orange light that the skates captain now half a mile away saw through his binoculars was not the flicker of tinys bic however but the flame from the protruding from the subs sail like a short stubby stick in the fog its burst ricocheted off petrels forward deck bulkhead like supersonic stones thrown against a steel door one of thes rounds struck malcolm in the back of his neck felling him in a pool of blood that neither jimmy frank or tiny saw the three busy tossing their loshok packs the force of their thrusts reduced by the nerveshattering fire of the heavy machine gun as the trio hit petrels deck they crawled forward tight up against the protection of the capstan as several rounds from the sub struck the spool of anchor chain creating a shower of sparks as petrel heeled hard aport at full speed the wash of petrels prop was now clearly visible to the subs machinegun crew who kept pouring their fire into the big target as it withdrew seeing malcolm and dragging him into the forward lab frank then reached the bridge where he saw a palefaced helmsman the bridge glass a milky spiderweb of bullet holes the sparkling glass fragments crunching under his boot hall was surprised that he hadnt heard the glass being hit wheres sandra he asked chart room answered the helmsman his voice a strangled whisper sandras face was cut badly and bleeding as the bosun and two other crewmen knelt beside her doing their best with tweezers to remove the tiny glass slivers her white blouse and pants were splattered with oil from the compass mounting and the chart of juan de fuca strait was smeared with blood aboard the coast guards skate the sonar operator heard the underwater whoosh of a torpedo launch the skates computer telling him it was running at fifty knots the skate two hundred yards off in the fog was seconds from impact on its present course the captain reacted swiftly ordering a degree turn to starboard away from the unseen line of the torpedo it took him into the path of the second torpedo fired by the sub during the noise of the skates turn the explosion lit up the night in a bonfire of pyrotechnics that tore the stern quarter off the skate the ship was going down its nose sticking up at a fortyfivedegree angle it slipped under in minutes no time for lifeboats the cries of its crew many afire lost in a cacophony of sounds a firecracker string of its own ammunition cooking off in its superheated superstructure its death throes further illuminated by raging fuel oil fires soon all that was left was the burning oil slick silhouetting the frantic two dozen or so survivors trying to extricate themselves from the flaming patches of sea the fires updrafts doing nothing to disperse the heavier sullen fog that had now swallowed up the retreating petrel the crew of the oceanographic ship unarmed and in shock were rallying to help their own wounded an oiler on deck one of those whod helped make the slingshots was suffering from an ugly head wound hemorrhaging to death weve gotta pick up those skate guys someone said we cant answered the bosun were not out of the shit yet subs got dammit its a warship its got everything we slow to pick up survivors well end the same way sides those hydrofoilsll soon be here theyll slow right down said a winch man always do inshore cause of all the logs an crap floating about plus theres so much wreckage in the strait they cant risk speeding hit something with one of those foils at any speed you go a over t quick smart on the petrels bridge blacked out as was the rest of his ship frank hall knew there was only one decision he could make where the hecks freeman the first mate asked softly in trouble replied frank if he doesnt watch that theyll hear his outboard if he gets too close i know said frank which was why freeman at the tiller of the petrels zodiac had cut the outboard hauled it in and joined aussie using paddles to move west of the sub which now seemed strangely still as if like some giant marine predator it was undecided what to do immediately following the destruction of its coast guard prey or was the subs prop so disabled aussie wondered that in an allout run on the surface it could reach only a knot or so the awful noise generated by the prop was so loud that he knew it would serve as a homing beacon for the hydrofoils which would soon be on the subs radar in the eerie silence of the fogbound sea the crescent bays shore five minutes behind them might have been a hundred miles away and the sound of their paddles seemed extraordinarily loud to freeman and aussie perhaps because their sense of hearing initially scrambled by the explosions of the torpedoes was now straining to pick up any sound in the water about them they both heard the faint rasping sound it wasnt the same noise as that of the prop and had it not been for the small but persistent glow from the skates dying fires aussie wouldnt have seen the bulbous baseballsize head of a snorkel tube rising from the sub he stopped paddling and not daring to whisper tapped freemans arm twice the snorkel rising agonizingly above the sub the enemy craft about two oclock to the zodiac was the sub going to dive go on batteries for a while despite the grating prop noise far enough again to lie low and stop all engines given the depth reading he recalled on the petrel freeman knew that it wouldnt be too deep for a swimmer to exit through an escape airlock hatch and replace or putty in a few replacement anechoic tiles skate was gone petrel bloodied and unarmed and given the fog the two hydrofoils might not get to the sub before she dived which it looked like shed do at any second because there was no one on deck freeman was as vain a man as any other but hed never allowed vanity to block efficiency and he knew that his agrade fitness notwithstanding aussie lewis was a younger man with more strength in his arm so he passed the two balls of loshok to aussie and quietly tipped the outboards prop shaft into the water just in case with his mouth against aussies ear he intoned tape one of em around the snorkel they resumed paddling freeman estimating it would take them five to six minutes to reach the sub the snorkel was still inching up rasping the subs skipper obviously preferring to raise it in air rather than waiting till he was submerged where the sound would travel four times as fast to the hydrofoils the problem freeman knew was that it would be difficult if not impossible to maintain position in the current and tape the charge to the rising pipe the current was getting stronger they had maybe ten minutes chapter fortyfive rorkes ability to maneuver the big cigar as encino called their footlong sub had duly impressed the executive officer especially given the level of instability in the class caused by its sail being located farther forward than on the earlier boats of the class though launch site was still minutes away the xo foresaw no problems with the launch encinos loadout of torpedoes and tomahawks following normal procedure contained a number of variants of the dozen cruise missiles in the launch tubes forward of the sail four had single thousandpound bullpup he warheads four were armed with d runwaycratering submunitions warheads and the final four were capped with a doomsday city takeout kiloton nuclear warhead with all presets entered into encinos firecontrol computer console the attack boat rose to a point sixty feet below the surface its speed now down from thirty knots to three rorke had decided to start with the four ds the navigator confirming that the intersection of the coordinates was midway down penghus runway now presumably packed with pla fighters the sound of hydraulics and valves opening as the twelve forward vertical tubes were flooded in the sequence rorke had decided upon were noises that none of the boats officers and men wanted to hear they had no qualms about their part in the new post american policy of talking softly and carrying the biggest stick you could find but flooding then opening the caps or lids on each of the forwardangled twelve vlts violated the submariners counsel of perfection thou shalt stay silent the gurgling and bubbling sounds were worse than most sound shorts or acoustic faults in a boat signaling to any hostile within hundreds or even thousands of miles away where you were and in this case telling them you were about to launch a weapon whether it be an antiship harpoon torpedo or as now the tomahawk cruise missiles up attack scope said rorke it was unlikely there would be any ships nearby and encinos sonar hadnt picked up anything unusual but a visual sweep was needed just in case despite the awesome responsibility he had for launching such tremendous firepower johnny rorke enjoyed the anticipatory moment of looking through the scope he had not danced with either of the boats ladies since the utah he liked the physical sensation of watching the scopes oilsheen column rising to his command the sensation of flipping down the scopes arms gripping their crisscross nonslip handles and his eyes marrying themselves to the scope via the sensuously soft rubber cups that shut out all light in the cic including the luminescent green of the two target trackers computers and the bloodred of the weapons officers screen he moved as one with the scope sweeping smartly through a degree arc and back again the reverse sweep to assure him he hadnt missed anything during his clockwise rotation because of the different azimuth all seemed clear down scope with flight instructions for each missile in the computers rorke initiated what would be a ripple launch the first missile fired would be one of the outermost of the sixtube configuration on the starboard side followed immediately by the corresponding missile of the portside six commence launch said rorke this was for the crews benefit as the countdown the weapons officer had already initiated was an automatic computercontrolled function the crew heard the explosive charge that along with an enormous whoosh of compressed air ejected the cruise missile thrusting it through the thin plastic membrane at the top of its launch tube into the sea from sixty feet below the surface the boat lurched slightly as the pound tomahawk exited the boat seawater immediately rushing into the empty launch tube the tomahawks booster firing underwater twentyfive feet above the sub the missile broaching the seas surface shivered with the tremor of the boosters fiery exhaust the missiles protective wing cover popping off tailfin shrouds also discarded four tailfins extending to steady the tomahawks angle of flight at a thousand feet only seconds after launch point and as another missile left encino the first tomahawks solidfuel booster fell away its job done the turbofan jet taking over stubby wings extended its terrain control matching system helped to guide it the missile flattening out at ninety feet above sea level en route to its target virtually skimming the sea the radar cross section no more than eleven square feet its approach was doubly protected by the encino jamming the pla radars traveling subsonically at plus or minus mph this small radar signature of the tomahawk should be lost in the posttyphoon sea clutter the missile and the eleven other tomahawks following a sixmilliondollar train of explosives that rorkes crew many ardent followers of the old six million dollar man dubbed the six million dollar slamscheduled to reach penghu in approximately twentyfour minutes admiral crowley was bitterly disappointed upon hearing that encino was given the job of missiling penghu why hadnt they given it to him hed played it smart very smart conducting the burial at night in blackout conditions so hed be ready in the event any bizarroterroristkamikaze attack was launched at him in the morning when an enemy would assume the ship would slow for such a burial or didnt washington think mccains battle group was up to it because of the kamikaze hit the padre a good friend of the battle group commander tried to soften the blow god works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform he reminded the admiral is that so crowley retorted churlishly where was he when that kamikaze holed my roof the padre assured the admiral that the almighty had a plan well im damned if i can discern it padre crowley said his tone softening for the sake of friendship if not because of religious belief the rain of cruise missiles on penghu brought shock and awesome devastation the huge billows of copperred smoke rising reeking of burning avgas and atomized fish fertilizer from the once picturesque stonybordered farms the clouds of war obscuring the island clearly visible to satellite reconnaissance the problem was typhoon janes residual tail winds had increased the cep as the pentagon put it in english please eleanor prenty demanded circular error probable maam it means the diameter centering on the target within which there is a fifty percent chance of hitting error probable said eleanor my god youre telling me that they didnt hit penghu no our missiles did hit penghu no question about but not the runway and all the radars no maam i mean thats right youre correct we give me a percentage commander what percent did you hit eighty sixty bout forty to fifty whats the encinos loadout she asked knowing that sometimes the subs carried extra cruise missiles housing them in the torpedo racks the pentagon man didnt know if the twelve tomahawks were the encinos full load of cruise missiles or whether there were some in reserve well find out she told him abruptly yes maam use my phone it was very highly classified information and the pentagon messenger albeit a commander had to have written authority from the chief of naval operations to be given one of americas launch platforms precise loadout eleanor prenty waited impatiently if encino didnt have reserve tomahawks then someone else would have to be tasked to finish what encino had begun and to pulverize the penghu runway before the pla could use it as a base from which clandestine attacks could be launched against taiwan even during an official ceasefire that the secretary of state was hastily trying to broker between beijing and taipei both chinese capitals sticking firmly to their positions that the other one had reopened hostilities the commander from the pentagon had the answer to eleanors question twenty minutes later ssn encinos multiple launch as ordered by the president had exhausted the submarines loadout supply of twelve tomahawks the president didnt hesitate draw up orders he told the chief of naval operations for mccains battle group to take out that runway how about vertical launch from the aegis cruisers asked eleanor mccains pretty badly no the president was adamant its important politically as well as for the navys morale which is the lowest ive ever seen to have mccain do it have the carriers air wing launch the attack standoff weapons if we can take makung out as their forward air base well have a lot more leverage to force beijing to the table makung asked eleanor penghus city where the runway is oh said eleanor yes of course mr president do you think beijings got anything to do with this sub attacking us in the northwest the president had obviously thought a lot about it as he had about the myriad fronts going on in the war clandestine and overt all over the world as the us struggled to keep the upper hand i dont think so eleanor nor do the joint chiefs it seems more like a terrorist group to me trouble is we americans have lets face it a lot of difficulty accepting the fact that a bunch of muslims could develop a weapons platform so quiet so able to pierce our defenses like this midget sub the navys hydrofoils are now finally closing in on finally seemed a bit rich to eleanor admittedly it had felt like months and months dealing with the northwest attack along with everything else but crises always seemed longer at the time in fact it had been much shorter and the navy had done darned well to get the hydrofoils on their way because the new craft had barely finished sea trials problem is the president said we think of muslims we think of iraq iran afghanistan desert and oil the chief executive paused had you ever imagined arabs as submariners no well i knew some russian submariners who were muslim but no not further than that chapter fortysix as freeman and aussie neared the bow of the sub the snorkel pipe stopping then beginning to inch up again its slow ascent no doubt an attempt to keep its rasping to a minimum the two wondered if the subs sonar had picked up the noise of their paddling the fogbound sea was considerably calmer now than when they had shot at the sub much earlier that day or was the subs scope sliding up for a visual check but what was there to see in the fog besides the skates dying firelight aussie glimpsed the petrel her sterns hydraulic arm silhouetted against the oil slicks fire having heard the rasping of the subs snorkel being raised frank hall had no doubt decided to move the oceanographic vessel in quickly to pick up as many skate survivors as possible freeman meanwhile reached for the waterproof matches in his vest and flushed it was his usual physiological reaction upon realizing hed uncharacteristically forgotten a vital detail this time it was the short fuse on each of the fistsized loshok packs hed given aussie which would allow only two seconds no way you could ducttape light the fuse and get clear there was no time to convey his concern to aussie other than by speaking and they were only ten feet from the subs starboard fairing which aussie would have to board to place the charge cut the second packs fuse and tape it to the first the general whispered hoarsely thatll give us more time four seconds aussie thought to tape and run their zodiac bumped gently against the subs side a beam of light struck out from petrels foredeck toward the skates burning oil spill looking quickly for survivors aussie and freeman heard a dull thud then saw a head appear above the subs stubby conning tower followed by a quick order in a language neither aussie nor the general understood then they heard another more excited voice and saw a caliber barrel poking up from the interior of the conning tower and sticking straight out in the direction of the skate the gunner appeared next and then whoever was giving the orders either the subs captain or the officer of the deck good god freeman thought the bastards were going to shoot the coast guard survivors as well as the men on the petrel who were trying to rescue them a long ragged flame spat into the fog from freemans hk the mm rounds chopping into the sub gunners head and into the officers right shoulder but the officer managed to swing the around and squeeze off a loud burst a bullet struck freeman in the chest knocking him out of the zodiac as aussie already on the subs fairing below the conning tower plunged his kbar into the officer the officer grabbed at his throat in a vain effort to stop the pulsing jets of blood that showered aussies face then the officers body crumpled noisily the wooden stock of the falling back with a whack against the subs collar aussie heard a commotion below one more step up the side of the conning tower and he glimpsed the rubycolored glow of the subs small control room the body of the subs gunner slumped awkwardly blocking the hatch seeing a bald head below the dead gunner and arms desperately tugging at the gunners feet trying to clear the hatch aussie fired a burst down the hatch well the mans head exploding then he lit the first fuse and dropped it the reverberation of the loshoks explosion so severe that it momentarily stunned aussie though he was still outside the conning tower and unable to hear anything the charge he realized must have either bounced off the bodystoppered hatch or the open hatch cover itself hed have to heave himself up drop down into the conning tower and clear the body but one glance into the smokechoked hatch the loshok fumes rising up stinging his eyes throat and nose told him another burst was unnecessary what had been the enemys decapitated body or rather what was now an indistinguishable bloody pile had fallen down through the hatch onto the control rooms floor he squeezed another burst off anyway for insurance dropped the second twosecond charge down and slammed the hatch shut this explosion was a muffled whoomp no smoke emerging from the tightly sealed sub except for a white puff rising from the snorkel a new pope he shouted his outburst a mixture of adrenaline and anger wondering if the general was still alive and sure that no one in the midget sub had survived an explosion like that he knew would create a dense and toxic mix even in a fullsized attack boat the pinhead of light automatically activated by the saltwater showed aussie where the general dead or alive was drifting about twenty or thirty feet off the subs starboard bow not far from the zodiac aussie slung his hk tightly to his back discarded his boots and dived in swimming with all his strength to the zodiac he hauled himself aboard pushed the outboards starter and hungry for air gasped as he steered the zodiac toward freeman cutting the motor almost as soon as hed started it fire a goddamn flare the general was shouting his voice imperious dont you know anything in fact freemans bonhomie in the freezing water helped the general to tolerate the painful bruising that was spreading across his chest the round from the subs mg not a deadon hit but a powerful angled shot all the same and one that had shredded all but the last two of the kevlars sandwiched layers the petrel saw the flare as did the two closing hydrofoils one of which approached the zodiac with a suspicion underscored by an array of weaponry that was as impressive as it was late well at least they can help petrel pick up those poor bastards from skate aussie told freeman who was now hurting badly the general was not given to hyperbole regarding his enemies but what occurred next he would describe as simply astonishing from the mini vesuvius that was the submarines conning tower there emerged three ghostly figures in the flare lights their clothing steaming with white smoke that clung to them like dry ice their faces hidden by maniacallooking goggles and the snouts of gas masks son of a bitch shouted tiny thunderstruck pricks are still alive two of them were manning the everyone inside shouted hall from petrels bridge as aussie and freeman were being helped aboard secure all hatches lights out secure all hatches repeated frank and stay inside with that he pushed petrels full ahead button shouting into the down pipe to the engine room everything youve got chief the crew bodies involuntarily trembling with the thunderous reverberations had never felt anything like it frank snatched up the bridges microphone stand by to ram shit it was cookie in the blackedout galley it suddenly dawned on him what hall intended the hydrofoils should the bosuns attempt to explain to young cookie how hydrofoils were like jet boats on water very fast in clear weather but too delicate for this was cut short by a firecracker noise forward the sound of petrels already multipunctured bridge glass collapsing in a resounding crash now all firing from the hydrofoils ceased the petrel at fifteen knots having to cross their lines of fire the footlong sub and its conning tower were rendered momentarily visible with each burst of the only one man remaining at the gun frank was steering by the flashes of the he wasnt watching the sub through the foginhaling hole that had been petrels bridge but by lying on his back guided by the image of thes spitting flame in the mirror from sandras compact he held it up for several seconds at a time and could alter his course with a tap on the sensitouch joystick hold on he shouted over the pa but with the pas wiring among other things now severed in the hail of the subs machinegun fire no one heard him beyond the bridge the shock of the petrel hitting the sub aft of the conning tower was so severe that it flung several crew members across the mess the bosuns cheek split against the bulkhead stiffener and young cookie literally tore the big electric motor off its mount as a flying avalanche of broken crockery and foodstuffs injured him and five other crewmen amid an outburst of profanities and alarm so loud hall heard them coming up through the stairwell the petrels bow was so high now after smashing into the subs conning tower that the broken plates and other debris began sliding back but just as quickly everything began to subside petrels forward half coming down as it slid off the subs deck as hall leaped up running to the bridges starboard wing he saw that the subs aft was severely creased cracks appearing heard the machine gunner and dropped to the deck aussie racing along the petrels port side came out firing on its forward deck not taking his finger off the trigger killing the begoggled and blacksnouted gunner before the terrorist could swing the from frank on the upper starboard side to him then in place of the unrelenting gunfire there was relative calm but not silence as the oceanographic crew though hesitant at first now poured out on the stern to watch the death throes of the submarine in petrels deck lights which were now back on they could see water cascading into the deep threefootwide gash aft of the sail the subs nose rising in a strangely majestic way the excited voices of the petrel crew and the faint cheers of the hydrofoil crews ceased momentarily for no matter how evil its mandriven intent the boat itself now seemed possessed of a dignity in death its bow so high in the air that it momentarily rose above the level of petrels foredeck sent several men racing back toward petrels winches frightened by the awefilled ascent of the subs bow for the first time a flag was glimpsed on its forward staff which could only have been placed there by one of the three gasmasked ghosts whod emerged earlier from the loshoks toxified air once the sub slipping from view in a hissing steam of burst pipes and shattered machinery slid out of view the cheers on hold during her final moments erupted into the dank dark air a hydrofoil sapper unit already on their way to destroy the cave and its antechambers we can now report began one of marte prices colleagues in atlanta that this unprecedented assault on americas navy is finally over the announcer a hollywood face in his early thirties but with a marked british accent turned to his coanchor and its fitting joanne that it was the navys hydrofoils that finished the job bullshit came a chorus of outraged petrel crewmen sandra in temporary relief from the morphine shot the second mate had given her shook her head slowly in disgust it was freemans team whod done it first slowing and then damaging it further and finally aussie lewis disabling it so it couldnt escape enabling the petrel to finish it off the hydrofoils were late to the show its fitting indeed ryan replied the fairhaired coanchor with the to die for looks i know all america and our allies in this ongoing war against terrorism will heave a great sigh of relief and extend their gratitude to the us navy best in the world said the anchor shuffling his papers with an air of efficiency and confidence de rigueur for those who wanted to get ahead even if as freeman sourly observed they dont know what the hell theyre talking about sure as hell dont it was you guys who did it commented tiny i dunno first reports are always cocked up hydrofoil guys are taking the damn credit voiced jimmy no said freeman not their fault its nighttime no one can see a damn thing probably talked to a reporter on the radio phone static all over hydrofoil guy says the subs sunk rammed by petrel reporter cant hear it probably thinks what he heard was petrolprobably thinks the sub was afire and rammed line cuts out and all hes heard is that the subs sunk every war ive been in youre right son first reports are always cocked up itll get straightened out said the first mate though the rush of relief flooding over them was a wellknown experience for the team and the veterans of the iraqi wars among petrels crew for most the surge of success exaggerating their own part in getting the sub bordered on hysteria it was infused in part by the real and present danger they had faced on board what had been an essentially defenseless ship while being machinegunned the death of one of their number and the condition of sandra would dampen their celebratory remarks later on but right now the sudden turn of fate from being victims to victors was too powerful for them to moderate their behavior cookie was all but unmanageable in his adolescent fervor raining insults down at the fogshrouded depths where the broken sub now lay generals a bit sullen the cook told aussie while lighting up a cigarette uhhuh aussie replied noncommittally criticism of freeman by those in his own team was one thing but cook wasnt in the team how could he be expected to understand the present reserve of a man generally known for his garrulousness and forthrightness aussie thought a man who had become a legend because at crucial times he had neither behaved nor thought like other men hes probably exhausted added the bosun sensing lewiss quiet disapproval guess we all are said aussie but in truth he had also been struck by freemans increasingly down mood was it churlishness that he douglas freeman would not reap the glory that was the fuel of his insatiable ego another patton or macarthur walking past the general now a solitary figure in the penumbra of the deck lights aussie said lightheartedly i lost a good pair of boots back there the general leaning on the gunwale his focus somewhere in the fog didnt respond historyll know general have you ever seen such fanaticism the general asked aussie that machine gunner those three coming up out of that hellhole after youd blasted them silly aussie thought back a string of desperate firefights crowding his memory maybe once he said funny thing is it was a republican guard during that punchup we had round hadiya freeman stood up and looked across at aussie to hate america that much thats what were up against aussie aussie nodded formidable thats the word well general weve won this round yes said freeman right thumb and forefinger massaging his forehead theres something he paused something bothering me he stopped massaging himself and arms akimbo took a deep breath know what i mean a feeling ive missed something well find out more when we bring that sucker up said aussie go through it might find out who did it chinese or towel heads freeman unexpectedly laughed you want to win your bet before aussie could answer freeman added a few asians so far only a couple of chinese aussie was glad to see the general loosening up and promised himself as soon as they got ashore at port angeles hed try to contact marte price set her straight about just what did happen make sure freeman got his full measure of recognition well the team too he was encouraged to do it because after his chat with the general he realized that what the cook and no doubt others had interpreted as a sullen exhibition of petty ego was in fact a leaders concern the general famous for attention to minutiae was bothered by something like a detail in a persistent dream that takes flight the moment you wake yet remains in the background of your mind all day chapter fortyseven admiral crowley had just had his second and last coffee of the day any more and he knew hed feel on edge especially after the kamikaze attack which despite the absence of the kind of proof that would stand up in a court of law everyone on the carrier believed was instigated by the communist chinese air force to cow or at least slow the carrier from advancing further into the taiwan strait and effectively refereeing the twochina incident as beijing was calling the twochina war now crowleys voice was at once serious and upbeat as he addressed mccains air wing gentlemen we all know just how badly the navys been hit at home there isnt a man or woman on the boat who hasnt known or lost someone during the rampage of that subs attacks in the strait of juan de fuca a lot of folks on the other vessels in our battle group have also lost loved ones but im here to tell you that initial reports of the subs demise have been confirmed there was whooping and clapping throughout the aviators ready rooms and the other departments in the boat admiral jensen comsubpac group has verified that two of his hydrofoil fast patrol boats witnessed the kill who were they chipper armstrong asked his squadron intel officer the terrorists no verification on that commander now gentlemen i have a second announcement everyone whod done at least one tour with crowley knew that the big news always came last as you know one of our ssns missiled penghu satellite bdas confirm wind deflection courtesy of typhoon jane extended the missiles cep some pla planes were destroyed but not i repeat notthe runway least not enough to prevent quick repair the president has therefore asked if we can do the job before the pla can land aircraft resupply there was some braggadocio but others were silent there was that big hole in their roof any flier has the right to pass this one up without prejudice to his service record the admiral waited for reports from all the ready rooms listening to him all pilots and aircrew volunteered to go very well gentlemen its time kick the tires and light the fires resounding cheers were heard throughout the carrier and in minutes unseen even by some high in primary flight control scores of invisible colored jackets flooded the deck forward of the carriers island and the kamikazes bomb crater the crater having rendered catapults three and four on the carriers aft port side inoperable was now roped off with a sixman line stationed in front of it to yell at any of the deck personnel who might back up and impede maneuvering aircraft once launch operations got under way elevator starboard midships forward of the island clunked and emitted its deep hum as it descended yet again to the hangar deck to reload high up in vultures row the salty sea wind chilling their faces two offduty sailors a young barber from ohio and a young woman angela a purplejacketed refueler from arkansas held hands in the darkness saying nothing their rapt attention had been captured by the wondrously unique ballet of soft yellow flashlights far below them strobing through the sea spray in a strangely hypnotic dance of war the scores of deck personnel holding the flashlights were all but invisible the only thing that approached it in angelas memory was a performance by the black theater of prague that she had seen as a schoolgirl the players invisible only things moving on the pitchblack stage as if by magic the soft yellow bulbs of the flashlights were conveying the same eerie yet comforting display of connectedness and separation as if countless glowworms were coming together coming apart as the song goes joining separating and rejoining as the foreign object debris walkdown continued only personnel on the starboard end of the inspection line coming into full view as they passed through the apron of subdued orange light at the base of the island isnt it beautiful angela asked her beau despite the cranials they were wearing to protect them from the braindulling crescendo that would soon break loose below the young barber heard her hed heard every word shed said from the moment theyd first met on the boat yes he replied it is like you she elbowed him playfully their hands still locked together her grip tightening as the foreign object walkdown ended and the colored shirts went to work kicking the tires and lighting the fires then fierce purplewhite jet exhausts pierced the night the engines feral screams shattering any remaining world of glowworms the afterburners momentarily illuminating the colored jackets whose earlier gentler ballet was now a rougher thing altogether yet within what at first seemed a chaos of disorganized crew running kneeling and signaling pilots with lighted wands there was an organization so intricate and fast that it would make the busiest civil airport appear indolent the carriers night launch all the more impressive given that only catapults one and two were operational angela glimpsed a plane handler wanding the first striker chipper armstrongs super hornet into position for an instant the ambient light silhouetted eagle evans in the hornets backseat as the catapults tow bar was lowered into the shuttle in position to pull the fighter along the deck with the nose wheel housings holdback rod acting like the reins on a caged stallion the turbofans could now reach full power before release the shuttles pull in concert with the planes own thrust would catapult the plane off the deck providing all went well the night launch and recovery the ultimate test of an aviators skill hunkered down in the cat control pod set almost flush into the deck the yellowshirted shooter or catapult officer initiated the flow of superwet nonradioactive steam provided by a secondary loop off the carriers reactor plant the shooter double and then triplechecked the combined deckandship speed in regulating the steam pressure flow too little pressure and the fighterbomber unable to attain takeoff would be pushed into the sea too much and the aircrafts nose wheel would be torn asunder chipper armstrong all preflight checks completed redribbontagged ordnance pins out raised his arms high as if surrendering but in fact showing the shooter that his hands were nowhere near the controls the shooter seeing that the green shirts had completed the final checks gave the okay to armstrong who selected afterburner for the hornets twin turbofans and snapped off a salute the shooter pushed the button and the hornet rushed forward armstrongs and evanss bodies slammed back under the g force the plane hurtling down the deck speeding from zero to miles per hour in two seconds evans experienced an involuntary erection his eyes rammed back hard into their sockets and then the plane was aloft chipper taking over the controls as they banked rio evans glanced back at the rapidly shrinking deck seeing an f tomcat one of the four fighters assigned to ride shotgun for the hawkeye moving into position its toysized launch crew swarming around their charge if all went well the f would be off the deck in under three minutes longer than usual because of the extra maneuvering required forward of the crater despite one sailor in the craters warning line being knocked down by the combination of crosswind and jet blast freakishly angling off the catapults blast shield all went well mccains squadrons assembled upstairs for a standoff attack on penghu to finish what johnny rorke and encinos crew had begun on encino neither the officers nor men knew anything about the instructions given to crowley and his crew now they received orders to turn about and head for home the submersed bluecrewed sixmonth patrol ending upon return to bangor through the juan de fuca choke point the subs gold crew would take over after food lockers and vertical launch tubes were restocked mccains sixteen planes eight super hornets four ae intruders and four tomcats selected for the mission against the

were under strict instructions namely for the benefit of the nuggets the rookie aviators that the slams must be careful of fratricide by which they meant the destruction of a slam by either the explosion or debris of the missile fired just ahead of it impacting the rippled fire of tomahawks from johnny rorkes encino had prevented too fast a rain as missile instructors often stressed because of the time between each launch chipper was scheduled to be first to push the button the other slams to be fired at fifteensecond intervals the hit parades launch points well beyond the range of anything plas airtoair missile batteries might have hurriedly put into place on penghu it would be hit and run mccains planes returning to the safety of the carrier battle groups protective screen for whom there would never again be a bizarro incident any bogeys or friendly marked plane approaching the cvbg would be assumed hostiles and unless proved otherwise by radiorecognized friend or foe code they would be shot down weapons free authority was confirmed by chipper armstrongs six range known homing antiradar missiles fired by tomcats getting close in at ten miles low in the protective sea clutter at ten miles the missiles homed in on either sidelobe or more direct back radiation to take out whatever early warning radars the pla might have managed to erect on the island although these halfdozen eighthundredpound missiles streaking through the now typhoonswept sky at mach were burning lowsmoke solid propellant their vapor trails two of them crisscrossing were plainly visible to the crews of mccain the two aegis cruisers and the battle groups destroyers and frigates only the cvbgs forward and rear subs were unable to witness the harm attack the kind of antiradar onslaught that destroyed saddam husseins early warning network in april any concern mothers electronics crew might have had about an unintended crisscross of two harms quickly evaporated as all six antiradar missiles struck their respective targets the thousands of tiny steel cubes in their warheads swarming the radars sensitive antennae penghu now electronically blind had no effective defense against the ensuing onslaught of sixteen slams penghus runway so badly pitted by the slams cratering sub munitions that on satpix it looked like a moonscape there was collateral damage but as with the cias post attitude aboard mccain there was before iraq and after iraq after the civilian shields saddam had used to smother targets which had cost so many american men and women their lives the phrase collateral damage no longer evoked undue alarm in the administration similarly there had been a hardening of hearts among the australian british american and polish soldiers of the coalition and deep suspicions of white flags chapter fortyeight resting in petrels dry lab lazily watching the fog clear as the ship slowly limped back toward port angeles her bow and bow thrusters in critical shape aussie sal and choir were struck by the generals refusal to feel relieved even though marte price following up on the initial and incorrect cnn report had made it abundantly clear that it was not the hydrofoils who were instrumental in the terrorist subs destruction but freemans brave heroic team and petrels gutsy captain and crew freeman was still frowning as he walked about the ship unable to relax so what if some folks still believe the first news reports and havent heard martes followup mused sal the general knows what went down yeah joined in choir therell be a white house reception medals galore thats what itll be ladscept for aussie here and his bigs bigs said aussie who was as familiar as his comrades with most military acronyms what in hell is bigs aussies big grenade screwup you little welsh squirt aussie said i ought to bash your head in sal chortled you too you brooklyn bastard said aussie i incapacitated the damn thing it couldnt move aussie saw freeman passing by the lab doorway as he headed along the passageway out to the deck hoping to bring him out of his mood aussie called out isnt that right general freeman paused the frown creasing his forehead so severely that aussie felt like saying as his mother used to when he grimaced sourly over homework assignments if you dont get rid of that scowl youll stay that way young aussie used to frequently check himself in the mirror whats that asked the general stopping but so preoccupied that he hadnt heard i was just telling these two nohopers here that it was me who stopped the sub long enough to yes yes freeman said disappearing from the doorway as he strode away aussie waited several seconds then looked at sal and choir what a friggin rain face never seen im so down sal put his finger to his lips and jerked his thumb toward the stern deck where having turned sharply on reaching the deck freeman had bent down pulling back the blanket from the terrorist with the badly bruised neck once again he irritably threw the blanket back over the mans face stood up and walked slowly away whats with him said sal aussie shrugged dont think he knows maybe said choir laughing and quoting an old detergent jingle he doesnt like ring around the collar theres definitely a bee in his bonnet began choir then stopped freeman was standing at the corridor doorway again having reentered the ships passageway directly from the aframe out of view of those in the dry lab its not a bee said the general its a goddamn wasp and i dont know where the hell its coming from with that he moved off so asked choir wheres his wasp coming from my hearties neither sal nor aussie knew the question was finally answered at precisely pm a mile west of port angeles when the petrel in thinning but still persistent fog received the news as did the rest of the world that the uss harold ward a fiberglasskeeled minesweeper of tons had just sunk between cape flattery and vancouver island a coast guard patrol boat was sighted in the area but its doubtful if it was able to rescue any of the survivors as the minesweeper sank so quickly that suffering jesus exclaimed freeman in that serendipitous confluence of forces where unconnected links are finally connected the general had it choirs offhand joke about ring around the collar and the generals obsession about the bruise ring about the collar or neck of the terrorist on deck came together in the shock of yet another ship going down frank hall told freeman it would take another hour at least at petrels present crawl of one of two knots until they reached port angeles frank said the general his eyes alive with urgency for gods sake let me have the zodiac general i had no intention of refusing it you and the boys take it but the news guy said that that minesweeper had sunknothing about an explosion medias so hot to trot these days theyre automatically assuming its been torpedoed or something ships do sink for a host of other its been torpedoed frank said the general theres another goddamn sub dont you see thats why there were so many goddamn sinkings in a few days it was a goddamn duo at work then where the hells it come from asked frank i mean you darkstars gone over the whole coast i dont know frank thats why i need the zodiac frank let freeman have the zodiac aussie meanwhile cursing the fact that there were no boots on the petrel to replace the pair hed lost on the sub after diving off to help the general he ended up borrowing a pair of young cookies runners move it aussie shouted freeman already in the zodiac as jimmy and the bosun lowered it from the davit one of the sidescan technicians gave freeman a sonar tracking beeper hed requested it was used on occasion by the technicians to test their hydrophones in the lab bring combat packs freeman called out hes keen said jimmy watching the general using the zodiacs pike to keep the inflatable from crashing into the side as the petrel engaged a strong offshore current he lives on adrenaline replied the bosun his muscles stiffened from the petrels last tensionfilled twentyfour hours i want a massage so do i said aussie lacing up the runners and pulling on his gloves he threw over a line down then so he sal and choir could rappel into the zodiac its outboard already spitting coughing then roaring to life the general checking the gas level full inquired aussie were only going into port angeles said the general well hell couldnt we have waited till petrel no now listen to me aussie go get the first mate tell him i want him to get some syringes from the ships first aid kit and take a blood sample from each of those damn terrorists dna samples said aussie right replied the general well take them with us we might be able to id them through interpol you think so said aussie dubiously well its worth a try said the general adding tongueincheek might help you win your bet aussie grinned theyre not all chinese im not that stupid go on said the general hurry up tell him to get those samples fast and put em in a cooler i want to be off this tub in ten minutes while the zodiac bow up skimmed the gray water through varying densities of fog freemans brain was racing his chain of connected memories now complete his penchant for detail at the fore his mental files rapidly flipping back to the café the waiters dirty fingernails and the angry ring of irritated flesh around the throat and wrists taking him back to remembrances of his long days and nights in vietnam especially in the south where as he was now reminding aussie the viet cong having gotten dangerously close to saigon right under the noses of the americans and their own fellow south vietnamese had executed one of the greatest military maneuvers of all time cu he began then stopped swerving the boat heeding sals shouted warning that there was a deadhead in front of them one of the many floating logs that were always breaking loose from the huge timber rafts hauled across the strait or the fallout from stormuprooted trees along the coast cu chi the general told aussie as the zodiac straightened out on its fast run into the harbor gotcha aussie shouted above the outboard the engine markedly noisier than when he and the general had used it to approach the sub this merc needs a tuneup he told the general freeman took no notice telling aussie instead that it would be his job to drive the humvee that hed told hall to book ahead by radio hope its there shouted aussie everyones probably left town by now itll be there the general assured him though aussie was certain freeman had no way of being that sure sal the general called out ive been thinking soon as we hit the beach you call fort lewis tell brentwood to grab a huey and get his ass up here tell him well meet him at laurel and railroad you want him to bring that bullpup hell no better his sidearm roger theres the humvee said freeman slowing the zodiac to twenty knots well in excess of harbor approach regulations a purse seiner loomed ahead in the fog one of its crew giving them a frantic slow down signal sea rage quipped aussie waving at the purse seiner the mans shouting eliciting a full stiffarm italian response from salvini the humvee driver was waiting for them general freeman he asked unsure of just who was whom since none of the four special forces team wore any insignia or rank but it was freeman who had the leader look thats me he told the driver sir a captain brentwood is waiting at guess he got your message cut in aussie good answered freeman without breaking his stride turning to sal dont worry about making that call brentwoods here sal looked about the fogwreathed beach where in town you dork said aussie well least he could do was bring us an ale put in choir son freeman told the humvee driver you can wait here take a little unofficial furlough or head back to fort lewis the driver was nonplused not knowing whether to be grateful or insulted at not being needed ah yes sir fine freeman sensed his disappointment id love to have you along fort lewis tells me youre a real andretti the general smacked him affectionately on the shoulder maybe next time ah yes general as the four specfor warriors piled into the humvee the egalitarian aussie commented pompously he didnt know who andretti was who is he asked sal aussie pushed the starter button youre jerkin me off no said sal who was andretti race driver said aussie yeah said sal mario i know youre gonna get it brooklyn right up the ass promises responded sal go to the hospital after we pick up brentwood freeman cut in abruptly his tone signaling an end to sal and aussies banter i want you people on your toes if im right about the minesweeper this is going to be dicey in the back sal glanced at choir whenever the general said you people it was a warning that the mission could be extraordinarily tough the problem for choir was that he thought the general was getting ahead of himself so he made a side wager with sal that the minesweeper hadnt been sunk by a hostile the onetime medal of honor recipient looked even thinner than when aussie and freeman had last seen him on the firing range he was standing at the deserted junction of laurel and railroad in full combat gear and even with its bulk looked as if hed lost weight the sidearm on his right hip aussie noticed was holstered back to front so that his stillfunctioning left hand could crossdraw it if necessary why on earth had the general asked him to come along he wondered brentwood had to use his left hand to get aboard the humvee his right arm still a stiff lshape its hand a perennially bunched fist choir asked him anxiously what happened to that minesweeper david you hear anything it sank he knows that you dodo aussie told brentwood but howd it sink dont know said david who then asked freeman where we going general hospital first when they got there freeman asked aussie to grab the five terrorist samples obviously in a hurry he strode ahead to the front desk to arrange for immediate testing of the samples aussie came in a minute later looking concerned its all arranged freeman told him dr ramon here will do it for us soon as he can the doctor nodded to aussie who exchanged greetings returning to the humvee aussie in trepidation told the general petrels mate has screwed up he only took four samples the general frowned didnt you check em i thought there were but you know sir we were in such a damn hurry not good enough aussie back at the humvee the general was all business listen up were going to the eastwest café well be there in five minutes therell be no time for dessert so heres the drill freeman was wrong it took them eleven minutes to reach the café because of the traffic lights in the town not that many people were out and about most of the refugees hadnt returned yet as aussie waited on the secondtolast red fingers tapping impatiently on the humvees wheel david brentwood asked him do you mind not doing that doing what drumming your fingers he said causing sal and choir to look straight ahead and not risk a whats eating him glance then the general said dont censure me boys i wouldnt do this if i didnt think it was necessary their silence told freeman that he was the only one in the team convinced there was a second sub in the choke point the light turned green chapter fortynine shock and awe gentlemen freeman told them as the humvee dropped choir off in the alley behind the eastwest café aussie then made a sharp turn to bring the wide stocky nononsense vehicle to a pronounced stop in front of the café freeman armed only with his hk mm sidearm strode in aussie immediately behind him hk at the ready he was followed by brentwood then sal who with his shotgun turned about stood guard at the door about a dozen diners including some with young children one in a high chair looked up startled everyone had stopped eating they were obviously refugees returning to the town hungry and exhausted at first they had been reassured by the sight of the special forces team but then were suddenly terrified by freemans thunderous order everyone out now leave your cell phones on the table write down the number if you lie well backtrack through the phone company and youll be in violation of the emergency war powers act move only one elderly man with stubby beard and no teeth refused to leave his steaming wonton soup im too old to be frightened of guys who he had to finish his sentence outside sal having taken a firm grip of the mans worn lumberjack collar and literally dragging him out the old mans hands flailing spittlesprayed obscenities filling the air be safer out here buddy sal told him and sal was telling the truth for when salvini reentered the restaurant he heard a highpitched oriental voice in the kitchen beyond the string bead curtain screaming to someone back of the kitchen cor cor good idea said aussie evenly she the same waitress as before freeman asked brentwood yes confirmed brentwood aussie checked two side rooms without taking his eyes off the vietnamese woman who was yelling beyond the curtain he was struck by the fact that though she was clearly frightened she wasnt cowed there was fight in her eyes what are you afraid of maam asked the general were americans not terrorists soldiers she said contemptuously the restaurants back door about six feet beyond the kitchen at the end of a passageway cluttered with piled boxes of noodles burst open it was choir pushing one of the waiters ahead of him aussie immediately relieving the waiter of the cell phone he was in the process of using over here ordered freeman standing in the kitchen the young woman glaring at him from the kitchens chopping block the man looked more frightened than the woman who had obviously been the object of dispute between the two waiters freeman had seen when he and brentwood had been in the café among all the other specfor training courses one had been about quickly ascertaining who the alpha male was in any hostagetaking situation freeman though a stickler for multilayered training had always been skeptical of the course a tenyearold kid can tell you in two seconds whos the boss in a room he used to say here the woman was clearly the alpha aussie heard a noise directly above looked up and saw a trapdoor opening no please shouted the man my mother jesus christ said aussie a nanosecond away from wasting her the old woman said something in vietnamese and withdrew no pickup till after six i think joked aussie no one laughed but his attempt clearly infused the man with more terror of the unpredictable the young woman was retreating farther back almost touching the wallsuspended array of ladles noodle strainers and other utensils no knives freeman noticed they were to her left in a wooden rack near a kitchen stool and corner chopping block the specfor team had been in the restaurant for less than two minutes a fast entrance a quick push to see who was whom and to clear out those freeman had decided were innocent bystanders now he strode up to the waiter and told him to show his wrists the irritated skin rash had almost vanished freeman reached up to the mans collar stay still the bruised ring or more accurately half ring around the waiters throat was not nearly as dark as when the general had seen it when he and brentwood had eaten in the café freeman turned from the waiter and in a move whose speed and violence surprised even aussie advanced on the woman who seemed to shrink in size beneath him he grabbed her by her left ear and wrenched her toward him she gasped in pain but nothing more her eyes glinting with hatred and determination he pulled her out from the wall of appliances don dont hurt her please sir implored the waiter brentwoods eyes avoided the scene focusing on the bubbling vat of fat by the chopping block i wont hurt her bellowed the general his eyes maniacal ill kill the bitch if you dont take me to the tunnels the waiters pale face turned gray and he tried to speak but couldnt then ill kill granny upstairs shouted freeman his voice had taken over the café like a storm you bastards think i dont know whats going on eh eh those collar marks the ones on your wrists your filthy damn fingernails your ring around the collar buddy comes from hauling your buddies out of caveins in the tunnels only way you could get in and out in cu chi only way you can get a tunneler out in a cavein two ropes from your wrists to his feet gotta get im out before he suffocates then you put the pull collar round your neck lie down roll over and haul him out or maybe it wasnt your buddies eh maybe a torpedo warhead you were hauling down to the cave with all your other supplies eh thats why we didnt get any infrared spots on the ground you terrorist bastards were all underground like goddamn rats the man had said nothing but the rest of the team except for sal at the front door looked at one another with something akin to awe they realized they were witnessing the stuff of the freeman legend aussie alone however knew that the generals shock was not over with well freeman thundered you going to tell me the waiter caught the womans eye as did aussie her message was clear stand your ground dont tell them the waiter however probably habituated by a lifetime of running slavishly from the exhausting kitchen through the beaded curtain to serve the class to which he aspired and despised was torn between reality and hope his mind obviously a tumult of indecision all right bellowed freeman drawing his sidearm tell me he was holding her at pointblank range the waiter was trembling but shook his head the shot threw the woman back with such violence that her head slammed into hanging utensils her shout of pain startling sal who quickly looked around from the front door the crash of utensils like cymbals he could smell the acrid cordite wafting through the beaded curtain brentwood and choir their previous awe now overcome by shock stood literally openmouthed at what the general had done aussie was for once speechless seeing the woman writhing on the floor as freeman grabbed her by her bullettorn blouse now covered in blood and hauled her roughly into a sitting position against the wall all right freeman yelled at aussie bring down that old bitch ill shoot her too aussie gave the waiter an i dont like it but what can i do mate glance footing the chopping block stool across the floor below the trapdoor hurry up ordered freeman bring her down no no the waiter said his voice cracking i show you right said freeman turning to choir choir over here choir didnt move but he began goddammit freeman roared dont but me were a team work as a team get that bitchs body out of here give her to the cops then grab the old lady and stay in touch with me the general looked across at aussie whod been about to assist the woman with his first aid kit leave her alone barked the general she dies she dies give choir this jokers cell phone aussie wordlessly passed the phone hed taken from the waiter to the silent welshman who was obviously upset tell him your number the general ordered the waiter who drymouthed and trembling was barely able to speak try calling the number from the other phones freeman ordered indicating the halfdozen or so cell phones that had been left as per his orders on the cafés hastily vacated tables within a minute the team all had working phones give me the one with the best battery freeman told the others his schoolyard bullys tone not going over well with david brentwood it wasnt an aspect of freeman hed seen before while choir carried the bloodied painwracked woman outside the others began to climb aboard the humvee then they heard a police cruisers siren and saw its flashers approaching a group of the previously ejected diners huddled across the street like homeless waifs waiting anxiously to see what the police did about what one man in the group angrily and correctly described as the grossest violation of civil liberties hed ever seen in america freeman holstered his sidearm as the other four helped choir to carry the wounded woman toward the police cruiser spray and washs not gonna get that out said a callow adolescent who with some other teenagers had been drawn by the gunshot and was now pointing at the blood on her blouse hey a portly sheriff called out as he lumbered out of the cruiser his partner grabbing the first aid box you kids move along what happened wally asked the teenaged boy in an overly familiar tone the sheriffs eyes narrowed dont you sass me george daley you get on home from what i hear your grades need all the help they can get there was a burst of laughter from the gaggle of young girls in the group you tell im sheriff someone shouted and george daley sullenly moved off the general and sheriff conferred hastily by the cruiser the sheriff hitching his belt several times and nodding sal hearing him say you betcha and wish we had more time to get enough guys up here to i figure the general told him that those bastardsll be reloading with torpedoes and restocking after sinking that minesweeper the sheriff knew the general was right and agreed that the first thing the specfor team had to do was get to the tunnel that the waiter and others had been using to service the second sub second they were to find the tunnel used to service the sub that had already sunk to make sure both tunnels could never be used again freeman called out to salvini you go get grandma frisk her put her in a cab and catch up with us the cab driver can wait here and sal cuff her sal merely nodded seeing sals resentment a resentment apparently shared by the rest of the team freeman pushed the waiter roughly aside salvini you hear me you have a problem with my orders no sir said sal helping the waiter up the prisoner looking up pleadingly at sal his eyes betraying some sympathy for these four american soldiers who he saw had to serve under such a brutal commander one as tough as li kuan even though the smaller kuan bore no physical resemblance to the big american but li kuan had the same hard eyes as this man whom the sheriff had called general freeman the waiter understood english well enough to realize the full intent of the ruthless generals orders that his aged mother contemptuously referred to by the american as the old bitch would be forced to follow the generals humvee in the cab so that if her son balked at revealing the tunnels entrance they would kill her no no he wouldnt kill her if she were dead then what would he bargain with no the waiter concluded this crazed general would do what li kuan would do in such a situation what hed done to the american girl in suzhou whod overheard the plans between beijing and kazakhstan that beijing would supply the experienced vietnamese and chinese tunnelers for the muslim terrorists continuing holy war against america and li kuan would arrange the logistical support via sleepers in and around the olympic peninsula this supply tunnel complex not nearly as elaborate as the giant twohundredmile underground complex at cu chi in the sixties would be ingenious nevertheless no the waiter told himself one had to face reality this american general whod shown not the slightest hesitation in shooting his beloved myduyen whom the whites called sally would not kill his mother outright he would torture her as li kuan had tortured the young american girl in suzhou to find out what she knew before hed killed her the waiter now in the passenger seat of the humvee wanted to bury his head in his hands but the tight nylon strip binding his hands behind his back prevented him from doing so freeman was driving choir aussie and brentwood in the back once the fog lifts well call in cavalry troops soon as we locate the position freeman told them no one responded aussie wanted to but held his tongue knowing their silence denoted disapproval freeman elbowed the waiter in the side how many people you reckon you and your sub buddies have killed mao the waiter stared sullenly through the fog that was rushing toward them in huge gray billows how many so far freeman asked his prisoner would you say around ten thousand in an undeclared war world is at war said the waiter you americans invaded iraqis oh said freeman swinging the humvee around a pothole but not fast enough jolting choir out of his nap you think we didnt give those towel heads enough warning six months not long enough whos in charge of this operation mao i dont know who gave you orders in port angeles email li kuans email or from bin ladens leftovers who i dont know you serve on the sub mao or you strictly a tunneler tunnel same tunnel for both subs or did they have to take their turn mao or did each sub have its own garage i dont know this aha said freeman accelerating you just know about the tunnel youre taking us to right you bring the supplies what in a van and just drop them off yes you lying bastard said freeman braking hard as he swerved to miss a fallen branch barely visible in the fog youre a hauler look at your throat mao youre a goddamn hauler of everything from rice to outboards to ammunition to kill americans now aussie choir and brentwood were more attentive what theyd seen as the generals overtheline behavior in the eastwest café was now temporarily mitigated by their outrage at the horrendous loss of life to say nothing of the loss in ships caused by the midget submarine still the four specfor warriors unlike freeman were not convinced there was a second sub believing that the minesweeper if it hadnt gone down from natural causes had most probably been destroyed by a mine the generals questioning of mao was reminding them however just how horrific the terrorist submarine attacks had been and if the general was right about a second sub there would be more to come the fog lifted with the rapidity of a stage curtain what had been a gray damp world along eerily deserted highway as the humvee sped west toward the inland point five miles south of the strait of juan de fuca that marked the big bend between pillar and slip points the latter seven miles farther west was now a world so bereft of fog that every tree and bush was clearly visible the longitudinal reading aussie had taken earlier on the winding cliffface path as hed climbed high enough to see over the fog had given them the exact position of the cave behind the falls the cave in which peter dixon had been so gruesomely tortured and murdered tunnel entrance near here mao told freeman who slowed the vehicle to sixty waisthigh brush sandy loamy soil and burnedout forest racing by to their left looking south they could see the grandeur of mount olympus and the sundrenched snowcaps of its surrounding peaks the general fixed his eyes on the waiter who despite the general calling him mao looked only partly chinese to aussie further said mao sourly how much further snapped choir his finger jabbing the mans neck choir still didnt approve of the old man crossing the line shooting the woman like that but if he was right and there was a second sub time would be running out before it either struck again or decided to flee aussie general call sal tell him were a loud pop from the right rear wheel was followed by the roar of the humvee taking rounds aussie realizing that freeman and his team would have been dead or badly shot up if the general had not immediately sped up five oclock yelled aussie hundred yards light pk three men he grabbed the handhold freeman swinging the humvee off the road and into the loamy ground mowing bushes down before the vehicle that was back up to sixty miles an hour aussie and choir were returning fire as freeman swung hard left enabling his men to get off a quick broadside before he just as violently swung the humvee back hard right driving accelerating straight for the light machinegun post that freeman barely saw through the narrow slit between the rim of his fritz and the humvees bulletproof glass the machinegun post was now only twenty yards in front seconds away rising and falling with the humvees passage over the rough ground laudace freeman shouted toujours laudace aussies next burst hit one of them in the shoulder the trio broke and ran the gunner frantically hauling the pla light machine gun jumping over a log hold yelled freeman the humvee hitting the log the vehicles high clearance easily if shudderingly passed over it momentarily throwing freemans steering off the humvee clipping the fleeing gunman with the right fender he was down the gun thrown four feet away freeman braked shoved the stick into reverse and backed up they heard a sound like a branch cracking then he was off after the other two fog was moving in again ir freeman shouted aussie reached over and given the bumpy ride deftly managed to crown the general with the infrared goggles ah there they are the bastards three oclock hundred yards with that freeman again abruptly changed course the vehicle fishtailing then suddenly straightening maos head smacking the right doors glass the windshield not as peppered as aussie expected the general had no doubt put the fear of allah into the machinegun trio by unhesitatingly attacking without pause damn theyre gone the tunnel said choir wheres the entrance freeman asked mao mao was silent you think your buddies are trying to save you asked freeman theyre trying to kill you mao so tell me wheres the entrance mao remained silent freeman looked into the rearview mirror aussie tell sal to bring granny here the general glanced across at mao the waiter badly shaken by the attack see how much your buddies care mao they wanted to kill you as much as they did us either way freeman tapped his watch youve got thirty seconds to show us exactly i mean exactly where the hidden entrance is otherwise ill shoot granny mao was stroking his face beaded with perspiration he shouted she not my granny she my mother he began to sob then said freeman eyes afire and drawing his mm his face so close to mao that their noses were all but touching ill shoot your goddamn mother brentwood had a flashback to the portrayal of patton drawing his ivoryhandled pistol about to shoot one of his soldiers who trembling said he couldnt take it anymore brentwood felt revulsion first the young woman now the older mao was nodding so vigorously he looked as if he was suffering from an acute neurotic disorder ii show you get im out said freeman aussie his adrenaline still up from the speeding firefight hopped out the passenger door and hauled mao after him the fog was clearing as mao stumbling barely able to walk began dry retching no no said aussie you throw up on your own time show us the friggin entrance aussie saw brentwoods jaw clench tightly what the hell had happened to david anyway he wondered did he hunker down in the humvee just because he couldnt fire from midseat or was he scared so scared that he wouldnt have fired if hed had the chance and now david was giving everyone a censorious look well the trouble with davy aussie concluded was that he hadnt seen the sea literally red with american blood pieces of goddamn meat heads floating about thousands more than were killed on so he had a big trauma in ghanistan all soldiers in combat have traumas warriors live with it night sweats the screaming recurring nightmares but aussie knew that he himself had no compunction about pushing mao to his limits the bastards had killed the young coast guardsman jorges alvaro near the falls his body still not found and the seal diver albinski and poor bloody dixon this lot was as coldblooded as jesus said the general his blasphemy now a measure of his immediate if begrudging soldiers admiration for the ingenuity of the tunnels camouflaged entrance best ive ever seen concurred aussie freeman ordered everyone back ten yards all right mao he said go open it mao looked blankly at him work the combination safe added aussie you know the old booby trap cmon said freeman impatiently all of them startled by the ringing of choirs phone son of a bitch said aussie put that friggin thing on vibration it was sal informing them that he should be there in about five mao approached the camouflaged tunnel entrance its trapdoor not horizontal as one would expect but vertical a soilimpacted root end of a fallen charred spruce the roots fourbyfour trapdoor had been exquisitely carpentered so that any saw marks were invisible to the naked eye mao swung open the door and pointed inside the hollow tree trunk the actual entrance to the tunnel being a second fourbyfour trapdoor flush with the earth you all set david freeman asked brentwood as it dawned on brentwood that the general expected him to go down into the tunnel the coldclammy feeling of incipient panic closed in and his head and neck felt feverishly hot didnt think i told you to bring your sidearm for nothing did you said freeman fort lewis co says you can take out a dime at thirty feet and youre lean as a stick like these guys he pointed at mao you know what it was like in nam most of usd get stuck halfway down the damn shaft never mind the damn tunnels which are even narrower freeman turned around asking for a flashlight aussie took out his from his combat pack chapter fifty david brentwood felt all eyes on him even maos in nam freeman told david quickly guys tried to take regular weapons down tunnels couldnt move only thing thatd work was this he tossed brentwood the shaped flashlight best shape for tunnel rats that and a sidearm its the only way brentwood still hadnt moved freeman walked closer to him it was as if they were in a confessional theres another goddamned sub on the coast david we could use a whole division like we did in nam to search and destroy and we still wouldnt find the damn hiding place only way to find it there in nam and now here is to go down the tunnel see where it leads ill call in airborne cav once we find the hideaway but it was mao not the general who would change brentwoods mind the waiter no longer shaking now that hed given in sneered at brentwood possibly in an effort to regain some dignity from his own capitulation to the general the sneer was an unmistakable accusation of cowardice brentwood slid the flashlight switch on and looked at the bulb its light difficult to see in the flood of sunlight that after the dreary world of fog had revealed the northwest wilderness in all its glory he glanced up at the mountaintops the sun so bright it hurt his eyes the enormous rainwashed green apron that swept down to the coast one of such striking primeval beauty that he knew if he survived he would never forget it and the smell rising from the moss no longer that of bonecold damp but of reinvigorated life he hated to leave it aussie crawled into the darkness within the partially hollowed tree and edging his way past the trapdoor that was flush with the earth no booby trap waited till david had descended into the shoulderhigh shaft then he handed him the sonar location beeper the flashlight infrared goggles canteen knife and davids shortbarreled heckler koch mm selfloading compact its control lever easily switchable from left to right for lefthanded shooters good luck mate aussie said softly as david moved farther into the tunnel not even the ir goggles helped the only things he could see were the tiny wriggles of mice chewing at the base of what appeared to be a crude candle holder set into the tunnel wall the walls and ceiling in the rainsoaked terrain supported by fivefoothigh fourbyfour wooden joists the rodents and residual warmth from the extinguished candle in the holder emitting just enough heat to be detected by the ir goggles but beyond this the tunnel was a black disorientating unknown the air was foul and damp his back only inches from the nshaped tunnel he could hear his heart banging against his chest as he had in the afghan cave so loud that his fear locked in battle with reason was convincing him that anyone else in the stygian darkness ahead must have heard him move in and was lying in wait and to his train of fear other terrors quickly attached themselves the veterans stories of how the viet cong had boobytrapped the tunnels with pits of razorsharp punji sticks hidden by thin dirtcovered membranes of stretched cloth and how captured us claymore mines had been rigged in the tunnels side walls with invisible fishline trip wires only a few centimeters above the floor he was struggling to find a hope that he might get out alive trying to make himself concentrate on how to get through he recalled that a gi had gone down a tunnel smelled another man coming toward him in the dark and rather than fire had lain flat damn near melting into the earth his buddies had said the vc had fired first emptying an aks full thirtyround mag its rounds whipping over the gi no more than twenty feet away the gi survived without a scratch firing just once at the kalashnikovs flash killing the vc and he remembered how the tunnel rats who had survived said it had taken hours of painstaking work probing gently every inch ahead with your knife for the little russianmade butterfly mines that would blow your hand or foot off and the kind of unbelievable pain in neck and elbows as you crawled ahead the pain david brentwood was starting to feel now to reach the coast where freeman said the cave was would take hours and if the tunnel snaked had security double back loops and sucker deadend tributaries it would take an eternity but then in the pitchblackness of the stinking tunnel david accepted the possibility that if freeman was right that there was another sub this tunnel might not be part of an underground complex like cu chi which had held hundreds of fighters living and working underground with medical and kitchen antechambers as well as weapons and ammunition storage the man they called mao didnt live in the tunnel after all he lived in port angeles and used the tunnel solely as an underground supply road to the cave an underground throughway to prevent their sub resupply line from being spotted by the infraredequipped american satellites and uavs such as darkstar the munitions torpedoes and mines could be stored deep in the cave but food even the american and russian nuclear subs needed food supply had been routinely transported in by mao and his friends and what better cover than a restaurant had freeman thought of this he wondered that if this was a supply tunnel wouldnt it be as straight as possible to the coast and why bother boobytrapping it the terrorists had dug the tunnel not as they had in vietnam as a conduit from which to attack american ground troops but merely as a supply line and why impede an escape route from the cave with dangerous booby traps the rushing of blood in davids ears didnt go away but it subsided he switched on the flashlight and in that instant knew he was right ahead instead of narrowing the tunnel widened to twice its width for about thirty feet then dipped down and broadened into what seemed a holding area about as big and high as a goodsize delivery van the dimensions of the excavation at once impressed and told him that in order to get rid of the dirt always the tunnelers big problem the terrorists must have started digging from the sea cave so they could pass the massive amounts of soil back and dump it into the ocean that way if seen from the air it would have been attributable to the runoff of the inchesayear rainfall by the time david reached the holding area his confidence was growing and he sped up his pursuit of the escaping terrorists who freeman hoped would lead them via davids sonar beeper to a second lair beyond the holding area using his flashlight in quick onoff snatches he saw flattened cardboard the labeling in japanese and chinese told him nothing but the manufacturers stamps with their illustrated pictures of contents indicated that the boxes had contained dried noodles rice and other such foodstuffs he sat down getting his breathing under control he was so dehydrated from the strain his initial freezeup at the entrance to the tunnel and the constant bentover position required to negotiate the fivefoothigh tunnel that he wanted to gulp down all the water in his canteen but warning himself not to drink too much he rescrewed the cap and slid the canteen around his belt behind his back then he resumed his trek walking slowly moving his flashlight from side to side in rapid sweeps in fifteen minutes he had passed through what he estimated must have been a quarter mile of tunnel this wasnt a tunnel rats crawl he thought this was nascar he checked his beeper it was working fine he couldnt stand up and his back was aching but his dead right hand notwithstanding he was in reasonably good physical condition and anticipated that he would soon reach the cave or the branchoff that had to exist if freemans theory of a second sub lair had any substance he heard a sound like a spit and the flashlight flew from his hand flung somewhere behind him he dropped to the floor and through the ir glasses saw a smudge of white heat in the tunnel probably twenty feet away and double tapped his compacts trigger the two rounds striking a human form that collapsed into an indistinguishable shape he could hear someone moving running away and then he was running too the hunchbacked position slowing him more than he would have believed the human diaphragm not built to sustain a sprinter long in such an unnatural position the man fleeing from him obviously much shorter passing the stilled body he saw it was a woman her face no longer there two hundred feet farther he had to stop sweat pouring off him choir williams prodded mao with the barrel of his hk he freeman and aussie wearing full battle packs not knowing what they might need if there was another sub lair or what freeman had begun calling a branch plant of the terrorists they were close to the coast aussie lewis could hear the surf ahead we must be damn near the cave he said looking over at freeman the general heard him but refused to comment instead he beckoned mao with a gesture you led me on a wild goose chase comrade he said this tunnels leading to the cave we already found i told you what id do to mommy eh didnt i i only know the cave tunnel said mao we bring we brought food to the cave that is all i swear you kill my mother you kill me i can tell you no more i only know this tunnel freeman believed him and saw that choir redfaced with exertion also believed him he thrust his gloved finger hard in the direction of a thick treeline that aussie felt certain marked the high cliffs edge theres a he began and had to stop for breath which made him more irritated a goddamn sub nearby i know it permission sir said choir a rarely used formality in the team go on the general said there is a sub nearby sir said choir its at the bottom of the bay we sank it below them the damp of the tunnel was penetrating david brentwoods uniform his perspiration chilled now that hed stopped ahead in the quick sweep of his flashlight he saw a wall of rubble blocking the tunnel no doubt the effects of the hydrofoil sapper units demolition of the cave suddenly david was revisited by the ghosts of panic of losing his squad in afghanistan in another cave and now hed just shot a woman to death and where had the other two terrorists gone a side chamber behind him he started back then stopped heart thumping again how many had died in the tunnels sealed off the air was fetid in the darkness and he could smell the disgusting odor of decomposing bodies probably buried in the demolition of the cave then through his infrared goggles david saw a smudge of heat leaking from the rubble a moment later he saw a sudden white blossom then a thwack punched him off his feet he was being fired at two of them the first bullet struck his vest low left the second cracking above him as he lay flat on his back ir goggles knocked askew as he returned fire in the direction of the flash there were no ricochets which confirmed his marksmanship his doubletap rounds obviously having passed through what he now realized must be a narrow cleft between the demolition rubble and the left side wall of the tunnel his initial panic evicted by the sheer concentration required if he had any hope of getting out alive above him the specfor team and mao had heard the faint muffled shots choir noticed that mao was smiling and jabbed him with his hk better not let the general see that laddie but mao the tunnel mule as the load bearers were called in vietnam was grinning because hed detected movement high in a tall cedar atop the cliffs edge the americans were in for a surprise and this time unlike in the humvee mao knew he could keep himself out of the line of fire in response to choirs warning mao nodded as if apologizing for a lapse in judgment and waited anxiously for the party to move on he selected a solidlooking log ten feet off to his right a fir that would protect him from the americans return fire if any of the three infidels were lucky enough to survive the snipers fire the waiter resented the name maohe was no communist but a true believer and now he prayed to allah blessed be his name that the marksmans aim would be sure there must be at least two of them down there said freeman thats the way i read it dammit i sent david down there thinking there was another he paused then said i guess you guys were right no second sub were almost at the cliffs edge above the cave he shoved the silent receiver into his vest pocket and moved forward the snipers first shot rang out freemans fritz helmet literally spinning about his head as he fell the second shot penetrated aussies vest and left rib cage the third shot never came choirs mm parabellum cutting into the tall cedar a clump of its branches breaking plummeting down from what had been the snipers position the figure fell then abruptly jerked to a stop the snipers safety line coming to its end the body arms out dangling like an inverted cross choir then walked angrily over to the big fir log behind which mao was cowering his mudcaked face twitching and clipped a full magazine into his hk you saw him up there didnt you laddie he said you didnt warn us no no mao pleaded rolling over onto his back like a beaten dog his hands still cuffed beneath him pushing him closer into the protection of the log no please well make sure said choir seeing freeman with his bulletscarred fritz back on the general stripping aussie of his kevlar vest and administering first aid choir raised his hk to his shoulder no mao screamed no please sir i tell you about other cave okay other cave right nearby around headland behind cliff vines yes yes i swear choir called out general theres another cave on this cliff face the welsh american looked down at mao how far around from the falls he asked sharply two three hundred yards maybe from other cave west yes west of other cave tunnel here going to chicken bone chicken bone finish him off yelled aussie more to mask his pain than to offer advice give him a full fucking oh shit dont be a baby freeman admonished plunging in a vial of morphine this isnt an inoculation it was an open team secret that the tough australian had fainted when hed gotten his twoinone smallpox and cholera shot before iraq finish him off choir repeated aussie ill finish him said choir chicken bone mao was frantic licking his lips rushing to explain tunnel here he was pointing down tunnel goes into he rolled over onto his stomach and made a y shape with his arms and hands chicken you mean the tunnel divides into two said choir two tunnels yes yes said mao his voice muffled by the mud and grass growing by the log with that choir raised his mm submachine gun and fired a long burst into the cedar tree the hanging body jerking violently emitting a scream it sounded like a woman told you the whore was faking it said aussie wouldve dropped a grenade on us if wed jesus general that hurt eyes closed mao awoke from his nightmare first in utter surprise then in delirious relief thank you thank you sir thank you i take you to cliff ledge near cave there a sub in the cave asked choir i never been in cave only know about ledge i take you shut your mouth it was freeman his baritone sounding extraordinarily stentorian and listen to me you slimeball youre going to put on aussies fritz his helmet and his uniform and youre going to lead us quietly through this grass and timber up to the cliffs edge and very quietly youre going to be the first one down as well as wearing aussies helmet youre going to have duct tape around your mouth and so goddamned tight laddie that if you try to take it off youll fall from the rope right down to the fucking cliff the general though his line of sight was obscured by the windbent treeline along the cliffs edge fifty yards away was recalling the view of the falls and cliffs from the sea farther down the coast id say its about a hundred and fifty two hundred feet down to the rocks he continued you take us right to this friggin ledge youre talking about and you make any noiseany fucking noise and ill push you off myself then well have grandma join you you traitorous son of a bitch go on get up freeman grabbed him by his collar we let you people come into this country and this is the way you repay us attacking america by god i ought to freeman shoved him back mao falling and bashing his head against the fallen log only the moss saving him from cracking his skull choir helped him to his feet color now flooding back into the mans face we forced to do this said mao with unexpected passion otherwise li kuan kill all our families in china in kazakhstan kill everyone freeman jabbed his finger hard into maos chest youre a terrorist ill give you three minutes to get that gear on freeman turned to choir cut him loose ill rappel down the west side you and mao go down over there by that big arbutus which ones that asked choir jesus christ man the red bark twenty paces freeman had a parting comment for mao if my boy down there is dead which i think he is ill cut your fucking throat it had been only seven minutes since the snipers fire and about ten since the beeper had died but to choir it seemed no more than two or three seconds everything having happened so fast he was about to ask the general whether it wouldnt be better to call fort lewis in now when freeman turned to aussie you up to calling fort lewis get their airborne cav over here no sweat answered aussie dragging himself over to a small copse of cypress for good cover now having only his kevlar vest to keep him warm his load vest as well as his helmet having been given to mao maybe we should wait for them general said choir hell no by that time these bastardsll have burned all their codes and vanished then he indicated mao all well have is this bag of shit the cav can mop up choir was tugged by conflicting emotions freeman whatever else you might think of him was guts personified and in specops command that was the ultimate accolade but the pointblank shooting of the young woman in the café who might have already succumbed to her massive chest wound was clear evidence that freeman would have no hesitation killing maos aged mother as well there was a line even for special forces that choir knew you didnt cross he recalled the sas brit who gave up his and his teams position rather than shoot a little iraqi shepherd boy whod wandered into their hide freeman had surely crossed the line with his behavior in the restaurant and as choir readied the nylon line for his and maos rappel from the cliffs top to the ledge that led across the face of the vinecurtained cave the welsh american found himself adopting a fatherly almost friendly tone with the terrorist as he gagged him with the duct tape now just calm down he said breathe through your nose dont panic but im telling you laddie you make any noise you do anything wrong and hell choir couldnt bring himself to say it so alien was it to all his experience fighting by the generals side mao understood and nodded his labored breathing producing a faint nasal whistle that didnt worry choir because of the overriding noise of the crashing sea below and the wind through the thickly vined vegetation of the cliff that mao had assured them screened another cave the same mao choir reminded himself who had sworn he was telling the truth earlier freeman signaled to choir to synchronize watches then both of them began feeding the rope through their gloves over the cliffs edge mao began his rappel in the tunnel below them and back from the cliff david was still hunched his neck and leg muscles taut with the pain that radiated up and down his back he was trying to regain his hearing his ears still ringing from the three shots hed fired from his compact he felt a warm wash of air from the radiant heat of its barrel it felt good in the dripping wet cold of the lefthand tunnel hed entered through the narrow gap in the rubble of the tunnel that led to the waterfall cave he wondered if the two terrorists were still in the tunnel or if theyd reached what he guessed must be a second lair in the cliff face if they were still around he hoped they didnt have ir goggles that would pick up the compacts residual heat stupid he told himself if the terrorists had irs they would see his body heat anyway if he advanced down the tunnel he could only hope theyd be more interested in escaping than trapping him because they must have heard the shooting above them it had sounded as if a sniper had gotten two shots off before the replying stutter of an hk david placed his compact into the wooden lifeless grip of his injured hand and felt for his flashlight he pulled its head hard against him slid the on switch forward saw a pinpoint of light and switched it off returning the compact to his good left hand the danger he thought was that if the two terrorists he was following had reached the second lair at least one of them might be waiting at the tunnels exit under the lair to finish him off while the other busied himself with the means of escape they could have a zodiac possibly one of the big jobs as aussie referred to the thirtyfoot ribs that in a pinch could quickly ferry away twenty or more sardinepacked personnel that would rapidly take them eastwards back into the protective shroud of fog where they could then land melting back into the perennially green canopy of the peninsula to later reassemble and launch yet another attack david stopped noticing that one of the fivefoothigh joists lining the tunnel had come loose from the wall bringing down what appeared to be a candlestick holder with it a butterfly mine underneath the fallen joist seemed to have been pushed out over time by an inchthick root growing horizontally along the tunnel the root itself about three or four feet in length he slid his compact into his waistband and quickly made two cuts with his kbar resheathing it and extracting the root rubbing the root hard back and forth against his trousers to remove the slippery mud coating then he made several small nicks on one end of the root so he would have a better grip with the compact which had eight shots left and the thick threefootlong root in the wooden grasp of his injured hand like an officers swagger stick he started moving cautiously again down the tunnel it took a slight curving turn to the left the wide angle of the turn obviously designed to accommodate much longer containers than the cardboard boxes of food perhaps crated segments of torpedoes he thought he paused again the persistent ringing in his ears now joined by a sound like wind in trees the falls they were possibly only two hundred yards or so to the east and if he was that close to the coastal cliffs he knew the tunnel would soon end infrared spots of residual heat like those captured by ir cameras showing the images of parked cars that in fact were no longer there speckled his ir glasses slowly he counseled himself above him outside somewhere freeman aussie and choir and maybe sal too would be moving fast coming down a trail on the cliff face or some such thing exactly how he couldnt be sure because unlike them hed never seen the cliffs in the area hed only heard about them secondhand from news reports of the sinking of the sub david brentwood who was determined to redeem himself for what had happened in afghanistan his bootlaces tied so tightly his feet were throbbing knew that any temptation to rush to get it over with had to be restrained by common sense the terrorists if they hadnt already fled would be waiting for him in that case perhaps he should wait in turn until freeman and company made their move and he heard them he could smell paper smoke which together with the fetid air of the tunnel was partially depriving his brain of oxygen but should he make a dash for the exit which couldnt be far away the terrorists would be watching the seaward side of the lair as well not just the tunnel exit he had assumed that the roar he was now hearing was that of the falls the team had spoken of where they had attacked the sub but disorientated in the tunnel as to precisely what direction he was heading he couldnt be sure and everything was becoming fuzzy with the lack of oxygen he thought he heard movement ahead or was it behind him he stopped again and knelt down almost tipping off balance because of the oxygen depletion and the lack of sensation in his right arm he reached out with his left hand and ducttaped the flashlight to the end of the thick threefootlong root chapter fiftyone where in hell was douglas freeman more to the point marte wondered what was he looking for shed heard by now of his mythical second sub but it might be simply rumor theres a thousand bucks in it sheriff she told the wellfed lawman wally got up from his desk and hitched his pants lord she was a looker no spring chicken but experienced like you could get right to it cnn tryin to bribe me ms price thats serious oh heavens no said marte smiling touching his arm tossing her head back the sheen of her hair caught in the sheriffs green desk lamp its walter isnt it most folks call me wally wally she said as if right there and then nothing else was important to her wally yes i like that most nicknames well to be frank i dont like them but wally its friendly sounding isnt it he knew what she was doing did she think that coming from new york she could pull a fast one think he was some kind of rainforest hillbilly i just think continued marte that you folks in law enforcement have done a marvelous job up here the rescue work people leaving in droves and all that id simply like to make a contribution to your benevolent fund as one grateful american to another im sure there are police officers families in need wally nodded i knew some of those deputies on duty at birch bay she remembered the attack against the oil refinery general freeman knows me she said suddenly theyve headed out on road to callam bay he showed her where it was on the stations wall map of the olympic peninsula cameraman going with you you rather he wouldnt no no i mean i think you need a man along really a feminist edge there he saw i mean ah you know one of you drive the other one navigate sort of thing very deserted out there id lend you a deputy but with all the townsfolk returning look wally there might be other media people arriving here now the petrels in port uhhuh said wally rubbing his chin thoughtfully im not sure where general freeman is couldve gone east back to the down to hood canal bangor base imagine admiral jensenll have a few questions to answer bit late with those hydrofoils sides i think most reportersll want to get first dibs at interviewing the petrels crew helluva thing they did marte was careful not to crack a smile as she began writing her check her pen slowing however when she realized the sheriff might be right the petrels crew would be a huge story and if all freeman wound up with was simply a bunch of leftover terrorists in the bush still shed learned that freeman had a kind of sixth sense about things military whoa said the sheriff i cant take a check maam he was astounded by her naiveté i mean ah cashd probably be better oh yes of course im sorry i wasnt thinking wheres the nearest atm man theres been a run on them i dont think ive only got four hundred in cash ill need that for a cab can you trust me hell sure i can trust you soon as i get back she gave him a smile lordy he could have sworn she licked her lips walter gave her a wave we on asked the cameraman his tone utterly devoid of enthusiasm theres no second sub he added wearily ill bet you theres no second sub marte price told the cab driver to go faster worried that the car a half mile in front was fox or possibly englands independent television network those brits have been all over us like measles since iraq she told her cameraman i swear they got the nod into our market because they went in after saddam insane with us and the aussies the cameraman shrugged disinterestedly marte wanted the cabbie to catch up and overtake the vehicle ahead her foldup binoculars out of her bag its another cab she blurted a realization that convinced the cnn veteran that it was media up ahead rental cars were seldom used by the media because the paperwork and homeland defense purpose of rental security form took too much time to fill out salvini had spotted the car way back and saw it closing fast now terrorists he wondered he called aussie lewis aussie wasnt surprised to feel the sudden vibration in his tunic pocket the morphine freeman had administered having temporarily banished the pain putting his brain in reverie where the fuck are you brooklyn in this cab with grandma sal replied listen ive got a bogey up my ass looks like another cab no one else is supposed to be out here the boss told sheriff yeah well cut in aussie lethargically his laidback tone annoying sal could be a hostile said sal urgently okay aussie answered pleasantly pull a left block the road show em your weapon there was a pause well thats what i was gonna do you okay aussie you sound weird took one in the rib cage not deep though other guys takin care o business aussie definitely sounded high got a gps loc for me asked salvini i must have gone past the mile post you gave me oh yeah said aussie accommodatingly sure hang on mate you on morph oh yeah aussies voice said lazily on the morph jesus call me back with your gps sal dropped the phone onto the cabs passenger seat and braked hard maos mother yelling something at him in vietnamese as he blocked the road and stepped out with the shotgun martes cab slowed keep going she told the driver theres another hundred in it lady i dont care if theres another million in it im stopping right now that guys holdin a shotgun all i got is my dick an i plan on keepin it stan marte told her cameraman you drive she turned back to the cabbie you stay here she handed him two hundred adding we shouldnt be long ill pay for any damages the cabbie counted the money it was more than hed expected go stan marte instructed her cameraman slowly he said fine but go take off your panties the cameraman told her what youre wearing white panties i think wed better start waving them pervert dont turn around he didnt but did look into the rearview mirror when the cab pulled up to him sal told marte shed have to turn back no media too dangerous as they spoke he could hear firing which he was sure must be echoing up from the sides of the cliffs in fact he was hearing the distant linoleumripping sound of aussies hk with the morphine now wearing off his pain returning lewis had been in no mood for the four terrorists he saw popping up out of the ground a hundred yards away from what was supposed to be a patch of skunk cabbage all four were armed and in a clump running for their lives through the brush toward him heading for the road aussie flicked off the safety aw shit he murmured after his first burst seeing that the four though having been in a bunch now had the sense to disperse like every specfor warrior aussie lewis knew stop in at least eight languages zhàn zhù he called out now claymore every enemy of the united states knew what claymore meant aussie thought of it as the terror that had pulverized so many of uncle hos viet minh into ground minh three of the four were suddenly standing dead still the fourth in what aussie called obvious freeman shockmaybe hed heard what had happened in the port angeles caféwas walking around in circles calling for someone aussie cut them down without the slightest compunction they had attacked his adopted country his home and besides they were in civilian garb and thus he told himself armed spies under the geneva convention you should go back to port angeles sal told marte and her cameraman put your panties back on and interview those people dont be a smartass marte snapped what people people who got kicked out of the restaurant they can give you a story hed taken care not to mention the woman being shot and he felt badly about having to steer the reporter in that direction the shooting story was sure to come out but it was the only way he could send her and the cameraman away from the firing anyway seeing that some media type was going to get the story it might as well be price whom hed heard had once been buddybuddy with the general whos the old lady asked marte looking into sals cab informant sal said before he had time to think his job was fighting not arguing the old lady was shaking her finger at the three of them whats she saying marte asked do you know says you should go away big trouble up ahead marte looked disgusted do one thing for me whats your name mickey all right mickey will you at least tell the general if hes still alive that i was here first and id appreciate it if he gave me first crack at his story ill do that as their cab headed back the cameraman told marte his names not mickey gee said marte her voice cold with sarcasm i thought it was she asked him to toss back her panties and id appreciate it stan if you didnt perve at me in the rearview there might be a good story in town he said in a conciliatory tone she didnt answer you know stan continued up at the hospital that sub commanders crush what was her name elisha alicia said a somewhat mollified marte alicia mayne yeah the one with the burns you know i heard that deeper burns arent as painful as first degree burns because third degree burns destroy all the nerve endings you dont feel the pain still needs skin grafts by the dozen that one yeah but they can work wonders now friend of mine told me they have this kind of synthetic skin thats revolutionized burn recovery well she couldnt look worse than some of those hollywood bimbos said marte pay ten grand for a facelift and they look like theyre from a waxworks boobs look real just drive stan chapter fiftytwo if murphys law had run amok through the strait of juan de fuca during this disastrous week for america freeman thought murphy now seemed absent as he choir and mao having successfully rappeled down the cliff face without incident now reached the footpathwidth ledge that ran across the base of the cliff high tide was in waves broaching the ledge here and there disappearing behind the ragged bottom of the thick tangledvine curtain freeman was about fifty feet across from choir and mao and both could see the entrance there was a smaller curtain about fifteen feet wide and thirty feet high within the much larger curtain of vegetation like a smaller door set within a hangar door another outfit might have used mao at barrel point to go ahead to be first man inside to take the first fire if surprise wasnt achieved but freeman didnt want to do it that way surprise was not gained by creeping approaches in his school which taught that slow approaches bred defensive attitudes in what was supposed to be an offensive force freeman signaled to choir to make a walk speed approach along the slippery ledge then a fast entry it suited his preference for audacity laudace laudace toujours laudace choir gently pulled mao back cuffed him with a nylon strip and turned his face into the cliff maos breathing was still labored but choir could tell easing now wait here choir whispered he glanced down checking his grenade array freeman already having done so then both of them began making their way along the ledge choir from the east side of the heavy vine door freeman from the west freemans biggest worry given the bright sunlight was whether any part of their shadows would pierce the screen of vegetation like that of someone passing by an ivycovered trellis momentarily he glanced up at the rim of the cliff its overhang of freshsmelling vegetation a vivid green fringe against the blue sky and he saw why he and choir hadnt spotted any sentries other than the treehidden sniper a human form against such a wild natural setting would at once arouse curiosity in anyone at sea anyway he hoped he and the rest of the team had decimated the core of the supply unit in the firefight at the falls cave and against the sixman zodiac near petrel along with everyone on the submarine theyd sunk he saw a cloud about to swallow the sun choir seeing the general looking up got the same message theyd pause a second or two longer the door still ten feet away and then make their move in the shadow of the passing cloud they heard pulley chains then and the two halves of the vegetationscreened door began opening like a stage curtain no voices the sun hidden in cloud now had not cast shadows but neither did it illuminate anything more than a few yards of a semidark cave whose back wall neither choir nor freeman could distinguish some kind of gantry was faintly visible and the first thing coming to freemans mind as he and choir dropped down on damp icecold rock was stage scaffolding he couldnt see anyone but if the terrorists had escaped then who was running the chain and pulley admittedly it would require only one man but where was he or she terrorists these days were equal opportunity employers then choir glimpsed a faint wink of light it was davids flashlight sweeping from about twenty feet inside the tunnel as he approached the tunnels exit that led directly into the cave and it immediately drew fire the last twenty feet of the tunnel suddenly exploding with tracer pouring from the back wall of the cave into the tunnel at the flashlight the shooters had assumed the enemy tunnel rat was right behind it holding it but david was now at least five feet away left of the flashlight the long root handle to which hed taped it for just such an eventuality was in the wooden grasp of his useless right hand davids left arm came up from his prone position compact in hand his first shot imploded one of the two terrorists heads and the second was just as accurate born of constant practice on the fort lewis range also killing its victim instantly choir and freeman held their fire at the remaining terrorist lest an errant round strike david the bang of his compacts mm as distinct to freeman as the sound of his own weapon david freeman shouted general the exultation david felt combined with the smell of the sea air that was now flushing out the stink of gunpowder sent his adrenaline racing the cave lit up then and freeman swung his hk up its burst taking out the light a hot glass rain showering down on him and choir but in that instant of light turned on by the terrorists freeman had glimpsed enough to know now that what hed assumed was scaffolding was in fact a dry dock and in it was a long blacktented vessel only its prop and prop guard visible choir had time only to glimpse it too but hed noticed something freeman hadnt the prop had exactly the same number of blades and prop guard as the sub theyd sunk for an instant choir felt as if someone had walked over his grave that the sub had been resurrected but he told himself that was not possible no way choir and freeman at the front of the cave crawled quickly to the bottom beam of the dry dock the two were about fifteen feet apart with david just inside the tunnel exit at the caves rear forming the third point in an ad hoc triangle of fire but to stay there to wait was to die they had to get up a shaft of light pierced the cave on freemans right and three men came out firing wildly their intent obviously to flush out the americans but having already glimpsed the layout freeman choir and david because of their training for instant memorization of hostile layouts had no fear of blue on blue and cut the terrorists down within seconds what they werent prepared for was the utter surprise of seeing the black tent moving toward the front of the cave two hydraulic launch rails sliding out ahead of the dry dock through the now open vinecovered door into the high tides water which was almost flush with the caves lip that was the ledge the black tent moved slowly at first its conical top plucked up by an overhead fingers claw that had been screwed into the cave roof freeman saw that on his right side of the cave there was a thick side spar a short canvascovered walkway projecting out from the caves westerly wall presumably coming out from either a natural or manmade antechamber in the rock wall adjacent to the black tent several terrorists probably four certainly no more than six by the sound of their footfalls had just entered the conical tent via this covered walkway as the tent was being raised higher and the vessel started to move freeman could see that once the as yet unrevealed bow hit the water and the camouflage tent was completely drawn off the vessel would be into the water and away like rescue boats that could be launched in seconds from rocky shorelines sliding straight from dry dock to sea choir and david paired to maintain suppressing fire but davids ammunition was getting low cover freeman shouted and dashed toward the rising tent that now above the vessels waterline revealed the shape not of a sub but of a fast patrol boat with us coast guard colors freeman pulled the pins of his grenades and lobbed one two three forward and midships the last one onto the stern deck three of them went off in quick succession the craft aflame the fourth he grenade exploded as the vessel was only halfway out of the cave its stern still inside and on fire david having located the pulleychain button pushed it thus shutting the door jamming the patrol boat half in and half out because of the resistance of its high superstructure aerials and radar antennae the vine curtain was now on fire and fuel tanks began exploding spewing out sheets of flame over the starboard decks canvasshrouded torpedo tube the concussion lifting freeman off his feet covering him in flame and throwing him back toward the center of the cave where choir quickly extinguished his burning clothes with a throw of fire sand from one of several contingency buckets lined up by the wall spitting and cursing eyebrows singed freeman was up on his feet facing seaward when he saw a door burst open on the deck of the burning boat three terrorists emerged firing furiously at david who coolly returned fire heading one of them who fell back into the burning shroud of the tent choir felled the second and then there was the general not in uniform of course but general chang nevertheless as freeman squeezed off another burst before chang could hit him he realized with the force of a physical blow seeing the chinese generals wig fly off like a bloodsodden pelt revealing a pockmarked scalp that he was looking at li kuan the cave was an inferno freeman telling david and choir to disengage an unnecessary order given that there was no more resistance the downed terrorists scattered about the cave floor freeman knew the fight was over but feared that the torpedo tubes the warheads doubtless having been loaded to sink more minesweepers or anything else in the choke point would explode the cave instantly becoming an oven consuming all the oxygen and everything within move out he shouted he couldnt see david then freeman heard a loud crack saw choir fall and the drydock frame behind him engulfed in flames knots in the wood exploding like more gunshots choir was all right but had twisted his ankle as he fell he could have sworn that the body of the pockmarked terrorist leader on the fiery stern deck had twitched muscles contracting probably freeman his right hand holding his hk his finger on the trigger thrust his left hand under choirs right shoulder to serve as a crutch and the two made their way through black toxic smoke that was now pouring out from the interior of the burning boat they heard a tremendous crash behind them the drydocks front section having collapsed the boats stern higher because of it choir saw a figure clinging to its rail it was the pockmarked terrorist issuing forth such a feral scream of rage and pain that choir knew he would never forget it mother of god he blurted the hot smoke scorching his throat hes still alive we should finish the poor devil off dont bother said freeman glancing back at li kuan aka general chang jesus said choir there was another ungodly scream hes melting general his bodys choir was coughing violently his bodys actually melting let the bastard melt said freeman who was thinking about a young american woman called amanda so full of promise and hope brutally tortured then murdered and dumped in a stinking canal by changli kuans thugs because shed overheard what had now been revealed in the cave the communist chinese governments plan to quell rebel muslim nationalist movements on its xinjiang border by offering to oversee a muslim attack on america chang or li kuan as young mao knew him had clearly blackmailed immigrants just as mao had told freeman to cooperate in providing the sub and torpedo boat with supplies the asiatic muslims providing crews and gunmen by the time the wokka wokka of the airborne cavalry units from fort lewis could be heard in the skies over the us side of the juan de fuca strait the threat was over for now it would be the fbis and homeland defenses joint responsibility to backtrack to go through seattle and vancouver importers invoices and find out which importers bought which supplies and just as important who transported them to port angeles on the lonely washington coast outside the smokefilled cave mao whod had ample time to turn around carefully on the ledge and cut through the nylon cord cuffs by rubbing them against the barnacleencrusted rocks moved across the ledge helping freeman and a corditereeking david brentwood assist choir along the narrow ledge and then in a painfully slow descent for choir down to the rocky foreshore epilogue its naive freeman told marte price port angeles during her exclusive hospital emergency room interview to believe that there arent more sleepers all over the country you really believe that general marte pressed marte he began drawing back as the nurse applied a malodorous salve to his burns smells like damn fish do you really believe that marte asked again that there are sleepers all over the united states freeman was sure she believed it too her repetition of the question merely an attempt to have him answer in a form best suited for tv this was larry king grist i do said freeman asserting most americans the experience of and this last week notwithstanding are far too sanguine about the extent of the sleeper danger there she had her quote and it was the truth and the canadian borders a walkthrough he added almost as an afterthought this last comment was the one that grabbed headlines and caused a diplomatic fracas between ottawa and washington dc it drove the modern miracle stories of what was occurring daily in americas hospitals off the front pages the space age technology of these miracles wherein radical dnabased techniques had greatly reduced burn healing and recovery times to months rather than years barely got a mention amid all the war news sal as he put it was highly pissed off missing the action in the second cave his day ending by having to return maos mother to the restaurant where she berated him again in rapidfire vietnamese mao was turned over to the fbi for further questioning with an in consideration leniency note from freeman stating how helpful the blackmailed terrorist had been sal had joined choir and david at the hospital to visit the general and aussie while david was waylaid by marte price who wanted a followup interview with the medal of honor winner choir and sal went to the second floor to see aussie they had to wait the patients curtains closed as a harried nurse checked his wound and recorded his vital signs despite their relief that the military operation was over sal and choir now they had a chance to talk about it were still troubled by freemans behavior in the restaurant with the young woman and his actions en route to the second cave with mao maybe said sal checking to see that no one was within earshot he should give it up yes concurred choir you fight these fanatics too much you become like them end justifies the means right right and so one can only imagine the two mens astonishment indeed their shock when they saw a gumchewing sheriffs deputy walking by with a young female patient the woman in a washedthin vnecked nightie sally maos wouldbe love glared hatefully at them a dark saucersized bruise visible even through her nightie she quickly drew the v of the nightie closed as if rebuking two leering adolescents sal and choir stared at each other pointblank said choir he fired pointblank shit said sal he must have used a nonlethal round a rubber bullet but wait a minute what about the blood fake mate came an aussie drawl from behind the curtains those blood samples taken on petrel from the terrorists we whacked i told the

jesse ventura well not have any of that foul language here thank you very much there are children here you know the specfor trio were utterly cowed terrorists they could do this they couldnt handle sorry maam they said contritely as she left there was a moment of silence sal and choir feeling guilty for ever doubting the general down on the first floor freeman stood impatiently in the phone cubicle outside emergency the stiffness in his chest from the impact of the subs round against his kevlar spreading up to his neck and shoulders he could tell that if he didnt get something to relieve the discomfort as the hospital staff referred to pain he would be in for a motrinsized headache trouble was to get a pill in emergency required a consultation with an md so instead he took a combat vial of morphine from his jacket and jabbed it into his upper arm junkie exclaimed a disgusted young woman hurrying by with an openmouthed teen in the hospital yet i dunno freeman felt badly stupid thing to do and was about to hang up the phone so he could go and explain but then he heard charles risers voice on the other end mr riser yes general freeman here youve probably seen the news mr riser about whats been happening up here in the the sub and that other boat yes thank god mr riser i hate to fall back on a cliché but i cant think of anything better than to say ive got some good news and bad news well i guess its all bad for you li kuan and general chang arewerethe same person chang being in prison was a lie just a smoke screen freeman waited giving charles riser a chance to absorb the shock it was only seconds but seemed infinitely longer before riser whom freeman imagined must have had to sit down get his thoughts together replied is are they his voice taut with tension hes dead said freeman shot the son of a bitch myself there was another long pause before riser inquired youre sure hes dead deadern a fucking doornail excuse my latin you actually saw him die mr riser i saw the scumbag melt i can go into details if you like but im sure please do said riser charles risers next door neighbors were concerned for him it was late pm on the east coast and they could still see him in his tartan robe roaming around his house from kitchen to dining room to front hall and back to the kitchen clutching a large gilded portrait of his daughter to his chest hes talking to her said the neighbors wife i think hes crying dont think so her husband said peering over her shoulder at riser looks to me like hes celebrating maybe both marte price the embodiment of unflustered professionalism was becoming flustered she had just clipped on the medal of honor winners throat mike the emergency room a terrific backdrop as stan told her everything set to go and what did she see the elevator opening and john rorke the captain of the uss encino who the white house confirmed had launched the first blow against the plas penghu garrison together with the mccains air arm strike it had forced beijing to the ceasefire table with taipei as freeman reentered the room he heard marte ask her cameraman whos the woman with him stan was busy adjusting the tripod and the focus what he said the woman with commander rorke said marte stan glanced over in the wheelchair yes stan in the wheelchair its the only one i can see the couple were now over at the admissions desk obviously ready to check out he in the stunning white dress uniform of a united states naval officer she in a flattering loosefitting blue silk dress shes the one who was in the hospital room when we barged in for that interview marte remembered the occasion but thats not her she said emphatically that woman was badly burned she was said stan adjusting the down angle of the video she still is on most of her upper body but havent you been reading the papers theyve had photos of her and some of the other burn victims pretty impressive i can tell you some sort of miracle skin wrap thats revolutionized damn said marte she had the legendary freeman on tape the medal of honor winner all miked up and ready to go and now a naval hero and a medical miracle were about to get away excuse me she told david brentwood unclipping his mike and dropping her clipboard she scuttled over to the admissions desk commander she called out but she was positively beaming at the woman in the wheelchair quick pleasantries were exchanged between rorke and marte this is my wife alicia he said his pride evident and alicia this is marte oh i recognize you said alicia her smile pleasant but not obsequious and extraordinarily painful to her though she didnt give any indication of it would they be so good as to let cnn do a quick interview marte asked just a few minutes she lied i know it would mean so much to the people who she stopped as she saw john rorke looking down with concern at alicia alicia knew it was her call talking tired her there was so much subcutaneous healing yet to occur and her face was still so sore that the slightest breeze at times became unbearable fine she said where would you like us to go over here said marte and returning with them to the camera ever so politely edged freeman and brentwood out of camera range david would you be willing to wait a few minutes marte asked sure he said he felt relaxed for the first time in over six months hed called melissa and knew hed be home by tomorrow evening i dont mind take your time thank you said marte turning triumphantly to her cameraman you see stan things happen in threes freeman watched her do the interviews realizing again how people who dont actually do a job any job from gofer to legend ever understand how much goes into making things happen he rose to leave feeling exhausted and slightly woozy from the morphine but he managed to interject a brief invitation between camera takes dinner tomorrow night he asked marte she smiled knowingly last time you invited me out general you thought i was too hyper needed to relax how did you put it rest and recreation calming down will eight oclock be all right done the general replied and left you see stan told marte things happen in fours you ready to roll yes maam on the second floor as the nurse taking aussies vital signs finished up and closed the bed curtains choir and sal sat down and soon the three warriors were busy talking over the mission then i guess the boss would never have harmed the old lady said choir guess not eh aussie added sal the usually voluble aussie didnt answer he didnt know it was an old world but a new war this battle with terror nothing quite like it in many ways this world war was like all wars but still it was different but for now the hemorrhaging in the northwest at least had been stanched the big news of the day however which dominated all the networks was that the elderly blind woman and her black lab guide dog who had been missing following the sinking of the ferry georgia queen had been found by a us coast guard cutter though both cold voraciously hungry and thirsty they were together and otherwise all right having huddled together on an ad hoc raft of styrofoam packing that had been rapidly drifting out to sea through the choke point
