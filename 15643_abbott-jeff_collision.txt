collision jeff abbott men die because they cannot join the beginning to the end alcmaeon two years ago end of the honeymoon emily said you tired of me yet absolutely ben forsberg watched her standing at the sink at the rental houses kitchen smiled as the light from the maui sun played across her face ive already called several divorce lawyers probably be best if we didnt sit together on the flight home and i thought it was just me she gave him a glance over her shoulder bit at her lip fought down the grin this marriage was a huge mistake im consumed with regret she flicked water at him and came to the kitchen table where he sat she slid into his lap and he took her in his arms he gave her a long slow unhurried kiss she kissed him back ran her foot along his calf and then stood i was kidding he said i know einstein go shower you smell like golf what does golf smell like sweat grass sunshine and frustration usually in that order whats the smell of frustration he asked starting to laugh youll soon know emily said if you dont go shower youll be one highly frustrated new husband she gave him a small chaste kiss and a light pat on his rump as he stood i love it when you threaten me ben said kissing her again not a threat sweetie go get cleaned up its my turn to fix us lunch then well have dessert before we have to go to the airport she touched his lips with her finger and smiled i dont want to go home he said im not ready for you to turn back into the queen of spreadsheets or you to be the king of contracts she said we could just stay here and never go back to work be poor and homeless in maui brilliant idea he leaned back from her work is overrated except for bringing us together speaking of which i need to call sam before we leave for the airport remember no work calls ive kept my side of the deal yes well ill keep my marriage vows to you but everything else is negotiable go shower she kissed his finger with its new band of gold i like you in nothing but your wedding ring he headed for the shower glancing back at her as she finished washing her hands his wife he smiled big but he turned his head so she wouldnt see his grin shed think he was being silly he showered fast trying not to think of the real world that awaited back in dallas he toweled off hearing her wrap up a conversation with their boss laughter in her tone he heard her hang up then water jet into the kitchen sink he slipped on his simple gold wedding ring its slight weight welcome on his finger and pulled the towel around his waist shed mentioned dessert with a twinkle in her eye maybe theyd have a treat before lunch make love in the kitchen the sort of crazy outofbounds thing two normally proper workaholics did in their honeymoons last hours he smoothed his hair flat in the mirror he heard the glass shatter a loud tinkle babe he remembered her toes tickling his calf when they kissed if shed dropped a glass shed be risking those bare feet babe you drop something he slid his feet into his sandals ben hurried into the kitchen emily lay sprawled on the tiles as though a hand had slammed through the window and shoved her to the floor leaving a wet red huge fingerprint on her forehead emily ben knelt by her his voice soft as prayer calm not screaming because this couldnt be they had to make love eat lunch get to the airport emily please wake up nicky lynch lay low on the buildings roof steadying the snipers rifle watching the two targets arguing out the last moments of their lives he stared through the crosshairs waiting for the shot when he could take both the geek and the big guy in rapid fire rush jobs made him nervous he hadnt had enough time to prepare his body was still on belfast time six hours ahead of austin texas he blinked stay focused he told himself you going to shoot today jackies voice whispered into his earpiece his brother waited in the lobby of the office building across the street anxious for nicky to work his doubleshot magic so jackie could go inside adam reynoldss office and finish the job radio silence nicky said into his mouthpiece any day now jackies impatient sigh made an electronic crackle in nickys ear silence nicky repeated into his microphone keeping his annoyance in check killing took only a second but precautions so that the job went cleanly took time jackie was too restless he had the impatience of a fever nicky put his mind back to the kills the angle into the office where the two men argued wasnt ideal but the client had been quite specific in how he wanted the job done the big guy standing near the window wasnt quite close enough and nicky had to complete the hit with the first shot jackie would be in the office less than a minute after the two men were dead and he did not want either man breathing when his brother stepped inside to plant the goods especially the big guy nicky didnt want jackie within ten meters of that man if the two would just stop moving the honking stopandstart traffic of downtown austin jerked on the street nine stories below him a distant rumble touched the sky a spring storm deciding whether to grant a cooling rain he tuned out the noise because the prime chance for the kill shot might come at any second the office was large its narrow windows divided by white limestone he was at the same height as the targets but he had to hide close to a roof airconditioning unit and the angle was awkward he frowned best if the two stood in the same slender window frame close together but the pair stood off from each other like wary lions the geek wore a scared frown as though he were shoving aside all the numbers and facts in his oversized brain and searching for unused courage the geek damn well should be scared nicky thought nicky had read the notes about the big guy with a mix of admiration and shock it wasnt every day you got to kill such an interesting man nicky had killed thirtysix people but none so accomplished he almost wished he could have bought the big guy a pint chatted with him learned from him soaked in his exploits but the very best ones he thought always kept their secrets now the big guy laughednicky wondered what the hell was funny and the big guy moved halfway into one windows frame but not far enough for a certain shot and then the geek pulled a gun from his desk and aimed it at the big guy nicky held his breath maybe theyd do his job for him kill each other and he could just watch stay back adam reynolds said the gun made for an unfamiliar weight in his handhe had purchased it only three days before a necessary precaution he had spent five hours on the internet researching the right pistol but he hadnt spent nearly enough time practicing how to shoot adams lungs tightened with fear his back prickled with heat his tongue seemed coated with sand this was what happened when you went hunting for dangerous people sometimes they found you instead just keep him at bay adam thought help was on its way the gun did not seem to make the big man standing near the window nervous give me that before you shoot off a toe or finger or something even more valuable adam no adam said he flicked the mans business card off his desk and tossed a bound proposal at the mans feet take back your stage props asshole youre nothing but a con man the big man shrugged so i lied to you youre a liar too lets stop lying you first whats your real name the big man laughed im nobody no the problem is youre too many different people mister adam straightened the gun steadied his grip youre got more names than a cats got fleas i found them all every alias youve used in the past few months i want to know who you really are the big mans gaze narrowed he took a step away from the window a step toward adam he kept his hands at his side deal adam ill tell you who i really am and who i work for if you tell me who hired you to hunt me down i have the gun so i will ask the questions and you will answer them yes adam you do indeed have the gun the big man said as though that fact didnt really matter to him adam swallowed whats your real name my names unimportant what matters is why youre searching for me who paid you to look for me thats the only reason i arrived on your doorstep adam is because you were looking for me he crossed his arms did it occur to you that maybe im one of the good guys i i know what you are adams voice broke youre a terrorist or youre connected to a terror group oh god you could not be more mistaken the big man said he laughed youre kind of book smart and street dumb all at once arent you adam shook his head put both hands on the pistols grip to fix his aim adam this is why youre in trouble you had to break a number of laws to find me and all my aliases banking laws privacy laws federal statutes protecting classified material all that data you used to find me scattered among databases where you have no clearance or access someone gave you that access tell me who and i promise youll be safe and protected sit on the floor put your hands on your head adam said ive already called a friend of mine in homeland security theyre on their way here so if you hurt me hurt you the big man frowned doubtful you have the gun he took a step forward brilliant computer programmers dont just suddenly start finding people who never want to be found who do you work for ill shoot please stop adam didnt sound convincing even to himself please the big man risked another step toward adam youre way too nice a guy to shoot me and im not going to hurt you so give me the gun genius and lets talk nicky watched through the crosshairs the big guy was moving forward slowly and the geek was suffering the tortures of the weak not wanting to shoot a fellow human being hell then a thought occurred to nicky what if the geek did shoot the big guy will i get paid if i dont shoot them and one kills the other the thought panicked him he glued his eye to the scope take the shot leave no wiggle room for the client to argue the fee or debate whether or not services were rendered he needed the money the big guy came forward moving toward the geek calm the geek lowered the gun a fraction of an inch both men in the same window now the big man reaching for the wobbling gun dont wait in two seconds nicky lynch calculated the ramifications of the choppy wind gusting hard from the bend of lady bird lake that hugged austins downtown did the math for the deflection of the glass touched his tongue to the roof of his mouth and fired the big guy dropped nicky pivoted the barrel a fraction fired saw the geek jerk and fall stillness in the room twin holes in the window he watched for ten seconds then pulled back from the lip of the office buildings roof below him people hurried on their late afternoon errands unaware of death in their midst suited men and women walking toward the texas state capitol most with cell phones grafted to their ears a street musician braying a bob dylan song strumming a guitar in front of a case dotted with spare change a huddle of workers awaiting a bus no one looked up at the muffled sounds of the shots it had gone all right for two such difficult shots he ducked behind the airconditioning unit wiped his hands on the maintenance uniform he wore he dismantled the rifle with practiced grace he tucked the rifles parts into a duffel bag and headed for the roof stairs youre clear he said into the mouthpiece to jackie heading in jackie said going silent silent nicky signed off jackie tended to chatter and nicky didnt want him distracted a boom of thunder crackled the waiting storm starting to rise the breeze electric with the sudden shift bizarre requirements nicky thought but the client specifically wanted the job done this way murder the targets from a safe distance and then leave a manila envelope on the geeks desk the money was caviarandchampagne good enough to keep him in liquor and books for a stretch of several months in st barts he needed a vacation jackie would use his share of the money for hunting down rare johnny cash vinyl recordings and spend time scribbling more bad songs jackie and his music waste of time maybe nickyd talk his brother out of frittering away his cash get him to come drink in the caribbean sun you wanted warmth after you killed nicky thought as he reached the street in his earpiece jackie got the allclear from nicky and summoned the elevator a crowd of pinstriped lawyers walked in from the street pooling around him chatting waiting for the elevator doors to open damn he thought he didnt want to be remembered so he let the lawyers crowd the first elevator that came he thumbed the up button again and waited an extra ninety seconds for an empty elevator he rose to the top floor alone the hallway was empty no one had heard the silenced shotsno one at least had emerged from the neighboring offices in panic to crowd the hallways goodno one would remember his face as he completed his errand this assignment although a rush job was big the targets were important do it right he thought and youll shut up nickys carping jackie approached the suite the sign read reynolds data consulting the office door was locked and he opened it with a lockpick in under ten seconds he pulled his steel blade free from his coat just in case either man was spasming out the last of his life but he wasnt going to stab unless necessary not even for fun a knife wound would confuse the police he stepped inside and closed the door behind him the office was silent jackie put the large envelope under his arm the geek lay in sprawled surprise beside the desk blood spreading from his head mouth slack eyes finally vacant of brainstorms orders were to leave the sealed envelope on the desk but first jackie stepped behind the desk to take a peek at the big guy across the street nicky lynch shouldered past a crowd of techies spilling out from the parking garage ramp heading for early drinks in the warehouse district he walked up the ramp and took a left he pressed the remote for his mercedes beeped open the trunk he put the rifle case inside and slammed the trunk closed as he slid behind the wheel and started the engine his earpiece crackled jackie yelling not making sense hes gone nicky glanced into the rearview just in time to see the big guy running up behind the car drawing a gun from underneath a jacket for a half second shock seized him then he ducked for the loaded glock he kept under the seat and closed his fingers around it the drivers window exploded agony lanced his shoulder this was not happening impossible the shot had been true who sent you the big guy asked nickys mouth worked his arm didnt he fumbled for the gun with his good hand last chance answer me the big guy said nicky lifted the gun with an angry grunt the answering barrage sprayed his lifes blood across the dashboard and the front windshield jackie run nicky thought staring at the red mist then died the big guy stood at the shattered window and fired four neat tidy shots for insurance into nicky lynchs chest and head adam reynoldss gun went warm in his hand always make sure mister the big guy said he swallowed the bile in his throat today had gone all wrong time to walk away from the whole mess wrap up the package for the cops let the police chase a nobody he took a business card from his pocket and tucked it into nicky lynchs bloodied jacket he wouldnt need it anymore he hurried away from the car hiding his gun under his light jacket taking the staircase someone would spot the bulletriddled car within minutes he walked out onto the sidewalk as a light gentle rain began to drop from the marblegray sky one street over jackie ran in a panicked pellmell from the building sprinted hard toward the garage dodging traffic and oldlady shoppers and coffeeswilling lobbyists cars slammed on brakes honks jeered him as he sprinted into the street he slipped his knife into his jacket pocket his hand closing hard around the glock under his windbreaker scanning the faces behind him scared he kept the folder of photographs clutched under his arm he heard a woman shriek as he hurried up the ramp he braked on his heels and peered around the concrete pillar a woman and two men huddled around the mercedes a smear of red on the windshield one of the men was on his cell phone calling the woman had her hand clamped over her mouth as though repressing a scream jackie stepped close enough to see there was nothing he could do nicky was dead jackies throat closed on itself he remembered to breathe he turned away stumbled down the ramp the police would be here within moments he fought every urge to go to his brother and fold him into his arms swallowed the need to drop to his knees and cry the big guy wasnt dead but jackie thought with a hot rage in his heart and tears crowding his eyes he soon would be were in deep trouble sam hector said tenmilliondollar contract choked this morning im sorry sam ben forsberg said into his cell phone its a deal with the uk government to provide additional security for their embassies in four east african countries hector said i cant lose another big contract ben ive sent you the details and i want you to go through the information tonight all vacations must end sure ben was close to home the top up on his bmw because as he approached austin the spring sky clouded with rain he wished that sam hadnt called it a vacation ben no longer took vacations he had alone time away time hed only been away for six days im ready to go back to work thank god because the deals are drying up hector said i wish you would come back to work for me fulltime i need you hows the negotiation with the state department coming ben wasnt interested in rehashing that conversation he liked working freelance now and living in austin the dallas office reminded him too much of emily another precarious situation were in disagreement on five or six points undersecretary smith is being intractable on the level of training that our security personnel have to have for the next congo assignment while not wanting to pay a commensurate price which is bullshit congo is amazingly dangerous right now they need us and shes being obstinate thinking she can handle it with regular government personnel ill talk to her ben didnt expect the negotiations to be prolonged the security situation in congo was deteriorating terrorism on the rise the state department personnel stationed there needed a greater level of protection and a contract with the professional soldiers of hector global was the cheap and fast answer hector global did several million dollars worth of business with the state department each year providing armed security for its employees a new rising conflict in congo was a tragedy but an opportunity as well someone had to protect the diplomats and no one could do a better job than hector global if the situation there deteriorates it might help us close the dealshell get scared i like scared people because were in the business of making fear go away hector said you still want to use that as a motto ben laughed fear is not a good slogan whatever i also suspect shes stalling so she can get you back up to washington again ben moved into another lane headed north on mopac the major northsouth artery for west austin he exited into the suburb of west lake hills so that he could take back roads home to central austin the infamously slow austin traffic had already begun its daily dragging shuffle ben did you hear me sam dont kid you know im not ready for you cannot live in this bubble youve created for yourself now sam hector sounded less like a client and more like a chiding father you just spent five days alone ben at a resort known for catering to people twice your age emily would not want you isolating yourself ben said nothing he had found it best to endure this kind of advice in polite silence ms smith has asked me about your interests how often you come to washington what food you like to eat as soon as our negotiations are done i suspect shell ask you out the next time youre in dc does she know im a widower i told her but not every detail thats up to you email me smiths concerns on the contract and ill craft our response sam hector was silent for a moment on the other end of the line forgive me im only trying to be helpful we all worry about you sam im really fine and ill talk to you tomorrow morning take care ben sam clicked off the phone no woman had asked him out in the two years since emily died and he had no plans to ask out any woman he tried to imagine how hed react to an invitation he had nothing to give nothing to share nothing to say a slight cold terror touched his skin he lowered the cars window let fresh air wash over his face as he turned off the highway toward home he clicked on the radio a bizarre shooting in downtown austin today left two dead the announcer said and ben switched off the radio he did not like to hear about shootings two years after his wifes death the very word twisted a knife in his spine brought back the horrible memory of emily sprawled dead on the kitchen floor a bullet hole marring her forehead random pointless for no reason some unknown idiot firing rounds at empty houses he eased his grip on the steering wheel tried not to remember ben lived in tarrytown an older and expensive neighborhood on the west side of austin his house was small by the neighborhoods increasingly grandiose standardstarrytown had been invaded by megamansions towering over the original houses on the cramped lotsbut the limestone bungalow suited him he pulled into his garage just as the simmering storm broke into soft rain his flower beds needed springtime tending and the yard could use a mow he thought ben went inside his house and set his duffel bag on the kitchen floor he grabbed a soda from the refrigerator and headed back into his office he cracked open the laptop and downloaded five days worth of email most of his clients knew he was gone this week so there was less than normal he saw an encrypted note containing the specifics of sams hot uk deal he frowned at a couple of messages a request from a business magazine reporter to respond to allegations of security contractor malfeasance involving a company hed never worked with three emails from people he didnt know protesting the use of private security forces in iraq and afghanistan and emails from six people with military and security backgrounds looking for work with hector asking him for advice and help where there were millions at stake and guns involved controversy always loomed he understood peoples concerns about private contractors being used in war but the reality was that the government was offering bigdollar contracts and people of both dubious and high integrity went after them hector global was one of three hundred private companies offering security and training services in iraq alone ben was careful to work only with the contractors with good records and highly professional staffs many of them other than his biggest client were new staffed by former soldiers and unused to navigating government deals his guidance made it easier for them to win favorable terms there were well over a hundred thousand private security contractors on the ground in iraq training security forces and police protecting facilities and dignitaries the money was excellent ben had helped sam hector grow his company into a threethousandemployee behemoth in the security world with thousands more independent contractors on call to provide everything from security to computer expertise to food services a soft red glowed on his answering machines readout he decided to deal with the rest of the real world after he took a shower technically he was still on his alone time he told himself ben showered and rubbed a towel hard across his skin the mirror showed a bit of early spring sunburn on his nose and cheeks from his lake walks he was of swedish descent and the sun wasnt always gentle on his pale slightly freckled skin he smoothed out his thick thatch of blond hair with a comb of his fingers brushed his teeth and decided not to shave over the sunburn he dressed in jeans tennis shoes and a longsleeved polo shirt he reached for the soda hed left on the counter and then the doorbell rang a low long almost mournful chime two people stood on his bricked porch ben had been around enough government agents in his work to recognize them as suchthe stance the careful neutral expressions one was a petite darkhaired woman in her early thirties wearing an expensive tailored gray suit she had brown eyes and a mouth set in a frown and when ben opened the door her gaze was so fierce that he nearly took a step backward the man next to her was thin and silverhaired expressionless behind them ben saw a car with two thicknecked men in suits and sunglasses standing at attention near the passenger door mr forsberg the man said yes both showed photo ids department of homeland security office of strategic initiatives it wasnt a division at homeland ben recognized from his consulting work like fema or the secret service im agent norman kidwell this is agent joanna vochek wed like to speak with you ben blinked at the badges kidwell was in his forties with a hardscrabble face that was alien territory for a smile dark eyes that gave a glance more calculated than kind a suggestion of granite under the skin of his jaw okay about what ben asked it would be better if we could talk inside sir kidwell said uh sure he wondered if one of his clients had messed up gotten dodgy with a contract with homeland but they couldnt just call him he opened the door wider the two agents stepped inside how can i help you ben shut the door lets sit down kidwell said sure he went into the kitchen and they followed him vochek staying very close to him he noticed her glance surveying the room as if mapping every exit would you like a soda or water no kidwell said heading on a trip mr forsberg vochek pointed at his duffel bag no ive just gotten home he sat at the kitchen table kidwell sat across from him vochek stayed standing planting herself between him and the back door where have you been she asked marble falls it was a small town an hour west of austin my parents condo were your parents with you kidwell asked no theyve both passed away were you alone she crossed her arms yes are you going to tell me what this is about kidwell opened a notebook and rattled off bens full name his birth date his social security number address and home phone all correct ben nodded you have an office phone i work out of my home my cell serves as my office number kidwell kept his gaze unwavering as if a thread connected his eyes to bens do you have any other cell phone accounts no he suspected he was about to be dragged into a bureaucratic mud hole clearly a client had screwed up in a contract with homeland and he was going to have to endure endless protocol before these two tightasses got to the point you advise government contractors kidwell said ben nodded and tried a cautious smile is one of my clients in trouble no you are kidwell tucked his chin into the v of his hand between thumb and forefinger because vochek leaned against the wall do you have a client named adam reynolds no do you know him vochek asked her insistence on the word know made him more cautious if ive met mr reynolds i dont recall it he designs software for the government a oneman shop but highly effective vochek said hes a very smart guy then im sorry i dont know him sweat broke out along bens legs on his back in the cups of his palms he tried another awkward smile listen i sincerely want to help you but unless you tell me why im in trouble im phoning my lawyer kidwell pulled a photo from his jacket pocket and slid it across the table to ben do you recognize this man mr forsberg ben guessed the photo had been taken at a distance and then computerenhanced colors sharpened details made clear it showed a man short and stocky glancing over his shoulder as he walked down a busy street he wore a hat pulled low on his head its brim dripping rain he was adjusting his collar against the wet and the wind and his fingers were surprisingly delicate and long ben pulled the picture close again inspected the mans face racked his memories i dont recognize him im sorry kidwell said nicky lynch i dont know him kidwell scratched his lip he looks meek hes not his father was a torturer and gunman for the ira before he died and nicky took over the business when northern ireland got boring after the disarmament nicky went for hire hes one of the most feared freelance assassins in the world we believe hes done all sorts of nasty work for hire training alqaeda snipers in syria eliminating political resistance leaders in tajikistan and pakistan killing judges and witnesses in mexico and colombia for drug cartels now i definitely dont know him ben said are you sure vochek asked with a doubtful tone jesus yes im sure what the hell is this this afternoon we believe nicky lynch killed adam reynolds here in austin mr reynolds had called me in houston at noon asked me to come immediately to austin on a matter of national security kidwell said ben looked up from the unassuming face of the killer in the photo and shook his head what does this asshole have to do with me you tell us mr forsberg vochek interrupted now she leaned forward put her hands on the table her face close to his because nicky lynch was shot to death and your business card was in his pocket your business card was in his pocket the sudden hush in the room took on a weight explain why nicky lynch had your business card mr forsberg kidwell said ben found his voice his lungs felt filled with lead it has to be a mistake i can think of two possibilities one you are associated with lynch two you are being targeted by him vochek shrugged which is it this is a sick joke right please because it is seriously not funny not a joke kidwell said we believe lynch shot reynolds through his office window with a highpowered sniper rifle from across colorado street through a window sniper rifle emily lying on a floor the words the memory made the world swim before his eyes he squinched his eyes shut took a deep breath no this has nothing to do with me we found a proposal with your letterhead on the floor of reynoldss office vochek said help yourself ben cooperate with us but i didnt know him ben sank back to the chair give me your phone kidwell said ben slid the smartphone to him and kidwell handed it to vochek find out his recent calls she started clicking through the menus ben rubbed at his forehead with his fingertips a slow burn of anger lit in his chest piercing the haze of shock if i dont know him then your second option is someone wants me dead theres just no reason he suddenly wanted kidwell to nod to agree but the poker face stayed in place do you have any enemies kidwell asked enemies no it was the kind of grabyourguts question the police asked him after emily died and when he looked up at their faces he saw the familiar stain suspicion the same poisonous frowns the police in maui and later dallas had worn while talking to him after emilys murder suspicion had already doused his life once with acid not again not again who killed lynch we dont have a suspect vochek glanced up from studying the list of recent calls on bens phone he held his gaze with her own piercing stare then went back to studying his call log im the suspect he realized kidwell slid another picture to bena snapshot of bens business card blood smeared the edges the listed business number wasnt his cell number but his home number had been jotted in pencil he tapped a finger on the picture hope rose in his chest thats not my business phone according to the cellular company you opened a cell phone account with that number last week vochek said ben shook his head i sure as hell didnt what about this proposal you claim i wrote it outlined getting government contractors including several of your clients to finance reynoldss ideas for new software products i never wrote it ben shoved the photo back at kidwell anyone could copy my logo off my web site forge a proposal to make it appear it came from me print a fake business card they could but why he had no answer and as his shock morphed into anger he decided to turn the questions back on them if this is an investigation why arent the austin police or the fbi here to talk to me ben saw a glance he couldnt read pass between vochek and kidwell due to the highly sensitive nature of this case and how it could impact on national security we have jurisdiction over your questioning kidwell said how exactly does this impact national security i think i better but vochek cut him off this week you were scheduled on adam reynoldss outlook calendar three times explain ben shook his head i told you i was in marble falls just an hour away kidwell said you could drive back and forth with ease could have but i didnt so reynoldss calendar is complete fiction as far as me being scheduled yes silence for ten long seconds im going to give you a single chance to come clean mr forsberg do you know of any terrorist threat that adam reynolds uncovered kidwell asked no none i swear to god i dont you see my problem kidwell stood adam reynolds did significant work for our government and he was murdered today by a man with known terrorist ties your name is the only name tied to the killer and the only name thats all over reynoldss office and calendar now by our simple but effective geometry that means you have a suspected terrorist tie bens breath stopped as if a noose had closed around his throat youre wrong id like to search your house ben shook his head what homeland office are you withstrategic initiatives he remembered the notation on their badges i never heard of your group or any of these people youre trying to connect me with i want my lawyer here and i want you to get a warrant neither is necessary kidwell said vochek knelt close to bens chair cooperate with us ben and ill do everything i can to help you the only help i want is from my lawyer he stood and reached for the phone kidwell wrenched it from his hands drew a gun aimed it at bens forehead ben stepped back nearly stumbled over his chair oh god are you crazy he raised his hands palms high in surrender suddenly afraid to move this could not be happening to him youre not calling anyone kidwell noticed the blinking answering machine and hit the play key six messages the first three were from various friends inviting ben to dinner and to a ut baseball game and to go to the movies this weekend then there was a message from a telemarketer about a survey about the automotive market a reminder from the library that ben had an overdue book and then the sixth message spoken by the slightly nasal tense voice of a stranger hi ben its adam reynolds just confirming our meeting at four this afternoon ill see you in my office call me at if you need to reschedule silence in the room just the beep and the computerized voice on the recorder saying end of messages ben kidwell looked past his gun at ben youre a deal maker i strongly urge you to make a deal with us panic hummed in bens skin i swear im telling you the truth i dont know anything i dont lets get him to the office agent vochek and get a computer forensics team from houston to search every square inch of this house i want it all papers computer files phone records everything this assholes touched im not going anywhere with you ben took a step back from the gun kidwell lowered the gun toward bens legs ill shoot you in the kneecaps and well take you out on a stretcher he gestured with the gun your choice ben stared at the gun and then slowly turned and followed vochek to the front door outside the two guards waited in the backseat of the government car the wind and rain from the brief thunderstorm had passed the wind gusted a cooling breath ben got into the car the guards sat on either side of him vochek driving kidwell in the passenger seat as vochek pulled the sedan away ben glanced back through the tinted windows as his lawn sprinklers surged to life and began to shroud his house in mist like a vanishing memory one of the guards stuck a gun into his ribs sit straight eyes ahead dont move this isnt right ben thought and through the shock a horrifying notion occurred to him maybe these people werent with homeland security after all khaleds reportbeirut nothing is as it seems that idea is the deepest truth in this sorry world and now i am about to live this truth because my whole life is going to become a carefully constructed lie why because i write these words with my brothers blood on my face oh i washed the stains off weeks ago no remnant of their loss remains on my skin for anyone to see but their blood is there always an invisible mark on me the only cure is to avenge them my bosses want me to write my story as to why i have taken on this most dangerous work i can assume that my words and my handwriting will be analyzed to see if im worthy to determine my loyalty to do a psychological evaluation to see if im made ofto borrow an americanismthe right stuff i am an unlikely candidate i know to become a fighter i was the baby of the family the one who my brothers samir and gebran always tried to protect to shield from the bully to walk home from school to give advice so i didnt make an ass of myself which i am confession time prone to do i do not think i am particularly smart or brave i am angry my bosses should know exactly what they are getting in me i studied chemistry for a while then changed to business and finance i like the cleanness of math it is much less messy than life i am too formal in social settings and probably in my writing but too easygoing with those that i love i dont like loud people i love old westerns i can be a fool but i am not foolish i can be angry but i am not mad and now i think i can kill and not weep let me say this about my brothers i do not blame them they both always did what they felt was right in this world gebran was a music teacher a talented guitar player samir worked at a bank generous to a fault they had no idea of the danger they were getting into i suspect but i am walking in both eyes open facing paradise samir and gebran were two and five years older than me and they had a different set of friends more political more fiery i was more concerned with video games and girls than defiance of israel or palestinian statehood or the islamic struggle no one in beirut is surprised that i am supposedly moving to europe for school not after what happened to my family no one can ever know that im actually going to america to do my work so here is what happened samir and gebran had as i said a different set of friends far more firebrand than my lazy loafing clique i dont want to go when my brothers invite me to go see a buddy of theirs named husayn who lives near rue hamrabut my brothers are insistent and i have sadly nothing better to do on the car ride there from the southern suburbs in beirut where we lived with our parents samir turns to me in the backseat and says husayn works with a special group we are driving past buildings bombed out in the last fighting with israel mounds of rubble slowly being cleared so the buildings can rise again before they are bombed back down to their foundations an endless cycle will it take twenty days or twenty years it doesnt matter it will happen again the cycle never ends a special group i say i do not think my brother means the special olympics or volunteering with the elderly or any other helpful pastime yes a group called blood of fire sounds like a charity i say sarcastically samir ignores the edge in my voice it has been dormant for several years husayn is bringing blood of fire and its ideas back to life it is not a charity but it does good work samir peers at me through his glasses as though my reaction might be printed on my head like a news feed good work ive heard that term used before a justification for bombing and killings and terror fear worms through my guts that sunny afternoon i had no use for violence none what did it ever accomplish the knife in the hand doesnt buy security when the other man has a bigger knife perhaps you get in one stab and then youre done unless that stab pierces to the heart but i am a different boy in that backseat as we trundle toward fate and i say so what hezbollah not good enough for him like i am making a joke samir and gebran dont laugh your friend is what a terrorist try using those words together terrorist and friend in the same sentence putting breath around those words feels like a pipe inching through your throat terrorist no its the wrong word gebran says in the patient voice he uses to teach guitar chords to tenyearolds he doesnt suggest an alternate term you said you wanted to have peace in lebanon samir says watching me so do we peace across the arab world sweat lies cold against my ribs i thought we were going to his friends house for a casual dinner nothing more this is more a whole new world of more and i want no part of it i want to say mama and papa will kill you for buying into this which is true but i dont maybe the trick is that i need to see this friend of my brothers see how hes played them into joining his cause and then dismantle his approach with reason and a dose of brotherly guilt convince them both it is a bad idea strange how a stray thought a word unspoken a whim followed can change your world if id told gebran to pull over if id told them no turn the car around i want to go home if id had a bit of courage to stand up to them immediately husayn lives in a small apartment a couple of blocks away from rue hamra and its busy stores and crowds of tourists the apartment reeks of onion and cinnamon and cigarette smoke but is well furnished books in arabic and french and english crowd the shelves husayn looks like a man who practices his scowl in front of a mirror he is thin like a weed dark with a soft fleshy mouth but in his eyes a flame stands a fire that makes your bones twitch under your skin i wonder if he is high or crazy only eight or nine people are at the apartment the only one i talk to for longer than five minutes is a young man with a scar marring the corner of his mouth his lip looks twisted he tells me his name is khaled same as mine he seems nervous also like me food and drinks and i am introduced all around the baby brother or am i the promising candidate i nod and smile and shake hands and try to keep my hands steady they talk but they do not start chatting of plots or bombs or retribution they talk of politicshatred for the israelis disdain for syria aggravation and fury with the west they sound like old men not young firebrands the cigarette smoke thickens like a cloud because the windows are kept shut at husayns insistence i notice after twenty minutes that i am the recipient of many sidelong glances this is a test fine i wish to fail the test i smoke my last cigarette sip at tea and tell samir that im walking down to the corner store to get some more cigarettes i have cigarettes he says fumbling at his pocket not the kind i like whatever brand he offers i will instantly hate poor students shouldnt be picky husayn says next to him the boy with the scarred mouth nods gives me a nervous smile and offers to walk with me no ill just be a moment i say i give a falsenote awkward laugh i want out of the room maybe ill take a bus home and tell mama and papa that their two oldest sons have lost their minds i excuse myself and walk into the rain the store sits on the corner i buy the cigarettes and i stand under a store awning the warm honey of smoke calming me in no hurry to return watching the pedestrians a block away on fashionable rue hamra my brothers getting involved with a wannabe terroristslashbookworm who lives in an expensive apartment madness i start to build the arguments in my mind the words i will use to tell them theyre making a mistake blood of fire what a name i imagine the drive home as my brothers will try to convince me that theyre serving justice perhaps they are yes i understand their frustrations with the political system with the west with the rest of the arab world and the blast sounds more like a truck coughing up a ton of grit more a rumble of machinery than death i have heard explosions before this ones boom grabs my bones i freeze and then horror fills my skin i am running down the street the cigarette crushed between my fingers and i dont feel the cinder scorch my hand the boy with the scarred mouth the other khaled smacks into me knocks me down slams a foot into my chest as he keeps running i get up and run toward the apartment building smoke from husayns building roils into the rain the third floor where husayns apartment is was a body burning crumples from the window falls arms cartwheeling smashes into the rubblefilled sidewalk as i run toward it gebran i start to scream his arms that carried me burning his fingers that strummed bach and folk songs burning his dark curly hair burning he lands in front of me ten feet away i land on top of him to smother the flames i dont feel his flames i dont feel pain i feel his death pass through me hands grip me and pull me up from gebran a mask of surprise covers his dead face smoke wafts from his shoulders his hair sirens wail i bolt up the stairs fighting against a surging tide of panicked tenants fleeing the building the floor is a ruin husayns apartment and the one next to it are destroyed the fire rages in the two apartments but from the stairwell i see fragments of the dead the remains of an arm smeared along the floor a head and the shoulders of one of husayns friends burnt and torn a fetalshaped crisp that was once a person and samir the edge of the blast caught him perhaps he was coming out of the apartment to fetch me on my cigarette errand to lecture me on my rudeness for leaving and not hurrying back he is crumpled against a far unsteady wall legs bent like windchurned twigs his face pale gore seeping out of him as though he is melting his whole body turning to blood i kneel by him try to pick him up and he starts to come apart he is beyond broken kill kill them his lips manage to shape the words and he looks at me as though he doesnt know me and he dies the ceiling begins to collapse and i run down the stairs out into the streets past the sirens and the fire engines smeared with my brothers blood i run home mama and papa are standing at the doorway watching me stagger toward them the television is full of the bombing i have to find the words to tell them samir and gebran are dead i dont even remember what i say probably samir and gebran are dead papa shakes his head keeps shaking his head mama screams they are lost in their grief and shock they clutch at me suddenly their only child when they can speakwhen i can speakthey ask questions no i do not know why the apartment was bombed no husayn i had never met him before he was my brothers friend no i only went to get cigarettes i was only gone a few minutes papa starts to wheeze in shock who did this i ask kneeling before the television to watch the news footage who has claimed responsibility because whatever division of the police or counterterrorism group has killed blood of fire will surely be trumpeting their victory through his tears papa shakes his head no one has claimed it yet then that means the israelis the cia perhaps a rival cell i think of how hamas and fatah in the palestinian camps happily murder each other who is this terrible friend this husayn mama demands then she is screaming a new trill of grief because papas hand closes over his shirt disappointment in his eyes but also a surprising relief he slumps into his chair we call an ambulance i am calm on the phone me bloodied and singed and battered papa dead in his chair mama clutching my arm we stand looking at papa in his recliner my hair smelling of burnt blood mama sobbing our world is gone gone in an hour i want to kill someone for the first time in my life and i dont know how to who to hunt for who to hate the police talk to me in the days and the weeks that follow i am questioned for hours i can give them nothing i never say the words blood of fire aloud the papers argue that the murdered men were a peacecommitted organization cut down by the mossad or the cia no arrests are made no one knows who the boy with the scarred mouth is rumors fly the boy was an american agent an israelibribed traitor who planted the bomb and made his escape nothing proven but now i know the truth mama sits at her window and moans and cries and the sound of it will drive me slowly insane the sound of her grief cuts me slow and deep like a sword drawn over my back again and again laying all my pain and hate and anger bare that night i make a simple vow those who destroyed my family will pay with blood spilled a thousand times more my promise sounds ancient it feels modern timeless hatred doesnt seem to expire it is why i am coming to america and am eager to do my duty teach put a motherly hand on the big mans shoulder ran her other one across his burr of hair you literally dodged a bullet the relief in her face was vivid pilgrim teach leaned close to him it wasnt his real name but it was the name she had used for the long dark ten years of working together so it was as real as anything else in his jigsaw life pilgrim nodded i must have moved just enough as he fired and it saved me i felt the shot pass by my head i hit the floor and the sniper thought hed taken me pilgrim stepped past teach into the den in the rental house which stood on a quiet bend of lake travis near austin teach and her assistant barker had already started tearing down the scant equipment in the safe house erasing the laptops drive looping cables they always packed lightly so they could vanish quickly she told barker to finish loading up the cars pilgrim sat at the table rubbed the back of his head as though the bullet had left a trail in his hair i should have just kidnapped adam forced him to tell us how he found us who he worked for he shook his head i dont like losing teach we couldnt tip our hand early that we were watching him you made the only approach possible whoever he works for didnt want him talking you should have brought him back here this from barker stepping back inside the house to pick up a box containing eavesdropping equipment pilgrim wondered if the kid had wiped the milk off his lip he couldnt be more than twentythree or so bespectacled and thin he had more opinions than experience pilgrim ignored him adam thought i was a terrorist god only knows what he told homeland ill derail that with a few phone calls teachs face was normally florid a little plump but now her skin was pale and her mouth a thin slash of worry she was in her fifties slightly built bookish with a polished southern accent this sniper pilgrim said i recognized his face nicky lynch rumor was he killed two cia officers three years ago in istanbul i remember teach said she stood next to him inspected his head as a mother might a scrape he shrugged her off hon give me info on his car pilgrim described the car gave her the license number im sure it was a rental paid for under a false name or stolen for the job barker track the plate when we get out of here she nodded at barker still standing in the corner lets get the bags in the car hon were heading back to new york barker nodded he paused at the door im glad youre okay pilgrim thanks teach waited for barker to step outside and closed the door behind him you nearly get shot and you dont call me immediately im having a really unpleasant idea only you and me and barker knew about the operation and foreign gunmen dont just show up in a place like austin someone had advance word of our operation barkers clean teach went to the window as if to regard barker afresh as he loaded the car did reynolds give you any information before he died as to how he found us no he went into the bedroom hed used started packing a few essentials into his bag teach rubbed her temples whoever adam reynolds was working for has obliterated his tracks barkers found nothing unusual in reynoldss life no unexplained money no accounts no suspicious emails or phone calls nothing which scares me were talking very smart very dangerous people clearly they killed their own boy genius for talking to me it narrows the suspects she shrugged terrorist organizations organized crime drug cartels foreign intelligence services she offered a wan smile no shortage of people who hate us hon pilgrim went to the bathroom splashed cold water on his face a ghostly heat tingled in his hair left over from the bullet as though its close path had singed his scalp just imagination he told himself and he stuck his fingers under the cool jet of water he didnt want teach to see his hands shake it was strange to think how close he had come to his brains painting the walls and the desk and the surprised face of adam reynolds the poor dumb brainiac pilgrim dried his face reynolds all he wanted to do was good exposing us is not in the national interest she said its necessary for our work that we remain unknown pilgrim shook his head im tired of whats necessary necessary sucks i want to do whats decent she put her hands on his shoulders pilgrim you do every day youre tired and rattled youll feel better when were back home well regroup plan our next move screw the next move suppose theres evidence in his office about the cellar something i didnt find what do we do hide take up new names and new lives again you knew what our work was when you signed up you knew it entailed sacrifice dont lecture me about sacrifice sacrifice implies a choice you had a choice today teach crossed her arms you should have let nicky lynch believe he succeeded track him and see who the hell hired him instead you pull brainless macho crap you probably liked him realizing hed missed yes ill long treasure the surprise on his face before i blew him away lose the sarcasm you didnt analyze the situation and i want to know why he sat on the edge of the bed i didnt think becausei dont want to do this work anymore the realization was clear in his head unexpected but sharp she came to him and touched his arm and it made pilgrim remember the old days when she first found him offered him a choice better than a lifetime in a dank hellhole of a prison that smelled of ancient stone tears and blood youre just shaken pilgrim shrugged off her hand im done adam reynolds found me when no one else ever has he knew the aliases i used on the jobs in india and canada and syria he could have plastered the news channels about us we cant hide anymore wrong we simply find out how he found us i dont want to work for the cellar anymore i want a normal life her frown deepened stop this nonsense youre not resigning pilgrim teach was like a mother who didnt hear what she didnt want to hear he thought were dead if our aliases can be exposed i know you well enough that you wont walk away from us while were under attack she picked up her phone started punching in a number he heard his own words again i want a normal life he touched his pocket the notebook was there where he always kept it he wanted to go to the lakes shore sharpen a pencil draw the face as he remembered it as he dreamed about it but not now pilgrim clicked on the television surfed to a news channel cnn showed an aerial shot of a downtown austin building police securing the scene the reporter said one man was confirmed dead in a sniper shooting and another death in a nearby parking garage might be related no mention yet that the dead guy in the garage was a known assassin no release of reynoldss name yet it was too early the talking heads droned on the reporter on the scene parceling atoms of worthless data and trying to make her words meaty and relevant teach got off the phone weve got seats on the evening flight to laguardia pilgrim made a walkingaway gesture with his fingers have a good trip you cant resign barker stepped into the bedroom doorway he straightened his glasses good lord are you quitting false alarm its the shock of nearly getting shot teach said your timing sucks a strange smile touched barkers face thats what i said he cant leave us now teach started she turned to barker and she stopped her body blocked pilgrims view of the young man and he stood barker held a glock millimeter aimed at them pilgrim felt disjointed still blinking from the surprise of surviving a sniping and the slight bespectacled barker reminded him of poor foolish adam reynolds and he thought nerds with guns then his survival instinct kicked in an engine in his chest and he calculatedeight feet to reach barker with teach between them he couldnt get to barker before barker shot teach this is disappointing teach said i apologize barker said nothing personal pilgrim was silent barker was stupid tipping his hand early therefore he would do something else stupid pilgrim put the worn tired look back on his face one that would make barker smug teach kept her voice calm but pilgrim behind her could see a shift in her stance a balancing to shift her weight forward pilgrim said you work for the same boss as adam reynolds wow give me a moment to deal with the staggering awe i feel at your mental prowess the gun gave barker a sense of power shining in his cocky smile retirement is definitely in your future barker kept the gun locked on pilgrim put the gun down ill pay you better than whoever youre working for teach said shut your mouth he said with an eye roll pilgrim said why are you waiting because there was no good reason for the kid not to shoot them both he risked a step to the left teach stayed still im unarmed and i still make you nervous consider it your last compliment barker said footsteps approached boots crunching into pebbles teach had chosen a rental house with a gravel drivewaythe stones announced feet or tires with a growl they want teach alive barker said so cooperate and she doesnt get hurt too much information pilgrim thought what about me he asked youre dead barker said and teach rushed him drawing the guns aim barker hesitated for a fraction of a second not wanting to shoot her obeying his orders teach rammed into barker catching him in the door frame pilgrim seized the gun from barkers hand in a swift downward wrench that broke barkers wrist with a sickening crack barker screamed and dropped to his knees teach took the gun from pilgrim and moved into the den their guns were gone hidden by barker she locked the back door three more guns upstairs closet teach said pilgrim ran up the stairs in a closet he found two semiautomatic pistols and a rifle a crash boomed downstairs glass breaking a door being knocked loose from its frame he grabbed the rifle and barreled a third of the way down the stairs he saw chaos barker still lay splayed on the floor face contorted in pain teach squeezed off a shot at the first man through the door but missed by a fraction of an inch before she could fire again a darkhaired bruiser of a thug struck her in the arm with the butt of his rifle she lost the gun and he grabbed teach as she staggered backward then shoved her out the door following her two other men covered the room with semis pilgrim raised the rifle tried to angle the awkward shot past the railing barker screamed on the stairs the men spun the guns toward him and opened fire the railing splintered around pilgrim as he retreated upstairs blood wet his temple cut by the flying debris he reached the second floor covered the stairs with the rifle and backed up next to the window he peered through the glass as he dragged her across the yard teach struggled against her captor hitting a wellplaced blow to his throat but he had a hundred pounds and twenty fewer years on her and with a jackhammer backhand he knocked her into the scrub she fell like a stringless puppet to the rainwet lawn silence below not a cry from barker no feet slamming on the stairs the men in the house were waiting him out pilgrim watched the bruiser throw an unconscious teach over his shoulder and start a hard run toward the oak thickets behind the house pilgrim shattered the window with the rifle butt took careful aim and fired the bruiser jerked and fell he and teach crashing to the grass pilgrim knew he should turn his eyes back to the staircase to the immediate threat in the house but he kept his gaze locked on teach he heard an angry bellow from downstairs get up run he willed her she didnt move jesus maybe hed hit her the idea iced his heart he didnt see blood on her but the way she lay slumped blocked by the bruiser he couldnt see her clearly he heard a barked angry half curse half command you can hold a gun in one hand cant you idiotin rapid heavily accented english the leader must be talking to barkerthen position yourselves wait for the dog to panic spoken in arabic first an exira sniper and now these assholes it was an international gathering to kill him he swallowed past the thick dryness in his mouth and a peculiar serenity filled him and he thought you guys made a really long trip to die he glanced around the room the only furnishings were a table and an office chair not much for cover he calculated how long it would take him to get down the stairs if both men turned away from the stairwell toward the window not long enough not running he moved to the lip of the floor checked the stairs empty that meant barker and the two gunmen were taking cover waiting for him to expose himself on the trapped boundary of the stairs where his options were limited they on the other hand had an entire room in which to move and catch him in their cross fire he returned to the window and saw teachs chest rise in a hitch of breathing she was okay just out but two men emerged from the dense grove of oaks and ran toward her if he fired at them the three men waiting below would know he was aiming out the window busy with multiple targets not at the stairs in moments the trio would rush upstairs and obliterate him with the semis stalemate one of the men with hair dyed blond and waxed into spikes threw teach still unconscious over his shoulder he raised high a pistol nestled the barrel against her head where twigs tangled in her graying hair pilgrim understood fire at us she dies the man turned and ran awkwardly teach bouncing on his shoulder the second man wearing gaudy wraparound sunglasses covered their retreat into the woods they left the dead bruiser in the grass he needed a distraction nothing at hand but the table the chair he noticed the chair had wheels on its bottom he readied his pistols left the rifle on the floor the hardwood floor was a minefield and one wrong creak would tip the gunmen to his position he slowly opened the window over the porch roof directly above where the gunmen had entered he fed the chair through the window carefully and propped it on the windowsill halfin and halfout the wheels positioned against the lip of the frame he picked up the glocks and slid quiet as a cat across the hardwood to the head of the stairs the gunmen and barker still werent standing on the stairs waiting for him cowards he thought pilgrim held the two glocks lifted one aimed and fired the bullet smacked into the chairs back the force propelled the barely balanced wheeled chair out the window it made a rattling descent down the shingled sloping porch roof the noise was huge he heard a downstairs yell imagined the gunmen turning toward the window believing he scrabbled across the shingles in a desperate escape attempt pilgrim threw himself down the stairs his hair brushing the ceiling ignoring the coming agony of impact in the flash of the fall he saw a skinny gunman at the window whirling back toward him with surprise as the chair bounced on the lawn barker huddled at the window cupping his damaged wrist a second gunman crouched with his semi at the ready but aimed at the stairs themselves a foot or two lower than pilgrims falling path the second gunman fired and the edge of the stairs erupted into splinters pilgrim fired three times with the two guns in the scant seconds before he crashed into the floor the first bullet caught the skinny gunman in the face the second pierced barkers forehead the last winged the second gunman in the leg pilgrim hit the floor his left shoulder taking the brunt debris flying around him the second gunman pain twisting his face stumbled and tried to aim again pilgrim ignored the agony and fired catching the gunman in the throat he jerked backward and his last spray of bullets dotted the wall above pilgrim the gunman collapsed pilgrims whole body hurt get up theyre kidnapping her get up he had just taken a fullstory jump to a tile floor his left arm raged in pain but a good shake told him it wasnt broken he staggered to his feet testing the weight the skinny gunman and barker were dead the other gunman still breathed gurgled stared up at him with confused eyes pilgrim reeled out of the house he loped along the path the kidnappers had taken into the dense growth of oaks and cedar how much time since they took her a minute two he heard a car start tires tickle gravel an engine accelerate he couldnt see the car he lurched onto a back road and saw a silver van blast from the roadside he ran back to the house he aimed his gun at the dying gunman where do they take her he asked in arabic the dying man spat saliva and blood at him ill get you to a doctoryou can live see your family again where do they take her the mans eyes went sightless pilgrim frantically searched the body just a matchbook and a crushed pack of american cigarettes the matchbook was silver and red with the words blarneys steakhouse in silver print with an address in frisco texas and a phone number frisco he remembered was north of dallas a fastgrowing suburb he hurried over to barkers body stupid stupid kid but he wished he hadnt killed him in the flurry of shots barker could have answered all his questions but you couldnt always shoot to wound he found a cell phone and wallet with drivers license in barkers pocket and he took bothmaybe he could crack open a trail to whoever had induced barker to turn traitor he found nothing on the skinny gunman except a wallet containing a wellhandled picture of an equally skinny woman and two small skinny children shy smiles on their faces he dropped the picture on the floor nausea braiding his stomach you really shouldnt have a family in this business pilgrim ran he would clean up the mess later if he lived but if teach was gone the cellar was gone as well so what did it matter what the police found dead men in an empty rentedforcash dump of a lakeside house a laptop wiped clean guns no explanations no clues he dragged himself to his car and roared down the driveway only one road threaded through the lakeside neighborhood lake travis was a sprawling stretch of water a stones throw from austin its edges lined with homes condos and marinas this neighborhood was fairly quiet several of the homes were rentals that werent always occupied during the week the car had four minutes on him maybe he nearly careened through a stop sign that fed onto highway a major curving road that connected the northwest and the southwest edges of the city which way had the kidnappers gone to his right toward the bottom of a curve a red light caught several cars one was a silver van a horrible treacherous thought occurred to him he wanted to resign he could just turn left drive the opposite direction fewer retirement opportunities were more decisive and clear have a normal life a life outside the shadow a life in sunlight with no one shooting at his head he could almost taste the beer he had not been drunk in ten years not out of a dedication to sobriety but because drunk meant slow and he could never afford to be slow to be anything but constantly aware of every movement around him no more he would go to the airport toss his guns in the trash buy a ticket pick the furthest destination from the austin airport get drunk on the miniature vodkas they served on the plane maybe he could even try to have his old life back no he dismissed the thought as soon it came to him that was an impossibility so just turn left drive away this whole job was a trap a trap to draw you and teach out of the shadows it freaking worked they got her so get out now he had made enough sacrifices the light flashed green the silver van rumbled into motion he remembered the first time he saw teach he lay on a cold stone floor in indonesia cursing at the stupidity of his mistake his ineptness at getting caught hed been beaten with rubber batons off and on for a week hed glanced up and she stood at the bars he first thought why has a librarian come to see me the guard opened the cell door for her and then greased with money he walked away she stepped inside the cell and inspected it with a frown she knelt by him and said listen you say yes or no nothing more when im done to the cia youre nothing they arent ever going to acknowledge you exist i was in the same mess myself once that you are i was in a prison in moldova the food appears to be halfway edible here lucky you he tried to speak but his mouth wouldnt work she said you can either stay in prison or you can work for me hardest work youll ever do probably will get you killed but its all for good the most difficult good we can do but everything about you must change nothing of the man you were will remain he held his breath it was a hallucination an offer out of here it couldnt be she reached and touched his face so he would know she was real she waited to see if he understood what her offer meant the price hed pay or you can stay who you are and enjoy this lovely cell for the rest of your life yes or no he watched her for ten silent seconds decision of a lifetime he decided to believe her and whispered yes then ill have to get you out of here she said be patient ill come see you tomorrow ill have to negotiate a number of bribes and well have to fake your death she made this outrageous statement as though it were simply the final humdrum errand on a long list to his surprise she brushed the matted dirty hair from his eyes a caress that was kind and gentle she got up and left the cell and vanished down the dank stone corridor and he blinked as though she had been a dream but everything she promised she did shame at his doubt turned his stomach necessary shed said you always did what was necessary another decision of a lifetime to make he thought right now ten seconds later pilgrim turned right easing eight cars behind the kidnappers van as it rumbled toward austin vochek drove the car with kidwell ben and the two guards toward downtown traffic thickened a set of streets to the north had been closed by policeben remembered hearing the tidbit on the radio about a shootingand the area between austins highend second street and the restaurantandclubheavy warehouse district thronged with concertgoers for a bluesfocused music festival off second street vochek pulled up in a lot next to an abandoned squat brick hotel called the waterloo arms every other building on the block had been redone or undone in the latest spasm of urban gentrification an early evening crowd of wellheeled music lovers and drinkers wandered among the bars restaurants and music venues along the streets a wire fence blocked the lot of the hotel a sign announcing that the waterloo arms was being remodeled into premier office and restaurant space a thousand words crowded the back of bens throat arguments in defense of his good name but he decided to keep his mouth shut say nothing more until he got a lawyer silence was the refuge of the calm and the innocent as they neared the waterloo joanna vocheks eyes met his in the rearview and he wasnt sure what he saw in her brown eyes pity or confusion or disgust the guards tucked their guns into holsters under dark jackets kidwell turned to face ben were going to get out of the car now were walking into the building no one else is inside if you run if you scream i will hit you so hard in the spinal juncture in your neck that i might very well paralyze you for life do you understand me ben saw vocheks gaze flash again in the mirror as though kidwell were crossing a line but she said nothing yes ben saw the shine of ambition in kidwells eyes of course a highprofile case like this was a rocket to ride a friend whod made a personal plea for kidwells aid a man who helps companies score highly lucrative contracts and a notorious assassin linking the two together the possibilities smacked of deep and headlinescreeching scandal and bringing that scandal to light was an ideal career booster for kidwell they got out of the car vochek and kidwell walked on each side of ben as the guards unlocked the gates the group walked under the haloes of concertina wire to keep out the vandals and the curious the two men in suits peeled off from them taking stations at the fence no one was inside the waterloo it looked nearly ready for office tenants kidwell vochek and ben took an elevator up five flights to a remodeled floor they walked down a short corridor and into a windowless room it held a table and three chairs a palmsized digital recorder sat on the table sit down kidwell said and ben obeyed kidwell turned on the recorder gave the date the time and stated that ben was speaking willingly kidwell began to pace hands behind his back vochek stood in the corner not looking at ben outline your dealings with adam reynolds kidwell said ben leaned close to the recorder this is ben forsberg and i protest at how ive been treated im innocent ive been denied a call to legal counsel kidwell hit ben once from behind a closed fist impacting behind his ear and bens face slammed down into the desk kidwell erased the recording gave his intro again stopped the recorder kidwell vochek offered ben a handkerchief for his bloodied nose were breaking him agent vochek kidwell said it as a statement of fact now you dont need to assault him she said our mandate our mandate says do the job ask for forgiveness later vochek stayed in the corner her expression unchanged but ben saw a creeping of color of anger touch her cheeks kidwell leaned close to ben ben how much you help me is how much i help you im going to turn on the recorder and youre going to talk talk till your throats raw or im going to turn off the recorder again and ill get one of those tough young guys downstairs and let him beat the shit out of you i bet youve never truly been beaten ben i bet you dont really know how much a solid fifteen minutes of fist against flesh will hurt he turned on the digital recorder again the victim adam reynolds phoned you at home to confirm a business meeting describe the nature of the meeting you are threatening the wrong guy ben said his clients were important people they would be his allies in clearing up this nightmare sam hector is my biggest client he runs hector global in dallas i know who sam hector is kidwell said he does millions of dollars worth of contracting for homeland security hell vouch for me hes a longtime friend youre right homeland security does a great deal of business with mr hector so if i call him and tell him to drop you as a consultant he will kidwell glanced at vochek joanna get mr hectors number for me well call him on bens own phone i think we could learn more by asking ben do as i ask please yes sir she started to navigate through the numbers on bens smartphone a frown on her face your biggest client youre going to lose him ben i promise hector will pick us over you tell me about your meeting with adam if i could help you i would god knows i would a hot tickle caught in bens throat im going to call every firm that contracts with homeland security and tell them youre under suspicion of consorting with a known terrorist youll be blackballed youll never work in this

friend im going to freeze their accounts as well rage flooded ben surged past the fear he felt you cant absolutely you cannot whatever i do it will be on your head kidwell raised his hands in mock surrender ben turned to vochek you seem reasonable agent vochek please you cant endorse what hes doing i dont endorse what youre doing ben which is stonewalling us tell him what he wants to know she held the phone out to kidwell i found sam hectors number are we calling him kidwell smiled are we ben ben swallowed id like to know if theres any other evidence against me kidwell stopped his pacing and pulled a folded piece of paper from his pocket you have three other cellular accounts no ben shook his head kidwell read off three numbers all with area codes in austin those arent my phone numbers they were opened in your name a week ago tell me which branch opened the accounts i want someone to id me as the guy who conducted the transaction you rented office space last week off north lamar kidwell read an address off the paper wrong the office was rented through an agent sparta consulting never heard of them i never hired an agent maybe this is a case of identity theft vochek said

kidwell said talking to you is like talking to brick a dark scowl crossed kidwells face do any of these new phone numbers point to adam reynolds or nicky lynch ben asked he had to keep them he thought on the defensive force them to acknowledge a weakness in their case because they were wrong to kidwell vochek said we just got the records faxed over to us adam reynolds only made calls today to bens new cell number and home to your office in houston and several calls to a number in dallas vochek showed kidwell two printouts bens new cell phone number has several calls to reynoldss office fantastic ben said i want to know the time of all those calls i supposedly made because im betting i can prove i didnt make them vochek started to bring him the sheets and kidwell stopped her no show him nothing ben spoke to vochek meeting her gaze with his own before you start threatening me or bullying my clients you better check your evidence more closely you better have it be watertight because sam hectors a moverandshaker in dc and i doubt you want to be accusing his friends especially me i helped make him a wealthy man a powerful man kidwells lips went tight ben wanted the heat of the exchange to pass he wanted to let kidwell save face for his own sake may i please go to the bathroom ben said kidwell switched off the recorder and nodded his assent as if he welcomed a few minutes of quiet thought vochek escorted him down the hall ben washed his face twice cleaning the blood from his nose the ache faded to a dull throb at least it wasnt broken he went back out into the hallway vochek stood with arms crossed is this when you pretend to be the good cop no you cant be worse than kidwell you know hes breaking the law in how hes dealing with me i cant imagine this is how homeland security operates i know too many good and dedicated people who work there to believe kidwells typical he shook his head office of strategic initiatives i dont recall ever seeing that name on

innocent he said until i get counsel im unsure why i should help kidwell steamroll me he shook his head i thought i could reason with you i saw how you looked at him when he went nuclear on me ben but she went silent and ben walked away from her they went back into the room sit your ass down kidwell said ben sat he looked again at vochek who lingered in the doorway ill check what you say but you consider whats going to happen to you if youve lied to me think long and hard about it ben knock on the door if theres anything else you want to share to save us time kidwell got up and turned out the lights and walked out vochek gave ben a backward glance the door clanged shut behind them killing the soft envelope of light from the hallway and ben sat in total darkness hes soft kidwell said as vochek sat down at the laptop hell do exactly what we expect deny plead for a lawyer but when he gets confronted with more evidence hell crack im not so sure she said why heres the hole in all this mess ben strikes me as an intelligent guy and he barely tried to cover his tracks people are idiots or so arrogant they think they wont get caught kidwell said i want to find every link between him and adam reynolds find this sparta consulting that rented the office for him see how forsbergs tied to it i want to know everything forsbergs done or bought or who hes talked to in the past few days she opened her laptop saw a new email from their office in houston titled forsberg report she opened it and scanned it and said norman read this her throat went dry norman kidwell leaned close read the email and smiled goodness mr innocent here left out a key detail the kidnappers van suddenly powered into high speed along fm road a winding snake of pavement cut into the side of limestone cliffs they spotted me pilgrim knew the van dipped and wove through traffic rocketing along the curving road pilgrim stayed with them whipping around a minivan and a porsche to narrow his distance from the van the kidnappers had not waited to see how their compatriots had fared after the barrage of gunshots at the lake house which meant they either assumed pilgrim was a dead man or they had orders not to look back getting teach away must be their priority if he could grab her back he could end this nightmare his eyes stungblood running into his eyebrow and eye his body ached like hed been beaten with pipes cars peeled out of the pathway of the van as the driver rode the horn powering through a red light missing by inches a honking lexus sideswiping a bmw sending it into a spin pilgrim dodged both of the cars stayed close to the van the van roared up the incline sparks flying from a swipe against the guardrail the van overcompensated veering into oncoming traffic and then easing back just in time to avoid a headon with a pickup truck full of high school students pilgrim could see the teenagers oshaped mouths their faces contorted in screams as the van missed them by a hair end this now pilgrim powered his bmw up close to the passenger side the spikyhaired blond leaned out the passenger window and opened fire with a shotgun pilgrim dropped back the hail of pellets pocked the windshield the van skittered back into the wrong lane and wove like a drunken dancer to avoid three cars pilgrim saw the disbelieving faces of the drivers all heading back to suburban comfort after an extralong day of pushing paper or making phone calls or chained to emails death suddenly inches from them as he tried to give the van room to maneuver an empty stretch of road lay ahead there must be a red light on the other side of the hill stopping the flow of cars pilgrim thumbed down the passenger window floored the bmw past the van spun across the empty asphalt so he straddled the lanes he aimed his gun at the vans front tires and fired through the open window flashes of bullets sparking against the tire cover and bumper told him hed missed he was hurting his arm wasnt steady the van plowed past him the spiky blond leaning past the driver and leveling fire into the front of the bmw pilgrim ducked as the windshield shattered he sat up as the van passed and floored the car trying to catch up but he felt one of the damaged tires part from the rim and he overcorrected as the road curved the crippled bmw smashed through a railing onto a sharply sloping hill sliding thirty feet downward in a dust of limestone scrabble and hammering into the cedars lining a landscaped backyard he blinked broken glass littered his hair and his lap the passenger door was crumpled by a tree the engine died he opened his door clambered to his feet he was unhurt but the bmw was undriveable pilgrim stumbled then found his footing on the scrabble he ran into the backyards house kicking open the back door a family stood by a dinner table that faced onto the yard a dad a mom two teenage girls they all stared at him over their pot roast salad and potatoes au gratin dinner smelled delicious he raised the gun aimed it at the dad pardon the intrusion he said i need your car the mom retreated back to the kitchen counter tossed him the keys pilgrim caught them with one hand and said thanks he hated the next part he ordered the family into a utility room without an exit closed the door shoved a chair up hard against the knob you sit here for the next two hours ive got a cop radio so you call the cops im back and you do not want me coming back here he yelled through the door he needed them scared to the bone he needed them to give him enough time to vanish he could hear the parents comforting the girls with whispers the keys were to a marooncolored volvo station wagon he roared out of the driveway turned back onto fm road a police car stood where the bmw had peeled through the railing and he drove by at the speed limit and didnt glance over at the officers who would probably find and free the family in the next ten minutes he topped the next hill and floored the station wagon the van was long gone he drove a couple of miles hoping hed winged a tire given the van a flat but they were gone he headed right as fm road came to an end and forked into two separate streets headed down a side road pulled into a chinese restaurants parking lot tried to marshal his brain where would they take teach and who could help him he had no one to call that was the beauty of the cellaryou never knew the other operatives real names or how to reach them barker had a real name that wasnt barker and probably had two or three other names he operated under pilgrim was just the name pilgrim used in the cellar as he lived through a series of false names no one could betray you except teach who was the only person who knew every detail of every job her brain was the prize her brain could break the cellar put every operative in the group in prison or in crosshairs it was an unusual opponent he thought who could hire an exira assassin and a group of arab gunmen to come to texas to do dirty work and barker had claimed to find nothing unusual in adam reynoldss bank accounts or email recordsbut since barker had been in the enemys pocket then he would have lied and destroyed any evidence linking adam reynolds and himself back to the enemy pilgrim thumbed through the call log on barkers cell phone if barkers day was to end with teach kidnapped and pilgrim dead then the traitorous young man didnt have to be overly careful in erasing his tracks the call log held what was to be expected as theyd worked their job on reynolds over the three days calls to teach calls to pilgrims phone but there was a call to an austin local number pilgrim didnt recognize pilgrim drove toward central austin on koenig lane he saw what he wanted a small coffee house with a sign in its window offering free internet access he went inside early evening the shop wasnt busy a row of three sleek computers sat on a far counter and he sat at one and launched a browser it opened onto a news page and he saw a scattering of headlines senate committee demands cia develop more human intelligence resources in the mideast for the war on terror a football star enters rehab a sniper shooting in austin texas he scanned the news report no naming of the dead men yet no mention of a man seen leaving the scene sir are you all right he glanced at the barista behind the counter and then realized he must look like hed crawled out of a train wreck she was a pretty woman of college age and she pointed at his cut forehead youre bleeding oh am i he went to the coffee stand and grabbed napkins dabbed at his forehead blood flecked the paper i took a fall im okay are you sure she asked im fine a medium latte please thats whatll fix me up he tested a smile the barista nodded to him and returned to the machine he sat googled the austin phone number hed found on barkers cell no listing he waited for the barista to call that his latte was ready but she brought it to him on the house she said as he stood to reach for his wallet no really sir the barista said im guessing youve had a crappy day its on the house kindness was a stranger and for a moment he didnt know what to do thank you he said thanks a lot she smiled and went back to the coffee bar he sipped the latteit was energy and stimulant and calories all of which he needed the door jingled a man and his teenage daughter coming inside the girl smoothing her auburn hair against a gust of damp wind he watched them laugh and debate what to order a heaviness filling his gut and his chest that should be you he thought maybe it can be when this mess is done he turned back to the computer he used the browser to access an online database for the government where the phone companies both cell and landline were required to list every issued number he logged in using a password teach had stolen from a cia officer and given to him and searched for the number the database did not give him the phones location but it told him that the phone belonged to mckeen property company and the billing address was on second street in downtown austin he jumped back to google maps and searched for the address he finished the latte and hurried to his stolen car not looking at the father and the daughter laughing over their coffees jackie lynch sat hunched at the bar the granite cool under his palms he had stumbled along the downtown streets when he realized he was going to have to call the boss explain the job was an unmitigated disaster nicky dead hed seen a neon harp advertising guinness in a bar window and hed lurched inside ordered a pint in a hoarse whisper drank it down fast took a long breath told himself not to cry ordered a second pint because as his father often said no bird flies home on one wing home he had lost his brother and his mentor nicky was the brains of the business jackie barely knew how to deal with dangerous clients assessing contracts and their risks devising escape routes managing money in numbered accounts now theyd failed a job for a very powerful man he stared down at the counter he still clutched the sealed envelope he was supposed to have dumped it on adam reynoldss desk after nicky killed the targets but in the shock of only one corpse in the office instead of two he had simply turned and run out the door he left his halffinished pint of guinness and edged over to the bars window a few blocks away the streets around the parking garage and reynoldss office building were closed in a police cordon if they hadnt already he knew the cops would discover nickys modified heckler amp koch psg rifle in the trunk someone would see the bulletholed window in the building or find reynoldss body put the evidence together no way he could plant the envelope now impossible the client would just have to understand a band in the corner began to tune up on a small stage a guitarist and a piano player playing riffs of one of his favorite johnny cash songs the tennessee stud he loved music nearly as much as he loved his brother and for a moment he was tempted to not call the client to vanish go back to belfast listen to his records and curl up in bed but no that was selfish running away meant nickys killer walked jackie was the family business now he had to be a man nicky had always been the grownup but those days were nothing but mist music was nothing compared to blood he moved to a corner table far from potential listeners and punched the number he and nicky were supposed to call to confirm the job was done the phone had been left for them in their hotel room and they were supposed to call only once the number had a area code and jackie knew it was dallas hed looked it up out of curiosity in the yellow pages at the hotel the night before it rang three times then a man answered yes at first he couldnt speak then he said it went bad nickys dead he explained he could sense a simmering anger building on the other side of the phone if you had called earlier i would have been able to warn my other team jackie bit his lip other team the first man you all were supposed to kill is called pilgrim the job had a second component the kidnapping of a woman who is pilgrims boss missing pilgrim meant he killed four more of my men after he killed your brother youre going to whine and my brothers dead jackie thought no sir not today not my problem he snapped you dont tell me the big picture then dont hold me accountable for it thats your mistake not mine he tried to put the iron in his voice hed heard nicky use with a troublesome client it was never a good idea to piss off an assassin no matter who you were a painful stretch of silence jackie thought first hand you play alone and you screw up did you deliver the package to reynoldss office the clients voice was ice no sir deliver the package now the rage was clear absolutely not jackie said cops are crawling over that office like goddamned fleas best to simply assert what was undoubtedly true i can see them from here the duo began to play a plaintive willie nelson song and the voice said where are you uh a bar a bar disbelief and fury crammed into two words im not drinking the surviving members of the other team will pick you up you miss the rendezvous and ill tell them your mistake is the reason why half their team is dead im not sure what theyll cut off firstyour tongue or your hand jackie swallowed the rock in his throat and then what you help them finish the job of killing pilgrim jackie wasnt eager to face a man whod defied nickys bullet and killed five men today but he had no choice he told himself the job wasnt about the payment it was about payback nicky would have hunted this pilgrim bastard night and day to avenge jackie jackie tried to put steel in his voice where do i meet your men sam hector sat at his desk five cell phones spread before him waiting for the call that would change his life with one hand he clicked an antique chinese abacus he owned a sizeable collection of abaci from around the world ivory counters from africa jade calculators from china a prized set from india that had once tallied the household accounts of a maharajah he loved the soft feel of the beads the click of their collisions on the rods ben forsberg had given him the one he played with now a souvenir from a trip to beijing ben and his poor dead wife emily had taken before their marriage it was his favorite with the other hand sam hector paged through his email inbox the list was long and from every hotspot of the world communiques from iraq where he had close to a thousand military contractors working security details from kirkuk to basra from ethiopia where a select team of his employees offered advice to the regime on dealing with an insurrection in the south from afghanistan where his teams provided protection for both afghan and coalition dignitaries and had helped stop a suicide bombing at a schoolone of the contractors had shot the bomber dead unfortunately also killing a local guard whod grappled with the bomber regrettable he forwarded a note to his afghan operations director encouraging him to provide a bit of money for the hapless guards family anonymously of course hector global couldnt be held liable for doing their job war was full of tragic accidents and the work that hector global did was all for the common good not just americas sam thought but for the worlds the next email made him frown a manager in baghdad saying that many of the security workers were expressing unhappiness with their tours and the level of violence they faced if they didnt like working for hector global they could get on a flight home sam believed aisle or window chicken or pasta pick your seat he thought but it had been a rough couple of weeks hed lost five men in three separate incidents it was a relief he did not have to pay medical benefits or life insurance the contractors were responsible for their own worse hed lost the past seven contracts hed bid on for iraq work and the contracts for domestic security were starting to dry up he had three thousand employees on the payroll he needed every deal he could land he put aside the abacus and typed an email to the smith woman at the state department whod shown the morethanprofessional interest in ben sure that ben will call you tomorrow hes back from his getaway i believe today im sure well be able to come to agreement best sam he sent it and thought god if ben would have just bedded the idiotic bitch from state when shed dropped her first hint that contract would be signed and hed have several million he desperately needed on the books but ben wasnt going to be bedding anyone the last email in his inbox was from new orleans and contained a link to a google map image he studied the map for several long silent moments the map was the first key to his future he committed it to memory felt a little thrill of excitement one of the five phones rang he blinked at the number display hello homeland security has taken ben forsberg into custody evidence linked him to a dead foreign assassin killed today in austin but jackie hadnt delivered the envelope the frame of ben was incomplete but he was not going to argue with a sweet twist of fate where is ben now at the new homeland facility downtown at the old waterloo arms theyre questioning him no police no police youve earned a bonus he said and hung up it was useful to have people sprinkled throughout the government who were willing to give you information for a price sam hector stood and went to his window he had not killed in years he was done with dirtying his hands he thought but if the lynches and the team from lebanon all failed to kill pilgrim well then it was time to sharpen his skills a tremble of warmth touched his skin made his face flush it would be good to be back in the game another phone rang and he scooped it off the desk its jackie sir go ahead i hooked up with your other crew and we caught us a break jackie sounded almost joyful that pilgrim bastard is two streets over from the hotel you picked as the rendezvous point youre sure its him in a volvo station wagon cruising like he was checking out the property were ready to take him down pilgrim had managed to trace a connection back to the waterloo arms smart boy he considered and then sam hector saw a solutionan unpleasant onebut one that would serve more than a single purpose he examined the idea quickly from every angle testing its strengths and weaknesses and risks ben forsberg and homeland security were inside the waterloo pilgrim wanted inside the waterloo to find how it connected back to teachs kidnapping jackie you let pilgrim get inside the building then you follow him in and you kill everyone everyone do you understand yes sir one of you stays with teach when everyone inside is dead you call me back youll each be paid a hundred thousand more except you jackie as you havent completed your original assignment plus no money can motivate you more than avenging your brother message clear dont complain or ill tell them it was you not warning them that got their friends killed jackie stayed silent sam hector hung up he started to breathe again feeling like hed just ordered an army to launch a devastating assault nearly dizzy with the idea of the carnage hed unleashed he had just ordered a mass murder but it was required it was the only choice it was a very small sacrifice for a very big gainan incalculably huge gainthat was going to change everything for him he let the smile come onto his face while he waited jackie and the three gunmen listened to sam hectors instructions on how to get into the waterloo and then jackie closed his phone the three men in the van stared at jackie two with blank expressions one with clear disapproval jackie glanced down at the old womanteach hector called herthe men had kidnapped unconscious hands bound in front of her sleeping off an injection designed to keep her out for a few more hours you heard the man jackie said an extra hundred thou for each of you he announced it with casual arrogance as if he were disbursing the funds himself the arab leader was unimpressed you irish you stay with lady a large mole marred his chin he prodded the unconscious woman with his foot the other two shifted on the balls of their feet one had a wild thatch of hair streaked white and black the other wore wraparound sunglasses they all looked like freaks to him no jackie said pilgrim killed my brother i kill him no we are used to working together as a team not with you im going with you the leader shook his head three of us one of you he could let these dumb oafs do the dangerous work as long as pilgrim died did it really matter who killed him the thought shamed him he started again to stand the leader produced a smile of slightly crooked teeth and a beretta aimed at jackies chest plenty of hate for this pilgrim hell die badly i promise you guard the woman jackie could hear the sting of an implied insult in the words as though jackie were capable of nothing more than watching an unconscious fiftyyearold the gunman with the wraparound sunglasses took pity on him squeezed jackies shoulder well give this pilgrim a bullet for your brother jackie swallowed his rage and he nodded let them go do the work he didnt like that theyd seen his face or ordered him about like he was beneath them he still had the knife strapped to his pants leg and he was hungry now to use it he thought how the knifes handle might shine buried in their throats he kept the smile and shook their hands to wish them luck the waterloo arms presented a tactical nightmare fences guards in the middle of an urban setting pilgrim drove past the renovated building three times and stowed the volvo in a nearby parking garage off second street barhoppers and music lovers crowded the evening streets stages with bands playing blues music towered in two intersections more music spilled out from nearly every bar pilgrim wished he could go into one of the bars order a cold shiner bock let the heat of the music flow over him and not dwell for a moment on violence or guns unless it was inside the lyrics of a jealous lovers song instead he found a vantage point a table at an outside jazz bar and drank a coke an older woman who was attired as though for church complete with floral dress and pink hat pounded the pianos keys with vigor and precision and sang about a nogood man that she couldnt give up necessary as air he took a sip of soda he wore a burntorange university of texas longhorns cap and a windbreaker hed found in the stolen volvo the cap was pulled low on his head the jacket was too roomy for his lanky form but it hid his gun he studied the hotel lot he didnt even know for sure that teach was inside a sign on the fence said this was a mckeen property soon to be the waterloo arms court with several thousand square feet of office and retail space and a blarneys steakhouse all opening in about two more months blarneys the name of the same dallas steakhouse hed found on a matchbook in one of the dead gunmens pockets couldnt be coincidence hed watched two men in suits circling the fence one always staying in visual range of the buildings back entrance on guard the suits didnt look like the other kidnappers these two were anglos tall heavybuilt military burr haircuts wearing jackets that were no doubt hiding rigs they looked like highend rentacops the two guards didnt wander as a pair one took a clockwise orbit around the chainlink lot the other headed in the opposite direction they roamed out of each others sight for at least a minute on the edge of the fence the south side of the empty building fronted the busier second street the east abutted a jewelry store and design firms the north side was third street and the west faced another construction site also fenced a narrow passageway cut between the construction sites he flipped barkers phone to his earhe didnt turn it onand started a pretend conversation with an imaginary friend pacing back and forth just another guy in a selfmade cellular bubble yeah absolutely im gonna kill the bastards he said to himself then im gonna make teach buy me a steak dinner and accept my letter of resignation yeah yeah he nodded holding the silent phone and watched the guards continue their orbit he could not shoot either of them on the street too many people around and if they were reporting back into the hotel via phone or wire taking them out might alert the others inside so he had to get past them the wooden fence on the adjoining lot wasnt concertinawired it was the route of least resistance he waited until the walking guard closest to him rounded a corner pilgrim hurried to the fence of the stripped lot the fence loomed and he tucked the phone in his pocket got a running start and took a leap his fingers just caught the tip of the fence and he grunted hard as he pulled himself up and over his arms aching with the effort he slid down on the other side of the fence and ran to the east side he stopped to listen pilgrim heard a guard amble along the fence line at first he thought the guy was talking to himself but then he realized the first guard was using an earpiece communicator yeah the guard said its a hell of a lot better than baghdad i made ninety thou but the wife bitched incessantly cried herself to sleep every night i only want to do domestic now or maybe africa except for somalia those people are crazy yeah pilgrim checked his watch listened for either the approach of the next guard or the return of the one hed heard they held true to their schedule once a minute give or take ten seconds those ten seconds might be life or death to him he surveyed the empty lot a trailer sat on one side near the middle of the lot a forklift squatted next to it like a stout guard he took a lockpick from his pocket and had the trailer open in five seconds no alarm sounded the office was cluttered he spotted the keys to the forklift hanging on a hook by a desk he listened for the clockwork steps of the guard and as they passed he ran to the forklift lurched it into life aimed it at the sweet spot in the fence that bordered the hotel lot stopped it short and killed the engine the music festival drowned out the noise hed made he checked his watch ten seconds to spare twenty seconds later he heard the guard pass pilgrim clambered onto the forklifts roof lying flat on his stomach he peered over the fence which was now about two feet higher than the minilifts roof he saw the guard walking away from him four feet separated the two fences he powered himself over the gap just enough and his feet cleared the wire of the hotel fence he slammed into the ground and sprinted for the closest door which stood in a shaded alcove he tried the door unlocked he opened the door gun ready he stepped into a service hallway lit only with the faint gleam of fluorescent lights dangling in a straight row from the ceiling he closed the door he listened to the silence no sound of an alarm he tested doorknobs the third door opened into a stairwells ghostly light halfway up the concrete stairs he heard the footfall behind him he spun and one of the suits thicknecked stood in the hallway leveling a gun at him freeze pilgrim thought im not going to be taken down by a rental cop may i raise my hands lock fingers together palms up off the stairs to the ground the rental cop didnt sound like a rental a bite of authority lay in his tone pilgrim stepped off the stairs where is teach on the ground on your knees last warning then i shoot definitely not a rental cop pilgrim started to kneel he bent his knee until he had the right amount of leverage and then barreled hard into the man gunning his head straight into the guys stomach as they slammed into the concrete wall the guy was solid muscle he hammered pilgrims chin using a short sharp blow derived from muay thai a martial art pilgrim was surprised and he ducked the second punch slammed a fist into the mans temple once twice and then caught him in the back of the head with a pistol butt the guy staggered for one moment all that pilgrim needed the man collapsed and pilgrim whipped him again with the pistol butt to keep him down but when he saw the guys ear cupping an earpiece he knew that the other guard would hear and respond he frisked the guy for a second gun he found only flat plastic in the guards pocket an id card hector global security he dropped the card on the unconscious mans chest wait for the second guard to respond or go he pressed his back against the wall flicked off the light ten seconds later the door flew open and the second guard bolted into the hallway pilgrim launched a kick at the back of the mans head the lights flickered to life and after the coffinlike darkness ben blinked hard against the harsh dazzle hed sat in the darkness perfectly still trying to steel himself against what might come next nice to have quiet and time to think kidwell shut the door behind him sitting in the dark didnt make me smarter didnt it i thought you might be ready to talk about emily ben felt a slow rage fill him he said nothing ten seconds thirty seconds kidwell didnt blink you got a real ugly streak inside you i see it now youre an asshole its just fascinatinghe pointed his fingers into little gunsto me that you know your wife was shot to death two years ago case never solved and today your business cards in a snipers pocket because i dont believe in coincidence ben stared at the floor is that why you kept mewling for a lawyer forsberg you didnt want to talk about the way your wife died surely you werent stupid enough to think we wouldnt make the connection ben stood up from the chair sit your ass down kidwell snapped fingers pointed at the chair the finger snap pushed him in a way that the threats had not shut your mouth ben said you dont talk about emily i see the nerve remains raw im done here my wife was killed in a random shooting the police exonerated me you havent arrested me and im not saying another word to you im leaving and im going to hire a lawyer and im going to sue you personally so that your bank accounts emptier than your brain kidwell lifted his gun in a slow lazy motion he aimed it at bens chest i told you to sit your ass down im going to call the police in maui and the fbi office and inform them that ive got a new development in your wifes murder call away or ill leave it alone just tell me how you and reynolds and nicky lynch all connect we dont connect ben tested the doorknob it was locked he turned back to kidwell and the gun went against his forehead youre not going anywhere ben was too angry to be scared im tired of your threats and your insinuations fine you call the cops because theyll make sure i get a lawyer kidwell slammed the pistol into the side of bens head and ben collapsed into the chair you had her killed didnt you and its caught up with you no you had lynch kill your wife two years ago then you had him kill adam reynolds today no ben stood shut your mouth a wifekiller vochek thought ben didnt seem the type although a sociopath could camouflage himself beautifully in normal society show guilt and remorse enough to convince the gullible shed made herself look stupid defending the bastard before shed seen the report that his wife had died very much like the way adam reynolds died she glanced through the police report again a number of windows had been shot out in properties near lahaina in a fortyminute period a prank gone horribly wrong when emily forsberg took a bullet in the head no arrests ever made no gun ever found nicky lynch having bens business card pretty much made her sure emilys shooting wasnt an accident vochek hunched over her laptop quilting together information determined to see if she could poke holes in ben forsbergs story and find more links between him and adam reynolds she had access via homeland security to a major credittracking database a phone call resulted in a list of charges on all accounts for ben forsberg being emailed to her computer bens credit cards did show two flashes of activity in marble falls where he had claimed to be both in the evenings purchases at a liquor store and a grocery but they also showed activity in austin in the past three days she compared the times one of the marble falls charges was at pm one of the austin charges was at pm which also coincided with a dinner appointment with ben on adam reynoldss calendar you couldnt get from marble falls to austin in less than an hour so one charge could well be fraudulent kidwell was not going to be happy she opened her cell phone scanned the phone company printouts looking at adam reynoldss call log hed dialed one number four times she dialed the number the answering machine said hello its the moon base not here you know the drill moon base she summoned a government database of phone numbers the phone number belonged to delia moon she googled the name nothing did a criminal check nothing found delia moons drivers license photo on the texas department of public safety database twentyeight fiveten attractive with an address in frisco a dallas suburb so who was this woman to adam reynolds vochek left a message introducing herself and asking delia moon to call her back that it was important she flipped the phone closed she could hear the mutterings of the guards below on a radio monitor and she turned it low and dialed her phone her mother should be home now hello mom she said hi listen i had to come to austin quick on a job i cant do dinner tonight im really sorry oh honey okay well maybe this weekend will you be back mom sniffed a reminder that her allergies had been a constant burden this spring piling the firewood of guilt on the flames i dont know yet her mother couldnt or wouldnt hide the disappointment in her voice well then all right i know its hard mom her mother had moved to houston from long island where vochek had grown up to be close to her only child houston had been a difficult adjustment it was a friendly city but her mother had not quite found her footing couldnt or wouldnt vochek thought again im really sorry to miss the dinner you made well i wont go hungry mom tried a laugh brittle and forced will you call me when you know if youll be back i wont make plans until i know well maybe you should vochek said and she realized with a drop in her stomach that she sounded thoughtless i just mean mom if theres something you want to do go go to the movies or the museum or shopping dont wait on me please she thought find a friend make an effort dont let your life just slide by mom i dont mind waiting and then mom launched into a summary of her gripes about houston the humidity the traffic the lack of a good new yorkstyle pizza missing her friends back in oyster bay vochek gave her two minutes of free daughterguilting and said love you mom im sorry i got to go okay bye she turned back toward the door and a pistol was in her face a bigbuilt man stood behind the gun thats nice that you love your mama vochek didnt speak she clutched her phone tighter i dont want mama picking out a casket for you the man said where is teach the gun in her face made it hard to talk but she managed im a federal officer lower your weapon nice bluff but i saw the soldiers downstairs are hired where is she the man repeated im the only she here im a homeland security agent lower your weapon please she knew she shouldnt say please she needed the edge of authority in her tone but the word slipped out before she thought the gun was an inch from her face and she thought if he shoots me this close mom wont even recognize my face a telescoping baton lay next to her purse shed kept it in case ben forsberg had to be subdued without deadly force her purse blocked the weapon from the mans view no way she could go for her gun in the rig under her jacket my badge is in my purse she said may i get it it should convince you no lock your hands on your head the man reached under her jacket liberated vocheks service piece stepped back both hands holding guns she threw her phone at his face the phone nailed him in the forehead but he ignored it he clubbed her with the pistol hitting her shoulder she lurched hard against the table and grabbed the baton it snapped into its twofoot length with a click and she spun whipping it at his face he dodged she swung the baton back nearly catching the top of his head as he ducked he hit her wrist hard and the pain bolted along her bone like flame the baton fell nervelessly from her fingers oh god she thought he took her down without even having to fire either gun an unexpected bolt of humiliation cut through the fear and the hurt the man tucked her gun into the back of his pants he stepped back several paces from vochek still keeping his gun leveled at her head dont blame you for trying im homeland security she repeated kill me and the penalty doubles turn around shoot me in the back nice vocheks chin lifted in defiance i wont turn around dont make this worse the man gestured with the gun vochek turned she didnt want to show fear but as she turned to face the wall her lips twisted her throat tightened she thought of her mother and never having another dinner with her sorry he said and she thought my god hes really going to shoot me this is how it ends the blow direct into the nerve juncture at her neck crumpled her to her knees im sorry he said again then blackness folded over her eyes as the tile of the floor rushed toward her pilgrim fished the id out of the unconscious womans purse department of homeland security office of strategic initiatives joanna vochek it was either a very good fake or she was telling the truth pilgrim dropped the id onto her stomach he picked up her phone turned it off and tucked it into his pocket phones could be useful sources of information if homeland was attacking the cellar then the situation was far worse because he would then be fighting the resources of the american government which meant his battle was against a far more dangerous and powerful enemy than a bunch of guntoting kidnappers with a grudge against the cellar the thought dried his mouth he dragged the unconscious vochek into a storage closet and locked her inside one less person to worry about he returned to the hallway and closed the door behind him he hurried down the hall gun straight out listening pilgrim heard voices arguing from behind a door kidwell shoved ben back into the chair pain sparkled like a spinning firecracker in bens skull kidwell leveled the gun at ben amazing how a bullet in the knee loosens a tongue ive quit believing that youre with homeland security ben said and boom for a second ben thought kidwells gun had fired the door flew open from a kick a man stood there with a gun he aimed at kidwell who lifted his pistol to fire the man shot first he nailed kidwell in the leg kidwell collapsed with a scream the man rushed kidwell freed the gun from kidwells grip with a vicious kick kidwell wore a look of utter surprise the man regarded ben who stayed in the chair as though locked to it kidwell kept screaming ben thought hes right a bullet in the leg does make you talk he felt like slapping himself to set his mind back to order where is teach the man asked i dont know what you mean ben frowned at him as if he were speaking gibberish identify yourself the man said he looked first at kidwell who writhed in pain on the floor blood seeping between his fingers as he gripped his leg ben managed to speak hes agent kidwell homeland security supposedly where is the woman you took from the lake house tell me or i shoot the man stood over kidwell did barker work for you the arabs dont know what you mean kidwell gritted his teeth closed his hand over the flesh wound in his leg you up against the wall the mans gun tracked him as ben obeyed i havent seen any woman ben said im not with homeland security he brought me here the man glanced between ben and kidwell again who are you ben forsberg the gun wavered and naked shock crossed the big mans gaunt face say again as if ben had spoken in latin my name is ben forsberg ben repeated then in panic the words seemed to spill from his mouth they think i knew some hit man and i dont i shouldnt be here the man shushed ben bringing his gun to his own lips like a hushing finger he blinked as though thinking then ben could see a decision made in the mans sudden resolve my name is pilgrim come with me help me find her no other prisoner here kidwell had pulled himself up to a sitting position and leaned against the wall clutching at his torn leg just this man and youve shot a federal officer and youre in deep shit i clean up fast pilgrim said you come with me ben wasnt inclined to trade in kidwell for this new jerk but he had no choice he followed the man into the hallway pilgrim ran to the other doors yelling teach and listening for a response who are you ben asked pilgrim didnt spare him a glance im the guy whos getting you the hell out of here at the middle of the hallway between them and the room theyd left kidwell in the elevator door pinged and opened get behind me pilgrim said khaleds reportbeirut my recruitment was a seduction not in the physical sense there was of course none of that but in the long crush of weeks after my brothers and my father died i began to realize i was being followed by a man i now know as j at first i was very afraid no one had been brought to justice for the bombing and i wondered if my brothers enemieswhether they be domestic or foreignmight target me paranoia is not a healthy life but often i noticed jin the market as i made my way home from the university returning home from my aunts house with my mother j watched us followed us i said nothing to mama her worries were already crushing her he approaches me at the school library sits down across from me at a table we are alone hello khaled i say nothing i know who killed your brothers and their friends he says i look back down at my financial analysis textbook the charts and tables swim before my eyes dont you wish to know he says after my silence becomes uncomfortable yes i say then he surprises me why do you wish to know because i want to fight back against whoever killed them i want them dead i want them suffering now it was his turn to be silent you seem a stuffy sort and you are thin im not sure you will be useful j puts his hands flat on the table i let all the strength gather in my body id like to be useful come with me he says i do over the next day he shows me the prooffinancial trails photos a picture of the khaled boy with the deformed lip now lying on a morgue slab i killed him j says he cried before i shot him i didnt much like him he wouldnt betray his friends he wouldnt work with us i dont take any relief in seeing the dead man even though he planted the bomb he is just a cog i want to break the machine you could give all this evidence to the police they would do nothing j says you could do something what j leans back in his chair lit his cigarette join us no he offers the cigarettes to me and i shake my head i expected you to say yes im not a fool no youre not khaled thats why im issuing the offer to you you are ideal youre young smart and motivated im just one man we have several young men lined up for this sort of dangerous work where would i go america j almost says it with a growl i hesitate on how to answer i want to strike back at the murderers i want to make something happen so another family does not go through this horror i put my face in my hands if papa hadnt died maybe i could say no to j but my brothers deaths have shown me the ripple effect my brothers murders killed more than themselves blood of fires enemies remain unpunished and if i decline js offer am i suddenly well dangerous to j and his people i know about them the thought chills it is the single biggest moment of my life decide whether to avenge my family or whether to walk away and be safe but there is no safety in this world what do i have to do i ask first you have to sneak into america khaled j says will i have help yes but if youre caught we do nothing for you you never heard of us you speak of us and i dont think american prison will go very well for you i swallow the decision makes itself i nod when do i leave ben saw two menhardfaced pale wearing jeans and dark tshirts one sported wraparound sunglasses the other a punkish thatch of blackandwhite hair he didnt see the guns until the one in sunglasses raised a pistol and the other gunman hoisted a rifle run pilgrim said putting himself between ben and the gunmen firing at them as he ran ben turned and sprinted down the hallway in the narrow corridor the sudden blasts of two shots boomed like thunder yanked close to earth ben headed for a stairwell at the end of the hallway an exit sign hung above the door and as he bolted toward it the sign shattered a stray bullet slamming through the x as he reached for the door heat hissed past his ear he tried the door locked then pilgrim jerked ben back from the door fired a bullet into the lock a punch of fire and metal pilgrim kicked the door open and shoved ben into the stairway a faint dyingbulb glow lit the stairs stop pilgrim said there could be more downstairs im sure there are at least three of them ill kill these two here okay fine then youll kill them here ben couldnt believe pilgrims calm ben took a step backward onto the stairs theyll shoot us we need to get to the ground level they heard a man down the hallway pleading no then the bang of a shot kidwell ben thought where was vochek the two guards he wasnt going to stand here and get shot the solution was distance between him and the guys with guns including this one he doesnt want to give away his positionhe wont shoot you logic was a beauty ben turned and ran for the rooftop door no pilgrim hissed goddamn it get back herebut ben hit the door to the roof and it opened he ran out onto the roofs concrete expanse the day was dying the sun halfway through its low slide into the hills he saw another roof entrance on the opposite side with a jumble of industrial ac units and ventilation equipment in between and he ran straight for the door an escape hatch a way out of this nightmare the door opened pilgrim couldnt protect the idiot if said idiot wouldnt listen to orders he hated extraction jobs and hadnt done one in over ten years it was a bother to worry about keeping a frantic civilian alive in the heat of dirty work but he had to keep ben forsberg alive because ben forsberg was clearly the key to understanding what the hell was going on with teach with the cellar with this attack first things first the two gunmen in the hallway keep one alive to talk to tell him where theyd taken teach he considered the staircase was concrete with metal railings he peered down into the gloom the pit of the stairwell dropped down six stories and offered no nooks or crannies in which to hide no cover but there was the bend of the stairs where the stairs forked at the landing the plain metal railing met the dusty concrete the railings post stood close to the gap in the stairs he could hide in the gap just below the landing pilgrim eased himself over the railing tested to see if his feet would reach to the railing below no if he braced himself in the gap his head and shoulders would show and theyd blow his brains out in the first few seconds but if he held onto to the railing onehanded he tested the idea only his fingers wrapped around the metal of the railing post were exposed he held the glock in his right hand he couldnt see the landing but the gunmen if they came through would be standing just sohe pictured the positions in his mindand he screamed in hysterically tinged arabic i give up i surrender truce lets talk they would know he was on the landing and theyd fire suppressing rounds to clear him off the landing before they set a foot inside he heard the broken door kicked open a spray of bullets hitting the steps where a man would stand if they saw his fingers gripping the bottom inches of the post they would simply blast the bones of his fingers away and hed fall the stairwell went dark the lights blown out the shooting stopped pilgrim raised the gun above the lip of the landing emptied the clip at an angle he hoped would catch the knees bullets pocked against skin and bone and screams echoed against the concrete he released his hold as a bullet smashed against the post hed been gripping the screams fading and he landed feet hitting the railing below bouncing from the rail to land like an awkward cat on the steps pilgrim scrambled to his feet drew the gun hed taken from kidwell and ran to the landing the punkblond gunman lay dead guts ripped heart hollowed the one in the cheap wraparounds had caught shots in the chest and the groin he cupped one hand around the blood welling from his jeans while reaching toward the blonds gun pilgrim shot him in the hand and the man shrieked where is the woman you took he said the man cussed him and pilgrim answered in arabic i will get you a doctor and promise protection for you if you tell me she is dead he screamed he drew his knee up to his bloodied crotch you wouldnt kidnap her just to kill her where is she he mumbled an answer gasped in exquisite pain who do you work for one of the lenses on the mans sunglasses was shattered either from the crease of a graze or from falling on the floor and it resembled an empty eye staring back at pilgrim the man grimaced and frowned and shuddered a final breath then a shot thundered on the roof pilgrim remembered the person he needed to keep alive the roof door opened and ben bolted for the cover of the closest ac unit he was down and hidden before whoever came through the door had closed it ben crouched against the metal of the unit and tried to breathe silently he listened trying to hear which way the man moved instead he heard the hubbub of the ordinary world brakes on the street music rising from the festival nearby a car honking the hiss of the airconditioning system then he heard a footstep close as though the hunter were taking the measure of the wind breathing the scent of bens fear ben had no weapon nothing he had the clothes on his back shoes a belt he stopped and carefully slid the belt free from his pants he grabbed the end of it opposite the buckle the silver buckle wasnt heavy but it would hurt if it hit a face a nose a mouth fighting a killer with a belt he was an idiot he tried not to shiver youre not the one i want a voice accented called ben didnt move no pointthe man knew where he was he just didnt know if ben had a weapon was trying to urge him out rather than fight you tell me where pilgrim is and ill let you live i have no gripe with you him i want he killed my cousins the man stepped around the corner of the unit a heavy gun in his hand ben swung the belt overhead as hard as he would swing an ax the buckle cracked against the wrist bone the shot blasting into the ground close to bens foot the manben saw heavy shoulders a mole on his chin a snarl of teethinstinctively grabbed at his wrist more surprised than hurt and ben barreled into him before he could lift the gun into bens chest pilgrim ran up the roof stairs the shot probably meant ben forsberg was dead jesus he needed someone still alive to tell him what the hell was happening he went through the door low gun out and halfway across the expanse of roof he saw ben struggling with another man the gunman was trying to shoot ben in the head but ben fought hard if not well keeping the mans gun aimed upward but ben was quickly losing the battle pilgrim lifted his gun aiming to shoot the gunman in the shoulder as the two men fought then the gunman saw pilgrim and headbutted ben but ben didnt release his grip on the gunman as he fell backward and the bigger man toppled the two of them vanished behind an electrical unit pilgrim ran to the mechanism the gunman cradled ben forsberg in a headlock the gun aimed at his temple a thick arm around bens throat he held ben up as a shield pilgrim aimed at the mans head lets talk he said in arabic stop or ill kill him the gunman said in english pilgrim shrugged kill him i dont care the gunman retreated toward the other door hauling ben with him ill shoot right through ben if i have to pilgrim said no ben yelled then do it big mouth the gunman said but youpilgrim saidget to live if you tell me who took the woman from the lake house where is she the gunman said you came to the roof to save this man so you want him alive dont let him ben started but the gunman yanked on his throat and ben went a shade of blue for a few moments he fell silent pilgrim shrugged shoot him he keeps interrupting me if only ben forsberg would have the guts or the stupidity to fight to break away and run then pilgrim could shoot the gunman in the knees get the answers he needed ive killed everyone you people have sent at me today but you ill let you walk just tell me where she is ben remained silent but pilgrim saw rage win out over fear in his eyes and thought if ben decides to fight itll be interesting be ready your only way out is to talk to me pilgrim said ten seconds passed that felt like ten days and the gunman said the woman shes in a silver van a couple of blocks away with an irishman no i killed the irishman you left another irishman behind a brother whats his name jackie who do you and jackie work for the gunman shook his head i told you enough you dumb ass open the door he pivoted ben slightlyhe didnt have a free hand without releasing either ben or his gun which was aimed at pilgrimand he turned ben toward the door so ben could grab the handle two heads together struggling with one square inch of suddenly clear temple and pilgrim nailed the open space a thunking round powered through scalp bone and brain the gunman sagged ben sinking to his knees with the body pilgrim started toward the gunman pistol out and down toward the body making sure the man was dead ben reached over and grabbed the gunmans pistol and raised it at pilgrim uh hello pilgrim said your life just saved by me okay thank you thanks appreciate it ben didnt let go of the gun his muscles felt thin and taut as wire ben put the gun down no im getting out of here you stay put im just going to head downstairs and call the police the gun started to waver and theyll give you back to homeland security pilgrim said they suspect you were involved in killing adam reynolds they found your business card in nicky lynchs pocket right the gun wavered in bens grip every nerve ending warned him to run to put distance between himself and this nightmare but he couldnt make a stupid move not now he needed the truth about the past day if he had a prayer of clearing his name who are you a distant rise of sirens the police approaching pilgrim lowered his gun raised a palm i can answer your questions and you can answer mine we can help each other but not if were both in custody which is where we will be in five minutes if we dont move this is all a mistake what it is ben is a double a special kind of frame done to you and me both weve both been set up to take the fall here weve both been screwed i dont understand i work for the government but i cant go to the police neither can you not yet not until we know who framed you who tried to kill me this teach im searching for shes my boss and whoever took her pilgrim said is the same person who framed you and set me up to die we have to go to the police the sirens drew closer someone had heard the rattle of gunfire over the hum of nightlife police will defer to homeland to kidwells special group you want a buddy of kidwells to start beating you again no then come with me now we need to find out whos targeted us and why later you want to walk away you want to go to the police ill let you but right now we have to run it looks worse if we run forget looks worry about reality the sirens grew louder ben handed him the gun they ran down the stairwell to the top floor vochek ben said theres a woman with kidwell i knocked her out and locked her in a closet she should be safe i dont think they found her they paused at the room where kidwell lay nothing to be donethe gunmen had shot him once in the head the granite face was still let vochek out the cops will shell be okay he grabbed bens arm and hurried him down the hallway they ran down the stairwell to the first floor the hallway was empty except for the guard pilgrim had knocked out the man lay dead two bullets marring the skin behind his ear another guard lay dead by the closed back door openeyed two bullets in his face jesus and mary ben said the gunmen came in to kill everybody pilgrim said he turned ben to face him listen this jackie may be waiting outside to kill anyone trying to get out you stay low you follow me and if i get shot you keep running ben nodded what if i get shot then i keep running pilgrim said on the other side of the building sirens blasted their arrival pilgrim and ben ran for the chainlink fence and went through the gate and no sign of a van where teach would be but there was practically no street parking and the closest parking was the garage where pilgrim had stashed the volvo come on he grabbed bens arm and they ran down second street toward the parking garage a couple of blocks away the gunman said maybe he lied maybe he didnt pilgrims eyes scanned the garages levelsif jackie lynch was parked there hed be waiting for the trio of gunmen hed know what pilgrim looked like jackie lynch could be watching him and ben right now seeing them approach knowing that their survival meant the gunmens failure we may not be able to get to my car well have to steal one if we cant steal a car are you kidding me i am not stealing a car borrow then well bumper surf he spoke to ben in a voice of utter calm thinking give him a problem to worry about other than getting shot its easy you hunt for those little magnetic boxes under the bumper that hold a spare key so people dont lock themselves out as they navigated into the meandering crowd spilling from the bars and the streets pilgrim slowed down keeping ben close to him what are we going to do ben said he was calmer now im going to get you to a car and then im going to find my boss while you wait they muscled through the crowd headed east for two blocks and ran to the garages stairwell they climbed the stairs up to the floor where pilgrim had parked wait here pilgrim ordered ben pilgrim eased into the row of cars gun out up watching the garage was quiet he scanned the parked cars no sign of a silver van many slots remained full either people working late or downtown for the music festival but he didnt see anyone leaving or heading toward a car the stolen volvo sat where hed left it pilgrim turned back toward the stairwell door and gestured an allclear he saw the door closing ben forsberg was gone ben ran down the concrete steps get away from the crazy bastard find a policeman now and tell him everything yes maybe he would end up back in the hands of this freaking weird division of homeland security but he was a witness to murder and he wasnt going to steal a car and he wasnt going to run the idle suggestion well steal a car had been the proverbial bucket of ice water clearing the shock from bens mind that was not the responsible course of action he had a business to consider a reputation and this horrific night could not redefine him as a person once he had a lawyer the world would shift back to its normal orbit sam hector and his vast connections in the government would get bens good name cleared he could get to the ground floor faster taking the stairs than pilgrim could in a car he heard the stairwell door bang open a flight above him ben run ben didnt continue down the stairsthey were empty pilgrim could fire down at him or catch up with him the guy was obviously a soldier of a kickass stripe but people might be on one of the levels attendants barhoppers someone who could help him he hit the door the second level was empty no people just cars in most of the slots he ran across the level arrowing for the opposite stairwell get as far away as you can he told himself just run run run a van peeled fast down the incline between him and the far stairwell door and he raised his hands beckoning for help as the van cornered and roared toward him ben saw a young softfaced man with stringy dark hair behind the windshield the van didnt stop the kids arm jutted suddenly from the drivers open window and a blinding red light caught bens eyes but not before he saw that the kid held a gun a silver van the gunman on the roof had said ben flung himself between a saab and a bmw a shot cracked shattering the bmws window above him the vans brakes squealed as though the driver stood on the pedal ben didnt huddle under the sedan he rolled under two suvs parked next to it grease staining his shirt and pants trying his hardest to be silent nowhere else to run nowhere to escape the kid could just get out of the van and shoot him dead ease down smile at ben in his temporary fortress of undercarriage and concrete ben waited to hear the van door open but instead he heard an eruption of gunfire pilgrim barreled out of the stairwellhed caught a glimpse of ben running down the stairs hitting the secondlevel doorand saw ben dodging a van a laser sight dancing a glow seeking flesh then a shot fracturing the rear windshield of a car behind where ben had stood the van jackie lynch teach was inside that van if the gunman had told the truth then the laser sight swung toward pilgrim caught between the stairwell door and a parked car as the van braked to an awkward necksnapping stop the shots sang a warble of thweets and pilgrim retreated backward the sting and burn of steel ripping through flesh in his shoulder and his arm he staggered missing the door as jackie leaned out the window to tighten his aim and finish the job he retreated blindly no place to run and threw himself over the concrete lip of the garage wall he dropped into emptiness how far up was he he wondered he couldnt remember past the pain now in a burst of speed the van powered past where ben hid the guy could kill him easy why was he running because he just shot who he was really after pilgrim ben crawled from under the utility vehicle bullet holes scored the wall along the stairwell door a spill of blood decorated the lip of the edge where presumably pilgrim had stood in chasing him he started to run toward the other stairwell he heard a screech of brakes he stopped pilgrim could be lying back there dead dying he leaned against a parked truck his and pilgrims lives were somehow connected tied to each other because of the murder of adam reynolds and how ben had been framed for it i can answer your questions pilgrim had said and you can answer mine we can help each other but not if were both in custody if pilgrim died ben might never be able to prove his innocence homeland security could threaten him all over again his reputation would be destroyed he would never know the truth pilgrim must know the reasons why bens life had been targeted and ruined pilgrim had saved him from kidwell from the gunman on the roof ben ran back to the edge of the garage and peered down the side pilgrim lay a story and a half below him in a row of crushed yaupon bushes moving his arms groggy hurt barely lifting his head halfway down the incline to the ground floor a crowd of college kids were laughing and piling into their cars debating through the open windows which club to visit jackie guessed they hadnt heard the sounds of the silenced shots or had attributed the bangs to festival noise but the kids were taking their own sweet slow time calling from car to car while they inched out of the parking slots blocking the passage jackie slammed on his brakes to keep from veering into them jackie rolled down the window move it goddamn it hey politeness dude a boy his own age sitting in one of the cars slurred his syllables and gave jackie a beersoaked smile jackie wanted to shoot and knife them all but the cars were full six kids in each and it was too many it would take too long please jackie said please sorry i yelled im in an awful hurry please move see politeness works the loudmouth said the car inched up enough to let jackie roar past jackie yanked up his pants leg pulled the eightinch steel knife from its sheath if pilgrim lay hurt on the ground hed dispatch him with the knife quiet and it wouldnt draw the attention a gun would if there were witnesses helping pilgrim the knife was fasthed killed a quartet of latepaying drug dealers in a small dublin room once with the knife in under thirty seconds nicky im going to make it right he thought ben sprinted down the stairwell again hands skimming the railing he hit the exit and the cool night air washed over his filthy and bloodied face he turned the corner and pilgrim was trying to stand favoring his leg bleeding shot in the shoulder cmon ben looped pilgrims arm over his shoulder pilgrim was only a couple of inches taller than him but he felt much heavier pilgrimhurt leaned hard against him they couldnt run down the street the van would be here within seconds and the shooter in the van was bound and determined to be sure pilgrim was dead im shot i know come on come on ben pivoted pilgrim halfdragged halfcarried him back into the garage they needed to hide now or the maniac in the van would cut them both down the crash of a wooden barrier breaking boomed on the opposite side of the garage they ran pilgrim gasping for the elevator ben thumbed the up button the doors slid open at once and the two of them fell into the open elevator ben rose on his knees and jabbed the controls the roar of a car approached and hed gambled wrong they were trapped he dragged pilgrim into the far corner of the elevator where they couldnt be seen the elevator doors slid closed as a van powered past and onto the street its headlights sweeping the broken bushes and the empty sidewalk pilgrim was gone jackie lynch circled the parking garage twice peering at the entrances letting his headlights spill along the streets lighting the couples and singles walking along toward the restaurants and nightclubs he could guess pilgrims point of impact from the mashed bushesbut the bastard wasnt there which meant he wasnt hurt and he was running he turned around to drive back into the garage but a large crowd of pedestriansfestivalgoers he guessedwere pouring into the garage as a light rain began to fall again too many people there now too many witnesses maybe they hadnt gone back into the garage he drove up and down the neighboring streets rage building in the cage of his heart he scanned the crowds for a limping bloodied man nicky wouldnt have missed him not that close hell he thought kick nicky off the pedestal nicky sure as hell missed when it counted the phone rang he put the knife on the seat and clicked on the cell phone report it was sam hector damn theyre dead theyre all dead jackie started you better mean forsberg and pilgrim the name forsberg meant nothing to him but he said no i mean your bloody arab hired guns all dead pilgrim killed them all its just you left hector didnt show any emotion the iron control made jackie dislike him more yes and im going to find that bastard and kill him hes gone i hit him but hes gone hes gone get out of there now get teach to my place ill text directions to your phone but pilgrims still do what i tell you or ill forfeit your payment maybe ill just keep the woman see how you like that he thought in a blistering rage but no sam hector would be an extremely dangerous enemy to have better to deliver the woman get his money then see if there was any way to use hector to find this pilgrim bastard again jackie drove until he saw the sign for i and found an entrance ramp heading toward dallas four hours north leaving the town now where his brother had died and for the first time he wondered what would happen to nickys body where it would be buried how he could ever get it home to northern ireland he suspected he couldnt he started to tremble not with grief with rage today wasnt supposed to be this way several blocks to the west a volvo station wagon worked past the crowds pain is nothing pilgrim muttered in agony pain is a friend if you dont feel pain youre dead he repeated it like a mantra pain says you need a doctor ben drove west on sixth street heading out of downtown watching his rearview trying to make sure he wasnt being followed he made a sharp turn headed north for a few blocks then turned east again brackenridge hospital was on east fifteenth streethe could be there in a few minutes no doctor no hospital pilgrim gritted his teeth dont be a dumbass youre hurt no im lucky havent ever been shot before havent ever fallen from a building what a fricking day im taking you to a hospital no cant go well be right back where we started youll be in custody and ill be where hurts too bad to talk keep driving pilgrim pressed his fist hard against his shoulder a federal agent pulled a gun on you and a killer had your name in his pocket and another killer just tried to shoot your head off you might want to stay under the radar im still taking you to a hospital if you want to stay alive get us to dallas if i pass out get me into a motel cheap get a first aid kit first aid for a bullet wound and a tool to dig the bullet out dont forget that im not digging a bullet out of you get real he turned into the brackenridge hospital parking lot the emergency sign a beacon pilgrim grabbed the wheel no i am begging you please if you bring me here were both dead men ben hesitated as he started to pull into the overhang by the entrance were guaranteed dead we have to get to dallas why do we go to dallas because the matchbook i found on the gunman is from a dallas restaurant barker betrayed me and his drivers license address is in dallas those are my only leads and then he added the guard i knocked out had a hector global id in his pocket the back of the id badge gave an address near dallas ben tightened his grip on the wheel the guards werent homeland agents nope so im thinking this hector companys connected to this whole mess ben swallowed sam hector he owns hector global hes a client of mine hes one of my closest friends he wouldnt be involved in anything illicit or illegal i spoke with him not three hours ago pilgrim stared at him awful big coincidence our friend kidwell should have homeland agents working as his guardsnot hired guns two paramedics came out began to walk toward the volvo we cant stay here ben please drive hector global must have a contract with kidwells group sam can help us can tell us what the hells going on maybe pilgrim leaned against the door putting pressure on his shoulder wound if hes really your friend okay lets ask him for help but not here get us to dallas ben please a car behind them honked and ben pulled back out into the lot past the paramedics he turned east onto fifteenth street then headed north onto i toward dallas thats the first smart move ive seen you make im only doing this because kidwell implied ben swallowed two years ago my wife was killed murdered on our honeymoon shot to death it was a random thing damn that sucks sorry in its odd awkward way it was one of the most sincere expressions of sympathy hed gotten most people said nothing more than im sorry a few shared horrors like at least she didnt suffer or youre young youll marry again and some said nothing which was somehow worse as though emily had never existed kidwell suggested id had her killed like i had a history with hired killers like nicky lynch pilgrim watched the road spill past breathing in rhythm to control the pain several minutes passed ben broke the silence let me call sam hector globals a huge company sam might not even know hes got people working for kidwell he could tell us who kidwell is pilgrim twisted slightly in the seat ill make you a deal ben im listening i can help you clear your name ben but only if you help me ben considered whats to keep me from driving straight to a police officer then theyll force you to talk if the police get ahold of me ill get turned over to the government and youll never see me again and then youre trapped under suspicion of the worst sort i dont officially exist anymore i cant help you if were caught youre going to have a bitch of a time clearing your name might never do it he stared out the window as they went past the suburban spread of round rock letting the weight of his words settle down on ben the idea made bens skin prickle hed already endured the rot of suspicion before after emilys death because the husband was always a prime suspect so what are you a government agent or an undercover cop im a strange breed what does that mean it means im not telling you what i do not until you help me i need your help ben im asking for it ben swallowed why me why is this happening i can hazard a guess your wife i dont ben you were a suspect in her murder werent you it would only be natural his throat closed and he coughed briefly but the police cleared me i had no involvement hed had to fly home to dallas from his honeymoon alone the worst flight of his life her body lay in the planes cargo hold he arrived alone at the house they had shared her parents shattered in their own grief and blaming him because the world had been cruel and capricious did not meet him at the airport sam was on a trip and couldnt get back in time within a few more days he realized that dallas had gone dead for him and hed moved back to his hometown of austin where there were fewer whispers about him behind cupped hands if you wanted to frame a person a man whos already been suspect once is a much easier sell to the police to the media but why me ill explain why you were framed just get me patched up and get me to dallas his words slurred his eyes fogged with pain its a fair trade im trusting you ben do we have a deal yes i give you my word ben said we have a deal i need some water ben took the next exit stayed on the frontage road until he reached a gas station he went inside the cashier said hi and he said hi back he bought two bottles of water he hurried back to the volvo ben opened the bottle for pilgrim watched him gulp the water down i should have thought of getting you water sooner sorry im not used to dealing with gunshot wounds i cant make it to dallas without getting patched up ben pulled back onto the highway im going to find a walmart and then a motel and get you cleaned up stop the bleeding thank you can i use a credit card will the police or homeland security be looking for me kidwell said hed freeze my accounts pilgrim said i got a credit card we can use he laughed can you forge a signature um ive never tried trust me its not hard to learn you look like a quick study pilgrim sagged against the door eyes at halfmast im not in good shape here man ben floored the car down the highway jackie lynchs throat ached from singing the vans broken radio hissed static and he couldnt bear the silence so he sang slow and low the entirety of johnny cashs at folsom prison album the rereleased version had been his and nickys favorite hed started with folsom prison blues then sung his way through the poetry of the other eighteen songs he knew every lyric but on nickys favorites it was a struggle to finish to link the words together he sang the album in an hour listened to the quiet again for five minutes then started singing it again like he was a busted music box doomed to spill the same notes for eternity his stomach began to growl as he reached the small city of hillsboro ninety minutes south of dallas hillsboro boasted a huge outlet mall and a large collection of fastfood chains and gas stations he figured no one would remember him in the constantly changing crowd jackie hated the necessity of his hunger it reminded him he was alive and nicky wasnt he bought his dinner at a mcdonalds drivethrough keeping an eye on the prone form of teach lying bound in the back of the van he regarded her with a cordial hatred he bought her no food in case she awokethe bitch could starve for all he cared he pulled over at the far edge of the parking lot to eat his hamburger and fries he sipped hard on a soda to cool his throat and bit into the burger he couldnt shake off memories of nicky they should be eating lobsters and steaks drinking a fancy wine savoring a kill that would have made their reputations even more sterling now hed be eating alone all the time with nicky dead and the realization made his face ache jackie set the burger and fries on the passenger seat the tears came hot and hard and he bent his head over the steering wheel happy images swimming before his eyes nicky teaching him how to ride a bike because da was always busy with his interrogations and his meetings nicky showing him how to kick a football how to shoot a semiautomatic how to cut with a blade so you opened the carotid on the first try his brother shouldnt be couldnt be dead he used his napkins to mop up the tears and the snot and then he used his sleeve and looking up he saw the boys laughing at him three of them a shade younger than him nineteen or so they stood four parking slots away getting into an old weathered sedan but theyd seen him crying like a babe and one acted embarrassed and the other two smiled amused at his pain behind him the woman stirred and groaned he glanced back at her she lay still again now two of the three boys had gotten into their car but one stood there and mockrubbed his cupped hand on his cheek wiping away pretend tears jackie opened the vans door and stepped out into the cool the hum of the highway made a throaty murmur and the night sky spilled stars across the darkness his fist felt primed to hit his feet ready to kick he didnt need a gun or the knife whats your problem jackie asked the boy kept his smile locked in place and said with a twang buy some pride dude my brother died today he walked faster toward the smiling boy whose grin faded maybe i should laugh do a freaking jig the boy ducked back into the car started shutting the door jackie caught the door handle fury made him strong and he reached in and dragged the boy onto the pavement the boy twisted and hollered jackie punched the mouth hard the teeth in the vanished smile cracked under his fist the two other boys spilled from the other side of the car one was bigger than jackie with the bearing of an athlete but jackie didnt see muscle and speed he saw only weaknesses borne from overconfidence a throat left unprotected a crotch to be kicked an eye to be gouged he slid across the trunk to engage the athlete take the biggest first nicky told him jackie nailed him with a hard kick in the guts the athlete doubled over and jackie slammed him into the side of the car the car door stood open and jackie shoved the athletes head into the opening knocked the door hard against him the athlete folded bleeding from both ears see jackie said to the last kid rounding the car to come at him thats pride asshole he bounced while the last kid threw a reckless punch he stepped under it and delivered three closein blows to groin stomach and jaw nicky had taught him the moves the last kid folded mouth wide in a gasp the athlete lay unconscious on the asphalt jackie ran around the car and found the oncesmiling boy dazed trying to crawl into the drivers seat blood dripping from his mouth and chin jackie yanked the boy out of the car he grabbed the keys from the ignition knocked the boy to the ground cry jackie said dont please the boys tears welled real ones of stark terror he pressed the boys head to the pavement jabbed the ignition key into the soft corner of the eye the boy screamed his own throat raw jackies grief vanished in the flame of his rage blind him he thought do the other eye but he glanced up noticed a couple of people gaping at him in shock from their cars in the drivethrough line time to go he turned and the van was gone he dropped the keys and forgot to breathe then he saw the van creaking along toward the exit the woman driving but weaving like the drugs still hobbled her mind like she hadnt figured out the relationship between accelerator and escape jackie ran leaving the boy screaming and writhing on the pavement the van was thirty feet from careening onto a thoroughfare that bisected the highway thirty feet for him to catch her and god dont let her gun the gas he cut across to the vans right side trying to remember if hed locked the passenger door hoping that she dazed with drugs hadnt the van jolted up onto the curb flattened the spring grass lurched out of the mcdonalds lot and onto the road ten feet he ran out into the street and reached the passengerside door caught the handle the van surged out into traffic he fumbled at the handle clicked open the door as the woman veered the van back toward him trying to knock him down and nearly planting him on the pavement he jumped through the door landing on his abandoned dinner a slick of meat and lettuce and pickle now teach hit the accelerator ignoring the cavalcade of honks as she dodged through traffic she veered into the wrong lane screeched past another car jackie grabbed her arms with one hand seized the steering wheel with the other her head bobbed as if she were only halfawake he slammed his door shut lady no jackie grabbed the wheel from her steered a clear path to the roads shoulder he hit her hard and precise she went limp he yanked her from the seat shoved her into the back of the van he eased into the drivers seat roared back into traffic idiot he told himself no control why did he care if smalltown jerks saw him crying his bad judgment had gotten him noticed cut and bruised and nearly lost him teach he zoomed back onto i hed have to find another car dump the van steal another car fast oh damn he imagined nickys ghost crouched on his shoulder thumping jackies head in disappointment no more stupidity it would get him in jail or dead the first mistake he decided was in feeling grief not again from now on he would simply cause it for others gouging the boys eye had eased his pain that was the way to deal with grief lose yourself in your work two hours later jackie parked a different van at a shopping center on the edge of the growing dallas suburb of frisco hed abandoned the gunmens van and stolen a new one from an apartment complex in waxahachie between hillsboro and dallas the stolen van reeked of weed and this gave jackie his first borderline hysterical laugh of the day a joint didnt sound bad at all but then he reminded himself he was running the family business and ceos should remain sober especially when facing a very irritated customer so maybe it would be responsible and smartboth aspects of being the mature and executiveminded jackie he told himselfto have a bit of leverage over mr sam hector he pulled into a corner of the lot far from the few other shoppers far from the lights teach lay on the floor of the dirty van halfwatching him he stared at her and she closed her eyes but he could tell from the focus hed seen in her eyes that the drugs were wearing off most old ladies been kidnapped they would have run screaming from the van shrieking their throat raw for help but you wanted to slip away unseen unheard now teach opened her eyes under the gag under the wicked bruise on her face the merest trace of a smile appeared then wavered and was gone he went back to the rear of the van and lowered the gag what are you lady whats your line of work ill make you a deal she whispered a million dollars if you let me go he laughed a million handsome offer but my brothers dead so moneys not my reason for the game now sorry the offer expires in one minute she was used to hardball he thought i dont need ten seconds to tell you no all right she said almost respectfully it impressed him that she didnt beg this pilgrim fellows a friend of yours teach opened her eyes hes going to kill you its guaranteed i shot him and he fell from a parking garage and so odds are hes dead better if she had no hope a man thought hed killed him this afternoon he hadnt jackie put his mouth close to her ear if hes not dead im going to kill him and when im done if youre still alive ill bring you his head and you can kiss him goodbye where are the guys who grabbed me she asked jackies mouth went thin he didnt answer and the absolute bitch shook her head let me guess pilgrims killed everyone you work with today do you really want to take him on little boy quite the ballsy whore he ignored the bolt of anger and decided not to kick her teeth down her throat hector wanted her unhurt he went back to the drivers seat and she asked where are you taking me i hope to a highly painful death in the rearview he saw her eyes widen very slightly yeah he thought telling her that was better than giving her a kick in the face a grand place the mans house was jackie thought the complex covered rolling farmland west of prosper a small town on the verge of great growth but still rural enough that you had space to breathe jackie had driven through the iron gatesa long stone fence ran along the whole perimeter of the acreage there were stables a private airstrip with a hangar and learjet a threestory manor of tuscan lines and arches a sevencar garage at the end of a winding driveway not visible from the road sam hector and jackie stood in the garage the back of the van was open and hector stood staring at teach sam hector wasnt what jackie had expected hector was taller than jackie a solid sixfive fiftyish graying hair trimmed close to his scalp a hard body shaped by weight lifting a craggy face his eyes reminded jackie of gray clouds right after lightning flashes against them it was the sort of face that made jackie want to defend himself i nearly got pilgrim and the other ben forsberg sam hectors voice was low and quiet forsberg but they got away pilgrims hurt bad pride inched back into his tone the envelope please jackie handed it to him hector glanced at the seal to be sure it was undisturbed i wouldnt boast about your competence how hard is it to leave an envelope behind hector said the only thing youve done right is get her here to me an odd itch in the back of jackies brain made him say yes sir but shes here and we could use her as bait for this pilgrim asshole teach didnt look at him thats true jackie hector gave him a cold smile pilgrim will come after her i hope he does jackie lit a cigarette and focused so his hand didnt tremble i want to kill the bastard i already killed pilgrim once hector said im sure we can do it again if youd carry her into the house id appreciate it just follow me jackie carried teach dangling over his shoulder and dropped her into a chair in a conference room the table was smooth granite with a stateoftheart presentation system hooked into the table a giant plasma screen on the wall jackie turned to leave no jackie stay hector said youll find my sales pitch interesting jackie wanted to go be by himself clean up his torn and soiled clothing although he realized he had nothing to wear his suitcase in nickys trunk but he stopped and stood behind teachs chair hector sat on the edge of the granite table i want to make a deal with you hector said she waited youve cost me a great deal today hector said in money in blood in risk perhaps you should reconsider your investments she said evenly im not going to contact your people and demand ransom im going to contact your people and demand loyalty youre going to help me i wont adam reynolds hes found ten of your people id like to know how many of them you have total im guessing twenty to thirty former and discredited cias maybe a few former kgbs who want to live and work in europe and asia a hacker and a thief thrown in for good measure that youve recruited she watched the tabletop i could torture you he said but god its just so distasteful and ineffective and id probably end up killing youyoud lead me down several false paths im sure and i know my own temper well enough to know id kill you in a rage he offered her a smile that reminded jackie of a fracture in a window what do you want she said finally i want the names and details of everyone who works for you in your private little cia teach every account you have every resource you have this is the part where i tell you to go to hell i think she said hell is crowded he answered he clicked on the laptop opened a video chat file the screen kicked to life it showed a young man in his late twenties bound to a chair mouth gagged his eyes were blackened as though he had been beaten already a dried trickle of blood inching down his chin past the gag he blinked into the camera flinching at the harsh light on his face he used to be antonio de la pena hector said excia field operative missing and presumed dead after a botched job against narcoterrorists in colombia his cover was blown and he had nowhere to go except witness protection but you made him a better offer hes worked under about three different aliases for you most recently in mexico city hector leaned closer to teach youre going to cooperate or he pays cooperate she said the word as though she were testing its taste in her mouth youre going to come to work for me teach you and everyone in the cellar youll follow my orders without question you will not let any of your agents know that there has been a change in leadership if you do not cooperate i will expose your entire illegal operation the government will disavow you like youre lepers and probably most of your people will end up in those lovely foreign prisons in those delightful countries where youve made so much mischief over the years teach did not tense her shoulders she did not tremble tell me the ten you know she said hector rattled off a list of names teach closed her eyes bit her lip she nodded toward the screen why grab him hes the youngest and most inexperienced if i have to kill one to prove a point hes the most expendable hector shrugged purely a business decision i take my orders from very few people she said i cant fool them by taking orders from another source let me guess the president she shook her head no the president never knows about us to preserve deniability a senior cadre of career officers within the agencythey give me direction youll continue to take their direction and will report to me all the orders you receive from washington but you will work for me not them and if i decline de la pena dies after ive killed his whole family hector crossed his arms he has a mother two sisters with husbands who have five children between them he glanced at jackie jackie could you kill a kid i dont much like kids jackie said id be game probably pays less though since theyre easier id give you a family rate hector turned back to teach none of your people want to be exposed want to go to prison want to be disavowed and prosecuted by the government they serve but they certainly dont want the people they cared about in their previous lives to be dead because of them you either work for me or ill gut the cellar she said nothing watching de la pena on the screen the man closed his eyes above the gag well tell de la pena that this was a training exercise ill let you live and a lot of innocent people keep breathing teach was silent and hector seemed willing to wait her out finally she said what do you get out of this arrangement im a firm believer that private firms are more effective than government agencies hector said not in our line of work she said spoken like a true bureaucrat he opened a folder two months ago you had a chance to kill a leading terrorist in istanbul but you missed three weeks ago you flub an opportunity to destroy a narcoterrorism cell in ecuador not inspiring anger reddened her face those failures had nothing to do with the skills of my people under my guidance you wont make so many mistakes who hired you she asked and jackie thought ah now thats a milliondollarquestion no one her laugh was brittle contractors dont work for free im making an investment in my companys future and im going to pay you and your people teach better than the government ever did he knelt close to her lifted her chin with his fingertips the fact you recruited and maintained an offthebooks organization for so long is brilliant you have the cellars collective history in that librarians head of yours you know every detail of every agent of every job i need you we can do great great work for our country together i dont want to destroy your group i want to give it new life you tried to kill pilgrim sam hector smiled at jackie he got too close to adam reynolds it was nothing personal and jackie saw that yes it certainly was personal a flash in the mans eyes as he turned away from teach interesting lets not leave your poor guy in suspense teach hector said does his family live or die live she said she cupped her hand on her forehead as though a migraine bloomed behind the bone ill cooperate good jackie mr de la pena is in the next room would you please untie him from the chair and bring him in here you can tell him this kidnapping was a field exercise one that he failed he watched teach for a reaction i have a job for him and for teach and several other agents he leaned close to teach you have an agent in denver get him to dallas by early morning tomorrow then we need to select at least six others for another project you tell him or your people anything they and their families are dead project she said the cellars going to kill a group of very bad guys for me he said in new orleans khaleds reportnew orleans there are six of us now in new orleanspreparing for our moments of glory six of us passed the first test to enter america without being caught i suppose our bosses could have easily snuck us in across the mexican border in the dead of night but they clearly want to weed out those who lack daring or are ineffective the unspoken deal is if im caught im on my own no one will help me two months ago i followed the instructions in a phone call and in a locker i found a ticket a thousand euros and a french passport in a new name for me i boarded a flight in beirut to frankfurt in frankfurt a man walked past me and slipped a new ticket and passport into my coat pocket first real problem one does not want to walk around in a western airport with an arabic face and multiple passports i destroyed the first passport by ripping it to bits and flushing the torn strips down the toilet i used the new belgian passport and the ticket flew to geneva then to rome i picked up a paged message left for me at the airline counterto meet j at a hotel not far from st peters square i took a roundabout route to the hotel thinking i could lose any tracker in the crowds and expanse of the massive square i was wrong at the hotel i was told by the fellow they called jhe has the bearing of a math teacher if you ask me and i am sure he is reading thisthat four men shadowed me following in a cascade so i would not notice one moving ahead of me and then picking me up again an invisible dance as i moved through the streets of rome j advised me of ways to circumvent such techniques i will practice more in america j tells me one must move without leaving a shadow j says and i quite like that phrase that idea because the alternative is to be caught and to die j let me keep my belgian passport with its french first name and lebanese last name and provided me a rental car to drive to paris in paris i flew to miami my seatmate was one of those tiresome boors who take a simple nod of hello as an invitation to interrogate you about every aspect of your life where you went to school where you live what you do what you likeand then must bury your every answer under his opinions i am sure such people simply cannot abide the sound of silence or the shallowness of their own thoughts but then i realized i need people like thatthey give information information is power this is my job now i was frightened for a moment that either this inquisitor was not an innocent nosy passenger but rather either friend or enemy determined to catch me in a lie seven miles up either to teach me a lesson or to unmask me he told me that he sells enterprise software to large financial institutions and i decided he was telling the truth i learned some important basics about banks and their operations this might be useful to me one day in selecting a target in interpreting data at immigration they looked hardwithout trying to seem soat my arabic face and they asked for my reasons to come to the united states i explained i was here on business as the sales representative of a startup software company based in brussels j had given me brochures and i had memorized the product features they asked their useless questions and i sailed through what would have happened though if i had been caught in a lie would i have been abandoned i suppose i very well might have been secret warriors can never be acknowledged it would have been a harsh lesson from miami a seductive jewel of a city i flew to new orleans a seductive ruin i expected that i would be followed at the airportthem trailing me to see if i had been trailed to avoid a repeat of my roman debacle when i thought myself so clever a necessary precaution i spotted one man following me but i am sure more lurked in my wake and im not going to claim a victory i did not earn following js instructions i took a cab first to the audubon zoo trying to lose any shadows in the milling crowds then i walked to tulane eyeing anyone who might be following then took another cab to the superdome i walked through a hotel checked into a room using my false name but never set foot in it walking through the back of the hotel grabbing a final cab to a chain hotel in the suburb of metairie new orleans is a strange half city now it reminds me of a oncetreasured plaything abandoned by a child entire stretches of the city remain utterly devastatedhere in a country that prides itself incessantly on its wealth its ambition and its shall i be frank superiority yet here is this blister on americas soul the neighborhoods that have returned to a semblance of normalcy still give the sense of lives lived on an edge of a hope tempered by the possibility that the city will never regain its former life i know how new orleans feels it is the way i feel and so i arrived two months ago and we started our work because it is a city where people are constantly coming and going staying leavingno one will notice us here in the ruins i had no instructions at the final hotel how was i to find my new colleagues adrift i thought perhaps i would show initiative i went for a walk heading toward a local mall and they grabbed me shortly after i arrived at the mall escorting me into a dark lincoln navigator i wasnt afraid we exchanged assigned code phrases ones j gave me in rome they drove me to a large home outside the city propernear a swath of a wealthy neighborhood ruined by floodwaters close to lake pontchartrainand to a large house which had fresh paint a new roof a sense of restored solidity the neighborhood remains mostly abandoned those who can afford nice houses can afford to leave the leader here is mr night is he reading my words if you are mr night you must admit your name is the definition of pretentious but it suits him dark unknowable yet somehow comforting if we listen to him well stay alive as we go to battle i am honing my skills i am learning how to travel and lose someone if followed how to follow someone without him knowing how to encode information so i can pass it undetected how to communicate back to my network without being discovered or found how to identify people who need to die how to get close to them and they will teach me how to kill not simply the techniques of murder but they will teach me not to hesitate j said this is the secret to killing you cannot hesitate in three days on sunday the holy day here we will head out into the world us six to do our duty without a moments hesitation the motel was old and clean owned by a smiling pakistani couple ben signed pilgrims counterfeit charge card in the name of james woodward with lipbiting care trying to make it identical to the tight scrawling signature on the card ben asked for a room on the side of the motel away from the highway he drove the car around to the back and halfcarried halfwalked pilgrim into the room and onto one of the twin beds hed found a target store near georgetown a small city north of austin and purchased clean clothes towels a duffel bag snack food a large bottle of antiseptic bottled water boxes of bandages and coban medical wrap saline solution peroxide and the most elaborate first aid kit offered he also bought a pair of forceps in the pharmacy section thinking as if im really going to dig metal out of him down the street was a grocery store and he bought two bottles of cheap chianti he peeled the blue shirt and khaki pants off the groggy pilgrim and dumped the bloodied clothes on the floor hard strength wired pilgrims body not gym or tennis muscles like bens a scar wandered like a river on a map across pilgrims stomach another seam of healed tissue bisected his shoulder it was as if the story of a life lived in shadows was burnt into his skin now a neat puckering wound marred the other shoulder an awful purpling continent of a bruise extended from hip to knee on the leg a tear across the forearm revealed where a bullet had pierced and exited ben gently inspected pilgrims legs and arms testing for broken bones all seemed whole bullets still in my shoulder pilgrim said gonna tell you what to do trusting you ben if i screw up im sorry youll do great ben followed pilgrims directions he eased pilgrim to the tub irrigated the wound with water disinfected both wound and forceps then back on the bed towels beneath the shoulder ben probed gently with the forceps into the wound i dont know what im doing so its going to hurt like a bitch he said pilgrim never screamed in the meat of his flesh the forceps touched then closed on a slug of metal ben inched the bullet free holding his own breath along with pilgrim ben dropped the bullet on the side table with a plunk swallowing a trickle of bile that rose into his throat okay pilgrim mumbled irrigate it with force hard ben helped him back to the tub and chugged water over the wound emptying several bottles then pouring saline then rinsing with peroxide pilgrim gritted his teeth ben smeared a generous spread of antibiotic ointment on gauze for the bandage he applied pressure with the bandage and then secured the pad with stretchy selfadhesive medical wrap colored bright blue he opened one of the screwcap bottles of cheapjug chianti hed bought for pilgrim to kill the pain and pilgrim took a giant swig of the red wine then ben cleaned disinfected and wrapped the forearm wound pilgrim let out a long sigh okay doctor youre done thank you ben went to the sink blood speckled his hands the new beach towels he had bought his pants hed slipped on when he got home back when his life was normal his hands stayed steady though and he stuck them under the jetting water im gonna down more of this premium vintage he inspected the label did you get you some wine ben i never drink before surgery ben noticed pilgrim had gulped down a third of the bottle pilgrim closed his eyes breathing through the pain ben collected pilgrims torn and bloody clothes he felt a weight in the pockets both front and back the front pocket held a small black notebook which tumbled to the floor as ben laid the pants on the chair he picked it up and opened it the notebooks pages were unlined and half of them were filled with delicate ink and pencil drawings a range of images were carefully inscribed on the ivory pages a baby swaddled in a fathers strong arms a toddler dancing in a garden of roses her pudgy hands reaching toward a fleeing butterfly a teenage girl bent reading a book on a park bench shaded by a wall of pine trees pushing a hank of dark hair from her face a gentleness pervaded the drawingsthe way that light captured the expressions of serenity and joy and concentration on the girls face thats mine pilgrim said opening his eyes ben handed the notebook to pilgrim embarrassed as though hed stepped into another persons dream he could feel another weight in the back pocketwhere pilgrim had drawn the credit card frombut pilgrims stare scored his back and he dropped the pants back on the floor you didnt strike me as the artistic type those are really well done im not artistic pilgrim closed the notebook kept it in his grip close to his chest its just good to have an eye for detail see things as they really are so really how are things right now ben went to the medical kit poured six ibuprofen into pilgrims hand watched him swallow them with sips of the chianti you got questions i hate questions i got questions get a glass i dont want to drink alone pilgrim said ben didnt want a drink but he got a glass if pilgrim drank to kill the pain it might loosen his tongue better to be sociable to get him talking ben found a clean plastic cup in the bathroom dumped an inch of wine in it life changes fast doesnt it pilgrim said yes he thought of the moment when his life divided married one second widowed the next the echo of the shattering window i killed seven people in the past four hours im like a goddamn serial killer all in one day pilgrim downed more of the chianti he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and ben saw his hand tremble you need some food ben heated water with the rooms tiny coffeemaker poured the hot liquid into a ramen noodle cup watched while pilgrim ate the spongy mass of noodles studded with chunky dried vegetables so your questions your boss you this secret group who are you a long pause teach is the general pilgrim said and shes the only one who knows the troop strength the battle plans ben decided to let pilgrim tell this his own way to let the answers unfurl because he could guess from pilgrims grimace that he was unused to discussing his life and the bad guys want to know what you and teach and this group do or keep you from doing your work pilgrim emptied the cup in an unsteady slop and reached again for the wine jug ben didnt stop him pilgrim gulped more chianti didnt look at ben for the first time the intense gaze in his eyes dimmed as though he were tired of glaring at the world ben decided to prod him the credit card was for james woodward is that your real name promise me you wont freak out i dont have a lot of freakout left in me i could tell you were thinking of going through my wallet i know youll do it as soon as im asleep go ahead ben went to the pocket dug out the wallet opened it a texas drivers license lay under a plastic window pilgrims face on it the name read forsberg benjamin lars ben thumbed through the rest of the wallet visa american express health club membership each one in bens name a business card that was a match of his own tucked into the wallet was an american passport pilgrims face bens name his breathing grew ragged and a slow rage rose in his chest he threw the wallet at pilgrim who caught it onehanded im you ben pilgrim said ive been you for the past three days youre the reason homeland thinks im guilty ben said it doesnt have anything to do with me or my life it has everything to do with your life pilgrim said you were framed as much as i was you stole my identity no your identity was given to me by a traitor he set me up to be you because someone wants us both destroyed you could have told me this immediately back in the car i couldnt have i needed your help and earlier i was too busy saving your life sit down drink your wine dont expect me to thank you ben went and picked up pilgrims gun off the table i dont think youre a fool you and i both got played both got nailed with a single shot weve got a common enemy he paused im not your enemy if i were youd be dead i would have grabbed you when you were checking the last of the bandages and broken your neck i didnt wow thank you ben put the gun back on the table tell me why youre pretending to be me the silence stretched between them like a wire drawn tight the only noise was the distant ripple of highway traffic and the drone of cicadas in the trees you told me you trusted me before i dug that bullet out prove it pilgrim cleared his throat the group im with does the dirty work that is necessary at times to identify and neutralize threats and protect the country dirty work the activities the other agencies are legally blocked from doing you do the jobs no one can take credit for or be blamed for pilgrim blinked excellent description wheres your budget hiddenfbi cia pilgrim looked at him with a bit more respect only teach knows for sure but i think the budgets hidden inside the cia cobbled together from miscellaneous funding were a back corner a forgotten room he paused its called the cellar and you routinely hijack other peoples identities no at least never before a little shit named barker created my legendsmy identitieswhen im on a job normally he spun them out of thin air invented a name a history a financial background he gave me your identity i had no idea you really existed he also betrayed me and teach he worked with her kidnappers which means his bosswhoever that isgave him your name to use he paused i didnt know you were real but why me id say whoever barker worked for hates your guts no one hates me or youre a huge threat to someone you just dont know it ben rubbed his forehead what was your job where you needed my name to investigate adam reynolds he took another long sip of the chianti over the past few weeks every alias or false identity used by myself or one of my cellar colleagues was being tracked credit checks were run against the fake names inquiries were being made our aliases brought to the attention of police in new york london atlanta other cities when were done with a job we walk away from the aliasesbut we keep an eye on them for a while after the job is done in case someone tries to track us through the false identities adam reynolds tracked you he was a software designer so he had to be using technology to find and discover our activities but we have no idea how he did it and you dragged my name in we needed to find out why he was after us and who funded him teach got an old cia contact to tell adam reynolds a contractor consultant named ben forsberg might be able to help him land funding for a startup software company to build products based on his ideas but i thought ben forsberg was just an identity barker made up along with a history barker bought the cell phones in my name opened the credit accounts rented the office space ben shook his head sparta consulting thats what he used as a cover spartas a front company for the cellar a way to camouflage our financial dealings pilgrim coughed winced at the pain i got three meetings with adam and i told him i represented a bunch of government contractors interested in backing his software ideas i could help him set up his own company fund the work share the profits of course all i wanted to do was find out how hed found us and whod paid him to hunt us down you wrote the business proposal with my name on it that kidwell and vochek found in his office ben said nausea clawed into his guts i wanted to learn how he found our aliases see who his business contacts were find who funded his search for the cellar so why did he get killed he knew this afternoon that i wasnt ben forsberg i tried to make him understand i could protect him but he told me hed called homeland but i dont think he worked for homeland in trying to find the cellar why homeland security doesnt hire arab gunmen to kidnap people theyre not into assassination and they have no reason to frame you so his boss is who no idea and if his boss knew adam was bolting clearly he didnt want adam talking about his search for us and the cellar is the threat to national security he described to kidwell clearly he viewed us as a threat ben got up from the bed walked to the window so nicky lynch killed him and you killed lynch you put my business card in lynchs pocket the rage swelled in his chest held its breath and then was gone replaced by a exhausting realization of how bad his situation was he couldnt afford the distraction of anger he shivered as he stood by the window even though the room was warm ben listen i didnt know you were a real person my cover had been blown i thought i was leaving a nonexistent man as the fall guy an empty trail for the police to follow he shook his head i didnt know i would be pointing a finger at you ben sat down on his bed if nicky lynch killed you and adam it would come out quick enough that you werent me so im not convinced that whoever your enemy is hes also mine your guy barker could have just decided to use my name since im in the line of work you needed for your cover story pilgrim refilled his cup with wine i dont think its a coincidence that when im in austin pretending to be you youre out of town who knew you were gone ben hesitated my clients i told them so they would know i wouldnt be answering phone calls or emails and sam hectorwhose people were guarding you for homelandis one of your clients yes my most valued client my friend pilgrim studied the empty plastic cup frowned the government contracting world is a small one ben said hector probably has dozens of people working on homeland projects just because he has a security detail working with homeland then imagine this nicky lynch shoots straight im lying dead with a wallet with your name inside the authorities would want to know if you were connected to me theyd just assume you stole my identity it seems incomplete as a frameup but lets say the government thought we were working together you a contractor and me a guy whos not supposed to exist who works for an offthebooks group your reputation in the government might die the death of a thousand small cuts you very well could lose your business ben shifted on the bed kidwells office of strategic initiatives did you ever hear of it inside homeland pilgrim eased himself into a new position on the bed trying to get comfortable no but i dont much pay attention to bureaucracies theyre poison he put the wine cup down exhaustion filled his face kidwells team could be as dirty as yours ben said he sure wasnt about to give me due process the only way we get free and clear of this mess he said is to expose whoever took teach they framed us we get caught we have no means of nailing whoever hired adam ben got up began to pace to think i need to sleep now pilgrim closed his eyes exhaustion gripping him well get to dallas in the morning one minute who would attack the cellar any number of enemies terrorists for sure im sure that certain foreign governments would be glad for the cellar to shut up shop they might suspect we exist but they cant prove it fewer than five people outside of the cellar even know we exist and now me pilgrim nodded his eyes closed and now you lucky you ben watched him fall asleep over the next several minutes if he ran nowabandoned pilgrimhe might very well be walking straight into a bullets path whoever had attacked the cellar had used his name pilgrim was right it couldnt be coincidence it was safer for now to stay close to pilgrim see what he could find out because he could find out nothing from a jail cell or a homeland security interrogation room he wondered if vochek was still locked in the closet ben lay down pressed his face into his pillow he felt like hed fallen into an alternate world a wonderland gone dark where a crazy guy used his name and police hunted for him and vicious men held guns to his head this morning he had woken up on a lowkey vacation now his life was in tatters dont kid yourself your life has been in tatters since emily died he couldnt sleep and he sat up and turned on cnn and saw his name his face on the television his drivers license picture the anchor described ben as a person of interestpublicrelationsspeak for suspect homeland security wanted to know his connection to a purported contract killer with ties to terrorist cells who had been found dead in austin after shooting a victim who also had connections to forsberg the anchor announced ben had escaped from homeland custody in a shootout in which a respected decorated homeland agent died anyone with information on forsberg or his whereabouts was asked to call a special number at homeland security he had barely managed to rebuild after emily died he had survived the stares the whispers but never the guilt the pointless guilt of taking her to maui for the honeymoon the endless guilt of being alive when she was dead now something far more poisonous than guiltsuspicion his wife had been murdered and his name was tied to a contract killer he wasnt going to get a second chance in the judicial system or the court of public opinion unless his name was absolutely cleared escaped from custody he heard the anchors words echo in his head ben touched his own face on the television screen he was now a hunted man vochek didnt much like kids but she could never forget the two dead boys she had first seen the small crumpled bodies when she stepped into a bulletblasted living room six months ago in kabul afghanistan as she entered the ransacked house that awful gray morning she had pulled tighter around her face the hijab she wore out of deference to tradition the scarf masked the burnt smell of gunfire and hid the trembling of her own mouth as she stood over the pitiful bodies she reached to touch the children but her fingers stopped just short of their dark mops of hair one was nine the other ten both boys if they had been american children their pajamas would have featured scoobydoo or power rangers or spiderman but these two boys wore pjs with a repeating pattern of soccer balls with rainbow arcs of speed drawn behind each ball to suggest a powerful and accurate kick they lay on their stomachs and she realized that theyd been shot in the back there was no sign of the childrens parents people she knew freelance translators who worked with the state department she knew them because she was here to help the kabul government shape and refine its own version of homeland security the boys father had called her an hour earlier waking her from a deep sleep i wonder ms vochek if you could come by and talk to me and my wife we have information of value time is critical its two of your people the afghan officer in charge of the scene said my people she tore her gaze away from the children i dont understand yes the killers two men from the state department the people who killed these kids work for state horror filled her voice yes in the security division they grabbed the parents stuck them in a trunk after they shot the family wife is dead husband is wounded may not make it through the night the afghan officer shrugged what is wrong with you people she was placed in charge of the interrogation of the two state department employees the afghan government fed the media a careful fiction announcing that two unknown gunmen had attacked the family vocheks questioning of the two state department employees showed yes they worked for statebut they were taking orders from a secret group within state operating in kabul as a private information network this group was driven by its own agenda to spy on the insurgent taliban the group believed the parents knew of the locations of key taliban figures one of the two gunmen triggerhappy cut down the children as they fled from their parents attackers didnt mean to one of the men told her we were just going to take the parents to force them to talk the kids freaked ran we couldnt have them waking the neighborsas if gunfire wouldnt shatter the quiet and i just shot them the man wept because no one could know what we were doing no one the idea that a small rogue group could be operating independently secretly and illegally inside the vast maze of the government made her sick washington smothered the story the two state department employees who worked in the bureau of diplomatic security were sent back to the united states charged with far less serious crimes vochek protested she was told to forget the incident and she had no idea what had happened to any other members of the rogue cadre inside stateif they had been charged or dismissed or told to proceed a bit more cautiously with their underthetable work it was grossly unfair and she complained about it in memo after memo to her supervisor the only response was a maddening silence until margaret pritchard appeared in her office one afternoon pritchard was in her late fifties a carefully groomed woman with ash blond hair and slightly oversized eyeglasses she introduced herself as being from a homeland task force in washington that vochek had never heard of she shut the door of vocheks office you dont like the idea of these unapproved covert groups no i dont they offend you it was a dry observation ive read your memos and your emails you certainly love your outraged adverbs i dont love outrage but it serves a purpose pritchard leaned forward would you like to help me shut these groups down no thank you why not because the government doesnt want these dirty dogs shut down they had their chance i saw two men who killed a family get slapped on the wrist i dont want to participate in another charade dirty dogs i like that term but this isnt a charade the administration wants these groups closed and ended but with no publicity no acknowledgment that they ever existed this is a problem thats been building over timetoo many agendas not enough accountability too much leeway given to produce intelligence and hard results ive been put in charge of a team to find the illicit groups gather evidence against them build a strong case and then gut them she leaned back crossed her arms you and the rest of the team will have enormous latitude i havent said yes yet how many groups are there margaret pritchard shrugged i dont know sometimes groups have formed then dissolved i suspect theres a very private cia hidden inside the cia establishing whether or not they exist will be our first job we have our suspicions she reached into her briefcase unfurled a long piece of paper a web of colored lines connected circles the circles overlapped the names of the agencies and the departments cia fbi nsa defense state homeland we suspect certain activitiesassassinations thefts sabotagewere ordered by a cadre of people inside the government contrary to our current foreign policies they might produce good results but this isnt how our government operates were unsure where the groups are hiding inside the bureaucratic mazewhere they get their money their people their resources youre forming a secret group to find a secret group vochek gave her a bitter laugh it takes a thief margaret pritchard leaned back from the chart youll work out of the houston office i dont want people in dc knowing what were doing well keep our numbers few very lowprofile make heavy use of outside contractors so word doesnt spread among the people were investigating no good deed could bring back the afghan boys in pajamas but if there were no secret groups then there were no rogue operations there was accountability she would have to keep her silence for the sake of the government but the rogues using government cover and resources to advance their own agendas would be gone she wanted to make the first mark for right in the ledger she thought she had with ben forsberg she opened her eyes at the sound of the hospital door opening and margaret pritchard stood at the foot of her bed vochek blinked against the early morning light hazing in from the window not a word other than pleasantries well talk shortly vochek nodded your notoriously hard head seems to be undamaged im fine the attacker had left her with a bad knot i took the liberty of bringing you some of your clothes from houston pritchard held up a bag clearly im paying you too much does my mom know i was hurt not from me thats for you to tell her joanna thank you vochek went into the bathroom she had showered earlier that morningawake at four restless she opened the bag two of her chanel suits summerweight gray two armani suits and silk blouses shoes that matched hosiery underwear bought from a store clothes were her one vanity but she had found it paid to look like she meant business pritchard was a thorough soul and shed included in the bag basic makeup deodorant toothpaste toothbrush and floss vochek wished for a moment that her mother had half the initiative and poise of margaret pritchard she would have to call mom today but better to wait until she was out of the hospital so she didnt have to lie by default vochek used the toiletries and dressed in her favorite suit it felt like putting on armor she was ready to go face the world again she felt entirely herself again for the first time since pilgrims gun smacked into her head the hospitals set you free pritchard said come on they walked down in silence to a back exit of the hospitalaway from any curious pressand a waiting lincoln town car pritchard had a drivercumbodyguard a powerfully built man who raised the bulletproof privacy partition as soon as the car pulled away from the curb the car left the hospital complex drove past the interstate into east austin the morning traffic on the highways was spiraling toward dismal she had read austin had the worst congestion of any midsized city in the nationand the driver stuck to side roads im sorry about kidwell pritchard said vochek privately thought that pritchard was probably closer to kidwell than she was but she said thanks what exactly did you tell the police when they found you i stuck to the story kidwell ordered me to tell if we ever ran into trouble vochek looked out the window they drove past brightly painted taquerias and mexican bakeries the lots full of commuters and workers grabbing breakfast and coffee that i work for homeland security on a classified project and cannot discuss my assignment repeat as needed the local police have come to jesus pritchard said it has been explained to them that the shootings bear on a highly secretive operation relating to national security theyre keeping their mouths shut and responding to our requests for assistance fbi has charge of the official investigation they only know that yours and kidwells work was classified and is not to be publicized you will have to give them a statement later today but ive already written it for you pritchard handed her the morning edition of the austin paper and she scanned the story a photo of ben forsberg stared back at her the story described a brazen attack on an office rented by homeland security in downtown austin one agent slain one survived two contractor security guards assigned to the building killed three suspected attackers were dead all three men were unidentified but the paper suggested with a nod toward terror were described as arabic this followed hours after two shootings downtown one of a software programmer the other of a man at a parking garage who remained unidentified but had a canadian passport and fit the description of a known assassin from northern ireland forsberg a local businessman was missing the paper darkly hinted that he might have information on the attackershe was described as a person of interest to the police a state official warned about terrorists bringing their fight to american soil a spokesman at the washington headquarters of homeland security had no immediate comment neither did the fbi theres no mention of the man who attacked me does everyone think the gunmen committed suicide vochek couldnt keep the acid out of her voice of course not pritchard said this job is aging me faster than my teenagers tell me everything vochek did pritchard had the disconcerting habit of listening to detailed accounts with her eyes closed when vochek finished pritchard opened her eyes this man was looking for a woman named teach do you have any idea who she is vochek shook her head but im real interested in her why because he is pritchard leaned back against the leather a statement from homelands going to be issued shortly we have identified the three arabs as being part of a new terrorist cell they attacked the new austin facility because of scant security is that true well im told that theres been increased cell phone chatter to make homeland and fbi believe that terror organizations are trying to create more cells here alqaeda hezbollah a couple of small but ambitious groups like sons of the sword and blood of fire the gunmen might be lebanese but we dont have confirmation yet so why say theyre terrorists until were sure because we need the cover four more people died at a lake house near austin three of them were arabs as well if we say its a terror cell then we dont have to explain in much more detail the idea of hired guns from lebanon attacking our office creates more questions actually than saying terrorists did it because heres the next problem this was the fourth corpse pritchard slid a picture toward her the young guy was bespectacled skinny with a bitter expression on his face unhappy at having his picture taken who is he his name was david shaw he was a black hat hacker suspected of breaking into a department of defense network his hacker name was big barker he was awaiting trial when he vanished a year ago how does he connect with the arabs other than lying dead with them on a floor ive no idea pritchard tented her fingers put them against her lip vochek tapped bens picture on the paper i did not mention him to the police ben forsberg became a falling row of dominoes the austin police listened to kidwells recording of forsbergthe one left in the interrogation room they know kidwell suspected him of involvement in the reynolds murder then when forsbergs name went out on the wire the media searched on his name hit accounts of his wifes death the press got ahold of him and hes the only answer theyve got so bens their focal point yes and thats fine with me pritchard opened a laptop tapped a few keys a video began to playtwo men running one clearly injured someone tried to kill your attacker and ben forsberg last night in a parking garage off second street bullet holes all along one wall blood we got a solid image of mr nice guys face from the security camera pritchard tapped more keys the photos blew up focusing on the mens faces one was ben forsberg the other was the bigshouldered man whod hit her and locked her in the closet and inadvertently saved her life yes thats him weve had facial recognition programs running to see if we can find a match on him pritchard tapped her fingertips together kidwell poor son of a bitch he was much closer to striking gold than he knew she clicked on another file conjured another photo on the screen in the picture the man was a decade younger had brown hair his old jaw was more pointed and his nose was thicker more hawkish then he was plain neither handsome nor ugly a face that you wouldnt remember but the eyesthe blue eyes that watched her over the barrel of the gunwere the same intense i think its him hes had minor surgery there on the nose and cheeks and chin who is he randall choate pritchard said he was a top cia assassin he massively screwed up a cia mission in indonesia ten years ago got caught he was jailed near samarinda and then died in an escape attempt while crossing the mahakam river an indonesian police captain testified he shot choate four times in the back i thought corpses didnt keep so well in humid climates the body was never recovered police assumed that it was swept down to the makassar strait and out to sea the police captain lied clearly bribed pritchard said choates the key joanna hes the smoking gun an odd joy tinged pritchards voicedriven by the scent of the prey close at hand vochek thought hes been working for someone for ten years and its not the cia its not any agency we find him maybe we find our first real unapproved group inside the government our first major success in bringing down the unauthorized illegal dirty dogs the big prize this guy could be it the key to the suspected private cia the biggest of the illicit groups shivers of anticipation of fear of resolve traveled down vocheks spine she studied the mans face it held no weakness but last night he had been weak he should have killed her when he had the chance she would bring him down margaret pritchard closed her laptop your work has never mattered more joanna this is our best chance i want to feel this group wriggling right under my thumb especially if choate killed kidwell she gave her a half smile im counting on you to give them to me yes maam she paused he could have killed me he didnt why would he kill kidwell unknown and we dont know the relationship between forsberg choate and these arabs make no assumptions these people could have all been in league together these alliances often fracture into bloodshed and what choate and these arabs kill kidwell and the contractors and then choate kills the arabs she shook her head well well only find out how they all connect by finding choate and forsberg my cell phones gone im assuming that choate took it and still has it so heres a new one call them she handed vochek a phone vochek dialed her old number said after her voice mail greeting id like my phone back and to talk maybe we can help each other she gave her new number and hung up they may not turn the phone on so it cant be traced what now you say goodbye to me ive got a private jet ready to take you to dallas adam reynolds tried to call this delia moon woman there four times yesterday before he died id like to know why she was in no shape to answer questions when i called her she didnt know about adams death she went into hysterics i warned her rather sternly she was not to speak with the press pritchard glanced out the window they were turning into the austin airport heading toward a section for private planes and i want to know if theres any connection between ben forsberg and nicky lynch other than that business card if forsberg is working with choate there has to be an earlier time in their lives where they intersect and see what else you can learn about bens life with his wife she died in hawaii but they lived in dallas anything else yes the security guards that died they worked for hector global pritchard paused for the barest moment yes hector globals based in dallas i should stop by and extend my condolences pritchard shook her head best to keep a distance im getting massive grief for hiring contractors for security but when youre hunting dirty dogs in your own yard theyre easier to trust forsberg said sam hector was a major client of his hector might be able to give me some insight into forsberg pritchard shook her head again sam hectors going to be under a press microscope because his people were killed i dont want you showing up on his doorstep and creating more questions for the media stay out of sight focus on what ive asked you to do hector will provide us information if needed all right i feel the need though to clear up a problem before you set me loose she crossed her arms im not kidwell how so he was crossing lines with forsberg i dont want to criticize the dead but he was threatening forsbergs family friends with arrest threatened to destroy his career get all his contracts canceled threats can work wonders we have a mandate joanna shut down all illicit covert operations if i have to bend a few laws to catch the lawbreakers that we normally have little to no chance of catching otherwise im not going to worry about it and neither should you pritchard put steel in her stare you wanted to come to work for me joanna because you were tired of these people doing dirty work and not being held accountable dont complain now it wasnt an argument she was going to win this choate guy what will he do to ben depends on how useful forsberg is pritchard shrugged choates been rogue for ten years i doubt that has inculcated loyalty in him forsberg could be dead real soon she put on her sunglasses kidwells service will be in a few days ill let you know the arrangements hopefully our dirty dogs will be brought to heel by then and call your mom give her the new number i doubt you want her chatting with a man like choate pritchards small and secretive group of dirty dog hunters lay tucked in a back corner of the homeland security department given their low profile they were not about to tip a hand by asking the cia for randall choates file if the man in the parking garage photo was the agencys notsodead former agent but pritchards worker bees had put together a rushed dossier for vochek since the face match had been tentatively made and she studied it in detail as the homeland jet made the fast flight to dallas born randall thomas barnes thirtysix years ago in little rock arkansas randall was his mothers maiden name thomas a grandfathers name father died drunk behind the wheel when young randall was age two mother moved around taking a variety of secretarial jobs from arkansas to west virginia and finally to lafayette indiana where her fortunes took a considerable leap upward when she got a job working as a secretary in the foreign languages department at purdue university one of the junior professors michael choate who specialized in russian literature of the nineteenth century took an interest in the young widow and her son randall soon acquired a stepfather who eventually adopted him encouraging the boy to apply his considerable intellect to school his stepfather also taught him russian from an early age randall doublemajored in russian and history at purdue graduating with honors the file included a scattering of old photos of randall from the purdue student paper and yearbook randall was a nondescript boy pale but with a strong body and those eyes of certainty of intensity in most of the photos he was alone or standing off from the group in one photo taken at an intramural football game his teammates had arms around him randall choate smiled like hed rather go play the game all on his own she recognized the smilesame as the one hed given her after hed knocked the baton from her hand one of amused respect at the suggestion of a faculty colleague of his stepfathers who had contacts at the agency randall applied to the cia and was accepted and there the file ended except for the note that he was reported killed while escaping prison in indonesia four years later the mission hed supposedly botched remained classified and the busy bees at homeland were working to glean more details without directly asking the agency personal details his mother and stepfather still lived in lafayette his wife kimberly daughter tamara were all unaware of his status as an assassin wife had remarried five years ago the new stepfather adopted tamara history repeating itself family told that he had been involved in drug smuggling in indonesia died during a prison escape a nasty story for the disavowed no evidence of contact of the family by choate in the intervening years vochek closed the file the cia either knew that choate was still alive and his death a decade ago had been a cover story to pull a screwedup agent out of jail or they didntin which case it would be easy to ascribe sinister motives as to why choate faked his own demise the plane dipped into the northern stretches of urbanized prairie and to vocheks surprise the runway appeared stretching along a row of highend houses in a square formed by four busy thoroughfares lined with shopping centers and restaurants what airport is this she asked the pilot plano air ranch park he said private air park with a runway right alongside the homes buy a house get access to the runway park your plane in your backyard got built before dallas boomed this far homeland bought a house here a couple of years back more private for our comings and goings than flying into addison or dfw ms pritchard said you could stay at the house i got a key for you and weve got an extra car we keep there you can use he paused ive flown a few bad guys out from there flown em to mexico or the caymans and i dont know where they get shipped to after that he paused sometimes them bad boys cry during the flight knowing they dont know where theyre going uncertaintys not a good feeling she said the plane landed and the pilot drove the plane to the homeland house parked it under a covered hangar and handed her a set of car and house keys holler at me whenever youre ready to fly out your bad guy the pilot said im on call i wont be bringing back a really bad guy she said i just have people to question the day is young the pilot smiled you never know what youre gonna find indonesia ten years ago the man they called the dragon hadnt shown up for the rendezvous fine choate thought he hated working with a partner and particularly disliked one being forced on him one more hour he decided night began to fall on the park the pond turned a hazy purple as the sun began to dip below the smoggy rooftops of jakarta choate sat near the gazebo a trio of young musicians slightly drunk and out of key sat on the steps and picked out beatles covers on their guitars choates orders from the cia chief in jakarta had been clear we have a freelancer working for us he has information on a financial trail to a terroristgroup here youre going to help him meet him at this park at seven this evening choate waited as the parks sunnyday crowd began to thin just him and the musicians left and a couple of old sisters tossing scraps of bread into the water for the ducks he got up as the trio started on an offkey rendition of hey jude done he walked past the gazebo scattering a few coins into the open guitar case hes not coming a voice behind him said and choate turned the trio of musicians stood smiling one of them pulling a gun from behind his guitar the other pulling one from a weathered knapsack choate froze i dont know what you mean he said your friend the dragon the guitarist said he laughed stupid name is it supposed to make him sound fearsome dragons are false theyre nothing hes gone into hiding for good reason i dont understand choate said what do you want youll come with us the guitarist said only to talk choate took a step back one grabbed his arm the shot rang out and the guitarists chest gashed a red fog and he collapsed onto the stairs the crack of the shot was as loud as a whip the two old sisters at the pond screamed they fell behind a bench still screeching choate slammed a fist into the second mans face spun him around choate closed hands over the mans wrists they grappled for control of his gun choate could smell the mans breath reeking of fish and garlic another shot echoed across the parkland it caught the mans head a bare two inches from choates jerked him off his feet and spattered choate with gore choate yelled and dropped the corpse one left the tallest musician he turned and ran no avenging shot from the distance rang out so choate grabbed the gun from his attacker steadied his aim and fired missed his second shot caught the man square in the calf he collapsed with a choking howl clutching his leg choate heard running feet behind him he spun leveled his gun at a man hurrying toward him a sniper rifle in his hands the man had a shaved head was about ten years older than choate bigframed he spoke with a british accent grab him lets find his car we need to know who he works for youre the dragon god youre green the man said stupid of you to let yourself be followed here and listen to their bad music for two hours i wasnt followed clearly asshole the dragon said you were lets go the police are actually responsive in this part of jakarta he grabbed the wounded man hurried him to his feet and spat words in indonesian while pressing the barrel of the rifle against the mans throat the man gestured toward a parking lot on the east side of the park and gasped what choate thought was a plea for mercy choate fished car keys out of the mans pocket and they rushed toward the lot choate pressing the autounlock button in wide sweeps one of the cars taillights blinked they shoved the man into the backseat with the dragon choate drove thank you choate said what thank you you saved my life he felt dizzy with adrenaline ah well of course the dragon spoke as a man unused to niceties in the rearview choate saw the dragon watch the road ahead and behind making sure they were not being trailed and that choate knew how to navigate the tangled maze of jakarta streets he asked the prisoner a question in indonesian and got an reply in english yes a little english who do you work for the prisoner hesitated i have one more bullet in my gun just for you you talk you live the prisoner licked his lips shuddered choate thought maybe he was nineteen blood of fire but i am new please i dont know names i cant help you blood of fire choate said small terror cell big ambitions the dragon answered and the target for the job we were supposed to discuss tonight is tied to blood of fire which means they know we have a leak they know we were rendezvousing and they tried to take you out choates throat went dry life was easier when the targets were unsuspecting how did you know cias after you the dragon asked i dont know my friend told us he was the first one you shot i just follow their orders they feed me he added in a small voice i am a nobody youre not convincing the dragon said to the prisoner to choate he said do you know where the deepra garbage dump is choate nodded drive there shouldnt we take him to cia no im not official cia and on this job neither are you that was news to choate but he kept his mouth shut and put his gaze back to the road it is unholy the amount of garbage eighteen million people can produce the junk dumps of jakarta covered thousands of acres populated by scavenger families wise in the ways of salvage the deepra dump loomed like a miniature mountain range the discarded steel of cars purple in the starlight flocks of gulls hovering over the waste the smell of refuse like a slap from the hand of death they drove inside choate following the dragons directions to a secluded area scavenger tents huddled on one side but as the car approached the wastefinders ducked back into their hovels you know why they hide the dragon said to the prisoner they hide because they dont want to be witnesses a nice sedan does not come here after nightfall to dump a ton of garbage nice sedans only come here to dump bodies the prisoner made a soft wet noise in his throat we should take him back to cia choate said again they can interrogate him i dont do interrogations on cia property im all about deniability he jerked the prisoner by the shirt how did you know about our meeting the prisoner stared at the waste worst case isnt killing you and dumping your body out there worst case is hurting you really badly and leaving you out there to have all the flesh on your bones picked off by the birds the scavengers wont help you no one will help you now in an hour you can be free with a doctor to tend your wound and a nice hot bowl of soup to eat your choice the prisoner said nothing for thirty long seconds and choate thought just tell him answer his question gumalar knows that you are targeting him the prisoner said who is gumalar choate said financier got allah in a big way and hes the one funneling the money to terrorists the dragon said his brothers a big deal in the indonesian government so thats why taking him down is such a quiet job the prisoner said i require a doctor how does gumalar know this the dragon said wheres the leak we found people working for you the prisoner said over the past few days five of them they gave us enough information to know about your meeting to know where to watch for you where are my people the dragons voice went low and cold the prisoner shrugged i dont know you have a staff choate asked the dragon didnt look at him stare locked on the prisoner i have informants who feed me info i sell to cia you had informants the prisoner said the dragon gave the prisoner a jawsnapping slap where do i find gumalar you cant touch him the prisoner finally spoke with defiance in his voice on the radio a news report began to play two men identified as agents of badan intelijen negara the indonesian governments intelligence service had been found shot to death in a park oh shit choate said you killed good guys good is relative the dragon said our target has the good guys on his payroll you cant touch gumalar and i dont know where he is the prisoner said then what use are you the dragon said he fired once the bullet making a hard percussive noise in the tight confines of the car jesus he could have told us more choate yelled hardly choate said pop the trunk choate hands shaking slightly obeyed the dragon got out of the sedan went to the back froze choate hurried out of the car in the truck was a large plastic bag inside of it smeared with gore were a bunch of severed hands big calloused ones smooth feminine ones ones wearing rings others bare of jewelry choate leaned away from the car and fought down the urge to vomit ten the dragon said after a moment there are ten my five informants so what do we do now they sat in the dark throat of a jakarta bar miles from the park miles from the dump gumalars leak is because he has someone big inside bin in his pocket so this stays an offthebooks job for the agency i was told to follow your orders choate said he wasnt comfortable with this but orders were orders then we stick with our original plan we need to find the money trail this gumalar fucker is using to finance terrorism we find the money we tie him to it and we kill him along with his terror cell contact we make it look like the terrorist turned on him keep cias nose out of it and you need me to find the money trail gumalar owns a large bank here its going to undergo a cyber attack in twelve hours youll be called in as a representative of the it

down at the room at the end of the hall the dragon went into another room choate put an ear to the heavy door soundproofed he went to the room and collapsed on the bed he didnt like this at all but he had his orders he curled into a ball and let sleep close over him trying not to think of the bag of severed hands or the shocked face of the dead prisoner staring up past the mounds of garbage toward the starkissed sky his first morning as a fugitive ben was afraid the maid would come early to the room or that the motel owners would see his face on cnn this was a new kind of fear it didnt pass when you turned on the lights in the darkened room or reassured yourself the midnight tap at the window was a tree branch moved only by the wind this fear stayed with you it worked on your mind it made every moment urgent at am friday they left the hotel ben drove heading north toward dallas pilgrim wrote directions down on paper told ben this is where we go first in dallas the x on the map was near the dallasfort worth international airport pilgrim dozed fitfully in the back still in pain but his color was much better than the night before they got a bag of breakfast tacos at a stand in lorena south of waco pilgrim woke and ate with a lions appetite drank a giant bottle of juice ben swapped the license plates off the stolen volvo with those of a subaru parked close to the baylor university campus in waco ben did the work quickly using a wrench hed found in a miniature tool set in the back of the station wagon now im a fugitive and a thief he thought and the day is still young college students are slow to notice things like changed plates pilgrim said i find it useful to steal plates from fraternity parking lots on weekends not to stereotype but theyre too drunk its a baptist school baylor kids are not supposed to drink ben said then i hope theyre distracted by spiritual matters pilgrim closed his eyes and slept again the traffic wasnt heavy until they hit the southern suburbs of dallas a long trail of cars heading into downtown and pilgrim woke up questions for you pilgrim said about sam hector he sounded stronger now more alert ready to rumble how bigs his operation one of the biggest three thousand employees huge training complexes one an hour east of dallas the other in nevada most of his execs are former military decorated officers security training software if the government uses it he sells it ben gave a soft laugh sam joked once about using that as a company motto and you worked with him for how long my wife emily worked for sam that was how we met she was an accountant in one of his divisions he hired me to help him win new contracts after she died i left dallas i became a consultant and he kept me busy his revenues grown five hundred percent since ive been working with him so youre just a really good pimp pilgrim said excuse me i read about some of those contracts these guys land the government gets in a hurrylike when we invade iraqand they dont take lots of competing bids yeah sometimes there are huge time pressures to get the work done and these contracts they have profit built in no matter how bad the contractor screws up or goes over budget well these are often highrisk operations ben said news flash ben every business is a risk not every business can get you killed for about every four soldiers who die in iraq a contractor dies they dont get medals or military funerals or army benefits they dont get military hospitals they dont get a parade when they come home pilgrim was silent ben couldnt resist and i dont think its bad a business makes a profit but guaranteed profit how many regular companies are guaranteed a profit sort of takes quite a bit of the risk and the responsibility out of the equation ben returned his gaze to the road i hit a nerve pilgrim said sure there are crooked contractors people taking money for work they cant or wont do but abuses happen any time millions of dollars are dangled but youre not part of the problem right youre part of the solution if you want to insult me i can stick that bullet back in your shoulder at high speed it might be interesting to see you try ben the reason contractors exist now is because of choices made by the governments weve elected ben said people dont want a draft they dont want a huge military and they dont seem to mind that gaps in military infrastructure are being filled by private companies i dont see protestors at my clients offices very often these guys are making a good return on investment i doubt its a good investment for america pilgrim said what if the fighting gets too tough the contractors can quit soldiers cant that hasnt happened bullshit certain engineering firms pulled out of iraq because theyre spending way too much on security if thats the army corps of engineers doing the work and the army providing the security they have to stay its called accountability odd the interest in accountability since you stole my name given not stolen back to hector background longtime military worked as a liaison to officers of foreign armies then went into security consulting ah so mr hector lets the military spend a fortune training him and instead of being a career officer he takes that investment america made in him and goes private being in the army isnt an automatic lifetime enlistment but most people dont profit in the millions when they chuck their dog tags ben frowned when emily died sam hector was a good friend to me he paid me even when i wasnt up to working steered contracts my way gave me my first work when i was ready to get back in the game hes a man of exceptional loyalty loyalty then sam hector and i have something in common pilgrim pulled a cell phone from his pocket examined it turned it on briefly shut it off barker called a cell phone owned by the hotel you were held at before all hell broke loose the hotel owner is a company called mckeen you know them no you ever heard of blarneys steakhouse ben nodded there are a few in dallas im interested in the one in frisco you eat there once its the original one in the chain i found a blarneys matchbook in the pocket of one of the gunmen the construction signage indicated that a blarneys was going in at the waterloo arms ben tapped fingers on the steering wheel theres a connection there we need to understand pilgrim tossed barkers phone to the floorboard pulled another one out of his pocket this belongs to the lovely agent vochek he rolled the phone along his fingers if i turn the phone on they can trace it ben had a thought when i was arguing with them about the cell phone numbers you bought in my name vochek told kidwell that adam reynolds made several phone calls to dallas yesterday afternoon she might have tried to call the same number pilgrim powered on the phone he switched to the call log she called her mommy last nice girl he thumbed further down read a number aloud shut off the phone thats the most recent dallas phone number ah there are two new voice mails i bet theyre for me he hit the key that played the voice mail held the phone so they could both hear it the first voice mail was a woman sounding cautious hi ms vochek this is delia moon you called and left a message for me so im returning your call you have my number the second voice mail was vochek asking for her phone back pilgrim switched off the phone i dont think i want to call ms vochek today he tucked the phone back into his pocket we need to know who this delia moon woman is she might know who adam was working for a lot of choices what do we do first pilgrim considered stick to the plan we get resources then a base of operations he leaned down pulled a wallet from his bag then we go visit my friend barkers house and see if we can find out who turned him traitor pilgrim kept his resources in a nondescript threestory airconditioned storage facility they walked under the regular pulsing roar of departing flights from dfw as they went inside the building they walked past a couple carrying a case of fine wine out of storage past a mother and son retrieving a few boxes ben faked a sneeze to cover his face as they passed both groups pilgrim gave bens attempt at camouflage an amused eye roll oh man thats brilliant the sneeze and hide let me borrow that technique ben felt his face redden pilgrim leaning down with a wince opened the lock not with a key he didnt keep one on himbut with the silvery needle of a lockpick ben stood fidgeting behind him hoping no one would come into the hallway pilgrim stepped inside the unit and flicked on the light and ben followed him shutting the door behind them the unit held metal boxes pilgrim opened each one an assortment of pistols and matching ammunition a cache of identity papers drivers licenses passports a laptop computer of recent manufacture thick bricks of american dollars ben gaped at the armaments and the money my god where did you get all this leftovers from cellar jobs teach doesnt know i have it i thought it wise to have a stash in case i needed to run and hide someday pilgrim opened and closed each container i dont have a water gun for you ben do you prefer a glock or a beretta i dont want a gun pilgrim laughed and then winced at the pain in his shoulder you understand were in pretty goddamned dire straits ben we are going to war with these people ive been thinking i thought i heard a clicking sound pilgrim opened a pistol eyed its innards we get proof of whoever hired the gunmen whoever hired nicky lynch we give it to the police and were done youll be done i wont be pilgrim inspected cleaned and oiled the guns then showed ben how to load check and unload each weapon most important advice count your bullets always know how many you have in the clip i dont plan on using large numbers of bullets i patched you up im not phoning the cops im telling you what i know but im not shooting anybody i really dont like guns very much ill make sure thats mentioned in your eulogy next week no i mean i dont want to you pointed a gun at me just last night i was in shock i know i cant shoot another human being i suspect you have stretches of your soul youve never really explored ben could you kill the person who killed your wife ben put the gun he was awkwardly holdinga beretta pistolback in its case i kill him im no better than he is i would think youd consider the person who killed your wife to be pretty goddamned bad pilgrim said true yes id say he was absolute pond scum but you saint ben you wont lean down from your golden saddle on your moral high horse and kill him news flash were going to be dealing with people who are probably even less scummy but just as dangerous as your wifes murderer is i guess youre planning to spare all the interesting people were gonna go meet golly fucking jeepers beaver i feel better with you watching my back ben started to speak stopped that isnt what i meant pilgrim shrugged its what you said be honest with yourself ben do you have a spine i deserve to know before we get in any deeper ben picked up the beretta set it down there are a lot of ways i can help you without being something im not pilgrim took the beretta from ben loaded it tucked it into his own waistband under his jacket we take money and the guns he turned away from ben and ben knew hed failed on a test that pilgrim thought him more an anchor than an asset and that ben realized was a very dangerous position im very sorry for your loss vochek folded her id into its wallet please accept my sympathies thanks kind of you delia moon said and the clear anger on her face seemed to retreat behind an expression of neutrality she opened her front door wide and vochek stepped inside the cool of the foyer the home was big newly built in a development in the booming suburb of frisco the surrounding lots were either empty under construction or had for sale signs in their yard i understand my supervisor at homeland asked you to not speak with the media or discuss adams case delia was taller than vochek she wore her thick dark hair pulled back in a hefty ponytail she wore a batik print blouse of browns and blues and greens faded jeans sandals with turquoise stones on the straps a night of tears had left her eyes puffed and redlined she had a gentle face it wore anger awkwardly she so kindly broke news of adams death to me i barely slept last night would you like coffee while i yell at you vochek silently cursed margaret pritchards lack of finesse you can yell away and coffee sounds wonderful thank you listen my supervisor she told me i would be putting national security at risk if i talked to anyone not just police or press but even our friends delia said the words fairly exploded out of her sympathy and threats i thought i was in a mafia movie delia went into a large bright kitchen vochek following her a warm smell of cinnamon coffee greeted her a plate with rye toast uneaten lay on the black granite countertop ms pritchard didnt handle this well and i apologize vochek said you have a lovely home thanks i understand youre a massage therapist delia poured vochek her coffee didnt look at her adam bought the house for me i wasnt asking how you could afford vochek began but then she saw the battle lines drawn in delias eyes grief and pritchards clumsy approach during this womans horrifying loss had hardened delia against vochek she said if were going to catch the people responsible for adams death i need your help i understand were trying to determine what happened in the hours before his death he tried to call you four times i turned my phone off delia said and emotion cracked the anger in her face id gone to the library forgot to turn it back on regret tinged her voice and vochek wanted to say it didnt matter it wouldnt have saved him if hed managed to reach you but she couldnt share details yet even ones that might comfort with this woman we accessed his voice mailhe left you a message saying he might have to vanish for a few days do you know why no delia refilled her own cup but i take it if he bought you this house vochek began you would be close delia set her coffee down crossed her arms we met through friends here in dallas adam doesdidmost of his work in austin but he came to dallas a lot he grew up here his moms in a nursing home here she cleared her throat adam and me its complicated my life was a train wreck i was in really heavy debt from school i lost my job he always made fantastic money contracting for the government he wanted to take care of me so you were a couple no he wanted that but i wasnt ready you were ready enough to let him buy you this very nice house vochek thought delia crossed her arms i loved adam he was my best friend he said he was going to buy a house in dallas as an investment i could live here till i was ready to move to austin i just needed more time to know that i loved him more than a friend the words came in a spill or to string him along vochek thought she felt sorry for adam reynolds a guy who loved a girl who apparently didnt love him back at least enough and kept his scant hopes alive tell me what you know about his work you think a dumb charity case like me understands his work delia raised an eyebrow vochek thought ive got to refine my poker face im sure you do im equally sure your wellplaced anger toward my boss wont get in the way of your desire to see justice done for adam trust me my only concern is justice for adam she said but a bitter undercurrent made vochek believe she had a different view of justice he wrote lots of software for government agencies mostly about financial analysis detecting spending patterns trends tracing payments back to specific budgets boring stuff delia started wiping the spotless counter with a dishrag could he have found financial evidence of a crime is that why he said hed have to vanish he never told me anything specific i know he was working on a new projectsomething to do with querying financial information across multiple databases maybe he found a financial trail that led back to the secret group vochek thought was he doing this work for a government agency delia narrowed her gaze no on his own he wanted to make it into a product sell it to the government he thought the government would pay him millions for it i dont know what will happen to it now her voice rose slightly on the last word i suppose the ownership of it will pass to his heirs heirs delia said adam doesnt have any kids his dad died when he was thirteen his moms in a rest home earlyonset alzheimers its bad i take care of her for him make sure the homes being good to her she pressed her palm to her forehead he never mentioned he had a will did adam ever mention a man named ben forsberg thats the guy the cops are looking for i saw his picture on tv yes adam mentioned a couple of days ago he was talking with a consultant named forsberg who might help him get investors to start his new company was this guy working with the people that killed adam im trying to find out listen i dont care about the money adams software might make i just dont want adams work to be stopped i mean he was killed by a sniper what the hell is that he and the project must have been a threat to somebody powerful maybe someone in the government tell me more about this new project because i havent heard of any notes or software found on his system that would be dangerous but then she thought she hadnt gone through adams stuff pritchard had had everything in adams office seized and put under her control homeland security has his project data his prototype of the software delia said slowly youve got the goods you dont need to ask me i can assure you his property wont be stolen or misused im wondering if thats why your boss put a choke hold on me because youve got his software and its valuable to homeland delias voice rose of course not our technical people will go through all the programs and files on his system to see if we can find who might have targeted him but nothing will be misappropriated really delia do you think were robbers i dont know what to think who to trust then ill trust you adam contacted us about a serious threat maybe terrorism that might be why he wanted to disappear for a while is there a place where he would go if he was in trouble maybe he kept details about this threat in a safe place he would come here she gestured at the lovely mostly empty house but if he wanted to keep you out of danger he never went anywhere he lived for his work he she stopped we drove to new orleans a few times when we first met with friends and we love it the people the food the music then this week he made an odd comment about it we havent been since katrina hit and he said he didnt want to go anywhere near new orleans not anytime soon vochek frowned but he didnt say why no vochek hesitated pritchard had warned her to stay clear of hector global but there was no harm in a question especially since hectors name had come up more than once and adam was a government contractor too did adam ever mention a man named sam hector delia took a long sip of her coffee sam hector not a familiar name he owns a huge private security firm multimilliondollar government contracts delia shrugged im sorry im not being of help adam didnt tell me much about his work it was technical and im not im afraid adam knew computer theory was about a thousand feet above my head her voice went raw did adam say anything else unusual no he was excited about how his work was progressing i delia stopped abruptly like a weight had dropped on her ill call you if theres anything else i can remember i have your number from when you called yesterday i lost my cell phone vochek wrote down her new number on a notepad sitting on the kitchen counter can i tell his mother that hes dead she may not understand but i cant not tell her of course if theres anything else you can tell me i dont think so delia folded vocheks note in half and id appreciate knowing when adams bodys going to be released i have a funeral to plan she knows something vochek thought but if you press her shell just clam up more find out the bodys disposition that would earn a point vochek headed back to her car delia moon far from being the grieving girlfriend eager to help the investigation was going to be a problem vochek was going to need warrants to find out more about delia she called margaret pritchard left a message asking to be updated on what the computer team found on adams computers and also when the body would be released for burial she tried to call her stolen cell phone again no response she paged through her file and found the name she wanted next bob taggart the police detective who had assisted the maui police in investigating emily forsbergs murder hed checked into emily and bens life in dallas to see if a motive could be uncovered for ben to kill his new wife he lived south of dallas in the town of cedar hill she called explained why she wanted to talk to him and taggart told her she was welcome to visit him she pulled her car away from the curb and in the rearview mirror she saw delia moon watching her from a window then the curtain fell and delia was gone delia moon stepped away from the front window the day was cool and clear and the wind gusting sighed against the glass the house felt like it was closing in on her a crushing fist every corner seemed full of adam and she shuddered with grief delia could imagine what agent vochek thought of her the flicker of dislike that the woman had tried to hide and failed for the briefest moment well highandmighty agent vochek was wrong she didnt care that she might not be adams heir she wished she had loved him more or at least loved him better she did not have a copy of his software designs but she knew he was nearly finished with a project that might be worth millions and now homeland security had seized his intellectual property computer files could be copied and stolen his project could be hijacked even if she never saw a cent that money was rightfully adams and money that could help his mother with her exorbitant health care costs hed bought delia this house helped her straighten out her chaotic life shed protect his interests now resolve filled her like water flowing into a bottle please tell me about his project miss judgmental had said not very likely delia thought she wasnt going to give away his trade secrets if someone had killed adam hed found someone he wasnt supposed to find which meant his ideas worked she might need a lawyer to pry free his laptop his papers and his electronic files from homeland security she knew who to call because yes adam had mentioned sam hector to her as a man who was going to give him money to help develop his product she found his name in adams address book on the computer they shared when he was here in town and found a number for hector marked direct private line delia moon reached for the phone ben and pilgrim found a chain motel one so new the landscaping wasnt finished it sat near the lbj freeway that cut across the northern stretches of the city pilgrim paid cash for the room he left the money and the rest of the gear except for one cloth bag in the back of the volvo pilgrim looked pale as they headed up the stairs are you all right my bandages i might need you to rewrap them okay ben said they went inside the room it was clean and neat ben turned on the television and started hunting for a news channel pilgrim tossed the bag onto one of the twin beds pilgrim went into the bathroom and closed the door ben found cnn the deaths in austin remained the lead story his face still on the news still being sought as a person of interest but then a photo of emily appeared on the screen and his throat plummeted into his chest the reporter with a perfectly arched eyebrow said forsbergs past includes an unsolved murderthat of his wife emily forsberg two years ago ben grabbed the remote and switched off the tv no he missed emily with a grief that made his body ache fragments of the past spun into his mind glancing up the green spill of hill that backed to their rental house seeing no one in the moments after emily died the hawaiian police telling him someone had shot out windows at four nearby properties that morning so this was probably a random shooting his life destroyed for no reason sam hector speaking at emilys memorial of her grace and her remarkable work ethic and her dignity ben finally leaving their home in dallas knowing he could not stay crowded by memories of her and yet believing that abandoning the house theyd shared would be a final betrayal pilgrim came out of the bathroom stopped in the doorway i need you to check the bandages sure ben said he stepped inside the bathroom and a bracelet of plastic closed around his wrist what the hell he struggled and fought but pilgrim shoved him hard to the tiles and had already closed the other side of the plastic restraint around the pipe on the bottom of the toilet sorry ben its better this way pilgrim stepped back breathing hard you son of a bitch ben yanked hard the pipe didnt give panic surged in his chest you would be dead if i hadnt helped you im protecting you i dont know what im going to find at barkers house and its best that you stay out of the way fine ill stay here just take the cuff off ben i cant have you slowing me down or me not being able to count on you im sorry im sure your name will be cleared ben lashed a kick out at him and pilgrim dodged you bastard i need you to tell people you stole my name youre safer in jail than you are with me ben yanked hard on the plastic handcuff let me go ben listen you dont want to go into the world i live in its not an adventure its a giant pain in the ass its not for you ill find out who set us up and ill make sure they pay youll get bail youre an upright citizen you think im a coward well you are doubtful pilgrim said youre getting rid of me because you dont even know how to accept help that doesnt involve killing people and after i patched you together you goddamned ingrate i thought we were on the same side youre not brave enough to keep a deal you make i just i dont believe you have what it takes to do what we need done so let me handle the dirty work pilgrim stood get a very good lawyer who will ask homeland security the hard questions about this office of strategic whatever that kidwell and vochek work for good luck man and thanks he turned and walked from the bathroom pilgrim its for the best ben for the best as though assuring himself of the truth and the next sound ben heard was the click of the hotel door closing pilgrim was sure hed done the right thing the police would find ben and turn him over to homeland hed tell them about pilgrim and eventually hed be believed no one was going to think ben forsberg had escaped from the shootout in austin on his own finally he would be shuttled to the cia and the fbi for debriefing then released unless unless what was going on was a group inside the government declaring war on the cellar and they didnt want ben talking in public about pilgrim or the cellar an unexpected cold prickle raced along his skin but ben had government connections ben would be fine this sam hector guy could get him a squadron of lawyers i thought we were on the same side a sentiment of sheer stupidity ben lived in a normal world where yes you could become acquainted and think a person was your ally even your friend pilgrim remembered that world for a brief second he wanted to pull out his sketchbook sharpen a pencil draw the girl as he remembered her bearing daisies in her cupped hands her laughter dancing with the sunlight bens accusation rattled in his head youre not brave enough to keep a deal you make no maybe he wasnt but it didnt matter he worked alone it was the only way to survive the address on barkers drivers license was on a street in east dallas and two of the houses had for lease signs in the front yard the neighborhood was quiet dominated by mature oaks and singlestory ranch houses most people were at work but he saw a pregnant young woman kneeling in the shade weeding a flower bed she glanced up and waved at pilgrim as he drove past he waved back barkers lawn needed a mow and nuts from the pecan trees lay scattered and forgotten on the driveway no police cars stood outside which meant barkers body presumably lying in the austin morgue had not been connected to this address taking his drivers license had been a smart move pilgrim drove past the house three times saw no sign of life no sign of surveillance he parked his car two houses down at one of the for lease homes and headed for barkers front door he knocked rang the doorbell knocked again he fixed a picklock shaped like a small gun against the lock squeezed the trigger and the mechanism eased the lock open he was inside the chirp of an alarm began this was after all a cellar property and hed expected security he pulled a pda from his pocket popped off the plastic cover on the alarm keypad wired the pda to the keypad tapped a program it scanned the alarm deactivation setting on the pad and fed the system the right combination eighteen seconds into its search pilgrim unclipped the pda from the alarm memorized the displayed combination and replaced the keypad cover then he relocked the door and reactivated the alarm in the stay setting so he could move through the rooms if anyone came inside he wanted to create the illusion of an empty house the house was dark and still it was furnished simply with goods from ikea just enough to give the impression of a minimalist bachelor pad pilgrim moved through the rooms not turning on any lights he searched for the obvious places to hide a gun the freezer the narrow kitchen drawer closest to the back door a spot inside the pantry nothing the kitchen was nicely stocked as though barker expected to come home well why wouldnt he teach was supposed to be captured and pilgrim to be dead an unopened bottle of french champagne chilled on the refrigerator shelf awaiting a celebration he searched the house in the den were a portable tv a scattering of travel magazines pages turned down on articles about the bahamas and aruba notes about availability the following week jotted in the margins barker was planning a vacation with his traitors coins the builtin bookshelves were bare it felt like home to pilgrim his own lodgings usually changing every few months were similarly plain at the back of the house he found the master bedroom clothes awaiting laundry piled at the foot of the unmade bed a worktable wide and deep occupied one corner no computer no papers no trail a cordless phone with an answering machine he played the tape it had been erased he began his search in the back of a drawer he found three pairs of handcuffs lengths of silk sexual gels a few magazines that showed couples lashed and bound to each other in more than love and mutual respect whatever pilgrim thought those in the cellar led highly stressful lives hidden at the back of the desk drawer he found two fake passports for barker under different names which looked to be cellarissue teach used superb forgers but barker didnt need to be going overseas with his work teach used domestic support in operations she had europeans to handle european ops americans to handle american ops barker and a couple of others were based near american airport hubs to go quickly where they were needed so why had he been overseas he found one passport stamped for the united kingdom then switzerland all of two weeks ago the other passport journeyed to greece and then lebanon the united kingdom maybe to belfast to hire the lynch boys lebanon three weeks ago for three days perhaps to hire the group who took teach but then whod hired barker pilgrim tucked barkers passports into his pocket he heard the front door open the distinctive sound of the lock being eased probably by the same kind of lockpick he had used the alarm began its chime he went to the corner of the room he heard the door shut fingertips tapping in a code then silence whoever was here knew the entry code pilgrim liked this visitor immediately this visitor could tell him things the soft creepycrawl of footsteps two hushed voices both male the conversationhe couldnt hear what they saidmurmured on for thirty seconds which meant they didnt know he was here he waited it didnt take long but only one came into the bedroom and pilgrim put the gun on the back of his head as soon as he stepped into the room the man was wiry and compact in his forties head shaved bald and he went still with professional surrender pilgrim moved back from him and around him raised a finger to his lips and kept the gun firmly locked on the mans head call your partner back here he whispered politely and quietly i found something the bald guy said in a normal tone pilgrim pulled him back out of the line of sight of the hallway put the bald guy between him and the door as a shield he heard footsteps approaching then another man a young heavybuilt latino came into the room he sported evidence of a rough day two black eyes a bruised mouth he wore a suit slightly too small for him black jacket and pants a white dress shirt its creases indicating that it had been recently removed from its store packaging no tie he stopped when he saw pilgrim tensed for his gun pilgrim said dont youre pilgrim were from the cellar the man with the bruised face said teach sent us here im de la pena its my real name this is green really wheres teach shes safe where i dont know where shes at he said just that shes safe pilgrim tossed one of barkers handcuffs to each of them face each other hands in front put a cuff on your hand and his hand opposite he kept his surprise that de la pena offered a real name to him you never shared your true identity in the cellar so the guy might not be from the cellar after all that or he was desperate to create trust the two men faced each other as though they were about to ballroom dance slid the cuffs onto their wrists greens right hand was cuffed to de la penas left greens left hand was chained to de la penas right lock them pilgrim ordered and they shut the cuffs green looked pissed he had a small mouth that went to a rosebud de la pena was calm he pilgrim suspected was the more dangerous one these are for girls green said peevishly theyre a little tight sit down pilgrim said he took their guns from them one in each pocket searched their backs and legs for more weapons found nothing he put the guns on the desk well out of reach paired awkwardly the two men sank to the floor you shouldnt be here de la pena said no malice in the tone neither should you pilgrim said were janitors cleaning up after a job goes bad clean up destroy data erase barkers trails kill anyone who needs killing crudely put i havent killed anyone ever de la pena said i cant speak for him he jerked his head at green who flexed an enigmatic smile so you say teach sent you yes you saw her or she called you she called green i was already here part of a training exercise pilgrim pointed at de la penas black eyes were you training to be a punching bag she told me to get to dallas and help this guy clean any cellar evidence out of the house green said shes been kidnapped pilgrim said she told us you tried to kidnap her green said you killed her helper she escaped sell your story down the street man i killed barker yeah but he turned traitor not me she got grabbed the two men stared at him not believing him he saw who has her pilgrim asked softly i think you know stop the lies man he kicked them hard nailing de la pena in the back and both guys fell over shes not operating of her own accord shes under a thumb she told me what to do de la pena said she said youd gone bad and what are you doing teach pilgrim wondered get up he ordered them he could question them in the kitchen as unappealing as it sounded a bit of fear at the tip of a knife might loosen their tongues de la pena and green rose awkwardly like conjoined twins always facing each other pilgrim gestured them back into the narrow confines of the hallway and they walked sideways facing each other de la pena stood a foot taller than green and green hurried to keep pace then green stumbled nearly going to one knee de la pena stopped and hauled him up and as green rose he lashed a sharp precise kick and caught pilgrim hard in the gun hand pinning his weapon back into his chest pilgrim backpedaled into the master bedroom pilgrim swung the gun up again but now they were on top of him moving as one de la pena launched green again swinging the smaller man and greens feet slammed into pilgrims chest air whooshed out of pilgrims lungs and as green fell de la pena launched a welltimed kick that smashed pilgrims gun out of his hand the weapon slammed into the far wall pilgrim collapsed against the wall and the two fell on top of him sliding to the hardwood floor de la pena pinioning pilgrim with his weight the mens joined hands closing on his throat strangling him in symphony he jammed a finger into greens eye green howled and twisted away de la pena raised and lowered their joined hands closed a circle around pilgrim tried to crush him between himself and green pilgrim punched green short and brutally hard again he felt greens lip tear and nose break under his blows de la pena pushed all his weight against pilgrim pilgrims lungs and his throat were suddenly empty of oxygen fresh agony flamed in his shoulder pilgrims feet lifted off the hardwood and he shoved them between his opponents and the wall and pushed knocking them all off balance the tangle of men collapsed to the floor again and de la penas choking hold broke for just a second breath sudden and sweet pilgrim hammered an elbow hard into de la penas face once twice pain rocketing up his hurt arm de la pena tried to headbutt him hit the shoulder instead nearly made pilgrim faint from the pain pilgrim rolled atop de la pena pulling green on top of him grab his throat de la pena yelled at green pilgrims and greens faces were an inch apart and pilgrim closed his hands around greens neck and green was trying to squirm away from pilgrims reach panic in his eyes no no dont green grunted knowing what the grip meant pilgrim closed his fingers around the jaw around the head with precision and care and the crack was audible the dying sigh went straight into pilgrims face green lolled a limp weight attached to de la penas hands lying atop them pilgrim slid lower seized greens dead head rammed it against de la penas face pilgrim writhed ducked from between the bodies but de la pena grabbed at his hair and throat but pilgrim twisted free of the clutch of the living man and the weight of the dead man he clambered to his feet as de la pena lunged for his legs delivering a powerhouse kick to de la penas jaw then to the stomach de la pena doubled up tried to pull green on him as a shield pilgrim let him then he grabbed the dead mans head from behind pounded it again and again into de la penas face ill talk de la pena finally screamed ill talk pilgrim hit him twice more for measure then dropped greens body to the side de la pena stayed still if you move if you look at me funny ill kill you son of a bitch i understand de la pena said through bloodied lips the blood was not all his own who sent you teach did but theres a man this guy exmilitary kidnapped me last week brought me here kept me in a conference room beat me beat me for no reason he blinked through the blood he knew i was excia knew my real name said teach would be here soon to talk to me and she was last night she looked like shed been in a fight she told me the new guy was a partner wed be working with him i could read the writing on the wall hes muscled his way into the cellar and shes letting him you know the guys name no she didnt tell me hes older but you can tell hes definitely from our line of work cold eyes he smiles like how i think a ghost smiles he paused his house is fancy describe him tall late forties or early fifties silverhaired but very fit anyone else theres one other guy young irish accent he shrugged dressed in black like johnny cash yeah this new guys got teach deep in his pocket you may say shes kidnapped but clearly shes working with him only because hes threatened her or us shes being coerced teach wouldnt ever betray us doesnt matter if its voluntary de la pena said teach loses control of the cellar i go with the flow whoever runs the cellar runs me tell me where this house is youre entirely missing the point these guys theyre not keeping her at the point of a gun theyre keeping her because they found us this guy owns our asses because he can expose us de la pena stared up at him through the blood whats the cia going to do when we come to light wash their hands of us you know we cant be acknowledged we all made the deal when we signed up well get brought up on federal charges he spat a trickle of blood you should just vanish give up on trying to get teach back its a new day man your loyalty is an inspiration teach gets you out of the gutter gives you a second chance and you wont fight to help her get free shes not fighting this guy de la pena shrugged why should i pilgrim stood went to the far side of the room retrieved his gun de la pena said uncuff me man hes dead uncuff me he jerked his arm and greens dead arm moved in unison i told you what you need to know let me go i never saw you and were square pilgrim stood unsteadily groped in his pocket for the weight of barkers passports if you move im going to leave him bound to you and lock you out of this house i cant wait for you to explain to the neighbors why youre walking the streets with a dead guy chained to you he picked up the phone hit redial listened to the phone beep a number the number display showed new orleans area code after the third ring a woman briskly answered hotel marquis de lafayette how may i assist you today im trying to locate your hotel but i think ive taken a wrong turn were near poydras and st charles sir where are you coming from oh i had the address down wrong i can find it thanks so much pilgrim hung up the phone he tried to imagine barkers last day in this house preparing for a traitorous operation one where he had to fool both teach and pilgrim set pilgrim up for death isolate teach for a kidnapping and the last phone call he makes is to a hotel in new orleans who was there why new orleans tell me where shes being held first unhook me from him man de la pena said tell me no de la pena said uncuff

you havent i believe you not the guy whos got teach i can help you hes planning a big job he needs teach for i heard them talking the job is on sunday whats happening sunday i dont know pilgrim watched him he went to the bedside table rummaged in its depths found the keys he readied his gun he wished hed brought ben with him useless as he might be because this was the moment of greatest risk he kept the gun on de la pena unlocked the first cuff then the second de la pena slowly stood hands apart fighting in the restraints had scored his wrists raw and bloody he spat blood again wheres the guys house jesus im bleeding inside de la pena stumbled his hand going to the collar of his shirt pilgrim hesitated but then he saw the flash of silver coming from under the collar de la penas arm slashing toward him felt the bite of the blade into his gun hand as he raised it and he fired the bullet caught de la pena in the throat he collapsed dropping the thin little knife hed hidden in his collar his gaze found the ceiling and stayed there you stupid pilgrim muttered both to himself and to de la pena the cut wasnt bad but close to his wrist and he mopped up the blood with a towel he splashed water on his face spat into the sink everything ached his wounds were seeping nausea rocked his stomach he finished the search of the house nothing he had a threadnarrow and possibly meaninglessleading to new orleans and a dirty job in less than fortyeight hours but teach was still here in the dallas area and he couldnt leave without trying to find her he went to the car parked in front of the house used keys from greens pocket to open it a rental he found the receipt in the glove compartment the reservation was in the name of sparta consulting the regular cellar financial front nothing to trace back to the new boss other than a vague description and he had no idea if de la pena had even been honest about that he returned to the stolen volvo and headed down the street the pregnant lady still kneeling in her garden with a smile waved at him again as he drove past and he waved right back on friday morning after the mayhem in austin sam hector stood tall and resolute in front of press microphones at the briefing room at hector globals complex northeast of dallas nothing can replace the two brave men lost yesterday in austin they were working for homeland security as contract guards for an important new office in austin in an effort to make all americans safer he briefly eulogized the two men and lauded their families he honored norman kidwell the dedicated homeland security officer who had died with his men let me assure you that the three thousand employees and all the worldwide resources of hector global will be available to the authorities to bring those responsible to justice he cleared his throat and gave the viewing public the benefit of his stern determined gaze all early indicators here point to this heinous attack being the work of a terrorist cell operating here on american soil clearly this is a new danger a more serious threat to us all that our nationboth government and private businessmust work together to respond to with strength and resolve he paused to let the drama build the scratching of pens against paper stopped the gathered reporters waited hector global is and will continue to be an integral part of the war on terror especially when terror comes again to our shores we will give our full cooperation and support to homeland security the fbi and other governmental agencies he took no questions from the press although they yelled several at him as he left the podium he heard one inquiring about his business relationship with the missing ben forsberg and one asking how much his contracts with homeland were worth and would he be losing the departments business another reporter yelled a question about how much business hed already lost in the past six months and it was an effort for hector not to flinch as he walked away he retreated from the conference room to the sanctuary of his own office alone he sat at his desk and pulled from a locked drawer a photo yellowed with age the man in the photo was bigbuilt plainfaced with brown hair his name had been randall choate he was supposed to be dead but he was not sam hector wanted choate dead soon the stakes were far too high to let a man like pilgrimchoateinterfere with the operation contractors are sometimes each others most important clientmuch of the large contracts handed to companies are then subcontracted out to other more specialized concerns the resulting network of suppliers and firms made for a considerable intelligence advantage hector started leaning on his network to find pilgrim quietly lockhart technologies a fastgrowing company based in alexandria virginia handled communications and it support for hector global sam hector owned a software engineer inside lockhart named gary whose online gambling addiction required money lockhart also provided customized software design and support to the national security agencys mainframes for tracking analyzing and cataloging millions of phone calls to and from and now within the united states the software was a critical component of the nsas parabolic satellite listening stations in yakima washington and sugar grove west virginia gary kept an admin account alive on a mainframe used to analyze the torrents of dataand this morning at hectors request he was secretly loading programs to listen for and identify any phone conversations happening anywhere in the country using the word choate he wanted to know if the cia knew one of their lost heroes was alive and well a financial services contractorwho handled credit card charges for the military and for hector employees in baghdads green zonewas told by sam hector to alert him to any new credit card accounts opened in the name of benjamin forsberg or randall choate or of any new credit card accounts opened with any of the aliases he had identified as used by the cellar he also asked for alerts on the use of cards which had been dormant for a month specifically on charges for hotels travel or gasoline in a fivestate area the contractor got a number of immediate hits hector noticed three from last night in towns between austin and dallas including a charge for james woodward that was one of pilgrims aliases found by adam reynolds so were they headed for dallasor just headed away from austin he called the contractor back told him to call immediately if there were any further charges on the james woodward card pilgrim must eventually show his head and hector wanted to be ready to lop it off he slid the old photo of randall choate back into his desk soon enough he thought you bastard youll be in the coffin you belong in he expected that ben forsbergif choate had not killed himwould be calling for help soon both men should be dead within twelve hours hopefully if pilgrim did the expected thing and went to barkers house nice to have people to do the dirtiest work for you hector preferred having clean hands his phone rang the cell phone he kept in his pocket the number that fewer than ten people in the world had he glanced at the cells readout he didnt recognize the number hello uh yeah hi mr hector my name is delia moon he said youre adams friend he knew this not because of adam confiding in him but because he knew all pertinent details about adam reynoldss life oh yeah did he mention me to you with the warmest regard delia he was so fond of you oh god um a choked sob controlled with effort he waited for her to compose herself i need help mr hector of course adam mentioned that you were going to help him with his project his software to track illicit banking activities to find terrorists hector squeezed the bridge of his nose and thought idiot couldnt keep a secret that was unfortunate well yes he talked to me about such a project but i didnt know he was far off the ground with it well he is very far along in developing the program i think thats why he died and homeland security theyve confiscated his computers and theyre going to sit on his software or take it for their own use and well it doesnt belong to them it belongs to him to his estate now i guess and you would be his estate no she said sounding horrified his mom shes sick she needs money but its not the governments im scared theyre going to take it and keep it its not right i need your help mr hector they wont listen to me but theyll listen to you or your lawyers yes he said we should talk but privately all right he considered may i come to your house im afraid the press are all over my place and im constantly interrupted with calls from homeland security yes thats fine she gave him directions and he said ill see you shortly then and he hung up he called in his assistant im going to work from home today the assistanta former army clerk who was not easily rattledwent pale sir youve gotten another twenty interview requests including cnn and fox and the new york times youve got that noon meeting with the lawyers if the guards families sue the pr firm wants to give you a strategy update cancel it all im not giving further interviews ive said the words that matter most to me they can rerun the press conference im simply not available he knew he didnt have to explain but he believed so fervently in the power of his own company to do good he added i have to assist the government in its investigation are there still a lot of press camped out in front of the gates yes sir tell the driver to get a car with tinted windows i dont really want the world knowing where i am right now the two men from the cellar had not returned or reported their progress teach sat at the conference table a laptop not connected to the internet sat before her she had been typing into a document a detailed history of the cellar its agents and its operations as ordered that morning by hector he slid into a seat across from her your boys arent back do you think green and de la pena abandoned you no you think pilgrim intercepted them maybe hate filled her eyes making us your puppets wont work it wont work today he said but it will tomorrow if i get any inkling that those two took off i start killing people on the cellar roll calls you may end up killing us all i may dont believe for a second that it will be easy he leaned over printed her draft report on the cellars activities as the paper spooled from the printer he scanned each sheet at one page his gaze widened slightly but he felt her gaze on him and he put his poker face back in place what she said im both impressed and disturbed by the scope of your activities would it sound contrary to say i admire you yes as you say this wont be easy but i know youll smooth my path keep writing he set the draft on the table and left the room locking her inside he leaned for a moment against the door it was reassuring to know hed made the right business decision he felt an inappropriate insidious urge to laugh but he choked it down hector found jackie sitting in a guest room hed sent an aide to buy him clothes black pants and black shirts as jackie requested jackie kept wearing his pair of black cowboy boots he looked like a poor mans johnny cash he balanced a wicked knifes handle on the flat of his palm the knife glinted in the light as jackie steadied his hand i need you to put that knife to work on a loose end her name is delia moon jackie tossed the knife up caught the handle i didnt think dallas had hippies they can have one less be quick and dont get caught jackie put the knife back in its sheath and stood id like to know why you hate these two guys so much i beg your pardon pilgrim and forsberg whats your motive its not your concern my brother died trying to put pilgrim down id like to know why he died hector crossed his arms jackie i wonder if youve thought about your future yes quite a lot are you going to answer my question no its irrelevant to your work he cleared his throat running a business like yours is dangerousnot just on account of the violence trying to bring in the contracts find clients who will pay its almost as dangerous as killing the targets every potential clients a cop or a rival who wants you to let your guard down its not like you can go coldcalling to drum up business so you complete this job and if you want youll work for me for as long as you like work for you doing what im going to give you pilgrims job hector said his exact same job jackie laughed his jobs too bloody dangerous but you wont be alone jackie and hector could tell hed read the boy right hed appealed to his insecurity because jackie studied the floor as though he needed to slip on a mask before he met hectors stare he said sure ill give it a solid think mr hector point me toward your hippie chick tied to a toilet ben figured he could holler for help pound the walls and the housekeeping staff or another guest would hear him and come to his aid and then what at the least he faced a difficult explanation as to how he came to be bound to the pipes and at the worst hed be recognized from the news accounts and handed over to the police the plastic cuff bit into his skin he had to loosen it he lay between the tub and the toilet a sample shampoo canister sat with its matching bottles of conditioner and soap on the counter but well out of reach ben yanked the bath towel hanging above his head he held one end of it and whipped the tail of the towel onto the counter it knocked over the pyramid of miniature soaps and gels ben lashed out again with the towel caught the plastic bottles under its weight he slowly dragged the towel and the toiletries tumbled to the floor he upended the shampoo bottle over the cuff and greased his skin he worked the ooze between the plastic and his flesh pulling and twisting he tried to ease his hand through the cuff too tight he worked it for five minutes but made scant progress he tried again with the bottle of conditioner pouring with greater care making sure he spilled none to the tiles his heart pounded against the floor and he steeled himself to lose an entire layer of skin he gritted his teeth and pulled agony he tried to twist his hand through the tough plastic circle but it was simply too tight his eyes searched the counter nothing else just a set of sugar packets plastic cups foil pouches of crappy coffee and a coffeemaker the coffeemaker the small carafe appeared to be glass he tried to flick it loose with his towel missed too far he pulled himself as close to the counter as he could the carafe was still beyond his reach he pulled a second towel down from the rack and awkwardly knotted the two together he tried again missed tried again this time the carafe jarred in its perch in the coffeemaker but didnt buck loose he heaved the towel in another hard snap and now the carafe rocked free from the coffeemaker but skittered toward the sink if it fell into the sink hed never reach it ben calmed himself before he made another attempt he aimed the towel held one corner tossed it over the carafe he dragged the carafe slowly past the sink and then it fell to the tiles shattering please god he thought let there be a piece big enough to cut with he pulled the towel off the broken carafe the handles metal ring held a jagged rim of glass he carefully picked up the handle and began to saw at the cuff where it joined to the pipe a knock on the door a voice calling in polite singsong housekeeping everything all right in there the woman had heard the breaking carafe im fine he called please dont let her open the door is something broken sir the woman spoke with a jamaican accent no everythings fine the woman gave no reply he put the jagged edge back to the cuff and after several more seconds the glass sliced through the plastic he stood half the cuff still on his wrist he stumbled to the door stepping on an object pilgrims small sketchbook ben must have knocked it out of his pocket during the fight serves him right ben thought slipping the book into his pocket he put his eye to the peephole a housekeeping cart stood on the other side and the woman was speaking into a walkietalkie and she said yeah i heard glass breaking in there she paused listening for more instructions okay she pulled her cord of keys from her pocket and stepped toward the door he opened the door and walked straight past her i dropped and broke the coffee machine he said over his shoulder sorry i was trying to pick up the mess he kept his hand in front of him the sleeve rolled down to hide the plastic cuff he reached the elevator and glanced back the woman was staring at him at his face he stepped into the open elevator and went down to the lobby he hurried past the front desk stepped out into the cool breeze the stolen volvo was gone from its spot he froze indecisive and behind him the hotel doors parted he glanced back through the glass and saw the hotel clerk standing behind the counter phone to his ear watching him he turned and walked across the lot was that what paranoia was the certainty that everyone was gawking at you everyone knew who you were everyone was reaching to stop you and pull you into darkness it was a worm that turned and chewed and ate at you from inside he had to find a car the hotel lay along a busy thoroughfare in plano one of the largest suburbs near dallas and a line of chain restaurantscajun mexican seafood a steakhousesat across from it behind them stood a strip mall that included a bath supplies shop a craft shop a furniture store a bookstore dozens of cars sitting there and he had no idea how to steal one stop think he stayed calm in negotiating multimilliondollar business deals he could stay calm now grabbing keys out of someones handno he wasnt going to mug an innocent person and no one left cars unlocked these days what had pilgrim suggested when they were heading for the garage back in austin if theyd had to steal a car bumper surfing hunting for key boxes hidden under bumpers he picked the heaviest row of cars leaned down low moving from car to car skipping the highend sports numbers he thought he might have better luck with cars with those stickers announcing kids activitieswouldnt a mother be more likely to take precautions to keep from being locked out of the car with kids in tow he refocused his efforts on those kinds of cars my god he told himself youre starting to think like a car thief nice what did pilgrim say about his job we do the dirty work thats necessary pilgrim was right you did what was necessary to fight back he heard the approaching whine of police sirens a woman getting into a car four down from him glared at him as though she knew exactly what he was up to she put a cell phone to her ear as she backed out of the parking lot on the next car he trieda ford explorerhis fingertips touched the square of a key box he opened the box worried it would be a house key but no it was a ford key and within ten seconds he was inside the car he backed out saw two police cars revving into the motels parking lot he drove the explorer around the back of the shopping center exited onto a side road desperate to put distance between him and the police now what he thought he drove west for ten minutesplano seemed to be mostly large streets with subdivisions constantly sprouting off the roads interrupted by shopping centers he pulled into a branch library he could call sam hector beg his old friend for help explain what had happened to his employees down in austin sam had connections of steel into every government branch and agency he could use his leverage to help ben clear his name ben put on a pair of sunglasses he found in the explorers glove compartment scant camouflage but it was the best he could do he found a scattering of spare change in the explorers cd holder an old pay phone stood near the door he fed it quarters and dialed sam hectors direct line the phone rang three timeshe could see sam frowning at an unknown number calling him on a line very few people knew how to reachthen he heard the familiar baritone sam hector a sudden urge inside ben said just hang up dont drag sam into this hell but instead he said sam its ben ben ben thank god are you all right where are you im okay im in dallas where sam i need help where are you ben i dont want to say i dont want to put you in a bad situation with the police ben im already in a bad situation i have men dead why did you leave the scene you have a hell of a lot of explaining to do to me in the background ben could hear a gentle clickclickclick and he thought they tapped sams line in case i called him help me and ill explain a pained silence ben come to my house we can strategize and well get you surrendered to the police get you the best representation ill stand by you clickclickclick i cant come to your house i need information ben glanced over his shoulder to see if anyone was watching him recognizing his face from the television the few library patrons were lost in their reading he heard more of the clickingit sounded familiar though tell me about homelands office of strategic initiatives ben you know i cant break client confidentiality please i need to know who these people at homeland are what their job is clickclick he debated how much to tell sam listen i was framed and these people think im guilty of being connected to the sniper that killed adam reynolds how never mind but ive never heard of this group and they leaned very hard on me threatened me threatened my loved ones my business who runs the group i need a name the silence on the other end of the phone ticked away ten seconds the clicking stopped sam help me give me a name fine i will tell you if you come to my house he seemed to spit out every word just give me a name and a number ben hated the begging tug in his voice and watch you do what run to washington and make a fool of yourself call the press and undermine an important program what dont lecture me im incredibly sorry your men were killed but they aimed guns at me and helped homeland take me from my house and deny me due process thats not exactly in the normal services your company provides on american soil he couldnt keep the anger from his voice my men must have been following strategic initiatives orders not mine hector said sam you owe me a long pause no clicks all right strategic initiatives is a very small and unpublicized group inside homeland you wont see them listed on the agency web site theyre a think tank on how to slice through bureaucratic procedure and encourage teamwork between the agencies they contracted with us for security services why does a think tank need security because they represent the cutting edge of counterterrorism thought the bad guys would love to get their hands on any of the strategic initiatives people who runs it ben for gods sake come to my house and we can talk no ill meet you in a public place he heard a solitary click on the other end of the line now you sound paranoid just tell me who runs strategic initiatives his frustration nearly made him yell i cant i made a promise to be discreet that is nonnegotiable ill tell you whats nonnegotiable how much money ive made you over the years how many deals ive helped you win because you werent particularly good at compromise and negotiation and i was how much ive contributed to your companys success and you wont help me in my hour of need ben youre hysterical just come to my house ben hung up he calmed his breathing the clicks sam kept that abacus collection in his home office he often played with an abacus on his desk fingering the worn wooden beads back and forth along the rods when he talked on the phone when he was bored or nervous that might have been the most important conversation he could ever have with sam hector and the man had been playing with an abacus like he was doodling on a pad he felt sick sam hector shying away from him so much for loyalty every mooring of his life seemed undone he drew a deep breath he remembered the phone number vochek last called on her cell phone when pilgrim went through the call log delia moon whod left a message she might be the woman who reynolds had called four times a partner a confidante someone who could be of help to ben in clearing his name saying thats not the ben forsberg that adam reynolds knew or who could tell him how adam had found pilgrim and the cellar and could help him find them again the library was not busy a few retirees reading magazines a few people surfing the web he saw his own face on the front page of the paper held up as a man read the inside of the section on the librarys reference shelves he found a phone directory he looked up her name not in plano he worked his way through the suburbs directories and found her address in frisco he consulted a map sketched out directions and headed back to his car delia moons house stood in a tidy section of grand but cookiecutter homes all with fancy stone exteriors and oversized garages hers was one of the few finished ones construction seemed to sprout from the dallas prairie as fast as weeds and wildflowers he drove twice past the house he could see a kitchen light gleaming it was nearly one in the afternoon he saw a dark mercedes parked down the street in front of two finished houses that still had dirt instead of sodded grass and with for sale signs the only sprouting growth a guy in dark glasses holding a newspaper open probably house hunting he parked down the street in front of a justfinished house that still had a for sale sign in front and walked back three houses to delia moons home he had an idea of what to say but no clue if it would work his throat locked he rang the doorbell no answer but he could hear the distant whine of a television he rang the doorbell again ms moon he called the door cracked opened before him stood a tall young woman darkhaired she opened the door barely an inch he saw a green eye and a cheek scattered with light freckles im not talking to anyone today my name is ben forsberg he said you and i were the last people adam tried to call before he died we need to talk how did you know where i lived through the inch of space the green eye peered at him ben swallowed he was unused to lying but then he was unused to removing bullets from flesh and forging signatures and stealing cars and right now a lie was necessary he cleared his throat homeland security brought me in for questioning the person who killed adam had my business card in his pocket they think i might be the next target he paused i saw your number on one of the homeland agents phones when they were trying to reach you you were going to help him get his software business off the ground she said and he realized she bought it she thinks im pilgrims pretend version of me i wanted to help him he lied can we talk i dont know she bit her lip and now he had to convince her lie if he had to or she would shut him out probably phone the police listen whoever hired that sniper to kill adam they could come after you if they suspect he confided in you the door stopped now she frowned im a nobody still if you knew what he knew all i know is all his ideas his software hed developed homeland security took it all but but what i dont know what theyre going to do with his research i dont want them to steal his work i want to protect it he needed to know what this research was as well he pressed his advantage thats exactly what this group at homeland might do access to his software is going to save them millions he hoped his bluff made sense but maybe i can help you get his property back just a minute she shut the door and he stood waiting for thirty seconds until she opened it again she was out of breath as though shed been running come in ben stepped inside the house the rich smell of cinnamon coffee hung like a perfume delia moon gestured at ben to walk first into the kitchen and he did realizing she did not want her back turned to him no sudden moves he thought dont scare her she was pretty but her face seemed careworn as though life had made her suspicious and cautious you want coffee sure i really am sorry to intrude upon your grief he said and he was he remembered how awkward people seemed toward him after emilys death murder paralyzed everything in your life she went to the cabinet and reached for an extra cup she poured him a cup and refilled her own i hope you dont mind black she said im out of cream and sugar blacks fine he took a sip of coffee the taste sent a surge of heat racing along his bones it was a moment of calmness of normalcy good coffee drunk in a sunny bright kitchen she pulled a gun from the back of her jeans from under her untucked batik blouse please put your hands on your head he thought she shouldnt have given me a hot beverage i could throw it on her get the gun from her funny how your mind started to work when you were afraid all the time but he set the coffee down im not a threat to you slowly he put his hands above his head she glanced at the remnant of the plastic handcuff on his wrist lay down on the floor he obeyed i dont have a gun he said i never thought id use this one adam insisted me living here alone she prodded at him with her foot along his legs along the small of his back delia please listen to me there was a man who stole my identity he pretended to be me hes the one who approached adam he works for a secret group in the government adam found his false identities the ones used in undercover work and this man and this secret group came looking for adam to discover how he found them when no one was supposed to be able to identify them she stepped back from him kept the gun leveled at him false identities she started to say and then stopped and he saw the dawn of belief in her eyes you believe me he said in shock and she nodded the sense of reliefafter two days of not being believedwas vast someone believing him he shivered put his face in his hands thank god finally thank you delia she slowly lowered the gun two sudden tears inching down her face ben slowly sat up from the floor these people he discovered are sort of spies but theyre not part of the cia they do the dirty jobs that the government cant own i need to know exactly how adam found them oh god he was stupid and brilliant she wiped away a tear he told me he had created a set of programs that would help track patterns used by people who are using fraudulent identities he thought it would be useful in tracking terrorists he wanted to do good he kept saying we had to find them before they strike but terrorists arent the only ones who try to hide behind false identities and accounts ben said it could also apply in finding covert operatives she wiped at her nose with the back of her hand he talked about stuff like common behavioral patternsfalse names quickly established and deactivated credit and banking accounts large cash withdrawals from those kinds of accounts brew all the data together and it sounds like a google to find bad guys ben frowned but that wouldnt work unless you could have access to a very wide array of unrelated databases financial law enforcement governmental travel corporate the trail any of us leave in our lives is across a quilt of databases that arent sewn together couldnt the government get him permission for that not without tons of warrants but he did it someone got him the access adam wouldnt try to expose undercover cops or cia agents or anybody working for good she shook her head never not on purpose i dont believe he knew he was searching for covert government agents maybe he was told they were bad guys did he ever mention to you that someone wanted to fund this software he mentioned once a guy named sam hectorthat mr hector might fund his research but this was months ago i called him today when i realized the government had taken all of adams ideas i thought he could help me he said hed come talk to me about how we could get adams research back from the government i know sam oh good not really he dragged his heels on helping me it wasnt like him he wondered if sam was feeling his own set of pressures from the government maybe sam knew much more than what he was saying well mr hectors coming here and hes going to help me and he would do nothing for me that wasnt under his own terms what the hell was wrong with sam bitterness rose into bens throat then he must see more value in helping you than helping me delia this is huge have you told anyone the police about what adam was doing she made a face there was a homeland woman here but she acted like i was shit on her shoe joanna vochek you know her yes she might believe me she didnt believe a word i said delia said im supposed to call her if i remember anything else she pushed vocheks number at him he opened the paper memorized the number he might need it soon he handed her back the paper but you believe me she nodded yes i do the doorbell rang is sam on his way over here now ben asked delia hurried to the front door yeah she said she put her eye to the peephole jackie had been sitting in the mercedes puzzling over how to get into delia moons house without a fuss when ben forsbergthe civilian from the parking garage last nightpulled up in a white explorer he waited watched ben talk his way into the womans house interesting he called hectors number no answer he left a message waited a few minutes and hector called back her and forsberg are here together then why the hell are you calling me kill them im calling because youre pretty freaking particular about how things are done jackie said he ended the call and walked out to the house rang the doorbell bold in the daylight saw the peepholes flick of light get eclipsed by whoever was answering the door jackie fired his glock through the peephole indonesia ten years ago randall choate had read through the dragons files on blood of fire a new group disorganized usually crippled by internal squabbling suspicion linked them to several murders in the muslim community in sydney to two killings in lebanon to a bombing in cairo very bad guys clearly the man had done his research thought out the possibilities analyzed the risks and minimized them but the dragons network of informants was gone destroyed in less than a day which meant what a single source had betrayed the whole network one informant knew about the rest that did not seem likely to him the dragon the legend had made a mistake along the line and now choate was stuck with him as a partner but he liked the plan he would do the dangerous work with a computer and a keyboard the dragon could do the dirtier work of killing gumalar and his terrorist liaison once located four hours after agency hackers in a small lab in gdansk poland launched a am cyber attack on gumalars bank randall choate sat down at a bank computer wearing a suit a tie and a visitors pass his id indicated he was with tellar data you can clean up from the attack the banks information technology manager stood behind him arms crossed the thin sheen of a sweat mustache shone on his lip it had been a most stressful morning yes the problem is the hackers choate was supposed to be an asshole i would like actionable insight please the manager said choate began a long technical runon sentence about repairing the databases with atomiclevel detail about checking field integrity before repopulating the records operating seamlessly with frontend enterprise transactions and other murmurings of reassurance all would be well and they could restore any damaged records from the backups the it manager asked pointed questions and choate gave correct responses when he was done the manager had begun to fidget choate jerked his arms so the cuffs of his shirt and his sleeves went up a maestro ready to work the it manager left him to his labors choate started the search loading a program that would not leave a trace of its passing hiding behind a series of protocols to check the database integrity in addition to searching for corrupted records the program hunted for the five aliases gumalar used to funnel money to the suspected blood of fire terror cell he found four of them the fifth returned a null result he funneled the aliases financial transactions and addresses to a log file the it manager came in halfway through the operation and watched the screen as millions of transactions in the database were inspected hacker bastards choate said conversationally the it manager agreed and inspected a network problem on another terminal talking softly into a phone the program finished its run and as choate removed a program cd from the system he surreptitiously slid a blank cd into the drive burnt the file of suspect transactions to the cd when the it manager went to take a phone call he slid the cd into a pocket in the back of his suit jacket done gumalars financial trail that could expose the blood of fire cell in jakarta was now within reach the it manager brought him tea and it would have been noticeably rude not to accept he sipped the hot beverage and his cell phone rang he expected it was the dragon calling to check if all was well he was two minutes past his deadline daddy sweet pea he loved the sound of tamaras voice he didnt even know what time it was back in virginia twelve or thirteenhour difference it was ten in the morning now in indonesia she was up late are you coming home by next week because im going to cook you a birthday cake

kimberly didnt want to talk to him probably because the rates were so high yeah sure tamaras voice made him ache made him ready to go home he did dirty work but she was his treasure of all that was good strange how a kid could make you conscious of the innate need to be a better person i need to doublecheck this data before we do the data restore he told the it manager ill go to our office review this with my analysts and i should have a report for you within a couple of hours i am pleased the manager said he followed choate into the elevator two other men in suits stood there his skin prickled but they were thin and slight dressed like midlevel managers hoping to make a solid impression choate reached for the ground floor button but it was already lit he turned to make small talk with the it manager strong hands grabbed his arms he slammed his head backward felt a nose break against his skull heard a scream of pain hands jammed his head against the elevator wall a needle slid into his neck the lit buttons of numbers whirled and danced grew smeary as though he viewed them through rain he was instantly drowsy and happy the strong arms tightened their grip hustled him toward a door he laughed and told them about tamaras red jacket before the darkness shuttered his eyes randall choate still had both his hands they were bruised and beaten his knuckles purpled he had lost two teeth in the back of his mouth every rattling breath told him two ribs were broken one earlobe was torn and he had not slept in two daysevery time he began to drowse gumalars thug threw icy water in his face he woke up in a room of plain cinder block with a high window letting in a soft cloudy gleam of light he was tied to a wooden chair his interrogators had a table and a lamp and a chair the room had nothing else but the rubber hose the pliers the bucket a trash can and a leaky faucet its slow drip played a maddening tune he had started to doze again the ice water slapped his face he opened his eyes to see gumalar sitting across from him eating a banana frowning let us try again i am an optimist gumalar chewed gestured with the halfeaten banana i have a contact who tells me that you are cia choates stomach was as empty as a waterless well but the smell of the banana made bile rise in his throat no please mister i work for a database consulting firm your work for tellar data is a lie gumalar held up the cd that held the financial transactions of the aliases why did you have this cd please let me go the words were out of his mouth before he realized it and a curl of shame unfolded in his chest your name is randall choate you live in manassas virginia you have a wife and a daughter gumalar lowered his voice my reach is long mr choate if i want to reach out and touch your familyhe tossed the banana peel into the trash cani will now you are cia sent here to spy on me no no no it was no struggle to put fear into his voice they were threatening his family the terror hed felt for himself faded like the dusk replaced by a darkness that thrummed in his chest kim and tamara jesus no how did they know so much about him tellar is a cia front no no sir please whatever this misunderstanding is you got to let me go my company will pay you is that the problem theyll pay to get me back im not going to give you back youre going to tell me what sort of operation is being mounted against me i dont know anything this englishman they call the dragon gumalar said where do i find him i dont know more water more torture more ripples of pain shuddering under his skin gumalars thug clicked a pair of pliers in front of choates face and made a grand show of removing his sock and his shoe choate stayed silent gritted his teeth told himself not to scream with a deft yank the thug wrenched out one of choates toenails the thunderbolt of pain made choate dryheave and piss himself he screamed and the thug hit him with the pliers cracking his cheek the thug kicked the chair over in a rage and beat him senseless time passed he did not know how long the slant of light through the high window was different when he awoke he was alone suddenly from the next room voices drifted through the wood let us see if this dragon breathes fire then choate heard a scream a man no no you got the wrong guy man a voice with a soft rural english accent the voice revved to a scream bloodyhellbloodyhellahhhhhhgod no god no theyd found the dragon someone had betrayed them both are you the one they call the dragon i oh please dont and then a horror the sound of a sharp chunking into wood and a scream that would have unsettled the demons in hell the scream lasted half of forever and then devolved into sobs and a moan slaps mumbled questions about cia operations in indonesia more screams more the door clanged open choate opened his eyes men dragged what was left of the dragon into the room his wrists were bloodied stumps loosely wrapped in pillowcases sodden red his eyes wide with terror his chin smeared with vomit who is this man gumalar yelled and for a moment choate didnt know if he was yelling at him or the dragon i never saw him before in my life choate said and the dragon hung his head we will kill him if you do not talk youve already done half the job choate said and he spat at gumalar a fist started hitting him in the head and after the seventh blow and a brutal kick the chair he was tied to toppled to the floor and he fell with it the world went hazy and gray time meant nothing he jerked his head up at the roar of a gunshot men mumbling arguing one saying in indonesian we cant learn anything from him now you stupid ass for a moment he thought hed been shot but he wasnt he was alone he heard doors opening and closing but his stayed shut they would come for him now kill him now voices grew louder arguing in indonesian he heard the distinctive soft grind of a body being dragged across concrete hey we talk again in a few days when you very thirsty you very hungry we talk some more the thugs voice was thin through the heavy door leaving him here leaving him here to die to starve to death or die of dehydration in the middle of a huge teeming city footsteps walking away a door shutting the dragon must have given them what they wanted if not the torture would have started on him maybe they were going to negotiate for his release no he had seen gumalars face he choked down the hope that he was going to get out of here they had no reason to keep him alive choate barely dared to move the ropes binding him to the chair were as tight as they ever were but the chair felt strange the back of its frame moved as he struggled wood grated against wood he closed his eyes and collected his thoughts slowly he began to move his bound hands thinking of nothing else ignoring the agony in his foot in his face crack the back of the chair already damaged from one of his attackers kicks parted from the seat he tried to pull loose from the ropes but they remained too tight still tied now just to two broken chunks of furniture his arms to the chairs back his legs to its seat nothing to do but wait for them to come back and kill him when he woke up the room was still in darkness the tall window that had provided gray light was black with night i will touch your family he tugged on the ropes tight he scooted the damaged chair against the concrete wall and began to pound his back against the hardness again again again the chairs back splintered further he pulled with his fingertips wriggled his back and eased out the damaged wood the ropes loosened as more pieces of chair slipped free finally after what felt like hours he wrenched his left hand free from the coils then slowly his right hand pain throbbed up both arms as he tried to move them for the first time in two days after a while he pulled his feet clear from the ropes he stood on unsteady feet stumbled until he reached a wall felt along for the door locked he tried the light switch it flickered on in the distance he heard a door opening they were coming back lied about staying away for days theyd probably just left to dump the dragons body he glanced around the room a table a high window just to let in light he pulled the table under the window he picked up the chair the thug had sat in while interrogating him he put it on the table and grabbed one of the chair legs it was the only weapon he had he stuck it down the back of his filthy shirt and he jumped up and grabbed the windows ledge he held tight and used his other hand to unlock and raise the window he fell back down to the table then climbed back on the chair and jumped up again he swung a leg up to force himself through the window and dropped onto an alleyway the night sounds of jakartathe purr of endless traffic honking the wind carrying the wail of musichummed in his ear he ran for the road i dont understand choate said the bedsheets were scratchy and despite his exhaustion he had little interest in rest now youre going home the station chief raines said he was a scarecrow of a man as though the heat and humidity of indonesia had winnowed away much of him he smoked kreteks clove cigarettes and the sweet smell knotted choates guts but gumalar never mind gumalar our investigation is shut down but the dragon they killed him they jesus they chopped off his hands someone inside betrayed us yes one of his informants no his informants didnt know about me they grabbed him after they grabbed me the only people who knew the dragon and me were working together were the cia raines frowned as though personally insulted listen then the dragon talked after you came to town he was a black ops dirty job guy he didnt exist even before he died he was a free wheel he wasnt an actual agent im telling you we have a leak inside the agency gumalar knew about my family they knew my name i never mentioned any personal details to the dragon then well seal the leak but youre blown youre going home gumalars family knows about the investigation were being asked to back out by indonesian intelligence they will handle it gumalar owns someone inside indonesian intel choate put his face in his hands hes dumping money to terrorists he kidnapped us because we got close and he wanted to scare the agency off what part of go home do you not understand its not your problem anymore your flight leaves tomorrow morning be grateful and happy youre alive randall the nurse brought his dinner and randall choate thought no im not leaving tomorrow im not leaving until the people who threatened my family are dead and he felt a debt to the dragon a need to see justice done he nearly laughed he had not wanted a partner now he was going to avenge the only one hed ever had the bullet shattered the glass tunneled through the door and plunged bent and misshapen into delia moons right eye ben caught her as she fell dead a second shot splintered the lock the bullet passing above his neck as he knelt lowering her he flinched a third bullet boomed and the lock shattered delias gun he remembered shed set it down on the kitchen counter ben retreated to the kitchen he grabbed the gun heard the front door kicked open the back door off the kitchen was a french door studded with glass panes painted a cheery yellow the back door was visible from the front foyer and for a few seconds when he rushed the door he would be in the line of fire but he hesitated telling himself stop overthinking just do stop overthinking just do and over the rattle of his panicked breathing he heard a footstep on the tile hed waited too long let himself be cornered stupid now he couldnt reach the back door not for sure not without shooting the gunman so shoot him i cant shoot another human being hed said and meant it but he also couldnt stand there and allow delia to die unavenged and himself to be killed pilgrims taunt you dont have what it takes ran hard in his ears ben put both hands on the gun he didnt know what he was doing but he would have to do it the house was suddenly as hushed as an empty church the noise of his own breathing seemed loud as a drumbeat he tried to swallow but couldnt ben aimed the gun at the opening in the far corner of the kitchen which faced out onto the foyer where would the shooter think he would stand or hide he had no idea he hunkered behind the kitchen island watching around the corner he could retreat entirely behind the island but then he couldnt see from which way the shooter would come a rush of movement past the corner and ben fired the gun he didnt anticipate the kick and plaster flew from the corner where his bullet struck well wide of the mark he pivoted further around the kitchen islands corner extending the gun again and jackie the kid from the parking garage with the elfin dark irish face fired at ben ben felt a tug in his flesh through the jacket then heat and with horror he realized his arm was hit shot he hesitated and tried to fire again and missed the bullet plowing into the tile jackie kicked ben in his wounded arm he gasped and jackie shoved the barrel of his gun onto bens forehead drop it ben obeyed letting go of delias gun ben closed his hand around his arm and blood pulsed between his skin and his cheap jacket youre forsberg ben nodded jackie yanked him to his feet dizziness washed over him pilgrim where is he i dont know he took off im shot he thought crazily i dont believe you he shoved ben back with the gun caught him off balance tell me where pilgrim is no ben collapsed against the granite counter jackie put the gun in his pocket and slipped out a large knife steel gleamed in the fluorescents and he seized bens hair with one hand put the knife close to bens throat he watched bens eyes widen as the blade drew near to skin you ever hear of a pound of flesh ill carve a pound off you then ill carve off another whittle you to the bone ben closed his eyes if he convinced jackie he was truly ignorant about where pilgrim was he was instantly useless and therefore dead i wont tell you the tip of the knife twirled and ben felt its edge pressing into his flesh he opened his eyes jackie gritted his teeth into a smile the knife moved to bens chest sliced through his shirt poked at a nipple ben felt flesh part under the steel then the tip danced along his stomach downward toward his groin stopped youre holding your breath now wondering where im gonna stick it depends on you pilgrim killed my brother you useless shit youre gonna tell me where to find him i i in the quiet they heard the rumble of a passing car from the shattered front door lets go where we can have a nice productive chat you help me you live i want pilgrim dead more than i want you dead jackie put the knife back against the side of bens neck and hurried him toward the door past delias crumpled body im sorry ben said to her he thought he was going to vomit from fear and pain the knife felt sturdy and sharp enough to decapitate him what are you sorry for jackie said i killed her blood splashed out of the meat of bens arm sudden bonedeep pain bloomed bright in his flesh they hurried through the front door jackie shoved ben across the yard he staggered kept his balance he had to get away but jackie was as tall as he was heavier with muscle and several years younger ben was sure he could not straightout beat him in a physical fight especially with a wounded arm and jackie had the knife and a gun so rattle him get him off guard he became aware of resolve settling into his skin odda day ago he would have been frozen in panic now fear was a luxury my arm shut up your whining my arm ben faltered again falling into the turned earth of the unsodded lot next door to delias house a for sale sign stood in front of him sporting a stylized logo of a rose the realtors name was rosie cute on your feet jackie said and ben closed his fingers into the loose dirt jackie grabbed his hair again and yanked baring bens throat ben threw the dirt over his head dusting jackies face and eyes he pushed hard back into jackie catching the knife between them jackie yelled his hands going to his eyes staggering at the push the cloud of grit caught bens eyes too but jackie got the worst of it ben yanked on the rosie realtor sign it pulled free from the soil and he swung it hard into the blur of jackies face the flat of the sign connected with jackies jaw and cheek with a satisfying thrum he swung again and knocked jackie to the ground ben already had one bullet wound down from loss of blood he couldnt risk losing to jackie in a fight so he dropped the sign and ran clawing the dirt from his eyes jackie spat in rage and frustration he swung the knife hard where he thought ben was the razorsharp edge hissing through the empty air he pawed onehanded at the blinding grit trying to clear his vision ben stayed low running for his car he shoved his bloody hand into his pants fingers findng his keys jackies hand closed around the weight of his pistol he fired aiming at the sound of retreating footsteps and ben heard the crack of the shot pressing just wide of his shoulder ben reached his car got in hunkered low as he started the engine in the rearview he could see jackie running toward him wiping his eyes vision clearing jackie paused to sheathe the knife under his pants leg and then blinking fired the gun at the purr of the engines ignition the bullet dinged the explorers bumper ben floored the car in a peal of rubber he veered away from the curb and jackies next shot almost got lucky starring the rearview mirror on the drivers side ben pressed the accelerator hard against the floor the explorer graceless then finding its speedroared down the street a stop sign stood at the end of the street but ben accelerated took the turn hard a police car honking at him as it slammed on its brakes the development was all new curving streets and culdesacs and circles and the wrong turn would leave him no place to go wiping grime from his eye and steering with his elbowhis right arm hurt as though a lit match had been jammed under the skinben saw in the rearview the police car closing in on him perhaps someone had heard the sounds of shots inside delias house he weighed stopping telling the officer everything and started to slow down the police car came close behind him but then revving up behind the cop came a black mercedes sleek as night he couldnt stop now jackie would kill both him and the officer he gunned the engine and arced away from the curb as the mercedes revved accelerating with its much more powerful engine the mercedes caught up with the police cruiser and jackie poured gunfire he still couldnt see well and the spray mercifully hit tires instead of flesh the police car screeched to a stop the officer fumbled for a weapon got out and aimed at the mercedes im not sure i can outrace him ben thought and he slammed hard into a left turn jackie stayed close ben thought of all the car chases hed ever seen in movies always on highways or in urban cores with lots of options to turn and nip and evade the cars dancing with the cameras to delight the audience but this terrain was gently rolling prairie shaped into newborn suburbia he had no place to hide there were new houses and halfbuilt houses and empty lots he was going to die on these newly minted streets the road curved dead ending and ben took the turn hard enough that he felt the explorers wheels lift and crash back to ground he faced a culdesac of new houses one finished the other four in various stages of completion one bricked two more framed the other just foundation waiting for wooden bones ben floored the car into the circle and didnt stop the back window exploded shot out glass peppered the back of his head sharpened confetti nipping at his neck and ears he couldnt win on pavement the mercedes was too fast ben peeled past one of the houses being frameda driveway had already been poured circling back into a sideentry garage that was nothing but concrete and lumber he drove off the driveway to flat dirt veered hard past the skeletal house tore into the empty matted ground around the unfinished shells the mercedes closed on him ben leaned into a hard turn pluming up dust and dirt praying the tires wouldnt puncture on a stray nail a flat tire meant the end he saw the mercedes drop back unable to handle the ridges of dirt at the same speed ben roared back onto the main road beyond the edge of the road was flatland cleared and fenced for future lots rolling slightly downward to a dip that he guessed was a creek but beyond that would be another road he could make the creekmaybebut the mercedes couldnt ben powered onto the flatland the explorer jostled and bounced in the rearview the mercedes rocketed onto the cleared land what would pilgrim do the thought nearly made him laugh past the nausea of loss of blood and pain then he knew he would think more than one step ahead the land began to slope down there was no creek as hed imagined but a fence of strung wire he hit the fence at seventy miles an hour the explorer tore through the wire pulling posts from the earth and one of them rammed against the passenger door like a fist wire scoured the paint off the hood a post clobbered the front windshield into a web of shattered glass the explorer spun out and he floored it again trying to regain speed in the rearview the mercedes glided through the gap in the fencing hed made the land now rose in a gentle incline ahead of him he could see a large heavily trafficked road two lanes divided by a thick nomansland of construction on the road traffic hummed at a fiftymileperhour clip he laid on the horn tried to time the cut across the highway he swerved a bit to the right trying to give a minivan room to get ahead of him and open a small break in the traffic he nearly made it the explorer exploded across the two westbound lanes aiming for the nomansland just ahead of a lexus suv but ben didnt see the pickup truck powering past the lexus on the outside lane and as he made it across the pickup clipped the explorers back right bumper the explorer spun ben fought for control to keep from spinning back out onto the highway back into the path of traffic he wrenched the wheel with both hands his wounded arm lighting up in agony despite the adrenaline and managed to right his track barrel forward his heart jammed in his mouth he looked back saw the pickup complete its own spin traffic slowing cars braking the pickup driver was a fortyish guy and ben could see his face frightened but unhurt he glanced behind him again jackies mercedes had dodged the traffic well most of it he spotted a bad dent on the passenger rear sideand the german sedan tried to regain its speed the explorer rattled like it was shaking apart as he hurtled past the construction markers and barriers the land here lay rougher and not planed smooth the rearview showed him the mercedes wasnt chasing him in a straight line jackie bulleted along the roads shoulder then cut across at an angle drawing closer cutting off bens options now ben could only go to the right half a mile shot by then another mile he wheeled past idle cranes and two men on a pickup truck bed staring up from construction plans at an interloper in their space he saw a large mall to his right on the other side of three lanes of traffic the construction zone was coming to an end nothing but turned earth and huge concrete cylinders machinery jammed into parking slots nowhere to run the mall was his last hope the mercedes moving like an express train now surged toward him he veered out onto the road narrowly missing an escalade with a silverhaired lady drivingshe shot him a diamondstudded finger he straightened the car could see the mercedes swerving looking for an opening a few car lengths behind him he punched the accelerator and the worn beaten explorer tried to respond but the car began to grind and jerk like a runner hobbling from injuries now the entrance for the mall a nordstrom a twentyscreen movie theater a massive bookstore chain a macys a home depot a couple of other department storesall the features of the comfortable marketplace of suburbia ben shoved his way onto the shoulder honking a clear path to the right seeing the mercedes trying to cut over to nail him two cars behind the mercedes colliding and sliding into each other he saw jackies face etched with fury hatred determination ben wrenched a right into the malls road system and jackie overshot the turn standing on brakes then powering the car into reverse on the shoulder the explorer limped up an incline and ben zoomed through a stop sign drove over a curb divider he jetted up a parking row for the front entrance suddenly a front tire gave the rim started to work toward the pavement and he urged another thirty feet out of the crippled car hed have to lose jackie in the mall he nosed into a vacant slot and got out of the car scanning the lot for a sign of jackies mercedes he saw jackie four rows over driving toward the mall entrance hunting him ben stayed low to the ground wrapping the jacket around his bullet wound blood dotted his shirt the top of his pants but he thought he could hide most of the stains and damage by holding the jacket close to him he spotted the mercedes hovering near the entrance then turning three rows over jackie would spot the shotout windows of the explorer within seconds ben ran bent close to the ground ignoring the curious stares of shoppers he reached the end of the row and then bolted across the open pavement toward the entrance down the row he saw the battered mercedes cruise to a stop jackie abandoning the car in the middle of the rightofway ben stumbled inside the mall the new mall was highend ornately tiled floors leather chairs and couches artfully arranged so people could relax and sip lattes and wait for shopping relatives in comfort friday afternoon had brought a goodsized crowd mostly teenagers and young mothers ben walked fast trying not to draw attention to himself he risked a look back to see if he was leaving a trail of blood he wasnt but he saw jackie following with purpose not running and jackie smiled the cat closing in on the mouse hand in his jacket pocket that would be where the gun was jackies gaze locked on bens ben reached an intersection in the promenade a left and right that each led to an anchor store across from him was a home electronics store and suddenly a dozen images of his own face looked back at him from the displayed tvs tuned to cnn he stumbled away wedged his hand into his hair as though lost in thought shaded his face with his palm think he realized that he needed a big store a place with short sight lines where he could lose jackie he hurried through the thickening crowdsa pair of jugglers performed in one of the intersections and people stopped to watchand veered toward one of the less expensive department stores he had a sudden hope that the store would be more crowded both with shoppers and merchandise than the pricier options more places to hide mister youre bleeding an older woman said to ben she carried pottery barn and macys bags and she gestured at his bloodied shirt then at his face her mouth pursed he gave her a half smile and a nod he hurried past her mister hey wait the woman called she might be grabbing a security guard ben risked a backward look jackie kept pace not closing in on him in front of witnesses but keeping a constant distance he couldnt see where the woman had gone ben went into the department store past a young woman handing out perfume samples past silverdraped tables covered with brightly boxed gifts past redinked banners announcing percent discounts he dodged mothers pushing strollers couples walking handinhand a trio of women hunting for the bridal department mistake too many people and if jackie started shooting ben got on the escalator he hurried past the standing riders he turned saw jackie in unhurried pursuit and he had a horrible sense that the boy would simply pull his gun fire a head shot at ben and take his chances with escaping from the crowd second mistake ben thought if he made another error an innocent bystander might get killed and the thought burnt his chest jackie boarded the escalator behind him ben stepped off and around taking the next escalator to the third floor where he booked a hard left through housewares and furniture here the merchandise stood closer together with false walls creating bedrooms living rooms and dens fewer open lines for jackie to catch sight of him a labyrinth of staged decor fewer customers he thought more furniture might move at night or on weekends families and couples browsing together but not on a friday afternoon one of the alcoves was a den done in an asian motif a lowstanding teak coffee table a minimalist sofa with red silk pillows chinese characters sewn on them in black thread a jade sculpture a large vase with cranes and flowers painted on its surface he grabbed the vase with both hands his arm cramped in agony the vase was heavy and reached from his waist to his head ben ducked back against the alcove and waited jackie ran past intent on catching sight of ben and ben rushed him in six steps swinging the vase hard as jackie turned and dipped his hand in his jacket pocket the vase slammed into jackies face like a ceramic baseball bat shattering jackie reeled back and ben swung at him again with the remnant of the vase the heavy bottom he socked jackie in the mouth and the young man went down face bloodied lip cut in a halfconscious sprawl ben leaned down took jackies gun and keys from his jacket pocket dropped them down the front of his own shirt where was the knife jackie tried to focus on him through a bloodied mask ben leaned down and with his good hand hit jackie as hard as he could in the jaw twice jackie tried to make a fist and ben pounded jackies head three times against the floor jackie stopped fighting his eyes unfocused hey a woman started screaming ben looked up the woman was a sales associate manicured hand at mouth he has a gun i saw it in his pocket call the police ben said he followed me from a house on nottingham street he hurt a woman there the woman retreated toward the sales desks phone she pointed a finger at him as though it would freeze him in place dont move choose stay and explain to the cops that jackie had killed delia but then he was in jail and maybe funneled back to another kidwell he stumbled to his feet and ran he heard the woman yell stop he didnt shed have security on him in a minute he headed for a door marked associates only it wasnt locked and he went through hearing the woman yelling behind him he rushed down a corridor leading off to an empty break room and a much larger back stock area and a freight elevator he hit the button get out to the parking lot this was an anchor store it would have a lot of exits find jackies car take it he waited for the elevator to arrive it cranked up sluggishly from the ground floor it boomed as though it hadnt been serviced in years a noisy throatclearing rise up the elevator shaft he pressed himself against the wall the elevator chimed its arrival the cargowide doors slid open like a slowly drawn curtain the elevator stood empty he rushed inside and jabbed the firstfloor button and the closedoor button he heard the door to the employee area open feet running stumbling im gonna cut you to shreds no the doors began to close sliding on their own ancient schedule ben yanked out his shirttail groped for the gun and the car keys jackie raced toward the closing door his forehead a blood smear eyes raging nose bent the knife low tight in his hand ready to strike the doors started to close ben raised the gun and fired jackie saw the gun his expression of rage shifted into surprise jackie dodged to the left ben pivoted to follow jackies lunge and fired just before the doors slid shut the elevator began its arthritic descent did i hit him did i kill him ben stood motionless in the elevator the gun warm in his hand what the hells wrong with you you could have stopped the doors dumb ass you had the gun he thought the elevator settled the doors inched open he hid the gun awkwardly under his shirttail listening for pursuing footsteps only silence he turned and hurried out of the cargo bay exit jumped down to the parking lot ben ran now pain drove him like an engine he reached the stretch of parking lot where hed abandoned the explorer the black mercedes still stood where jackie had left it an angry man standing by the sedan blocked in ben hurried to the drivers door for christs sakes learn to park the man said i will ben said the man gawked at him the blood on him the sweat hey do you need help im fine thanks ben slid into the mercedes wait a minute wait a note of recognition in his voice he pulled a cell phone from his pocket of course it was a stick shift since his arm wasnt working right but he was alive no complaints he gunned the mercedes into a lurching motion found a rhythm every time he changed gear the dull agony pulsed ben powered out of the lot you had a gun he only had a knife you could have hit the button opened the doors you could have shot the murdering bastarddead you cannot run you have to take the fight back to these people they will never stop chasing you through the pain he thought of delia lying broken on the floor gone in a second like his emily hed shot twice at jackie and missed both times pilgrim was right he was no good at this war he prayed as he pulled back onto the main road through frisco that the man in the parking lot didnt get the license number wasnt calling the police that sirens wouldnt rise in pursuit of him in the next minute a rage filled him eclipsed the pain in his arm and along his body from jackies toying cuts it was a hot and fierce anger hed tamped down hard into his heart kept at a simmer seeing delia die gave it energy fueled it like longdry tinder exploding into flame you ran and you should have killed him you should have killed him for what he did jackie lynch trembled more from fury than pain bens final shot had missed him because hed gotten out of the line of fire stumbling against the wall and not had the guts to leap and jab the elevator button reopen the doors confront ben the thought of being shot with his own gun had slowed him made him hesitate not caution but cowardice stupid he could have gutted the amateur with one sweep of the blade you worthless shit he said to himself mumbling through his broken nose and cut lips the heat of shame warmed his bones like a fever he had hesitated as ben cut into the mall crowd when he should have taken the shot then run a terrible mistake a sorry excuse for a lynch he suddenly fought back tears he was the son of one of the most feared men in the ira he remembered the dark basement in belfast where men who were suspected of whispering into british ears were brought he could still see the terror in their eyes as they were placed in the chair across from his father he was brother to a man revered for his ability to kill and not be seen but he was a sorry legacy of their blood taken down by an amateur hed badly underestimated he didnt even have his car keys now his face was a bloody fright anyone who saw him would remember him and if the police found him started questioning him found his ties to his brother and hence to his brothers clients in the mideastthen all was ended he would never see the outside of a prison again he reached the stores loading docks hung back in the shadows for a moment he kept the knife up his shirtsleeve ready to drop into his hand a young man wheeled an armoire into a delivery truck came back out onto the dock and then steered his dolly through another door now the back of the truck was empty the driver conferring off to the side with a coworker holding a tablet pc tapping at the screen and shaking his head at his companion then laughing goodnaturedly jackie stepped into the back of the truck squeezed through the narrow maze toward the cab hid between a refrigerator and an armoire he took off his shirt and pressed it against his cut and battered face would he have awful scars would his face be ugly now thirty seconds later the truck door slid shut plunging him into darkness he heard footsteps on the loading dock security men asking questions about two men running through the store the truck driver saying hed been standing here the whole time hed seen nothing jackie waited to see if the doors would open or if the truck would take him after another minute the trucks engine roared to life moved forward out of the bay escape was escape but this was humiliation running losing to a nobody like ben forsberg as he bounced in the darkness he imagined bens face gaping in terror dying slow on his knifes point screaming like the cowards in the belfast basement the bloodied smile seemed tattooed on jackies face bob taggarts den appeared to be a bizarre hybrid of a gun show and a used bookstore tall bookshelves covered one wall jammed full with tattered paperbacks and battered hardcovers another wall featured a collection of antique firearms mixed in with newer guns bright yellow squares of postit notes lay beneath several of the mounted guns vochek could see notes penciled on the squares of color the handwriting was as precise as the characters of a typewriter stacks of books towered from the floor volumes on history and weaponry and guns im working on a book on firearms bob taggart said im on the ninth draft of my outline im being very methodical in how i approach my work i admire that she said she leaned closer looked at the guns a french pistol from a german revolver from a police special from prohibitionera chicago if they could talk he said other than spitting bullets wed be out of our jobs he laughed a rich warm sound taggart was a short man heavyset with a silver burr of hair cut into a retro flattop he had a warm and ingratiating smile he had his hands behind his back and he rocked on the balls of his feet beaming at his guns vochek gave his fingers a quick inspection as he pointed out the beauty of an antique firearm from prussia no wedding ring she wondered if maybe mom would like taggart wondered if he ever made his way to houston you truly have quite a collection vochek said im mindful about my purchases i research them im careful and methodical she wondered if he was preemptively defending his work on the emily forsberg case before she asked a single question he offered her iced tea she accepted and he got them their drinks he settled into a recliner she sat on the couch across from him im not sure how i can help you he said the lead investigators were in maui i only did questioning here of people in dallas in support of the hawaiian investigation everything on the murder was in the file the case remains open but cold yes well youre the closest so im talking to you first but im sure well be talking with the investigators in maui as well i read the file you were indeed very methodical and careful taggart shrugged not that i made much of a difference for emily forsberg she heard bitterness under his words id just like your impressions on the case you can get so much more from talking to an investigating officer than simply reading the file you get all my prejudices and theories he smiled ill take those she said and this is because you want to find ben forsberg yes we found a link between forsberg and a known hired killer i want to find out how strong the link is and how long ago it was forged you mean did he use a hired killer to get rid of his wife yes taggart frowned i suppose anything is possible what did you think of ben as a suspect or a person both i did not talk with him until he returned to dallas so you understand i did not see him in the immediate aftermath of his wifes death which is when you can learn the most about a suspects emotional reaction to the crime hed had a few days to compose himself to deal with the shock of her death he was theres a phrase i used in my career devastated but dignified he does have a reserve about him she said the more calculating murderers often do but from what we found he and emily were very much in love very happy theyd met through their work dated for two years gotten engaged nothing to indicate trouble no signs of abuse or infidelity no money worries he carried no life insurance policy on her theyd only been married a week he shrugged plus killing her on their honeymoon if he didnt want to marry her he could have backed out a few days before usually people with doubts immediately after a wedding resign themselves to the marriage or start thinking annulment but but they didnt stay in a hotel they rented a house in lahaina that was a bit unusual and if he wanted her dead then it was certainly easier to kill her in a house than in a crowded hotel but she handled the arrangements apparently renting the house was her ideaher mother confirmed that with me ben and emily were together most of the time obviously it being a honeymoon their last morning there he went to play golf with another honeymooning husband theyd met down on the beachwhich gave him a good alibibut he only played nine holes not the eighteen he originally told emily he would if he planned the shooting and he didnt want to be there when she was shot he should have played the whole course he cleared his throat of course he could have taken a gun gone up the hill shot her dead but he has no experience with firearms and there was zero forensic evidence that hed handled or fired a gun or managed to acquire one while on maui the police thought it was random yes windows were shot out in two empty rental houses a half mile away some empty car windows shot out near the airport bullets all matched the shot into the forsberg house was the final one ben had just left the golf course when the first shots were heard and reportednot enough time to get to the first scene the timing weighed the inquest in his favor so several random shots and emily forsberg was just unlucky taggart shrugged an idiot kid drinking beer probably taking potshots but damn the bullet nailed her square in the forehead a precise kill the kind of shot that a nicky lynch could make or an incredibly unlucky shot and no trace found of gun or gunman none what about bens business if he was involved in shady dealings and she found out about it taggart shrugged too much government contracting is shadyjust my opinionbut we found no history of questionable business she worked for hector global yes she was a very senior accountant being groomed to be sam hectors chief financial officer taggart tented his fingers over his whiskeybarrel stomach sam hector delivered a eulogy at her service he stopped opened his mouth again as if to speak closed his jaw as though reconsidering he tapped fingers on his chairs arm vochek raised her eyebrows he spoke slowly maybe ben wasnt the shady dealer maybe sam hector was you suspected him careful and methodical remember he risked a smile he was in los angeles and two contractors backed him up but you know he has his own plane a learjet delta he paused again gave her an enigmatic look it has the range to fly to hawaii you think hector could have flown to maui killed emily and come back but there would be records of the flight this is a man who moves hired soldiers and equipment all over the world sometimes in secret if he wanted to get to maui without attracting attention i believe he could taggart shrugged but he had no motive we could discern and he had an alibi back to a dead end tell me about this hired killer you mentioned she took a photo from her purse and slid it to him taggart dug bifocals from his pocket studied nicky lynchs face he looks like a barkeep he was a trained sniper taggart raised an eyebrow he handed her back the photo of nicky lynch a sniper i guess that explains it then you dont think ben forsberg hiring a killer is the tidy solution i he stopped and glanced at his watch its five oclock somewhere i would like a small glass of bourbon would you care for a drop the sudden shift in his tone surprised her his ruddy skin paled she didnt want one but she sensed accepting his offer might loosen his tongue as much as the bourbon yes please just a fingers worth he stood and fetched them each a measure of bourbon handed her one of the crystal glasses and sat back down in the recliner were miles off the record you tell anyone i said this and ill deny it she allowed herself a tiny sip of bourbon sure he took a long savoring sip of his drink have you met sam hector yet she shook her head he stood up and splashed more bourbon in his glass this is the part i wont repeat when i started digging at sam hector i got leaned on hard avalanche hard by my supervisor and by a suit from washington i was told sam hector was not a suspect could not be a suspect and did not merit further scrutiny i asked why because i do not like getting leaned on and i thought hes got big government connections hes just throwing his dicpardon his weight around i mean could you do something that looked more guilty he touched the fresh bourbon to his lips i got into police work for two reasons my dad was a cop and i admired him more than anyone i ever knew second was i have a basic problem with unfairness i know that sounds naive but its the way god made me she offered him an awkward smile im the same way she thought of the dead afghan kids cut down in their pajamas she understood taggart and thought he understood her he would have made a far better partner in work than kidwell but we live in an inherently unfair world he shrugged i felt sam hector wasnt making my corner of the world more fair so i dug a bit and found that the suit from washington who warned me off was a senior cia official she set down her glass why would the cia care about sam hector at first i thought well maybe the cias a big client of hectors he seems to do work for every government agency but the cia protecting him is an inverse in the power relationship if hes in trouble because of a crime he committed and theyve hired him theyre going to cut him loose but instead they back him so they warned me off and i let myself be warned off but i always wondered why did the cia not want me to dig at hector why would the cia be shielding him she drove from cedar hill back into the heart of dallas headed north on central expressway cut across plano to the private air park and let herself into the safe house the pilot whod flown her up from austin had thoughtfully stocked the refrigerator with basics and she made herself a salad and a sandwich she hadnt realized until the bourbon inched into her stomach that she was starving the phone rang vochek she said delia moon is dead pritchard said the words hit like a hammer to her chest what how a man matching ben forsbergs description was seen driving at high speed from her neighborhood a man in a mercedes who was either chasing him or fleeing with him shot at a police officer who responded to a report of shots fired a woman was checking out a house being built down the street and heard the shots and called the police ben killed delia we dont know yet what the hell is going on vochek she didnt like the chiding tone in pritchards voice this software that adam reynolds was developing about searching financial databaseswhat has the team found on it why do you ask it was not the response she expected because delia was dodgy about a project he was working on said it was a prototype she didnt want to describe it to me she was worried we wouldnt return his property silence for a moment he was working on a way to identify and track people using false identities via combining information from lots of different databases at least thats what an encoded prototype on the system appears to be but he didnt save any queries or results from the programim not sure this program would even work and we cant test it we dont have access to all those different databases vochek said false identity one you invent or one you steal the competing charges on bens credit card made more sense to her now especially if someone had stolen bens identity i want to know why you told me to stay away from sam hector hes just a contractor were under the gun to produce results here joanna he has nothing to do with he knows ben forsberg he might be of help in finding him hes not going to give shelter or help to a fugitive it would be career suicide vochek couldnt keep the anger out of her voice youre the second government agency to be shielding hector during a criminal investigation why i am hardly shielding him i am keeping you focused on what matters joanna i want you to find out for me if sam hector is excia you want please well hes not theres an extensive government file on him hes exarmy not cia never mind what his file says she tempered her tone joanna leave it alone just find randall choate thats all that matters dont get distracted if hector is excia dont you think we should know that little fact sleeping dogs pritchard said but i can tell you wont give this up so fine ill see what i can find thank you margaret vochek hung up she had a sinking feeling that shed opened a box best left sealed sam hector was a powerful and respected man but too many of the threads seemed to loop back toward him vochek clicked on the television found a twentyfourhour texas news channel waited for an account of delias murder to run dead adam reynolds who had called kidwell for help kidwell and the guards now delia the same awful sense of helplessness that shed felt seeing the dead afghan boys cut down by a covert group clenched her chest no more no more no more she dug through the phone book and called hector global argued her way up the chain to sam hectors assistant im very sorry agent vochek the assistant said hes not in today and i doubt hell be in this weekend weve had a real tragedy here i know tell him i was at the hotel when his men were killed ask mr hector to call me at this number i need to talk to him about ben forsberg she thanked the assistant for his help she went back to her unfinished dinner ate the rest of the food without tasting it leave it alone just find randall choate she was suddenly afraid of what else she might find pilgrim pulled the stolen volvo now on its third set of license plates into the parking lot of the apartment complex in east dallas in the backseat were two sacks of groceries food and sleep sounded like heaven he got out of the car he had been careful in approaching the lot trying to make sure he wasnt being followed making sure no hunter lurked in a car no one in the cellar knew about the apartment the same as no one knew about the storage unit hed loaded with guns and cash it was his escape hatch his hideaway he spent most of his time in the wonderful constant anonymity of new york city but this dump was his secret base for any job that brought him to the southwest or mexico or beyond he paid for the apartment once a year sent cash for the utilities the complex was seedy and the landlord was only too happy to have a unit that he didnt need to worry about dunning for rent he had not been here in months another large apartment complex next door had been razed a bigger shopping center rising in its wake just the shell of the buildingsteel beams and concrete floorsin place so far pilgrim headed up the stairs sitting in front of his door was ben he held a gun between his raised knees loosely not aimed at pilgrim on his wrist pilgrim could see the remnant of the plastic cuff he was pale shivering in pain and pilgrim saw dried blood on his hand he could probably take him in three steps knock the gun from his hand but he wanted to hear what ben had to say hello pilgrim said im really surprised ill take that as an insult pilgrim shifted the bags in his grip i do what i put my mind to ben said you didnt bring the police with you are you scared that im here a challenge rose in his voice scared of you pilgrim set down the grocery bags how did you find me ben i got shot in the arm you patch me up and ill tell you how i found you and ill tell you exactly how adam found you im suspicious you would trust me again i dont trust you for a second you screw me over you screw yourself over a hard edge touched bens gaze when emily died i was so frozen it took me two minutes to call the police because her being dead couldnt be true i refused to see what was right before my eyes its called shock its called how i live i saw a womancompletely innocentdie today i cant see that again not after my wife i cant keep running i want to take the fight back to these people whatever it takes pilgrim picked up the bags come in and lets get you cleaned up pilgrim disinfected and bandaged bens arm as ben gritted his teeth an expert shot jackie made to wound you dont compliment him ben dryswallowed four ibuprofen tablets he sat still and then started to shake the adrenaline easing out of him so sherlock how did you find me bugs you doesnt it i dont like security holes your storage unitslasharmy depot i figured if you had a storage unit near a major airport hub you might also have an apartment close by in case you needed to hide before you got on a plane or you wanted to vanish for a few days without having to travel it made sense to be close to your resources as you call them you didnt want me to know about any residence you had since you were planning to dump me as soon as you were recovered enough from your injuries so i went back to the storage facility office and they remembered id been there this morning moving out boxes with you i was asking about renting a unit myself prices and such and the very nice clerk was looking up units on their system to see what was available she got a phone call and when she turned to take it i snuck a peek at their computer screen and typed in your unit number it gave this address youre lucky they didnt recognize you from tv i wore a cap and i talked in a thick fake boston accent i didnt even use the sneeze and hide pilgrim went into the narrow compact kitchen tell me how adam found the cellar no ben said first you tell me what you found at barkers ben in your case ignorance truly is bliss wrong because if i know too much you cant abandon me again which means youd have to kill me and you wont i killed seven people yesterday i killed two more today youd make it an even number but he gave a crooked smile ben pulled the small black sketchbook from his pocket he tossed it to pilgrim who caught it onehanded and tucked it close to his chest he then slid the sketchbook into his pocket thanks he turned back to the counter started emptying the grocery sacks heating the oven for frozen pizzas you didnt realize youd lost your sketches i hope you like pepperoni pilgrim checked the oven setting hed fiddled with twenty seconds earlier you dropped it when we fought in the bathroom i said thank you whos the kid in the drawings ben asked pilgrim slid two frozen pizzas into the oven i know what it is to lose someone pilgrim my wife was funny and sharptongued and brilliant and loving and hardworking she drove me crazy both good and bad ive never been the same since she died not for a second dont give me that she completed you shit pilgrim slammed the oven door shut completed me no she would have laughed at sentimentality but she made me a better man in every way and when she died i cant be better again i dont even know how to start no one can fix it i have to figure it out on my own pilgrim stood away from the oven for a moment he thought of a little girls voice on a tinny cell phone call in a jakarta bank urging him home for her birthday you said you knew how adam found the cellar i said you first pilgrim told him about the attack at barkers house that his own colleagues were now hunting him he described teachs kidnapper using the vague terms that de la pena had provided that teach was being held in a house but that he did not know where the house was that barker had last called a hotel in new orleans i spent this afternoon trying to track de la pena and green back to where they came from there wasnt a gps in their rental car i could use to see where theyd come from the rental car was in greens name paid for by sparta your front company yes so it was paid for with cellar funds i made no headway does his description of the guy whos giving teach orders sound familiar he sounds like any number of guys who might be in this line of work ben said slowly the man did sound vaguely like sam hectorbut fit older men would be a description for practically every suspect with a military background pilgrim shrugged de la pena was desperate not to betray the guy which tells me he had major motive to behave either through reward or threat im not sure i can trust anything de la pena told me tell me what you learned ben told him how he escaped from the hotel stole the explorer made it to delias house and about his desperate flight through and from the mall in frisco pilgrim listened chin on steepled fingertips youre lucky to be alive pilgrim got up pulled the cooked pepperoni pizzas from the oven put them on plates and sliced them considering you made about a dozen stupid mistakes i missed a chance to kill him you didnt give him an equal chance to kill you sometimes the smartest move in a fight is to retreat a look crossed his face regret of the bonedeep sort and he turned away from ben youre alive to fight tomorrow and it sounds like he came out of it far worse than you did now what there is no what ben do yourself a favor turn yourself in to the police i know you think im a bastard but leaving you in the hotel was a way to keep you safe no he stood and got their drinks took his plate of pizza his arm ached but the nausea had passed and now his stomach rumbled and clenched a raw pang of hunger discussion over pilgrim started wolfing his food down fine we stick together then it was such a simple assertion that ben knew pilgrim would not go back on his word this time barker called new orleans ben said delia moon mentioned new orleans said adam wouldnt go anywhere near new orleans right now and he told kidwell when he called him that there was a major threat brewing those two statements have to be connected there are lots of government contractors in new orleans lots of fat deals yes ben said fema contractors hundreds of them companies with contracts to rebuild and for relief efforts for a while there were a large number of private security contractors to maintain order in the city right after the hurricane but not so many now and they are mostly tied to private businesses we have three contractors connected to this caseadam and hector and you its not coincidence you said delia calls sam hector and a killer then shows up at her door we still have no connection between sam and jackie he was putting his business before our friendship today but i cant believe hed be involved in murder you cant or you wont sam hector is your blind spot ben lets consider this from another angle this software adam was building to unearth and connect illicit activities across databases he needed funding presumably to have time to write a massive amount of code or to hire out parts of the work its stuff the government would love to have true and lets say adam was originally not working for the government but was working for bad guys who want to find and destroy the cellar but if you want to kill a group of peopleespecially a group of skilled operatives like the cellaryou dont let them wander freely you kill them dead before they can kill you he paused let the words sink in so if said bad guys found green and de la pena why not simply kill them whats the purpose of finding the cellar if you dont destroy it pilgrim said exposure think corporate takeover you force them to do your bidding pilgrim stood fists clenched i am so going to end these people what do you know about this office of strategic initiatives that vochek and kidwell work for zero could strategic initiatives simply be trying to take over the cellar ben crossed his arms remember a few years back when the department of defense didnt like the intel it was getting from the cia they started forming their own intelligence agency the cellar would be a premade cia and theyre willing to kill their own people like kidwell and hectors guards theyre willing to hire the lynch brothers its very dangerous to come after us maybe you have an enemy in a high place ben said pilgrim stood lets see what we can find in jackies mercedes the mercedes sat parked a block away in another apartment lot the dented door and scraped sides gave it an air of belonging in the neighborhood that otherwise it would have lacked they drove the mercedes back to pilgrims apartment parked it in a pool of light ben opened the glove compartment began to search the papers stuffed into it a map of texas a map of dallas a registration receipt and proof of insurance car owned by mckeen property company ben said mckeen thats the same company that owned homelands office in austin they searched the rest of the car but found nothing else so they went back to the apartment we need to find who owns mckeen ben said and if we dont or cant then we go to sam hector he provided staff to kidwell and he balked at giving me any information on this office of strategic initiatives ben i understand hes your friend but his name is cropping up here way too much for me i dont know anything about him he urged me to come see him said hed get me a good lawyer the best money could buy but he absolutely refused to tell me who was behind the office of strategic initiatives so do you trust him i dont know im not sure a real friend would have told me everything i needed to know maybe we never know people as well as we think we do pilgrim finished his pizza wiped his mouth with a paper napkin and here you are with me instead of your old friend because you need help you cant stop these people alone im just doing whats right and necessary same as you it might be necessary but its not right are the people you killed bad or not pilgrim shook his head im not going to tell you campfire stories spare me the gory details pilgrim sat at the table drank from his water bottle i killed three terrorism financiers in pakistan one was a pakistani government official so no way our government could own that one a couple of times i killed people selling secrets to the chinese he took another sip from the bottle i killed a british gun runner in colombia who was trying to cut a deal between uk extremist groups and the cali narcotics rings for financing to kill british judges the guy was supposed to be alone his girlfriend was with him i had to kill her too a single shot to the heart she started to scream and never finished it his mouth narrowed into a thin line did she know he was with the extremists i assume her brother was the head of the ring then she made her choice in her associates but i assume maybe she was clean just getting a nice vacation in south america maybe she didnt know her brother and her boyfriend were major assholes odds are she did know people have to bear responsibility for their choices and their actions pilgrim then im doomed he looked at ben ben you dont ever get used to it ever but youre fighting the good fight so you approve of what i do i understand the need for it ben said but do you understand the price pilgrim was silent for several seconds once i made my biggest mistake i tried to destroy a terror cell in indonesia years ago i failed miserably i lost everything for the first time ben saw a tremble touch pilgrims hands i guess you dont want to talk about it ben said pilgrim didnt answer ben heard only the passing of traffic on the nearby road the soft hiss of the tires on pavement i dont need a friend ben i just need your help to stop these people all right im thinking were missing the obvious adam is hunting terrorists and the sniper who takes him down has terrorist ties what if the reason adam died is because the terrorists found out about what he was doing maybe they were watching him and they saw me and they learned what teach and i are maybe this mess is way more about adam than you and me ben was silent terrorists operating on american soil with serious resources targeting the people who could expose them or bring them down this fight could be much more important than getting teach back or saving the cellar or clearing your name pilgrim said do you understand that ben nodded maybe he really found terrorists here and the arabs in austin were part of it pilgrim stood we have to find whos behind this mckeen company wait you said you lost everything did you lose the kid in your drawings pilgrim shuffled feet on the grimy carpet dont ben is she your daughter please do i look like a family man not now maybe before you were a guy like you leave it alone ben you dont hear me asking you about your wife he took a deep breath all right business consultant what do you need to find out about mckeen as a company a laptop and an internet connection pilgrim pulled a red matchbook from his pocket and tossed it on the table ben picked it up blarneys steakhouse very popular with the imported gunman crowd pilgrim said and look there he pointed at a line below the phone number free wifi a crowded restaurant absolutely not my face is all over television ben said not the face im going to give you ben barely recognized himself he wore a fake dental front to make his teeth seem bigger and slightly tinted glasses from pilgrims cache of goodies that made his blue eyes appear brown his blond hair went under a baseball cap blarneys steakhousethe original of the regional chainsat in the prime corner of a major thoroughfare in frisco behind its giant shamrock sign was a glass building where the shamrock was reproduced again albeit smaller the restaurant when it had gone chain and started a slow expansion across the south had needed an actual headquarters and had moved to the building behind it blarneys had taken everything good about ireland and made it cheap badly produced irish folk tunes warbled from speakers the singing muffled so that patrons wouldnt be distracted by the poetry of the lyrics the entrees were given names such as dubliner chicken and leprechaun lamb chops and erin go blossom a huge fried onion appetizer walls were covered with obscure faux irish sporting memorabilia framed pages from joyce and yeats reproduction street signs from towns all around ireland the large bar made to resemble an americans ideal of the interior of an irish castle attached to the main restaurant was full of people watching basketball the dallas mavericks rallying from behind a win nearly in their grasp ben took pilgrims laptop and sat at a corner booth he felt incredibly nervous about being out in public againbut pilgrim said hide in plain sight youd be surprised how few people notice anything going on around them most of the bars patrons seemed entirely focused on their own conversations or on the close game being waged on the hardwood whos gonna look at you they got american idol to watch and basketball brackets to bet on and cell phones pressed to their ears pilgrim ordered martinis made with expensive vodka and two hefty appetizers to keep the waitress happy so she wouldnt care about them staying awhile ben started digging mckeens web site simply showed a banner apologizing for technical difficulties the web site was down odd but perhaps mckeen might be suffering from media shyness after the austin gun battle on its property he jumped to a series of business intelligence sites where he maintained subscriptions it was a risk to enter his password in case people who knew his habits were hunting for him but he had to take the chance mckeen was privately held so there was scant financial data to be found other than analyst projections the martinis and the badly named casey quesadillas and the armagh artichoke dip arrived ben drank a hard sip of his martini pilgrim ate watched the data spill across bens screen in silence ben read and clicked through a long march of analyst reports news releases and forum discussions on mckeen not a lot mckeen started off as a construction company divested into retail and office properties about ten years ago mostly in the south they started doing specialized construction for the government restoring facilities in afghanistan after the fall of the taliban more contractors pilgrim said the expansion continued mckeen landed a large reconstruction contract in tikrit but had to pull out due to the insurgency bought out a few regional construction companies in texas and new england bought blarneys steakhouse wow mckeen owns blarneys ben said im going to go scout out the corporate headquarters behind the restaurant pilgrim said dont do anything stupid just sit here and keep getting smart pilgrim said he got up and left ben read further mckeen was bought by a private equity group mls limited two years ago june two months after emily died my god how different would life be if she had not died they might be planning to have a child they might be sitting on the couch at home watching this same basketball game she would be full of the energy and love and life that had so defined her personality and he wouldnt be wearing a disguise in a bar trying to find out who was trying to kill him he started tapping again buying and reading and mining through analyst reports now hunting for information on mls limited it was in turn owned by another threeinitial firm headquartered in bermuda that company in turn was a subsidiary of another practically invisible company one ben couldnt find a detail on hed hit a roadblock bens head began to spin someone was hiding behind an entire meaningless maze of names he wasnt going to be able to find the name behind mckeen not with what was available on the web frustration made him feel sick he drank the martini ate the olive he ate half of the toochewy quesadilla and nibbled at the clovergreen artichoke dip he had another idea there was a discussion board devoted to security contractors he surfed to it wanted to see if he could find anyone who had done contracts for the office of strategic initiatives he started paging through the threads the discussions of topics there was one called missingcontractor he clicked on it it was about him a few executives at his smaller clients had ventured to his defense but a number of others were gutting him ben forsberg was no longer considered a kidnapping victim according to news reports he had been identified by the housekeeper and the manager of the motel near the lbj freeway hed been identified by a sales associate at a department store he scanned the words two contractors died and this son of a bitch ranhe better hope the cops find him before one of us does it had to be a crooked deal he was settingup he probably screwed the dead guy on a contract and had him killed the venom and the conjecture went on each poster used a fake name on the board so he could not know who was savaging his reputation but the momentum was on their side his few defenders were shouted down by the righteous he had an account on the board and wanted to post you idiots dont have a clue as to what youre talking about it was a business that based much of its appeal on loyalty but little loyalty was being shown to him he went to the sites search bar and entered office of strategic initiatives no results if someone had done a contract with kidwells group it was not being broadcast or discussed the basketball game went into its final minutes and still pilgrim did not return he watched the mavericks win then the screen switched to a west coast game he drank pilgrims martini his bullet wound began to throb his head felt fuzzy bad idea they were making scant progress and getting drunk was not an option pilgrim walked into the bar and ben could see his face was ashen he sat across from ben noticed the two empty martini glasses at bens elbow gestured to the waitress for another round he gritted his jaw in cold fury what ben said whats wrong pilgrim said nothing until the waitress brought two more martinis he watched her leave then drank one down and chewed the olives i broke into the offices how jesus ben it doesnt matter i have my ways i wanted to access the ceos computer see if there was any data relating to mckeen but much more interesting was this picture hanging on the ceos wall pilgrim pulled a newspaper clipping from his pocket it looked like it had been cut from a picture frame a newspaper article celebrating the original launch of blarneys the caption under the picture listed the people at the ribboncutting the owner a couple of his investors the mayor of frisco is this sam hector is this your wonderful friend pilgrim tapped the man at the far side of the photo smiling thinly with his intense eyes pilgrims finger trembled as he pointed at the mans face yeah thats sam i didnt know he was an original investor in blarneys theres a hell of a lot you dont know about your friend his names not sam hector at least to me what that man destroyed my life ten years ago pilgrim said indonesia ten years ago the hunt for the dragons killers took choate into the rainslick streets into trashreeking alleys smokeclouded restaurants a gritty airport hangar information flowed at the point of a gun or with the folding of bills into a grimy palm the info hed found in the bank was next to useless those aliases and accounts vanished but he found people who were family and friends of the dragons murdered informants they gave him slim threads of hope and rumor to follow he stayed out of sight the cia and the bin knew he hadnt bothered to set foot on the plane back to virginia his colleagues were searching for him three days of careful and constant tracking brought him to the end he stood in a darkened upstairs hallway gun in hand waiting to kill gumalar would be arriving at this house within a few minutes then the score would be settled his familys safety assured the house was a grand mansion in jakartas wealthy pondok indah neighborhood outside distant traffic hummed like a swarm of insects the breeze smelled of the soft jasmine blossoms of melati on the floor below him choate heard the terrorist leader complain to the drug lord inconsiderate bastard always running late yes mr gumalar please hurry up and get here choate thought tonight gumalar was coming to deliver a laundered two million dollars to the blood of fire cell that wished to undermine the indonesian government the house belonged to a drug lord who had a vested interest in a weakened government and was providing a neutral secure location for his two friends to conduct their business the men chatted like a pair of old widows gossiping about television and mutual friends as though their business was not the devastation of human lives choate checked his watch gumalar was late there had been a change of plans one of choates new contacts told him in a whispered phone call moving the meeting to here from the city of bandung a hundred miles away choate had raced back to jakarta driving like a madman frantic hed gotten bad informationbut here the terrorist leader and the drug lord waited choate wondered if the men were simply being cautious in altering their plans or if they suspected they were being hunted since his escape from his prison because someoneperhaps even someone in the ciahad betrayed him and the dragon to gumalar someone might have also told his prey that he hadnt left the country choate glanced at his watch and prayed for gumalar to keep the meeting tamara was having her birthday party in three days and if he did the kill tonight and walked back into the agency hed be back home in virginia in plenty of time to help decorate the house help tamara bake her own cake he knew if he got this impossible job done so that neither he nor the cia could be blamed hed be forgiven for leaving the hospital and continuing the operation a downstairs door opened he caught his breath he heard a chorus of greetings the drug lord speaking in indonesian saying hello and well all right if you had to bring him sounding a bit surprised mens voices speaking quietly an answering murmur from gumalar then the drug lord said yes well upstairs and to your right someone was getting directions to the bathroom perfect choate thought if it was gumalars bodyguardhe could take the man out immediately charge down the steps kill the other guard kill the drug lord the drug lord was a heavyset man of sixty choate did not think he would be a problem gumalar was in his forties and had no fighting skills the guards were the main threat and if he could eliminate them separately the job would be smooth maybe he could even catch an earlier flight back to the states he heard the soft tread of footsteps on the marbled stairs approaching him choate aimed the gun with a leisurely practiced stretch of his arm a single shot to the throat he was ten feet from the stairs and as the man stepped up the flight choate would wait for the guard to turn his eyes adjusting to the darkness of the landing lit only by the faint glow of lamps from downstairs not seeing choate he waited a child stepped onto the landing from the stairs choate froze the boy was maybe ten thin dressed in jeans and a tshirt that celebrated a japanese trading card game and wore hightop red sneakers he glanced over at the corner where choate stood and he froze choate held the gun and his finger lay ready on the trigger and the boys throat was in his sight the boys gaze locked on choates face as though looking at the gun was too horrible decision kill the boy so he could kill everyone in the house choate froze unable to fire unwilling to fire the boy screamed choate ran into a bedroom and went through the open window he hit the roof he skidded down its sharp slant grabbed at the roofs edge seized it slowed his fall dropped off the overhang he landed on the firstfloor roof jumped from it to a metal patio table by the mansions pool he hit the ground drawing both guns and he saw an armed man gumalars thug the one whod tortured himrounding the corner firing and choate blasted rounds the man went down his chest a bloody ruin choate turned and through the window saw four men standing in a room the drug lord the terrorist leader gumalar and the dragon alive wearing darkrimmed glasses and a suit his shaved head covered by a dark wig he still had both his hands one of them quickly raised a glock centered its aim on choate son of a bitch choate yelled and emptied his clip the window shattering the drug lord and the terrorist leader each taking a round in the throat gumalar collapsing clutching torn guts the dragon dove behind the heavy desk one of choates bullets announcing its accuracy with a spray of his blood against the wallpaper choate ran he scraped through the thick bamboo privacy thatch at the edge of the estate plunged into the street he dodged a bmw that was barreling down the road ran north the homes on the street were large and well lit he had few places to hide he had a motorcycle stashed a block away in a darkened part of the driveway in an unoccupied house that was for sale he sprinted into the houses yard tried to kick the motorcycle into life it wouldnt start he heard police sirens rising he ran to the next house an older but wellmaintained audi sat in the driveway he broke the drivers window opened the door cracked open the console underside hotwired the car he revved the car hard into the street just as three police cruisers tore into the road closing in on him he floored the car took a hard right putting a map of central jakarta in his head i can lose them if i can get to mentang get to the agency safe house they chased him for a half mile enough time for him to think that damn dragon was the traitor and then another police car barreled right in front of him and he swerved to miss it crashing the car into a storefront he hit the steering wheel hard and his last thought was im going to miss my babys party when he woke up he was in the infirmary in an indonesian jail the cia said they had never heard of him youre telling me my best friend is your worst enemy ben turned the mercedes into the parking lot of the apartment pilgrim leaned against the window of the passenger seat he had just finished telling his story of indonesia to ben i think hes your worst enemy too ben sam hector and the dragon cant be the same man ben parked the car turned off the engine sam isnt british and he was never bald he never worked for the cia he has an entire life history i know it accents and hair can be changed did you know him ten years ago ben was silent they went inside the apartment ever meet any of his college friends people he worked with before he started his company no he worked overseas for the army he was a military liaison to allied armed forces ben muttered the words as if he were reading them aloud from a resume he knew by heart sam taking him on a fishing trip to florida to celebrate a big contract sam introducing him to emily then two years later toasting him and emily at their wedding sam voice breaking paying tribute to emily at her funeral sam an assassin no ah that was his cover then being a liaison officer allowed him to move around easily kill wherever he was needed pilgrim turned to him this is why i wasnt going to be offered a job with the rest of the cellar he knew id recognize him ben turned off the engine he wanted people to think that the dragon was dead that was his execution i was supposed to hear in the next room he walked away from his cover in the cia to set up his company maybe with the cias help maybe on his own oh christ ben felt his stomach sink his mouth went dry sams first big contract with hector global was in indonesia with the foreign ministry consulting work to their security service because there had been an attempted assassination against a prominent government family holy jesus ben he played both sides as the dragon he set up the attack on gumalar that the cia wanted done he must have even killed his own informants put their hands in that bagif he was vanishing as the dragon he didnt want any locals who could name him or id him the indonesian intel guys in the park were there because he told them i would be there doing a job on their own soil then he switched sides told the indonesians he could get the cia to back off if they gave him a security contract he launched his company with the blood of innocent people he profits from ruining a perfect cia operation he makes it look like hes lost his cover and even his buddies at the cia buy it they stay in bed with him maybe he paid them off he profits from protecting people who were funding terrorists pilgrim shook his head he destroyed my life ben reached for pilgrim touched his shoulder pilgrim flinched pressed his fist against his mouth i told them the dragon was alive they told me id killed him with that shot before i ran they covered for him and sold me out jesus he sank to the floor cupping his head in his hands im going to kill him no wonder you preferred not to have a partner all these years ben said what was your family told i looked up the news accounts later they were fed a story that i was smuggling drugs on the side im sure they were told that i died in the jailbreak teach staged im sorry pilgrim he thought of the drawings of the girl her imagined transition from toddler to teen pilgrims only connection to his daughter so he gets you out of the way and uses my name ben was quiet that means he stopped finish the sentence ben it means the lynch brothers worked for him it means the gunmen were in hectors pocket too and he sent the gunmen into the homeland office to kill us all including his own people just like back in indonesia bens temples began a slow drumbeat pound you understand this goes against everything ive ever known about this man he puts loyalty and country ahead of all he kept me going when emily died he was there for me you understand he spent years living a double life fooling you or anyone else is going to be easy for him he pulled the double frame on us its no coincidence barker gave me your identity hector knows im a threat to his takeover of the cellar youre somehow a threat to him too no those dates you showed me you said emily died two years ago same time mckeen gets bought by a mystery company she was an accountant maybe she found money being used she wasnt supposed to know about now youre reaching too far sam adored emily he thought of emily laughing on the phone with sam in the minutes before the bullet ended her life no get it through your head you dont truly know this guy hes a trained killer ben and the most manipulative bastard ive ever known jackie is driving a car registered to a company he once had dealings with hes connected ben was silent for a long minute thinking of sams insistence on not meeting him in a public place of the soft bored click of the abacus while ben had begged sam for help okay he finally said were going to his house pilgrim said force him to tell us where teach is no were not thats suicide right now his house will be a fortress its also exactly what he would expect ben said were going to beat him by doing what he doesnt expect five past midnight a quiet saturday jackie sat and drank the shot of vodka neat the alcohol stung the cuts in his lip but he didnt care he closed his eyes and let them water then blinked hed escaped from the delivery van easing out at the first stop when the deliveryman busied himself loading an oven onto the dolly jackie had crawled out of the truck unseen he spotted a busy thoroughfare a block away which saved the truckers lifejackie didnt need to kill him to get away and disposing of a full furniture truck would have been a hassle jackie walked a quarter mile until he reached a gas station and called hector to come pick him up hector wasnt happy that ben was free and jackie had lost a car jackie didnt care he peered out the window bored restless ready to hurt someone hector had well over a dozen security personnelas arrogant as the british army had been he thought in the belfast of his youthwandering the property the men made jackie feel safer but their presence was a pain he and teach had to be kept out of sight hector did not want to explain to his squad of respectable former policemen and exmilitary why a woman was being held against her will no one was allowed in the main house but hector jackie downed a second shot of vodka he got up and went downstairs to the conference room teach and hector sat at the table scribbling on a chart drawn on a plain map of the united states and europe it showed names connected by colored lines notes penciled in and hector had taped pictures to some of the names that the whole cellar then jackie asked all your little spies they both looked up at him i have ears jackie said if only you were as good at the rest of your job hector said to teach he pointed at six names these six theyll do fine call them tell them to get to new orleans by this afternoon come to your safe house there tonighthe tapped an address written on a notepadand await further orders you said you wanted to kill people in new orleans jackie said the cellars going to continue its good work jackie ive found a cell of young arabs in new orleans who have all snuck into the country under false id theyre terrorists planning to launch an attack here you and me and our friends in the cellar are going to kill them jackie laughed im surprised by the altruism i dont figure you do nothing without getting paid for it he smirked at teach who had been mostly silent speaking only to answer questions believe me that when i say killing this group of guys is the right thing for our country he pushed the phone toward teach make the calls he listened while she did following his orders to the letter she hung up very good teach if you know of a terrorist cell why not simply call homeland and tell them let them take the risk of taking the cell down youd be a hero teach said i dont need acclaim to be a good citizen he stood jackie put teach back in her room he walked down to his office closed the door the day had not gone perfectlynothing had since nicky lynch damn him to a thousand hells missed his shotbut the situation was salvageable he was going to win he checked his messages one from his assistant saying an agent vochek with homeland was very eager to speak with him he deleted the message an array of photos stood on his walls hector shaking the hand of the president of the united states posing with his contractors in the green zone touring a mountain stronghold in afghanistan now he would truly make his business grow again hectors cell phone buzzed yes mr hector this is fred espinoza fred was a hector global employee who handled the security account for blarneys steakhouse im busy fred this isnt a good time i know sir what with our men dying in austin im real sorry about that sir but given what happened in austin i figured you might want to know about any breaches at any client companies we had a breakin at blarneys corporate headquarters tonight details now sir well im not sure how he did it at this evening we had a guy deactivate the alarms caught him on the videotape system he broke into a keypad and hooked a pda into the system it read the codes and gave him access espinoza stopped not a typical burglar no he ran his fingers along the abacuss beads what did he do i have the video footage sir posted on our internal web site hector found the page with the video randall choate now known as pilgrim the pain in my ass that must die he thought pilgrim hurried through the darkened halls into the ceos office he flicked on a penlight scouring the room the scene was then picked up by a hidden camera in the ceos office pilgrim tested the file cabinets found them locked stopped and stared at the wall the video showed pilgrim bending close shining his pool of light on a framed photo the ribboncutting of the first blarneys hector remembered it a happy day pilgrim removed the picture from the frame tucked it into his pocket then put the flashlights glowing circle on his hand and raised his middle finger for a good five seconds the rest of the video showed his exit from the building have you informed the client yet hector asked yes sir its bizarre the intruder doesnt take anything of value given the onefingered salute it must be a prank a rather elaborate prank sir espinoza sounded doubtful well like computer hackers wasting their intellect on defacing a companys web site he slid all the abacus beads to one side with a clatter we need not report this to the police sir this might be a gentleman hungry for attention to hurt the hector global name weve already had one facility attacked and now this intrusion the last thing we need is the police getting ahold of this video and a joker leaking it and putting it on youtube this guys just trying to show that hector globals not doing its proper job and hes gone to great lengths to prove it yes sir espinoza said we cannot handle more bad publicity regarding our security services cut a deal with blarney tell them well give them six months of free work just keep them calm and keep the police uninvolved yes sir and fred thanks for alerting me to the situation youve done me a huge favor yes sir good night he watched the video again choate stealing an old picture of him he didnt know you as sam hector now for sure he does he had not assumed that choate knew of his rise to the pinnacle of contracting work hed thought choate was dead only a few days ago he had learned that choate was alive so now he knows you by your real name the next time i see that finger ill shoot it off he thought so pilgrim was still in dallas maybe he had cut ben forsberg loose maybe they were working together that last thought did not appeal but he was smarter than both of them there was little they could do to him hiding like the rats they were but they needed to be stopped put down the phone rang it was the contractor hed asked to notify him of any charges on the james woodward credit card a charge came through at a blarneys steakhouse i called the restaurant four martinis two appetizers the server said there were two men in the party thank you so they were together ben and pilgrim drinking and snacking and breaking into offices werent they the confident bastards he would end their arrogance he slid a fingertip along the abacus on his desk moving beads from one side whittling the top rods value ben stupidhe slid the last bead to zero hed been an economic soldier of value helping with the business deals putting money into hectors pocket a workaholic easy to exploit because he had no life of his own to live since emily died hed been useful until now he wasnt just like every other person he hurried to the room where teach slept handcuffed to a bed he kicked the side of the bed and she awoke with a jolt up he said i want to know where theyre hiding who pilgrim i gave you every cellar account every safe house we have i gave you everything you kept barker near an airport hub in dallas same with de la pena in chicago with green in denver its your pattern your method pilgrim would copy it here if he wanted a hideyhole then its his and not mine and i dont know about it he put his face close to her her breath was sour he hadnt permitted her the dignity of a toothbrush dallas is close to his kid teach didnt flinch he doesnt have a kid yes he does tamara choate her names tamara dawson now her new stepdad adopted her no reason not to what with her good old dad dead and all shes fourteen she lives in tyler eighty miles east of dallas thats why you give old pilgrim all the jobs in this corner of the country lets him swing by and goggle his kid from a distance i dont wonder if he might have a place nearby so spying on her is easier gives him a pillow to lay his head after a job she shook her head he has no children he slapped her hard tell me where hes hiding or im going to have jackie pay miss tamara and her mommy a call he leaned down to her dont make the mans daughter pay her lip bled i cant tell you what i dont know she gave him a look he didnt like the fear ebbing pure hatred firing into her soft pale eyes give me his address or ill encourage jackie to spend quality time with his daughter he stroked her chin with his fingertip i like kids dont want to hurt them but if you dont help me ill hurt her and shell never ever be the same i wont kill her ill leave her alive it will be the worse of the two fates she gave no answer her bowed head hanging over her lap as though lost in prayer are you holding out hope that pilgrims going to rescue you give it up she raised her head how many dead men you got he went to the door favoring her with a remorseful sigh jackie come in here for a minute please jackie stepped inside his face was terrible the bruising from his broken nose the bandages crossing his face hector touched jackies jaw if youre a fourteenyearold girl and you wake up in the middle of the night to find that face above youno offense jackieyoure going to piss yourself in sheer terror he turned to jackie pilgrims got a fourteenyearold sweetie pie of a daughter im going to give her to you tell teach here what youd do to her dont leave out any details jackie glanced at him reading the other mans need for calculated savagery then smiled and sat on the edge of teachs bed i dont normally contemplate hurting girls but pilgrims daughter wow okay id have to get inventive id start with giving her a fierce poking id let her feel a bit of good before she felt no more pleasure ever again teach didnt flinch jackie pulled the knife from its leg sheath let me tell you some of the ways my da got the proddy bastards and the traitors in belfast to talk when they were sure they wouldnt see theyd get brought down to his basement for a cup of tea and a nice long chat if the chat went bad da would get out the knives teach didnt move jackie thought if he leaned forward and kissed her hed feel the fear in her lips but see itd be worse for pilgrims girl back in belfast when the stupid men started talking my da stopped cutting their faces and their privates the knifes work was done but i dont want her to talk theres nothing she can tell me to save herself he turned the knife and its glint caught the dim light above her bed i only want her to hurt jackie began a recitation that chilled teachs blood painted horrors in her mind so that she flinched from his soft whisper but still she shook her head so jackie started to demonstrate khaleds reportnew orleans on sunday we start our work if i have not ruined everything i am terrified because i fear i have jeopardized all my training all my sacrifice i was unprepared for random chance today i walked through the french quarter on one of my exercises trying to determine who is following me and how i can lose them in the crowds i am sure that the crowds are smaller than normal since katrina but the streets still throng here with happy americans hazed on their crimson hurricanes of liquor and fruit juice or their canned beers i entered my own haze today halfway through my exercise with my trainers i saw someone i know from home in beirut a girl named roula a cousin of a good friend i remember hearing that she was studying architecture at rice university in houston one would hope she would be hard at her studies but no here she is walking with a trio of blond american girls looking very american herself in jeans and a sky blue polo shirt and a set of bangle bracelets she is lovely walking with these american beauties tucking a lock of her dark hair behind her ear i glance at her twice once in shock and the second time to be sure it is her i turn my head but she has sensed my stare and she turns she wont recognize me i hope and i duck my head and turn away abruptly to study a display of junky tshirts for tourists in a store window khaled i hear her voice call rising in surprise at the end no i turn and start to walk away and then she says it again loudly so i stop glance back at her she smiles at me in recognition khaled hello how are you fine i say how are you roula what are you doing here the words all feel woolly in my mouth im visiting for the weekend with school friends she gestures back at the american beauties who look at me and through me a skinny arab boy with the awkwardness of an engineering student and therefore of minimal interest to them ah i say my watchersi can see them now they dont even try to hide from meare watching me talk to this girl i wonder what that will mean for her i have an urge to run what are you doing here i am supposed to be in switzerland studying finance ah well my advisor at my schoolim at the university of genevais giving a speech at tulane and i came with him the explanation rings hollow to me but i force a smile behind it and gesture at the window full of junky tshirts you caught me in an unacademic moment roula laughs well how long are you in town i leave sunday so do we and then of course in the manner of my people she begins to inquire about my mother my cousinsshe knows my brothers and my father are dead and she says nothing of them i answer quickly ask after her own family then take refuge in consulting my watch well this was a lovely surprise roula but i must get back to the campus i didnt give myself enough time to explore i tender an awkward grin she gives me a bright smile well it was nice to see you khaled good to see you too i turn and walk away and i dont look back my outing my training run is ruined two blocks further i risk a glance there were two trackers following me and now there is only the one the other tracker is of course now shadowing roula i am brought back to the house questioned thoroughly i explain she is a friend from home studying architecture in america that she is harmless but you are not supposed to be here the masters say to me what if she mentions to her family to her friends that she saw you here i gave her a story consistent with my cover i said and they laugh not because it is funny i keep hoping they will tell me this is a test that roula is part of the organization but they give no such reassurance what should i have done i say miserable you dont talk to her you walk away you get away from her but she knew it was me to run would increase her suspicion but she would never be sure it was you you spoke with her she knows too much coldness touches my heart this is not how it is supposed to be i have come here to learn how to do good work how to kill those who must die not innocents like roula what will happen i finally say my masters exchange a glance her familys phones in beirut will be tapped their email and physical mail will be monitored we will listen and see if she mentions seeing you here if she does not fine if she does well then we shall see this is on your head thoughlet it be a lesson you never forget as though i was a prankster schoolboy fresh from a whipping i am not sure i believe them i am sick with fear they will have roula killed tonight i return at their orders to my room i lie on my bed and study the ceiling i feel they are watching me this is a test and i am failing the door opens i sit up one of the masters the one called mr night enters and closes the door behind me are you going to kill her i ask in a rush no he says you must think us rather impulsive or cruel im a realist about our work mr night nods at me but if necessary someone will speak to her impress upon her forcefully the need for silence your presence here must be kept secret i swallow forcefully can cover many options but if he says she will not be killed i believe him my life is in the hands of these people i have to trust them i understand if she is unable to keep her silence he shrugs she will i assure him she is a very sensible girl from a good family perhaps someone in her family could be recruited as well perhaps he clears his throat i need to know if youre truly ready for the job khaled it is painful for me to record his words but in fairness i must i am i am please i have a sudden fear that i might now be expendable but they need us there are so few of us willing to do the work to take the enormous risks i had already risked so much in coming forward in making it here he studies me for a long while saying nothing and i compose myself and dont plead my case further i have to be strong now you are still one of us here is your assignment i nearly collapse in relief but i do not let emotion cross my face i read the file they hand me see what my first battle in the war will be i am more eager than ever to do my job they release me from my room i drive over to the shooting range and start putting bullets into the targets each squeeze of the trigger a relief dawn crept in through the heavy yellowed curtains as though reluctant to bring brightness to the darkened rooms ben awoke on the futon he could feel the hump of the gun under his pillow and he pulled his hand back from it with a jolt his arm ached hed slept far heavier than hed thought possible pilgrim was awake and brewing coffee standing over the sink staring into space hey ben said no answer youre not a morning person ben said we should have gone after hector last night sleep was the last thing unclench the fist hector knows i am questioning his loyalty since i didnt call him back and im betting he knows about your visit to the mckeen office now not hearing from us is keeping him off balance i cant just abandon teach you abandon her if you get killed in a pointless attempt to save her ben stood up from the futon we take the fight back to him but we act like subtle knives not cannons that roar and attract a lot of noise this isnt how i roll pilgrim said you dont know what were up against you wouldnt even know who your enemy is if it wasnt for me so maybe you can permanently shelve the talkingdowntome crap because its gotten really old pilgrim set his coffee cup down fine what do you suggest hectors strength and his weakness are his business its what gives him power but its also what hes most fearful of losing i helped him build it up i can tear it down you mean you can expose his dirty laundry its not as much dirty as it is questionable what i can do is get in touch with every one of his contacts at the various agencies and imply that hes going to be under investigation very soon youre a fugitive and lacking in the credibility department pilgrim said i say im hiding from his security forces ben helped himself to coffee black and strong we launch a twopronged attack start smearing hector with the people in government who matter politicians run from a stink we put the stink on him second we contact agent vochek delia moon gave me her number we cut a deal with her useless if they want us dead i dont believe she wants you dead leashed maybe what will help us is that you did necessary work ordered by the government correction necessary as decided by a small and secret group and that group might be her target far more than you vochek might cut you a really good offer to come in you know more dirty laundry about the government than i ever will about hector i still say we face hector down youve already hurt him badly youve made him desperate you wiped out hectors teams you killed his sniper hell have beefed up compound security just because he lost two men to supposed terrorists hell virtually have an army on his property no way will you get to his house we dont even know thats where he has teach fine i see your point pilgrim said this as though it caused physical pain so what do we say to vochek dont freak at my idea ben took a deep breath the cellars done adam reynolds already found you its just a matter of time before homeland finds the other cellar agents you just have to decide whether you surrender peacefully and cooperate or not give them details about your jobs your results theyll go easier on you i joined the cellar to avoid jail i cant go back into a prison he parted the curtain slightly surveyed the lot you understand that strategic initiatives cure for us might be a bullet in the head i dont believe vochek would be party to murder youve been fooled by sam hector for years so pardon me if i question your judgment of character she wasnt comfortable with kidwell leaning so hard on me says something about her as a person she was playing the good cop role fine we play good cop by giving them something we cant fight hector not on his own turf we cant go to the police whatever is going down tomorrow in new orleans if its bad if we step forward now with the information get it to homeland we can cut a deal but we have no idea whats happening help vochek put all the pieces together and then youre a good guy shell just arrest us i know this is a different approach for you but please lets try it we give vochek ammunition everything you know about the cellar everything we both know about hector both in his business and in his days in the cia theres a relationship there and if pilgrim shook his head vocheks group hired hector someone in that group could smother the information yes its a risk but were going to have to meet with her facetoface see if we can convince her you did save her life not on purpose take the credit we need it ben this course of action sounds sane to you it sounds crazy to me i just want to get a gun and kill hector problem solved doing it my way makes it a lot more likely that we survive ben stepped forward leaned on the cracked formica bar that divided the kitchen from the tiny dining space jackie lynch was in league with the people that killed kidwell homelands going to want jackies head on a plate and hes driving a car that ties him to hector they therefore will want hectors head on a plate if theres an alliance between them we destroy it isolate him you should call vochek no ben shook his head you will i have poor phone manners youre the one with the information she wants but youre going to meet her by yourself because she may set a trap and she cant catch us both one of us has to stay free if the meeting goes bad pilgrim nodded shes not catching me dont worry he rubbed his forehead ill call her he shook his head at ben no offense but i really am not getting used to having a partner hopefully its not for much longer ben said vochek glanced at the clockjust past nine on saturday morningand studied the photos of the dead men the investigators on kidwells murder operating out of the homeland security office in houston sent her the latest on the dead arab gunmen the men had been identified they were all from the southern suburbs of beirut two of the men were brothers two more were their cousins and all were tied to a gang that ran drugs into beirut and did muscle work when hired she remembered a truism shed read about the middle east in a book by former cia agent robert baer you dont recruit individuals you recruit families tribes clans here was a perfect example but the one with dyed blond hair the other with two piercings in his earthese men did not strike her as typical fundamentalists she called one of the homeland investigators in houston let him complain about working with the fbi for three minutes then she said but these guys dont seem like religious extremist types oh i dont think the murads are prayerful boys theyve always been hired help she heard a shuffle of paper on the investigators desk the murads all flew in via paris then miami staggered over five days tickets paid for in cash in beirut but they all stayed together at a hotel in miami before they flew into austin the morning of the attack he coughed a smokers hack heres the sticky part back in the s papa murad the head of the clan was eyes and ears for the cia interesting yeah when we were hunting the embassy bombers he was an informant not a great one but he was willing to point a few fingers for a price he dropped off the agency payroll about a decade ago one of his sons got tangled up with a blood of fire cell in lebanon did some forhire bombing work for them got murdered a few months back so the murads have played both sides yes but you wouldnt know it to hear the cia they say they dont have a file on the murads which beggars belief theyve been part of the beirut underworld for two generations my sources are two retired cia field officers and mrs murad you talked with her shes not speaking publicly of course and she could be trying to defend her familys honor say theyre not terrorists but frankly its more dangerous for her to link her family to the cia than to hezbollah she said her husband mentioned hed gotten a call from an old friend big money for a favor whos the old friend she says he was an englishman her husband knew years ago called the dragon of course the cia denies that they know or have known anyone by that code name in fact the cia is no longer talking to me the dragon she said of course theyre putting distance and denying they know anything former hirelings of theirs attacking a homeland office on american soil its a pr nightmare they wont touch it former cia informants and now a mysterious englishman from the murads cia days why does someone hire a gang from lebanon you could just as easily find gunmen closer to home quit asking hardtoanswer questions she tapped her finger on the table they attacked an office that wasnt even open yet very low payback for the effort put forth lets say they get caught or killed arab gunmen attacking a homeland office it creates a different image in the media that sounds like a terrorism attack but this wasnt probably not she heard the investigator shuffling another file so what were they after they could have taken kidwell if they wanted a homeland officer and if they wanted ben forsberg why what does he know why is he valuable to them i dont know ill keep digging maybe the only want was wanting everyone dead it still didnt tell her why she thanked him and hung up she wanted to sleepshe had gotten precious little of it last nightbut she couldnt shut her mind down she called margaret pritchard did you find out about sam hector if he was cia she asked ive got feelers out dont get your hopes up for a speedy answer she sounded uninterested feelers impatience churned in her chest pardon me margaret but cant you just call the cia director and ask please if he was cia deep cover they arent going to tell me they will if you tell them hes a suspect in a homeland agents death sam hector is hardly a suspect she told pritchard about the muradcia connection what mrs murad had said about a man called the dragon i dont care about an idiot called the dragon he sounds like an extra from a bruce lee film i care about randall choate choate and this dragon are both excia hector is allegedly excia we need to see if theyre connected you would make me proud if you would follow a straight line joanna it sounded like a compliment shed wish her mother would make instead of complaining you hired hector to give us logistical and security support in hunting down the offthebook operations but could he have his own agenda in finding these groups he could be using us to piggyback for his own purposes pritchard made a dismissive huff he could hardly plan for me hiring him maybe he didnt plan until you hired him tick tick tick the clock on the wall measured the wrath of pritchard building maybe she knows she made a mistake in hiring hector and she doesnt want to admit it it could be fatal for her career vochek thought pritchard said he would hardly risk a lucrative business screwing up a government operation a businessman will do anything if he thinks the risk is worth the payoff who told you we had to go after the offthebooks groups thats classified but my directions came from a very senior person and hector has millions in contracts with the government he knows every senior person youre making a presumptive jump then test my theory find out about hector what are you afraid of remember we work in a hierarchy agent vochek pritchard said coldly but if it will be of help to you ill tug a bit harder on my fishing lines pritchard hung up youre stalling vochek thought she could hear it in pritchards tone so either pritchard knew more about hector than she admitted and didnt want vochek to know orfar more frighteningpritchard didnt know about hectors background and she had been played by him and was refusing to see that shed been played the phone rang ah hector hopefully she answered her cell frowning at the numberblocked readout on the screen this is vochek i hope you didnt have a headache shock raced through her like steam through a pipe she knew the voice instantly the man at the hotel who had knocked her out locked her in the closet yes hello i hope the headaches past nearly id like to talk to you randall her own voice sounded thin to her in the stillness of the room randall choate is still dead at least until you and i come to an agreement what are your terms sam hector goes down silence for ten long seconds excuse me hector hired the gunmen that killed your partner one of his people killed delia moon and tried to kill ben yesterday we stole the guys car from him and its registered to a shadow company thats connected to hector i need details youll get them when we meet you come alone anyone else is there i run i dont look back homeland gets nothing and youre still hooked at the hip to a killer like sam hector im not sure i feel comfortable coming alone you hit me in the head you tried to break my neck with a baton lets forgive and forget she could almost hear the smile in his voice if i wanted you dead youdve been dead in austin im still waiting for the thankyou for saving your life by sticking you in that closet she swallowed thank you randall soccer fields off plano parkway noon come alone if i get a sense that youve brought company im smoke ben forsberg is he all right ben is okay then she heard regret tinge pilgrims words so you knowben is entirely innocent he did not hire nicky lynch i used his identity without his knowledge but hectors tried to kill ben multiple times in the past two days so bens shy right now one more thing for you yes i dont have details but if youve got any hot leads about a threat in new orleans take it seriously thats my boy scout moment new orleans yes okay randall yes i want to help you come in i dont want you or ben hurt words are cheap see you at noon he hung up well pilgrims offer could be genuine or it could be a trap protocol demanded that she inform her superior she hesitated she was not by nature a rulebender but she knew pritchard pritchard would demand backup for vochek and the immediate capture of pilgrim they would have an actual rogue cia agenttied to an actual dirty dog groupin their custody of course she might talk him into surrendering but capture would guarantee he would be in their grasp and new orleanswhat did that mean she had no idea if a threat had been identified against the city it was a lead she couldnt keep to herself it would be grossly irresponsible decision made she called pritchard and explained the conversation ill contact the new orleans office see if they have a hot situation working pritchard said of course it will be a bit difficult to attribute this warning to a man whos been presumed dead for a decade are you willing to meet with him alone pritchard asked yes im not willing to risk it if he wont surrender to you then i want him followed hell spot a tail not our people im calling secret service in dallas not their jurisdiction ah but he said he stole ben forsbergs good name identity theft and financial fraud are under secret services purview please let me handle this alone we already lost kidwell we have no idea of what this man is capable of and the things he said about sam hector the long silence returned i want to see the evidence that he has should we put working with hector on hold on this mans word please on the phone vochek could hear the tap of pritchards nail against the desk evidence joanna lets find the meat on the bone first teach broke at tenthirty saturday morning she gave them the name of the street and the apartment numbershe had known about them for years shortly after pilgrim got the property under a false name and let him think she knew nothing jackie cleaned off the knifenot too much blood the cuts had been shallow and strategicand patted her on the cheek lovely help youve given us youve saved that girl a bad few hours now she can die an old lady hector gave her a cloth to sponge her face her mouth her legs she trembled and he wondered if it was more from rage than fear lets go shes coming with us hector said us jackie asked you and me were taking pilgrim out i can handle it without help jackie felt reinvigorated from the night hed gotten teach to talk a necessary job done right his father would have been proud of him i need to get back into the field i thought you just supervised every manager should get his hands dirty now and then hector said why bring teach with us lock her up here i have a lot of guards here and i dont want to leave her behind where she might be discovered by my people a pause sure jackie said with a nod and a half smile ill pull the car up close to the house get her ready i just need to get one thing before we go in case ben is there ben tapped the keys on pilgrims laptop he wrote a detailed report of every contract hed helped sam hector win as far as he knew nothing in the deals was illegalbut certainly elements of the contracts might raise watchdog eyebrows in terms of timing lack of competition or inexact wording that might favor hector more than other vendors most businesses in the real world hoped to make a profit hector global worked a guaranteed profit sometimes up to percent into every deal with the government charges that cost the company eighteen dollars were billed to the government at eighty a number of contracts had been virtually nobid hectors only invited competitors were firms that were too small actually to do the work rendering the competition moot there had been delays in services rendered with no delay in payment ben put his face in his hands and took a long breath hed helped create this monster and nowwith contracts imperiled with funding drying upwhat would the monster do to survive his work and smart counsel had helped sam hector win deals made hector richer and more powerful with a grasping reach into every agency that surpassed that of senior elected officials pilgrim came into the room loading a clip into his gun im leaving i want to scope out the site thoroughly before i meet her i hope you come back ben said if i dont then ill find a way to bring him down i would rather eliminate him with a bullet than a spreadsheet whatever works ben stood good luck he offered pilgrim his hand and pilgrim shook it he left without another word ben sat down to finish his braindump on the laptop he wrote every conversation he could remember with hector regarding work for homeland writing was peace a return to normalcy from the chaos of the past two days but his shot arm began to ache with the typing now he just needed to compile a group of people to send it torepresentatives and senators and state and defense officials who didnt much care for the contracting businessand convince them to take him seriously since he was currently a fugitive that would be difficult he got up went to the kitchen got a glass of water needing to stretch his legs he wanted to think pilgrims sketchbook lay on the counter a clear sign that he expected to return ben picked it up he was tempted to page through the drawings again but it felt like a violation but he didnt like leaving it where it might be forgotten if he had to leave quickly he stuck the small black book in his shirt pocket he took his water and went to the window the day had grown cloudy gray skies the color of worn chains he scanned the parking lot nothing odd the construction crews werent working this saturday on the massive construction next door he heard the soft calming whisper of the wind as he closed the curtain and turned away from the window a lincoln navigator turned into the lot he glanced at his watch pilgrim should be at the soccer fields by now he decided to write down the list of people who were hectors political enemies and then find internet access so he could start emailing them he finished his water refilled the cup a sound from the front door a scrape the lock clicked being forced and then the door was open jackie entering gun out in front of him sweeping the room finding ben hands on head and get down jackie ordered oh this is going to be good man seriously ben obeyed his gun was still under his pillow on the futon no way to get to it the door slammed closed he kept his face to the gritty kitchen tile he heard rapid movement through the apartment jackie seeing if pilgrim lay in wait in the bedroom he started to crawl for the futon and then jackie was back in the bedroom doorway gun aimed at him i dont get to rough your face up jackie said but im still going to hurt you he leaned down and pulled the cell phone from bens pants pocket tucked it into his dark jacket he was dressed in black with black cowboy boots his face was braced with a nose guard and bandages clear jackie called to the other side of the door sam hector stepped inside holding a woman in front of him she was fiftyish graying hair a generous mouth haunted blue eyes sam ben started sams smile was a crooked slash of arrogance jackie hauled ben up by his shirt shoved him to the living room floor now the futon was four feet away from him the pillow hiding the gun was at the opposite end the womanteach he presumedsat on a chair pushed there by hector hector stepped between him and the futon he held a gun aimed at the floor it would have been easier if you came to my house like i asked the customers always right ben i hate being wrong ben said and i was wrong about you hector gave a twitch of a shrug youve been wrong about a great deal old friend im not your friend ben said true and youre not going to grow old like adam and delia and your own guards down in austin youre a murderer hector raised a hand waved his fingers my hands are clean wheres your new friend gone for good give him his answers jackie yanked ben up from the floor delivered a savage blow to the face that slammed bens head into the wall ben felt a tooth loosen blood oozed from his nose the tip of the knife skimmed down to his stomach or im playing cutthedick with you a trickle of blood from his nose tickled bens lip what did i ever do to you sam except make your sorry ass richer you know i loathe people who delay where is pilgrim whens he coming back hes not coming back jackie check the laptop see what he was doing hector said jackie went to the laptop opened the recent documents menu item writing a report about you and your contracts not very nice one paints you a real bastard it does delete it see if theres anything else interesting on the hard drive then wipe it clean hector tried the smile again you have been an unpleasant surprise ben seriously i knew you had a brain but i didnt suspect the spine he eased down in front of ben where did pilgrim go ben i wont let jackie play with his knife on you if you tell me every time death loomed in the past two days ben had felt terror touch his bones adrenaline igniting his blood but nowthe knowledge of death no escape herean odd calm gripped him he had to protect pilgrim no matter what they did to him with knife or gun the realization settled him the lie was easy he went to your house to find teach hectors facethe mask that had fooled ben for yearsbetrayed no reaction then ben saw the barest twitch at the corner of sam hectors mouth a whisper of rage hes not that stupid neither are you delay him how do you pretend to be a normal human being when youre so clearly not sam i trusted you i was your friend basic math people are either help or hindrance he slid a sealed envelope from his jacket tossed it on bens lap if you dont want to cooperate ben so be it ill show my cards im not interested you are open it ben tore open the envelope pulled a set of photos free the images hit him like a giants fist crushing his lungs flattening every thought in his brain emily photographed with a telescopic lens standing in the kitchen window in the maui house in the moments before she died next photo the same next photo her clicking off the phone looking pensive almost looking up at the camera a frown on her face then a photo of the kitchen window a bullet hole marring the glass emily sprawled on the tiles the photos spilled from his hands onto the floor his throat thickened his chest tightened why hector laughed why did you why you mean who hector laughed the cat batting the dying mouse you goddamned murdering bastard ben yelled but then teach bolted from the floor threw herself at hector she closed a hard grip on his throatben saw the astonishment in hectors eyesand ben jumped up grabbing for hectors gun hector wrenched free from them both kicked ben in the face sent him sprawling hector powered his pistol into teachs stomach and fired teach collapsed eyes open mouth clenched ben got up again and hector slammed the pistol into bens face kicked him in the stomach to the carpet lying on the floor bens eyes locked on teachs she blinked once twice stopped tried to speak jackie hector watched teach the gun steady on ben when she stopped breathing he prodded her with the foot dump her ass in the bedroom jackie picked up teachs body and carried her into the bedroom ben crawled to the futon he could hardly breathe the gun the pillow his only chance to get away and to kill the son of a bitch i suppose its rude to point out ive taken everything from you hector said your wife your good name your business your dignity why why make the smug murdering bastard believe hed broken ben he got a hand under the pillow crouching as though he feared a kick or a blow from hector he shivered spat blood emily she had changed him in life and now that he knew the truth of her death he felt changed again determination filled him like an ache in his bones not a moments hesitation youre going to tell me where pilgrim is ben because i know you youre weak youll trade me the information for an easy death you want to look under teachs clothes see the cuts his fingers touched the gun hector would shoot him as soon as he drew it and even if he stood his ground and managed to kill or wound hector jackie would attack him from the other room the odds were dismal but otherwise they would kill him and wait for pilgrim to return death was doing nothing he thought of pilgrims words sometimes the smartest move in a fight is to retreat delia told me all about new orleans ben said plainly and for a moment surprise slackened the clench in hectors face ben flung the pillow straight at hectors head and swung up the gun that lay underneath it the feathers exploded from the pillow as hector fired a shot through its center but ben emptied the clip in hectors direction as he ran for the window hector threw himself backward and behind the kitchen counter for cover bens spray of shots pocked the counter the wall punctured the refrigerator as he ran the ten feet hector rose to return fire but ben hit the window the closed dusty curtains caught ben as he jumped through the glass the heavy fabric protecting him from the jagged shards his momentum carried him onto the landing stopping or taking the time for the stairs meant death and he rolled without hesitation slid himself under the metal railing of the walkway dropped one floor to the grass below the apartment stood at a corner and if he ran to his right hed be wide open they could shoot him from the second floor so he ducked under the walkway ran in the opposite direction hit the corner he could hear their footsteps starting to barrel down the stairs try to do what they dont expect he turned a second corner the chain link dividing the complex from the neighboring construction was just ahead if he was lucky theyd decide he was still running north when he was backtracking south on the opposite side of the building ben went over the fence ignoring the barbed wire that tore at his arms his khakis there jackies voice from the parking lot to his right hed been spotted ben hit the sand and ran into the maze of the construction the building was ushaped as it faced the street its unfinished sides open to the elements now he looked back hector was at the navigators wheel plowing through a gate on the side of the fence jackie running behind the suv drawing his pistol ben dodged wheelbarrows stacks of drywall an idle forklift the navigator roared behind him he dodged to the left and jackie behind the navigator fired it was either get shot or be run down he kept going straight the suv always between him and jackie and running through piled debris where the navigator couldnt go supposedly he glanced behind him and the navigator plowed through the construction junk sawhorses and broken drywall flying ten feet behind him ben jumped up onto the foundation and headed for an interior wall that was already erected he needed cover he went around the wall as gunfire hit it with a low vicious whistle he heard the navigator screech to a buckling stop then boot heels hitting the concrete he exited the other side of the shella clear path all the way to the next chainlink fence on the opposite side of the lot more than enough room for hector or jackie to shoot him but there was nowhere else to go you cant outrun him forever and your gun is empty hed counted the bullets like pilgrim taught him and the news wasnt good he ran and louder than his own panting he heard the pounding of footsteps behind him several yards beyond the chain link he saw a knot of men and women waiting in the shelter of a dallas area rapid transit bus station he launched himself onto the fence using a pole to haul himself upward now he spotted a ditch breaking the land between the site and the bus stop he scrabbled over the fence went head over heels and the shots boomed one hitting his shoea violent jerk rocked his footanother shot hitting his chest like a hard kick a third shot nailed the metal pole that lay against his stomach it thrummed from the force as though an invisible man kicked it ben fell headfirst stayed low and rolled went into the ditch water and mud runoff from the site smeared the bottom ben sucked breath into his lungs staggered to his feet heard a man saying what the hell a woman screamed and yelled in spanish gunshots i heard gunshots ben ran down the ditch staying low bending low to crawl through a drainage section that barreled under the street the crowdsomeone would be calling the police please god he hoped he eased out of the opposite end of the drain and clambered up the side of the gulley he found himself in a vacant lot with a large sign announcing more office space soon to come no sign of hector they might have fled as soon as they saw witnesses hector would not want anyone identifying him hector would be running ben groped for his cell phone gone he remembered jackie had taken it blood welled from the laces of his running shoes the pain in his chest throbbed and he probed his flesh halfafraid to find a bullet hole his chest ached to the bone as though it had taken a hammers blow a tear in his shirt pocket he found a hard rectangle beneath the hole pilgrims small sketchbook with the drawings of the young girl wore a bullet embedded in the leather cover he had to find pilgrim but he had to get off the streets he was bloodied and muddied and memorable he ran toward a convenience store and the alley behind it it was a surprise to learn that homeless people had cell phones a group of three men stood behind the store they stopped talking giving ben a suspicious glare as he approached them excuse me ben said is there a pay phone nearby naw one of the men said what happened to you i fell into a ditch hurt my foot all three men looked down and inspected his foot blood oozed from the sock church down the street they give you some ice for that one man said ice and a prayer a second man laughed who you need to call friend hell come get me ben glanced over his shoulder no sign of pursuit theyd have risked being seen if theyd lingered with the crowd at the bus station looking for them it didnt mean that they wouldnt be combing the area looking for him youre the man on the front page the first man said ben froze the three men studied him yeah the second man said we stay informed aint got much else to do but look at the paper the third man said is there a reward the first man asked the other two moved in a circle cutting off bens lines of retreat please please dont report me he was begging for a break from people whod either never had one or never made the most of one theyd gotten im innocent please im trying to stop the people who killed my wife the three men looked at each other like on the fugitive one asked ben nodded if theres a reward copsll figure out a way not to pay us thats for damn sure the first man said i dont want to be on tv either familys always looking for me here the second man dipped in his pocket pulled out a bulky phone you can use mine but no more than one minute prepaid got mine at walmart and nothing personal but i hold the phone so you dont run off his foots bleeding he runs its a short race the first man said and laughed at his own wit the man held the phone and stunned ben dialed the number then the man moved the phone to bens ear speak up clear mr fugitive its not the bestquality sound the threat of rain hadnt kept the soccer fields empty dozens of families and kids in varying shades of uniforms and ranging from ages four to ten wandered between the rectangles of green mothers fathers and siblings stood on the sidelines chatting among themselves or calling out sweetened encouragement to the players coaches clapped and frowned high school kids serving as referees blew whistles and acted supremely bored dads cheered their daughters pilgrim knew tamara played soccer but hed never worked up the nerve to watch a game from a distance the risk was too great why did he choose this place filled with fathers and daughters salt in the wound rubbed there himself pilgrim moved through the crowd he was dressed in a phone repairmans shirt and baseball cap a treasure from his cache and he stayed on the edge of the crowd he spotted two people watching him in the first five minutes a soccer mom who didnt seem to know the other moms on her side of the field standing a bit apart arms crossed her eyes not fixed on the glorious play of a child but instead scanning the crowd a bit too often there was another a compactly built young man in a referees shirt but the shirt was untucked and hanging loose over long pants might be a gun there he was no bigger than the teenaged refs but his face was that of an older man he kept glancing around at the other games neither approached him they wanted him to talk to vochek probably they would try to take him after they talked when he left but she had broken her promise or a superior had overruled her stupid a group of sixyearold boys had finished their match and their obligatory juice box and snack and they and their parents walked as a herd he stayed close among them a cell phone at his ear pretending to be deep in conversation he walked into the parking lot with them and glanced back the watchers were still in place and he didnt make anyone else following him he ducked into his car and didnt bother backing up he barreled forward over the curb and into the grass and shot out onto the road he had preprogrammed vocheks cell number into his phone he pressed the button i said come alone he said a sigh i wanted to she said got vetoed at least she was smart enough not to deny the obvious im sorry he said but i cant deal if you break agreements i can offer you a deal how about if you come and talk to me and my boss i must decline your kind invitation im sorry youve bruised my trust she was quiet for a moment and her voice softened randall i know you have a daughter tamara i could make it so you can see tamara again a chill slipped into his chest like a knife you stay the hell away from my kid and my exwife i dont mean them harm im trying to give you what you want you dont know what i want vochek then you tell me what you want to talk with someone with the actual power to negotiate with me goodbye wait please i need to know whats going down in new orleans i need to know too goodbye vochek he hung up and did an immediate uturn pulled into a jack in the box parking lot and waited five minutes later he saw her in a ford sedan pull past two other cars both fords stayed close to her he pulled out after them tailing in plano was both easy and challenging the roads tended to be straight shots but traffic was heavyit was a suburb of a quarter million peopleand drivers wove in and out of lanes for every inch of advantage the trick was to stay close not too close and not lose them in the quickly changing lights without showing yourself the three cars headed back toward a shopping mall then turned into a neighborhood across the street pilgrim was surprised to see a runway bisecting the neighborhood a series of hangars with an array of private planes sheltering under the tin roofs he uturned hard saw the cars stop in front of one of the houses found you he thought what an interesting place for a safe house with an airport built right in at the shopping center he located a place to perch where he could still see the house she and her colleagues would go inside she would call her boss report failure perhaps plead for another chance interesting they didnt go back to an office vochek ben had said was based in houston he wondered if her colleagues were local if they were and they left soon his phone buzzed he didnt recognize the number calling he clicked it on yes its ben yes i need help explain im six blocks from the apartment slight accident hurt my foot hector came over and he got wild you know how he is are you okay does he have you im fine and no he doesnt he knew ben wouldnt betray him even if hector was holding a gun to his head right now he knew it with a clarity that cut through a momentary doubt im at the plano palisades shopping center across from the plano air ranch park do you have money in your wallet yes get a cab in dallas they dont exactly wander the streets looking for fares ben give me your address ill call a cab for you ill cover the fare im north of the nordstroms edge of the lot okay ben sounded like he might faint you all right i am beyond sorry dread colored bens voice you were entirely right about what i have to go my times and the phone went dead well if he was wrong about ben and hector had just found his location let hector come hed just wait shoot hector and jackie in the knees drag them to vocheks safe house like a cat bringing torn dead birds as trophies an hour later the cab pulled up pilgrim got out of the volvo and unfolded bills for the cabbie ben got in the passenger side eased his shoe off not looking at pilgrim tell me what happened pilgrim leaned down inspecting the foot i have bad news ben said pilgrim leaned back teach is dead pilgrim said tell me his expression stayed like stone as ben explained she died trying to help me pilgrims mouth contorted he got out of the car stood by the door leaned his head against his arm on the cars roof ben got out on the opposite side of the car faced him over the cars roof pilgrim man im sorry the traffic hummed by and kept them in companionable silence for a few moments pilgrim lifted his head he killed her because he doesnt need her anymore he has complete control of the cellar hes won no were still alive we can fight him we have to he killed emily he had photos of her photos taken of her right before and after she was killed pilgrims face paled he shook his head he seemed to wait a few moments for his voice to return ah god ben i was an idioti defended himi made him a goddamned fortune and he killed my wife where are the pictures i dont know they were on the floor i doubt hector headed back to the apartment to collect them pilgrim ran a hand along his mouth so the photos are still there with teachs body what the hell does that matter it may mislead the police pilgrim took a deep breath we got to keep moving forward let me see your foot im okay give me a job to freaking do all right he used the first aid kit in the car to doctor bens footthe bullet had slowed considerably in moving through the fake leather and the dense mesh leaving a wicked track parting a chunk of flesh from the foots top the bullet was stuck in the bloody sock between foot and shoe pilgrim thumbed the bullet onto the floorboards heres another one ben handed him the damaged sketchbook i put it in my pocket i didnt want you to lose it pilgrim plucked the bullet from the pages put the book in his pocket without a word without inspecting the damage to the pictures i dont have anything for the pain ben i dont need anything now what we talk with vochek he nodded toward the house only one car there now her sidekicks are gone lets go the safe house featured a porch camera and after the doorbell rang vochek frowned at the face on the screen she held a gun in her hand as she opened the door ben raised his hands and said im unarmed vochek gestured him inside and said wheres randall choate ben shrugged and stepped inside they heard a stifled cry and the sound of weight hitting the floor we mean you no harm but he wants to talk to you alone she hurried to the kitchen the homeland pilot who had been assigned to the safe house lay unconscious on the floor pilgrim craned his neck into the refrigerator he found a coke and popped the tab on the stove tomato soup bubbled ham sandwiches lay halfassembled on a cutting block pilgrim killed the heat under the soup messy boilover he said she aimed her gun on the floor you just assaulted a federal officer you all think a great deal of yourselves pilgrim said if hes such a federal badass i shouldnt be able to take him down with two love taps kindly point your firepower elsewhere you wanted to talk well here i am were even on your turf get your ass on the ground she yelled by the end of tonight either your career will be in the toilet or youll be running strategic initiatives your call she kept the gun aimed on him please listen to him ben said were on your side we have the information you need to do your job and were willing to share it but you have to help us in return you already know pilgrim is good at vanishing dont test him he told me you were innocent she didnt move her focus from pilgrim but im not sure i should believe someone whos been lying about being dead for ten years sam hector is the reason pilgrim had to vanish interested yet ben said after several more seconds she lowered the gun she knelt by the unconscious pilot checked his pulse ran a hand over his head hell have a headache nothing more hes out for another hour or so pilgrim said here well put him on the couch he and ben carried the pilot into the den set him on the cushions propped a pillow under his head ben waited for vochek to go back to the kitchen he dug in the pilots pocket removed the mans cell phone stuck it in his own pocket as he returned to the kitchen talk she stood again pilgrim poked a spoon in the tomato soup made a face ill tell you every dirty job ive done in the past ten years every job i know the cellars done the cellar thats the code name of the group of cia misfits and outcasts youve been chasing the cellar she sounded slightly dazed as though shed just woken from a dream ben guessed she hadnt even known the name of the group shed been hunting okay i spoke with my boss and im authorized to deal with you if youre willing to surrender pilgrim frowned at the word surrender as though it carried an unpleasant odor fine first ben gets granted total immunity hes innocent okay ill do my best your best will be outstanding agent vochek or i will shut up tighter than a misers fist pilgrim gave her a condensed version of the past days with special details about their escape from the homeland office in austin ben noticed pilgrim left out one critical bit of informationthe name of the hotel in new orleans that barker had phoned he figured that pilgrim thought it best to have a card to play in future negotiations so he said nothing vochek did not interrupt or ask questionsshe frowned shook her head a few times finally she said you can confirm sam hector was a cia assassin known as the dragon it will be my word against his unless the cia opens up about him the cia will face enormous political pressure to keep their mouths shut about hector hes made a lot of powerful friends ben said but thats not our first worry our first worry is new orleans i still dont understand what the threat is pilgrim leaned against the counter took a long drink of soda hes hijacked the cellar to do a dirty job work he couldnt use his regular security contractors to do either because they lack the training or because theyre decent guys and they would balk or ask too many questions the cellar agents believe that theyre taking orders from teach but we dont know what the job is im just going to bet its huge because hes taken huge risks to make it happen he cleared his throat ill help you stop the cellar from executing the job that means you stay free for now she said slowly ben said but we stick with you and we need your plane plane she blinked once as though shed seen his lips move but no word reached her ear this house sits on a runway ben said useless now she said you knocked out the pilot i can pilot pilgrim said we leave immediately before this guy wakes up just go to new orleans she shook her head no we need to call the cia call homeland ben shook his head hectors a contractor he does this for money your secret office at homeland paid him to find the cellar he did that but he didnt share the information with you did he no if he has my boss hasnt told me but now hes gone beyond that job hes taking the cellar over taking control of its missions he has control of a team of highly trained agents who think theyre doing good by doing what theyre told and if hes seized control of the cellar its possibleand he paused to let the words penetrateanother client has paid him to not your boss someone else has bought their own private cia the words hung between them like a curse and he has bought it by killing my friend and mentor pilgrim said he killed bens wife hes going to die not pay die vocheks face paled in the flicker of the kitchen fluorescents ben reached out and gently touched her arm hector just decided to use me and pilgrim because he needed to eliminate pilgrimwho knew him from his assassin daysand me because i would be an easy frame to be tied to a hired killer because of how my wife died he kills adam and pilgrim and because pilgrims been working with adam using my name i then look like im connected to them both it would come out after he was dead that pilgrim was an excia assassin hector would have made sure that information leaked then i take the fall for my wifes deathand maybe for adam and pilgrims deaths his plan got an unexpected boost when pilgrim left my business card on the snipers body i still dont understand why he targeted you ben if you were his friend two birds one stone the frame gives a solution to my wifes murder ben said and he must have wanted me out of the way as he was taking over the cellar because i know his business so well and weve given him business vochek closed her eyes for a moment my boss is hectors client margaret pritchard shes been running interference for hector all week then we cant trust her pilgrim said you cant trust her either i cant just let you take a homeland plane and go to new orleans agent vochek pilgrim said you want our cooperation thats what weve got to do decide or well decide for you with all due respect sam hector aimed his learjet down his private runway the compound fell away below him he set the planes course radioed into dallas airspace then he went silent slipped off the headphones and called a number on the planes phone he said i hope youre leaving some gumbo for me hardly i expected to hear from you before now margaret pritchard said listen theres been a break in the project im listening early this afternoon dallas police found a body in an apartment i have a source inside the department the body is that of a woman who i believe is connected to randall choate how do you know she is i dont but it might be worth it if your agent flashes choates picture to the landlord see if anyone recognizes him see if you can match the womans photo to any known excia including those missing in action my source at the force will send you complete info he cleared his throat he didnt need to go into detail about the additional findings in the police report the scattered photos of emily forsberg in the moments before her death and the description of ben forsberg given by the bus station witnesses better for her to hear it from an impartial source the only thing hed taken from the apartment was the laptop no reason to let the cops recover bens deleted report from the hard drive too many deaths she said we cant keep this under wraps wrong theyve been in hiding for years and thanks to adams work and my digging ive rooted out three of them in the past few days this woman could be the fourth this group is imploding under the pressure im putting on them he lied they know theyre close to being discovered choate might be trying to eliminate everyone who might talk i dont need dead bodies i need live ones that can tell us where the rest of this group is i know margaret he said were getting very close there is one problem what they know its me after them ben forsberg called me threatened me said they would smear me and my company with all sorts of allegations if i dont back down who knows what he might claim what he might say none of it would be true but i want you to silence the story as much as you can when you speak to the police chief in dallas and i know you will about this case having implications for homeland security you need to be sure she understands that im doing your work and any allegations against me are baseless she hesitated as though he were asking too much sam should i call the homeland secretary would that be easier of course not sam well handle it on this end are you coming straight here after you land no we have further leads to pursue but ill call you when im on the ground she thanked him and hung up jackie said you might have overplayed your hand there ben and pilgrim cant hurt us now ben fled a murder scene and left behind pictures of his dead wife no ones going to believe a word either of them say they know about new orleans he talked to delia moon hector didnt want to think about how ben had gotten him to let down his guard she knew no specifics and they cant get there in time we move tonight hector pointed the plane southeast toward new orleans the hard work was nearly done within a day he knew his future would be assured the pilot stirred awake voices jabbered in the kitchen two men vochek talking about taking the plane he could smell the tomato soup hed started to heat and he thought that his nose was the only part of his body working normally his neck ached he could barely see and his hands weighed heavy as though his flesh had converted to iron he groped his front pocket for his cell phonegone but he remembered the scattering of panic buttons in the safe house pressing the button would send a silent alarm to the homeland office in dallas and an alert to the plano police department he heard whoever was in the kitchen leaving and he staggered to his feet fell to his knees and started to crawl for the alarm button in the bookcase the plane was already fueled and loaded and pilgrim was going through the flight check when sirens approached pilgrim ben pointed over pilgrims shoulder we got to go now at the front entrance of the air park a police car screeched past the gate sirens flashing let me explain to them vochek reached for the door ben dont let her pilgrim kicked in the engines hurried the plane onto the runway we cant risk that you might not be persuasive the police car wheeled onto the grass around the runway as the jet coursed down the concrete hes going to pull onto the runway vochek yelled hes not suicidal pilgrim gunned the plane the plane hurtled toward the police car a second patrol car followed the first both onto the runway oh christ ben said the jet powered forward straight toward the cars which both lurched out of the jets way as time ran thin the planes wheels rose the cars fell away beneath them the officers didnt get out of the cars so i knew they wouldnt stay parked common sense pilgrim said your common sense gave me a goddamned heart attack ben said the planes radio began to squawk theyre going to order us to land ben said explain that were on a homeland security emergency your boss got juice pilgrim asked vochek nodded she can clear our path she can also stop us cold then she gets us cleared all the way to new orleans otherwise consider the possibility well be shot down she reached for the radio and asked air traffic for an emergency patch to homeland security three minutes later margaret pritchard was on the line agent vochek here with mr choate and mr forsberg please repeat mr choate and mr forsberg have surrendered and are in my protective custody understood we want to deal ms pritchard pilgrim said we can give your office everything it needs on the biggest covert group in the government but we get to fly to new orleans no problems thats what vochek wants and what we want ill make sure your way to new orleans is cleared pritchard said resignation in her tone thank you margaret vochek said one thing ben said quickly part of the deal you tell sam hector that weve surrendered to homeland security and are being questioned by you in a secure location the media and the dallas police dont know the silence went on so long they thought shed disconnected the line why do i need to feed him a lie pritchard asked ben gave vochek a pleading look we have some serious evidence against hector vochek said it would be best for now if he believes these two pose no threat to him i understand the line to pritchard clicked off and the only noise from the radio was traffic chatter directions for pilgrim to rise to a certain altitude will she lie to him ben asked i dont like that she didnt give us an assurance vochek said ben and vochek sitting in the back of the plane leaned back in their seats texas slowly unfolded beneath them as the sunlight began to die exhaustion claimed benhe hurt all over his bodyand he closed his eyes he heard vochek say why why what pilgrim asked why the cellar why was it created i dont know you joined it and you never asked ignorance has its advantages they didnt hire me for my brains dont she said you killed for the cia and then for the cellar yes more stole and spied than killed she went quiet and the hum of the engines became like a blanket ben thought of emily she hated flying never would have set foot in a small plane killed stole spied which did you do the most she asked does it matter pilgrim said you only killed the bad she said ben could feel the tension coming off her in waves one did not normally banter with a man who murdered i killed pilgrim said and its all bad i had to train myself not to vomit after i killed but i wont feel one second of regret for killing hector if hector is guilty vochek said and im not saying he is by any meansyou cant kill him we need him alive im not terribly interested in what you need im telling you whats going to happen youre not working for this cellar anymore i dont work for you either she poked ben with her finger open your eyes tell me why hector would risk this takeover of a covert group ben considered a man like hector only risks his business to save his business so whatever hes doing it has to be something that helps him maintain his bottom line hes had a lot of deals lost a lot of contracts shuttled away from him he told me a few days ago hes in the business of making fear go away so maybe he needs fear to be back in a big way they fell silent as texas passed beneath them and louisiana appeared ben closed his eyes exhausted dozed he dreamed of emily of the soft pressure of her hand in his peaceful and quiet he awoke with a jerk at pilgrims words theres another plane coming up fast on us ben pressed his face to the window its not a fighter jet he said its a private jet but bigger than ours vochek said theyre too close wait a sec pilgrim said and he pulled the earphone plug so the radio could be heard in the cabin this is pritchard the plane will escort you to new orleans lakefront airport upon arrival you will toss out any weapons leave the plane hands on head and then you will lie flat on the tarmac do you understand understood pilgrim said thanks for the escort he clicked off the line its just a precaution vochek said youve been rogue for ten years they just want to make sure you behave or make sure they control us ben said after they kill me pilgrim said theyll either promote you as a reward or kill you because you know too much vochek started to shake her head and pilgrim held up a hand watch your back at least until the inks dry on your promotion youre paranoid tell me ben said what was going to be the end result of finding all the illicit groups like the cellar shut them down theyre not accountable right and then what trials for all the participants and those who gave them their orders a public spectacle the dirtiest laundry of our government aired for the world to see or was the shutdown going to be discreet youd have to find a way to shut everyone up we certainly werent going to eliminate people but you werent going to give them passes or pardons ben said no i suppose not forgive me for not wanting to step in front of a firing squad pilgrim said the gleam of new orleans dimmed since the storm began to unfold beneath them the radio sounded the lakefront airportwhere jets such as theirs would normally landgave pilgrim approach instructions now they arrowed across the width of lake pontchartrain the huge lake to the north of new orleans one source of the deadly tidal surge that flooded the city coming up fast on the city proper the radio repeated landing instructions pilgrim scanned the controls he listened to the reported positions of the planes around him gauging distance and speed measuring their own distance from lakefront and louis armstrong new orleans international thisll work he said half to himself then he dove the plane toward the waters of the lake in a steep dive ben pressed his face to the window the homeland plane veered downward as they shot toward earth trying to stay close to them hes crazy ben for gods sakes vochek grabbed at pilgrim and onehanded he shoved her back in her seat ben give me the gun now she said no he didnt point the gun at her but he kept it close he knows what hes doing youre as crazy as he is she said air traffic control for lakefront airport was not happy calmly warning pilgrim that he did not have clearance for the approach he was taking he raced low over the long cup of lake pontchartrain but he had slowed his descent flying a bare two hundred feet above the surface and he came in low over the city in the puddles of lamplight ben could see people on the street watching the plane in surprise and fear perhaps sure the plane was verging on a crash before it went past in an instant the homeland plane was the only other aircraft close to them pilgrim zoomed over the superdome rising to skirt its top took a turn over the french quarter going low again driving hard along the mississippi river toward the lower ninth ward below in the bright glow of the moon lay a ghostly web of roads highways and devastation left over from katrina now taking on its own sad permanence ben peered at wide swatches of land where nothing had been rebuilt many homes still lay on limp and broken deathbeds fema trailers dotted yards he watched the altimeter dip he was at two hundred feet soaring fast over the broken city the engines roar made a booming echo against the ground he took a hard screaming turn downward toward the ruins the crazy bastard was going to land the plane in the streets vochek could see below that it was madness power lines stilltilted poles front yards jagged with fencing ruined houses trying to crawl back from death the gun ben still held it not pointed at anyone and his own mouth was a thin line of worry ben talk him out of this he knows what hes doing doubtful she grabbed at the gun and slammed her elbow hard into bens chest she got both hands on the gun and tried to wrench it from his grasp pilgrim turned the plane hard again banking slowing searching for enough street the force of the sudden turn threw vochek off ben he put the gun on the side away from her then a small but piledriving fist hit ben in the back of the head smacked his face against the window his lip split blood smeared his teeth he folded himself over the pistol he could not let her get the gun shed force them to land at lakefront the plane took another wrench to port pilgrim trying to slow before he ran out of road to land as the windows dipped ben saw the headlights of a car on a deserted street close enough almost to touch vochek landed on his back one arm closing around his throat the other hands fingers digging for his eyes saying please ben give it to me before he kills us pilgrim needed asphalt in the moons gleam and the spill of light from cars and houses he saw five threads of pavement one a busier cross street on the edge of the neighborhood where the roads and the lots had been swept clean the other two choices were lesscrowded roads one had fewer houses and fema trailers and chainlink fences dotting the yards and was a straight shot it had the fewest cars parked on the curb no sign of the homeland plane close by they were far above circling watching summoning the local police to intercept pilgrim taking bets if he was actually crazy enough to land well why wouldnt he be he had nothing left to lose nothing first time hed been told to do anything by anyone other than teach in ten years and she was dead he took no more orders the realization steadied his hands on the controls he descended fast hearing vochek and ben struggling behind him a pickup truck chuffed through an intersection at a crosshatch on the road going the opposite way maybe thirty feet below him as they dropped doubtnormally a strangerfilled him and a sour taste broke in his mouth he could kill someone and he was supposed to be a good guy eliminating bad guys a minivan full of kids or a car driven by a high school girl or a motorcycle with some regular nice guy coming back from a long days work of rebuilding the nearly lost cityno he wouldnt let that happen he dove the plane down toward the empty blacktop had to time it just right pull up with room to spare bring it down on three points with room to slow then the gun erupted vochek knew how to hurt the eyes the groin the bending back of the finger that caused surprised agony she worked all this brutal magic on ben saying ben let go again and again but he wouldnt she stepped on his wounded foot and he howled she got a grip on the pistol he raised the gun and she twisted it felt his finger depress the trigger the gun barked the window shattered a flick of light hit the wing goddamn it pilgrim yelled ben kicked back with all his strength trapped vochek between himself and her window he kept her pinned tried to pry her hands from the gun nearly there pilgrim yelled wheels hit the blacktop the plane bounced hard ben nearly thrown to the ceiling he kept his iron grip on the gun he landed back on vochek knocking the wind from her wings screamed as pilgrim cut the engines and lifted the flaps a boom thundered and a shiver rocked the plane sparks dancing past the window as a wing clipped metala mail box a street sign a chainlink fenceand the plane rumbled forward another shriek of protesting metal a jarring bump then the plane skidded to a stop pilgrim turned and pulled the gun from both their hands he put it to vocheks head the deal is off pilgrim said thanks for the lift pilgrim ben started the police will be here in probably ninety seconds and we cant trust homeland come on he opened the door grabbed ben pushed him out onto the pavement dont do this vochek gasped vochek dont trust anybody i dont want to see your lovely face again pilgrim jumped to the asphalt behind the plane a pickup truck and a minivan slammed to a stop pilgrim ran toward the truck his gun out and high to see and gestured the two women out of the cab the women stared agog at the crumpledwinged plane on the road and the crazy man waving a gun they obeyed hands up one crying very sorry need the truck youll get it back pilgrim shoved ben across to the passenger seat climbed into the drivers seat he wheeled the truck hard in a circle tore around the plane by driving on a grassy edge of the road and roared away through the open window the damp breath of the neighborhood smelled of wet and decay the sirens rose in their approach fire truck police ambulance above them circled the homeland plane ben pilgrim said i should have given you the choice to stay with her we said wed stick together he thought he saw for a moment a flicker of relief on pilgrims face there then gone he must have imagined it theyre gonna chase us hard you ready yes pilgrim tore along a road of houses of patchwork brick and wood homes trying to arise from the drowned soil stripped down and rebuilt i can still hear that plane ben leaned out the window hes banking trying to keep us in his sights pilgrim swerved the wheel hard catching sight of a police car flashing sirens in the rearview and he wrenched the pickup into a twowheeling turn toward the thoroughfare of st claude avenue and headed west a deputys car picked them up followed lights blazing traffic was light and pilgrim swerved and accelerated around cars ducking onto side roads and then back onto st claude ben braced himself for the impact that would surely come when pilgrim miscalculated and rammed into a bumper or a barrier pilgrim nearly clipped a construction sign that marked where the street was being repaired powerturned hard drove across two yards and veered down a side street he was out of sight of the pursuing deputys car and he stood on the brakes revved into a grassy parking lot full of cars and trucks a banner announcing a saturday night revival meeting presumably connected to a church that sat back from the street in redbrick grandeur slammed on brakes nestled in between two large trucks in a loading area for the event the jet went overhead they ducked down and ben thought this is how it ends me arrested with an exspy in a church parking lot the jets whine passed the deputys sirens faded and they eased out of the truck pilgrim started feeling along bumpers for key cases ben testing for unlocked doors more sirens sounded patrols responding to calls about the downed plane the energetic strains of modern worship music rose from the tent that stood pitched near the church then the sirens faded again the buzz of a helicopter replaced the churning whine of the homeland plane i got a winner pilgrim said pulling loose a key box from a bumper come on before the helicopter spots us they can fly lower and slower stick to us like glue they pulled away from the revival in a sedate blue ford sedan i hope this isnt the preachers car ben said were going to hell im the only one hellbound well find you a place to lay low they could hear the helicopter widening its circles pilgrim wheeled the sedan back into traffic at normal speed lay low forget it he killed emily im not sitting on my ass ben hector specifically took over the cellar for this big job that means i have to fight several people from the cellar itll be like fighting a whole gang of me you did your part you dont have to take this on i know im not good at shooting and fighting but i can help you not now i promise you i will kill him for you for everyone hes hurt pilgrims mouth became a thin slash for teach and for your wife you wont have a long wait good lord you know where hector and the cellar are at of course he knew and he wasnt going to tell vochek or the authorities until he knew what kind of reception awaited him and ben in new orleans i have an idea pilgrim said the cellar had a safe house here good guess if hector has them believing you turned against teachsame as green and de la pena didtheyll kill you ben said yes they will they dont know me from any other jerk on the streets hector has all of teachs pass codes bank informationhell seem very legit in their eyes i will look like the enemy then let me fight him from another angle barker called someone at the hotel marquis de lafayette last person he called before he left that house to betray you and teach yeah i want to know who that person is we know hectors working for vocheks boss on security but maybe hes working for someone else too fine pilgrim said you go get phone records ill go shoot people you better calm down ben said or youre going to make a mistake and get killed pilgrim pulled the sedan over to the side of the road pardon my anger ive lost my life same as you but ive done it twice now first i lost my family my career and now ive lost teach and the cellar i wanted to retire two days ago i wanted to leave and be in the real world he killed my hope for a moment he was silent fingers clenching above the steering wheel but theres no place out here for me now as long as i could stay in the cellar then i could hope it could be different for me that i could have a real life but i cant vochek and homeland theyd put me in a cell have me talking for years you offered to do that for vochek i was desperate ben to get here because hectors not winning do you understand me yes i hate the bastard as much as you do thats why i want you to let me help you call me on my cell if you find anything interesting in the phone records ill call you when ive killed hector he pulled the pilots stolen cell phone from bens hands activated the screen memorized the number assume we succeed then what i walk away you negotiate an immunity ill feed you plenty to give homeland thatll be worth gold to them itll buy you your life back buy your own life back youll always be looking over your shoulder no i wont pilgrim drove in silence for several minutes and then turned onto poydras on the streets were clumps of tourists not like in prekatrina days but more than ben had expected here pilgrim pulled a few hundred dollars hoarded from his storage unit slid them to ben you wont be able to get the records without bribery nothings cheap the hotels a few blocks down that way good luck you almost hope i get caught you dont want to be in the cross fire ben ben offered his hand pilgrim shook it sorry not good at goodbyes goodbye randall ben stepped out of the car first and only time to use his real name the one vochek mentioned bye ben im sorry for everything ben closed the door and the car raced off into the night the cellar they arrived one at a time taking rental cars from louis armstrong new orleans international airport the safe house was a twostory family home on the edge of the suburb of metairie in a neighborhood spared the katrina flooding hector felt like a magician summoning spirits to do his bidding as each of them arrived and he greeted each at the door with the pass code that teach had given himand with their real name six in all two women four men the six of them had never been in the same room together and he could see them glancing at each other trying not to study each other overmuch trying not to be remembered or to remember jackie stood in the back to the room arms crossed wearing sunglasses like he was a badass im afraid i bear tragic news teach is dead hector said when they had all gathered he pushed a button on his laptop which was hooked to a projector a slightly grainy photo of teach lying dead on the carpet hed snapped the picture with his cell phone when hed run back to the apartment knowing proof of her death might be useful one of the men rubbed his eyes as though weary one of the women gasped the rest were silent let me assure you that the cellar continues as it always has the transition to my leadership will be as seamless as possible like you all i am excia i worked in special ops as deep cover i currently run in my regular life a private security firm but ive worked with teach in partnership with the cellar for the past several years it was best he thought to weave truth and lie together who killed her one of the men asked he clicked another button pilgrims face appeared on the screen she was found dead in an apartment leased to this man he is a cellar operative known as pilgrim he is also responsible for the deaths of three other cellar agents pilgrim flashed the file photos of barker green and de la pena one by one and let the growing anger fill the room he killed one in austin two in dallas this is the most grievous attack on the cellar in its history especially coming as it did from within why did he turn on us one of the women asked for profit he got bribed by our target hector slicked the words with disdain we just came into possession of information about a terrorist group called blood of fire being underground here in new orleans they are gathered here to launch an attack were going to kill them he moved the screen to a detailed map showing a house near the south shore of lake pontchartrain in the lakeview neighborhood tonight we move fast because they leave the house tomorrow were not giving these bastards a chance he handed them copies of files photos of the six young men why isnt homeland handling this why not just arrest them the second woman asked we havent fed the information to homeland the terrorists know about us from pilgrim we dont want the terrorists captured and talking about us they go in the ground all of them the phone rang he glanced at the number display excuse me study the maps of the locale and of the house this is a fairly straightforward operation but i welcome your suggestions he displayed tactical maps on the screen stepped into the other room shut the door and answered the phone it was margaret pritchard we have a problem she said he wanted to say then solve it but she still believed the only agenda at work here was hers yes margaret two of the people from the covert groupim told they call it the cellartook one of my agents and her plane and theyre in new orleans one of them choate offered a deal to tell everything he knows about the cellar to us but he and his partner ran once they got here they wanted me to tell you they were being held for questioning by homeland im wondering why theyd make that request why theyd want you to believe they were out of the loop hector stayed calm pilgrim didnt know the location of the safe house only teach had but did he know the target would he try to interfere he couldnt know he couldnt you should know serious allegations about you are being made by one of my agents sam i think youve done a wonderful job in flushing out these people but we have to find the rest of them and i want to talk to you about your methods is this agent vochek is she the one they um kidnapped he remembered the name of the woman whod called him in dallas hed never returned her message shed been in a plane with pilgrim and forsberg he wondered what had been said what deal might be struck between them and this vochek woman this was a disaster for him goddamn nicky lynch missing pilgrim when he had the chance to kill him if hed only shot him and jackie planted the photosthen pilgrim would be dead ben forsberg would be under suspicion for having ties to a dead rogue cia agent with evidence pointing back to his wifes murder planted on the dead agents body a millimeter was making a huge difference in his life right now yes shes here with me now im not sharing her allegations with anyone and ive asked her to keep quiet for now but sam i have serious concerns margaret i know its late but i can come over now and we can sort this out youre at your usual suite yes she said ill see you shortly he walked back into the room the team was gathered around a map new information they may be rolling earlier than we thought we need to go now he explained his basic plan of how they were to approach kill any sentry and rip through the house in an orderly fashion room by room this group is not remotely ready for our level of expertise a bit rushed one of the men said in a tone of doubt its a twostory house theyre mostly sleeping you have more guns they dont its not calculus hector said he forced the iron out of his voice because now they were all watching him they werent contractors he remembered these were a different breed exagency like him i know teachs loss is devastating but these guys have every reason to expose us if pilgrim gives away our entire organization so we take them out before they do he left them discussing the maps sharing thoughts on how best to proceed given their skill sets and styles he gestured jackie down the hallway to the den jackie shut the door crossed his arms quite a bit of fiction youve told hector realized too late hed given jackie an unwelcome taste of power letting him attend the meeting listen to the lies jackie could expose him as a fraud not all of its fiction hector said jackie rolled his eyes hector leaned close to jackies ear i have a job for you i need you to kill two people all right do you know new orleans i can find any place if i got a map use the gps in the rental car youll be killing two women one in her late fifties margaret pritchard and the other a younger woman joanna vochek theyre at this hotel this suite number i need it done silent and fast both may be armed pritchard is a fool but vochek isnt theyre expecting me theyll be getting you jackie studied the address put it in his pocket pilgrim and forsberg are in new orleans we dont know where jackie blew an irritated sigh what if pilgrim and ben know where youre headed the corner of hectors mouth jerked they dont they couldnt never say couldnt then my new colleagues in the cellar will be happy to kill them behind them the clock chimed midnight khaleds reportnew orleans i cant sleep i hear snoring coming from the other rooms but i cannot settle my thoughts my mind is too full of worry later today i begin my work and i must do it perfectly with no room for error no mistakes it is strange to think of a job this way tonight i saw on the news more coverage about the attack on the homeland security office that had not even officially opened yet in austin by a group of lebanese men i could feel everyone in the room tonight watch me when it was announced they were lebanese as though i brought a contagion of incompetence with me perhaps i am imagining it reading so much into every reaction because i am aware of the constant lie that my life is about to become a lie until i die it is an odd discomfiting feeling one that works into your bones i feel like tonight is the last night forever of the life i knew before i thought my very identitywho i am at heartchanged when i was recruited that my uselessness ended then and i became hopeful and useful all at once but tonight is truly the end of my old life and the beginning of another for me i lay awake feeling the change in my bones i really need your help ben said with a tourists awkward grin the night clerk at the hotel marquis de lafayette flexed an automatic customercentric smile in response but any murmured request asked past midnight probably meant vice was involved ben could see the clerk steel himself against a polite inquiry as to where one might locate the pricier hookers yes sir my wife called someone staying here last monday id like to know who that someone is sir i cant release our phone records ill pay you two hundred dollars ben kept his smile friendly the clerk blinked sir i could lose my job im sorry i cant help you i understand five hundred dollars sir please the clerk reddened with embarrassment cash ben said no one will ever know but i have to have that phone number my children my wife wants to take my kids from me i had an affair so did she but she didnt have the guts to confess to it sir respectfully i dont want to know my kids i can do shared custody but i cant lose them from my life help me level the playing field please six hundred dollars if you dont need the money you must have family here that could use it i know how hard things have been since katrina sir the clerk wet his lips im not sure i could even give you enough information to help you she called at am spoke for twelve minutes you should have a record of the incoming call which room it was routed to and who was in that room thats all i need sir pardon my question how do i know you dont mean ill to whoever she called this question followed a long sigh low in the throat wrestling with the ethics calculating how much six hundred cash would buy the clerk was maybe twentytwo and wore a plain wedding band on his finger i swear i dont i i six hundred youre not doing a bad deed youre helping yourself and youre helping me and trust me i deserve a little help right now im not sure i can even get the information the clerk glanced over his shoulder my manager ben slid three hundreddollar bills to the clerk heres half the rest when you get me the records the clerk didnt look at the bills then he picked them up and tucked them into his pocket he went into the back of the lobby office was gone for thirty seconds returned and said twenty minutes ben nodded and went into the bar a few people drank and chatted in hushed tonesit wasnt a loud conventioneer crowd he had the sense hed walked into a room of bureaucrats here for the reconstruction persuading themselves it was okay to relax with a beer the tv above the bar showed the news of the emergency landingas it was being describedon marais street in the stilldevastated lower ninth ward he ordered a club soda drank half and leaned against the bar then quickly turned away from the door walking across the lobby he saw joanna vochek and a navysuited ash blond woman wearing large eyeglasses moving toward the elevators deep in conversation good lord what were the odds all the hotels in town but then he thought a constant stream of people with federal agencies came and went from new orleans with the reconstruction they might keep rooms on permanent reserve and hotels made deals with agencies to keep their business that he knew from his consulting work barkers contact here might be someone inside the government ben waited for the two women to vanish inside the elevator and then stepped back into the lobby the clerk stood at the desk frowning at the computer screen and looking guilty of several felonies sir he said in a low whisper i cant get the information the managers on the computer and i cant access the phone database records i cant heres your money back please keep trying but can you tell me thisis there a suite or set of rooms often used by the federal authorities who come here yes sir from several different agencies fema commerce homeland security of course femas part of homeland i need the names of every governmentconnected guest who stayed here last monday and their phone calls can you do that for an extra hundred the clerk frowned as though asking questions about government workers made him uneasy ill try yes but please hurry ben returned to the bar stayed near the door avoiding eye contact with anyone ten minutes later the clerk jerked his head toward the back of the lobby the mans forehead glistened like he might sweat to death a sheen on his face that showed nerves on edge ben walked past the counter kept going toward a stairway he glanced back and the clerk gave a short savage nod he went up the stairs toward a mezzanine that held conference areas and ballrooms the landing was deserted and the clerk jogged past him as if intent on another errand not looking at him ben followed the clerk to a closed ballroom the clerk stepped inside and ben followed him the ballroom stood dark empty the floral aroma of carpet shampoo reeked like cheap perfume the clerk said the money please ben handed him the rest of the cash and the clerk thumbed through the bills then he pushed an envelope into bens chest he opened it unfolded the pages the list of people with government ties at the hotel last monday was at least fifteen names long each list included incoming and outgoing calls were done we never saw each other thank you ben said but the clerk was already gone he stood in the deserted ballroom and ran a finger down the names they meant nothing to him and there was no indication of which agency they were with except at the end margaret pritchard in suite the clerk had penciled in in block letters received call on monday at the time you said the name of vocheks boss who had called them on the plane why had barker called her barker worked for teach he betrayed teach and pilgrim to hector how did he connect to vocheks boss ben leaned against the wall he scanned the printout under the calls the next number called from pritchards room was an austin area code hed heard the number before but he couldnt remember how he knew it he racked his memory then he remembered a nasal strangers voice on his answering machine damning him in front of kidwell and vochek had been the number at adam reynoldss office my god margaret pritchard had been in direct contact with adam reynolds which meant she might know about his search software that had unearthed a few of the cellars members so who had reynolds and barker been working forhector or pritchard if hector hired the lynch brothers to kill adam and pritchard worked with hectordid she view reynolds as an ally or a threat at the least shed been in contact with barker who was hiring death squads hector had given someone their own private cia maybe pritchard hadnt been used by hector maybe she was fully aware of his brutal actions ben had been a dealmaker a few days ago the smart thing now would be to cut a deal with vochek show her this evidence implicating her boss get her to help him find the truth he knew the odds of victory were not in pilgrims favor he was exhausted hurt and outnumbered so if hector escaped pilgrims fury he could not escape bens ben would expose his conspiracy strip him of his company destroy his fortune the idea gave him a cold shiver of pleasure the wounds in his arm and his foot throbbed he opened the pilots stolen cell phone he found vocheks number listed in it he dialed you and i are at crosspurposes vochek said we cant be pritchard crossed her arms paced the hotel suite face frowning in thought vochek touched her bosss shoulder and pritchard stopped walking im telling you we need to find pilgrim and ben get them talking theyve already talked plenty to you pritchard said youre calling choate by that asinine code name weve gotten in too deep with hector take him and his people off this project until were sure hes not hijacking what were trying to do at least until we can find out if hes really connected to emily forsbergs murder pritchard pressed a hand to her stomach im starving have you eaten no pritchard picked up the phone called room service ordered a pot of decaf two omelets and potatoes obrien she hung up you want me to take the word of a cia fugitive and a man who is tied to an assassin over that of one of the most respected government contractors in the country how exactly is hector helping us i told you providing infrastructure to help us id the offthebooks agents and when you find these agents then theyll be arrested you act like this is news are you doubting my word no im doubting his has he given you a single name other than that of pilgrim no yet adam reynolds is dead his girlfriend is dead because the cellars trying to silence them she said this as though stating the obvious adam reynolds found them didnt he he gave the names to hector but hectors not giving them to you thats ridiculous you didnt even tell me about reynoldss software to find aliases through financial trails at least pilgrim and ben told me why didnt you pritchard waved a dismissive hand we didnt know if the software would even work thats not the reason the reason is that for it to identify likely false identities it had to work across a huge range of databases that adam reynolds had no access to but you got him the access illegally no noise but the hum of the air conditioner i told you we have leeway to find these people she practically spat the words at vochek the disappointment vochek felt toward pritchard welled up in her chest if we break every law to find these people margaret were no better than they are were turning into them spare me the lecture on civil liberties and i wished my mom was more like you more poised more perfect we need to see hectors service record at the cia pilgrim claimed hes an assassin so what if he was pritchard said it has nothing to do with his current work his clients might feel differently vochek said her cell phone rang yes vochek its ben forsberg where are you nearby sorry we ran im not sure i blame you she said quietly are you with your boss yes she glanced at margaret who stood with crossed arms i have evidence tying your boss to barker the guy who betrayed the cellar and to adam reynolds i believe she might be able to clarify this situation how the pieces fit together vochek didnt look at pritchard but she could sense pritchard tensing standing close to her vochek turned and walked to the window she glanced down to the darkened sidewalks as though she expected to see ben watching her window i think youre right are the two of you alone yes i want to talk to you both together because if she wants to save her career she better help bring hector to justice i want a deal hashed out between us evidence it would either damn margaret or it could be explained but either way ben would be in her custody suite she said he hung up and vochek folded her phone she thought suddenly of the lost afghan kids and wondered if shed gone to work for a woman who was not the cure but part of the problem who was that pritchard asked vochek spoke to her boss with cool authority sit down margaret were going to have a talk vochek said nothing to ben when she opened the door and he came into the room he handed her the list of phone numbers and the gun hed had on the plane the one theyd fought for vote of confidence in you standing by me he said vochek took the gun and carried it into the bedroom margaret pritchard watched and then she got up from the couch and moved toward the phone ben stepped between her and the phone and picked it up pulled the cord from the wall youve already been on the phone quite enough he said you have some nerve ive gotten a lot more recently you hired hector to help you find these clandestine groups hes gone off the books himself she looked past his shoulder to vochek if you want to keep your job joanna youll arrest this man vochek didnt move i think weve become too much like the people were hunting margaret lets get all the facts out the cellar agent barker called you in this room if you didnt know about the cellar how did you know barker ben asked hes a computer hacker who went underground rather than serve time youve been consorting with a fugitive criminal terrible at congressional review time the phone record is wrong fine one of my clients does a lot of consulting work for the department of justice and has great connections there ill be glad to call the attorney general at home tonight and let you explain all this to her margaret pritchard went back to the couch stood arms crossed i hear you want a deal im listening she said it like she was the one doing him a favor hector goes down hard hes a murderer and hes hired murderers to kill people for him if i give up hector itll be news and our operation goes public the whole point of stopping groups like the cellar this way was to keep it out of the public eye i dont care if the government gets embarrassed its not fatal we hardly want our enemies and our allies to know details of our most illicit operations and if we go public with him all his work for me goes public too then give him to us privately you want me to let you kill him forget it you dont care about the numerous people hes killed i dont know that hes killed anyone pritchard yelled he showed me proof that he killed my wife ben put his hands on pritchards shoulders and pushed her into the chair she didnt resist you protect him youre protecting a murderer how did you know barker pritchards mouth worked as if she were unsure that she could form the words finally she said barker wasnt excia he came to homeland and got steered to me he wanted to betray the cellar for payment and for a pardon and you steered him to hector pritchard nodded barker was our foot in the door he only knew of teach but not her specific location he couldnt hand us any of the rest of the cellar but he gave us a couple of identities the cellar had usedthat he had set up for agentsand they let us test reynoldss software to find more of the ids used by the cellar barker called me monday to let me know the operation was starting to draw out pilgrim and the rest of the cellar that they had gotten wind of adam reynolds trying to track down their accounts and their identities but i had no idea hector was working any other angle such as targeting pilgrim or you except barker betrayed you too ms pritchard he fed you limited information while giving everything to hector he hired the sniper who killed reynolds and tried to kill pilgrim he hired the gunmen who killed kidwell and delia moon and kidnapped teachand hector never gave teach to you which would have handed you the entire cellar immediately he killed her right in front of my eyes not what you wanted is it pritchard put a hand to her mouth why would he kill reynolds ben leaned down and yelled in pritchards face tell me i dont know she said i thought ben stopped adam reynolds originally designed this software to find terrorists did he call you monday because he found not the cellar but actual terrorists pritchard rubbed her temples as if fending off a migraine answer him margaret vochek said he made a mistake she said he found suspicious activity centering on a group of men using suspect ids traveling to new orleans but theyre not terrorists who are they pritchard seemed not to hear him i came to new orleans to check it out thats why i was here its not a problem who is hector targeting ben asked because whatevers here its why hes taken over the cellar he couldnt be after them pritchard said in a whisper no reason to go after them ben grabbed her shoulders tell us reynoldss search queries they found a group of arabic men traveling under a pattern that suggested assumed names coming into the country a few weeks ago all ending up in new orleans but these men arent terrorists theyre training at a cia safe house pritchard swallowed oh my god ben said theyre arabs preparing to infiltrate and spy on terrorist groups overseas to be the native eyes and ears we havent been able to have in places like beirut and baghdad and damascus weve never had true trained spies working deep cover inside hezbollah or alqaeda or any of the other networks our best hope of destroying terrorist networks from inside ben let her go where is this safe house i dont have the location thats classified but adam gave hector the same information he gave you vochek said hectors going to use the cellar to kill a cia team why would he because hector needs the war on terror to keep going for a good long time ben said its fueling his bottom line he thought of pilgrims indonesian story framing pilgrim in turn for a security contract for his new company profiting from fear and chaos hector was repeating his own history but now on a much wider and more dangerous scale the knock on the door came a man announcing room service the waiter a gentle hardworking man who had been with the hotel for twenty years and had been one of the first employees to return in the wake of katrina knocked on the door announced room service he was tired his feet ached and he was ready to go off duty he nodded at the young man ambling down the hallway turned back toward the door and felt the cool metal touch his temple he froze youre going to walk in and leave the door propped open do it and you wont get hurt argue and youre dead i dont want to hurt you nod if you understand the voice was a lightly accented whisper the waiter stiff with fear nodded the young man stepped back against the wall where he wouldnt be seen the door opened pilgrim watched the cars leavetwo of them one was a van holding the cellar agents the other a sedan with just hector jackie had taken off five minutes earlier in a third car and pilgrim let him go he had to stay with hector the two vehicles pulled onto veterans boulevard headed east then headed north toward lake pontchartrain traffic was heavier than normal saturday night in new orleansand he hung back keeping an eye on hectors car they werent wasting any time whatever this job was they were moving now he did not want to kill anyone in the cellar they had made the same choice he had to take a broken life and rebuild it into meaningful work perhaps they hadnt chosen entirely for virtuous reasons he himself had no desire to rot in an indonesian prison they had all done work that would offer no acclaim and few rewards other than teachs assurance they had done a good thing what could be in new orleans that interested hector so that he needed the cellar hector global could command a thousand trained men for action anywhere in the world but those men wouldnt kill at will especially outside a war zone this had to be a job that his normal security forces would refuse to do because there would be questions repercussions hector needed deniability if he could take hector out with a shotthen the rest of the group would come after him perhaps abandon the target if they lost the element of surprise he stayed close as they began to head into the patchwork of rebuilt and devastated neighborhoods close to the massive lake and if he missed hector and the cellar caught him well his beginning in this life had been messy at hectors hands and his exit would cost hector dearly he would make sure the price was high the waiter mouth a thin line pushed the room service cart into the room ben saw the coffee and carafe and the covered dishes his stomach rumbled but the waiter said nothing no hello how are you kept his head bowed as if expecting a blow pritchard stepped forward to sign the ticket two sharp bleats the waiter falling over the tray pritchard reeling collapsing onto her back jackie lynch stood in the doorway silencercapped gun raised his eyes seeking his next target closing the suites door behind him vochek stumbled backward toward the coffee table jackie raised the gun no ben yelled no jackie saw ben a twisted smile touched his battered lips and he shifted the guns aim from vochek toward ben but in the second it took for the gun to point toward ben vochek rushed jackie and kicked him in the solar plexus he staggered back and she threw herself against him so that the gun for barely a moment pointed only at the floor ben ran and slammed jackie against the wall leveraging all his weight into the younger mans shoulder pinning the gun between them closing his hands around the weapon fury fueled his muscles he got hold of jackies pinky and snapped hard jackie screeched and fired the bullet popping into the carpet vochek tangled fingers in jackies long hair knocked his head against the wall once twice and he roared in anger ben twisted the gun around toward jackie he tried to fire but jackies broken bent finger jammed the trigger jackie headbutted bens face hammering into his cheek but even with the bolt of pain ben did not let go jackie wrenched free of vocheks grip with ben pinning his hands he landed a kick hard in vocheks chest and she fell to the floor it ends now jackie screamed he knocked ben loose ben fell against the cart the heat of the coffee decanter touched his arm he grabbed the carafe and swung it hardno time to unscrew the top jackie was lifting the gun to put a bullet between bens eyes ben caught the gun hard but couldnt knock it free of jackies grip ben swung the carafe back trying to connect with jackies head but missed jackie leveled the gun to fire again and ben caught his hand raised the gun toward the ceiling im going to kill you ben shouted vochek got up and ran toward the bedroom jackie grunted in fury started to wrench his hand from bens grip with the other hand frantic ben thumbed the pour control on the hot carafe and dumped coffee on jackies groin jackie shrieked and tried to jump back through the wall ben slammed the carafe into jackies face hot coffee splashed bens hand he didnt feel pain jackies face contorted in rage he bent and ben grabbed the gun but jackie kept his grip screaming with fury he slapped the gun into bens face once twice as ben fought to keep a grip on the pistol dont let go dont let go he thought ben fell to his knees his forehead bleeding his cheek cut jackie wrenched the pistol from bens hold and swung it toward him the sound of the shot boomed and a hole appeared in jackies hand a nickelsized coin of gore and then vochek shot him again in the stomach and jackie folded dropping the gun vochek stood over pritchard the gun ben had surrendered to her in her hands get his gun she yelled jackie lunged for the gun as ben grabbed it and vochek shot him again in the chest he shrieked and curled into a ball ben locked the gun on jackies head where is hector wheres his target ah god jackie moaned hurts hurts well get you a doctor but tell us wheres the target ben said nicky nicky jackie sobbed spit and snot flew from his face and he gagged writhing on the carpet no no no and then a broken hum his eyes widened in pain then he went still ben stood his mind felt wiped clean blank his body shivering with adrenaline no this wasnt over he reached into jackies pocket he found car keys a pass card and a scrap of paper with the hotels address no cell phone he took the keys vochek knelt by pritchard touched her throat oh my god ben call the front desk ben checked the poor waiter slumped by the cart he was dead as well this is hector cleaning house ben said shutting up pritchard and you before you became a bigger threat to him before you started questioning his tactics and results he doesnt need you anymore we have to find him now call the cia tell them their safe house is in danger or the police we dont even know where to tell the police to go and calling the cia theyll have to confirm my identity thats a lot of bureaucracy to navigate check her cell phone check the page of phone records i got on her someone at the cia told her about the operation so she wouldnt interfere there has to be a record vochek nodded i have another idea he closed his hand around jackies car keys he stood and hurried down the hallway past a couple of frightened guests whod heard the fight ill be right back he lied ben vochek yelled at his back stop where are you going the breeze outside the hotel was damp and cool ben took in a bracing breath as he exited via the hotels fire exit into a narrow brick alley sirens flashed the police already pulling into the front of the hotel marquis de lafayette blue and red light painting the bricks bright as a childs room ben put jackies gun in his pocket he went down the bricked alleyway by the hotel toward the closest parking lot he thumbed the remote on the keys kept at it until he hit the third row and a rental chevrolet winked its lights he searched the seat the glove compartment jackie was from belfast presumably he didnt know new orleans well there should be a page of directions maybe that ben could backtrack follow to where jackie came from nothing the scrap in his pocket carried only the address of the hotel no directions then he noticed the gps monitor he touched the screen and the gps purred to life he studied the controls tapped a button that displayed the last search which was for the hotel marquis de lafayette he went to the previous address it was in metairie okay then off to metairie but caution made him pause think like jackie where would jackie have been before coming to execute the hit perhaps at wherever the cellar group convened with hector and they wouldnt be there now he checked again up another address to a warehouse near louis armstrong international then the next address as he retraced the list was that of the car rental company he had to choose where to go he tried to think like hector if things went bad or the cellar people didnt accept hector or believe his story then hector would need a place to hide maybe it was the warehouse or maybe these were directions summoned by the last customer to rent the car he could waste precious time on a pointless drive warehouse hector global had deployed a security force here in the chaotic sad aftermath of katrina near the airport he remembered contracts signed and negotiated the difficulty of tracking down the owners of the property in the exodus after the storm when hector global wanted to rent the space it was all he had to go on he clicked back to the warehouse map studied it and pulled out of the lot he switched on the cell phone hed stolen from the pilot the battery showed the phones charge was nearly at its end he had no recharger he called pilgrim much of the lakeview neighborhood remained a ghost towna very few homes newly rebuilt others razed far more abandoned the shells had taken on the look of abstract monuments it had been a myth that only the poor neighborhoods of new orleans drowned in the bitch katrina this was a district of what had been nice middle and uppermiddleclass homes pilgrim thought if he blinked in the moonlightnow fading behind heavy cloudshe could see how pretty the yards and the homes had once been statues remained in a few backyards of the ruins arms and legs broken bodies slanted and bowed as though praying for mercy to their own stonefaced god suffocated oaks and japanese maples stood dead ignored tottering like natures own memorial to her fury as they approached the lakefront on west end boulevard pilgrim had to back off from the cars turn into a lot hold position then hurry to keep their taillights in sight then fall back again finally they turned onto a street he drove past then turned right onto robert e lee and circled back and turned into the neighborhood a few streets south of the road they had taken his cell phone chirped the cellar is attacking a cia safe house ben sounded frantic its a training place for a group of arab recruits being infiltrated as spies back into terrorist networks that goddamned traitor pilgrim thought he felt hatred lick through his heart no stay cool he told himself but i dont know where the house is pilgrim said no worries im there ben jesus you did awesome listen i think i know where hectors based here a warehouse by the airport he gave pilgrim the address vocheks trying to warn the cia im going to this warehouse to see if i can find evidence against him or do you want me to come help you ill take care of it pilgrim pilgrim hung up nothing more to say and no time to waste damn ben you scored a big one he remembered when he had told ben with a hard ugliness in his words you dont have what it takes he had been wrong he thought me saving the cia thats a definition of irony i get to go fight for the cia when they wouldnt lift a finger to spring me out of an indonesian jail unless i joined their dirty secret group full circle this was the end result of his life so different from what hed thought it would be he remembered the joy in his stepdads face when hed graduated from school the pride he felt when he joined the agency the mix of shock and awe at his daughters birth the warmth of new life being held in his unworthy arms everything then brimmed with promise if he had just not gone after gumalar in an attempt to protect his familyif he had not missed with his shot on the dragon through that windowif he hadnt gotten caught by the police if if if no more ifs there was only what was his beginning fading as though it belonged to a different man what was his likely end at hand he was on a collision course with the man who had undone his life he had no illusions about getting out of this mess alive pilgrim parked in an empty lot and slipped out of the car he cut through two yards between houses under construction and saw a street of mostly razed lots the grass grew high on two of the lots and he darted low through the growth half a block ahead he heard a plink a streetlight probably installed after the storm died before the light vanished he saw a large home ample grounds surrounding it a newly built stone wall set a bit away from the other homes and lots the target the cellar team would be fast the safe house probably had reinforced doors and windows but they would deactivate the alarm systems and they would be in and murdering and out in sixty seconds in the house one dim light gleamed on a second floor someone unable to sleep or standing guard hed never slept well while on training too eager to learn to soak up data and techniques and analysis he felt an instant kindred spirit with the night owl in the target house he hurried back to the van shot out the lock yanked open the door a man inside headphones on turned toward him he went for his gun and pilgrim stopped him with a kick in the gut the guy collapsed airless pilgrim carefully deactivated the headphones and wrapped the cable around the guys neck he tightened it hard into the throats flesh then loosened it a bit for a display of mercy tightened it again while he asked his question how many of them on the attack the guy struggled and pilgrim yanked the cable tighter turning purple the guy held up six fingers hector and five more cellar agents not counting this one guns explosives guns knives nothing heavier the guy choked whats your call sign dont lie to me if i give the wrong sign and i have to run ill kill you on my way out right now youre getting to live he eased up enough on the cable and the guy said strict numbers im seven by the way i didnt kill teach you get out of this alive and i dont kill hector for me he slammed the guys head against the corner of the equipment table twice and the guy slumped unconscious pilgrims own clothes were not night stalkerreadyhe wore khakis and a pale shirt the unconscious man wore a black turtleneck and black pants pilgrim relieved him of his dark clothes they were tight on pilgrims big frame but they fit well enough pilgrim took the guys gun and knife fished an earpiece from the curl of his ear and tucked it into his own he activated it and listened to the cellar chatter as the team deployed one and two had deactivated the perimeter security system and were approaching the house to deal with its alarm box which meant two of them should be close to the low stone wall holding back to watch the groups rear ready to join the others when the alarm system was cut for an instant pilgrim considered revving the van laying on the horn creating a disturbance to awaken everyone in the house but that would trigger a retreat all of them heading straight for him hed be outnumbered and outgunned and if he went live on the com network and informed them that hector killed teachthere was the chance they might not believe him he had killed two other cellar agents in selfdefense but when it was dark and tense one could not always have rational discussions with heavily armed people so hed have to do this the hard way he slipped out of the van youre going to die he was fairly sure of the outcome six now against one and if anyone inside the cia safe house was armedand no doubt they werethey were just as likely to shoot him do whats necessary he had done it for ten years and ben kept telling him that it was fine it was understandable ben was one of those people who thought dirty jobs had their place in the cogs of society as long as his own hands didnt get bloodied it was okay lots of people thought that way but now pilgrim faced killing his own colleagues to keep them from doing a serious and harmful wrong to the country and it wasnt their fault do what you have to do his heart weighed like a stone he listened to the silence no one saying anything which meant they were waiting for the alarm system to go down he crept from the vanevery streetlight had been doused the road was dark the moon hiding its face he studied the length of the wall five feet high a foot wide he got close to the houses main driveway a spot along here was a likely station for whoever was ordered to hold backenough to cover a retreat for those at the alarm box far back enough to see any encroaching danger he stopped ten feet shy of the driveway listened after a minute he heard four feet to his left the faintest rustle of a heel shifting weight in grass he moved back heard a whispered copy as someone announced they were nearly through the decode sequence for the alarm and went over the wall pilgrim practically landed on one of them a woman his feet knocking into her back nailing her to the grass the other was a man short and powerfully built pilgrim grabbed his head slammed it against the stone with three brutal blows breaking the mans nose savaging his cheek the man went down pilgrim dropped him he knelt by the woman she was semiconscious and he struck the flat of his palm against her neck knocking her out he scooped their earpieces from their ears three down four to go five four report hectors baritone in his earpiece the noise of the takedown drew his attention this is seven pilgrim whispered i see them they are heading back to the van four is tapping at ear ill check their pieces a pause as though his whisper was being judged tell them to get the hell back here copy pilgrim ran low and hard moving toward a small stone outbuilding where a driveway deadended he had to neutralize the team three more agents two of them working on the alarm and where was hector were found he heard a woman say both in his earpiece and in his ear and a kick hammered into his chest shed been behind the outbuilding and hed been careless her blow staggered him a flash of silver danced in the spare moonlight she had a knife trying to avoid the noise of a gun that would rouse the house she slashed at him with the blade slicing through the borrowed black turtleneck and scoring across his chest but she overshot on the blow tried to recover by launching another powerhouse kick at his face he caught her leg high and shoved her hard into the brick building shed hidden behind hushed and sudden chatter from the others filled his ear they knew he was there alarm down a man announced hit now hector ordered pilgrim fractured his attackers arm with the next blow but better than killing her he thought she dropped the knife and contained her scream brave and well trained trying not to alarm the target he hit her twice hard with respect and regret and she went down maybe not knocked out but hurt enough to be out of the fight two more cellar agents and hector remained pilgrim was at the houses side porch and he figured the assault would open at the back away from the street he heard the muted sound of a shot hitting steel a reinforced door the opportunity for stealth had passed he was too late he spoke into the earpiece hector killed teach not me shoot him shoot him no answer no acknowledgment two more shots youre not killing terrorists youre attacking a cia safe house hes a traitor pilgrim said he broke into a hard run four are down none are dead im not the liar stand down nothing they were ignoring him or hector had silenced the communications network he could see movement inside the windows hector and the cellar were already inside they knew he was here one would be watching the door for him while the others began the kills the door was a trap so he fired rounds at a back window bullets slamming into the reinforced glass he vaulted up the porch steps those inside would think he was stupid and heading for the nearly unbreakable glass he was trying to shatter with his gunfire he kept firing at the pane but at the last moment he leapt through the doorway the feint worked he hit the floor rolled out of the back hallway into the dining room his gun spitting and he caught one cellar agent waiting for him close to the window in the knees the agent firing back a bullet needling into the meat of pilgrims shoulder he rolled hard under a table fired again screaming without thinking cia cia he was once and always would be and now he was again a bullet smacked into the table he was under fired from his left he could see one body in tshirt and pajama pants on the kitchen floor theyd already killed one he shot the agent closest to the window again in the leg and the wounded agent staggered into the kitchen a hallway phone began to ring thanks vochek you got their attention too late a second cellar agent had also made a retreat into the kitchen firing at pilgrim from an awkward angle pinning him down bullets cracked into the back of the pine chairs at the dinner table abort pilgrim yelled in the pause between the shots hector killed teach silence the pause lengthened and he risked bolting from the table down the hallway as he ran toward the end of the hall the lights came on pilgrim could see on the stairwell a young man no more than twentythree blackhaired wearing eyeglasses mouth twisted in fright holding a glock with trembling hands hector crouched at the bottom of the stairs aiming at the kid pilgrim fired and the bullet sizzled hard into hectors gun the impact powering the weapon from his hand hector staggered into a room beyond the stairs pilgrim firing the back of hectors jacket tearing as a bullet hit him between neck and arm but hector kept going out the front the young arab swiveled his gun toward pilgrim firing blindly in panic pilgrim retreated back down the hallway and out the back door the remaining two cellar agents had fled the kitchen and were running across the yard the uninjured one carrying the man pilgrim had shot pilgrim hit the grass ran around the house toward the stone wall a blast of gunfire erupted from the houses upper windows the cia trainees were awake and pissed bullets churned the lawn by his feet they were shooting at him in the darkness thinking he was the enemy in the sudden gleam of the vans headlights on the street pilgrim saw hector hauling himself over the stone wall lights flickered on at the safe house upstairs downstairs pilgrim hit the stone wall vaulted over it agony flamed his shoulder the cellar van kicked to life and in the rising glow of lights from the safe house he saw the van tech not hector at the wheel slowing long enough for the woman with the broken arm to stagger inside where was hector the van surged at him pedal to the floor closing on him and he dodged the impact jumping into high weeds a bullet snipping off the tops of the grasses by his head he went low and ran and the van accelerated past him took off four lots further down a car started on a cracked driveway that lacked a house no lights hector pilgrim turned and dashed through the yards the empty lots hauled himself over a newly built fence reached his own car he revved back onto west end saw hectors car in the distance hector turned onto veterans boulevard heading west his cars headlights coming alive pilgrim followed long enough to believe that hector was not heading back to the cellar safe house in metairie but further west toward the airport toward where ben thought hector had a hiding hole run home your sorryass bastard pilgrim thought his arm ached he steered with his elbow did a onehanded click through the call log to the stolen cell phone ben had dialed no answer run home your sorry bastard he thought run home so ben and i can kill you ben turned onto a darkened street near louis armstrong international warehousing and storage facilities lined the street he saw signs for fema and a bevy of government contractors some of whom had once been clients of his the address he had was for an entire complex of warehouses with a darkened empty guard station but the wooden arm was down he noticed there was a passkey reader he tried the passkey hed taken from jackie and the arm lifted and he drove into the complex a scattering of cars sat in the parking lot slots near the various warehousesthere were at least four large warehouses the one he wanted b lay dark no cars close by he parked jackies rental near the doorlet hector see jackie was back safe and sound the sign on the door indicated this was mls limited the name of one of the shell companies used by hector he must have rented the space in this name not hector global ben tried the two keys on jackies ring that didnt have the rental car company tag on it the second one worked with his heart in his throat he eased open the door darkness he locked the door behind him it closed with a soft click he held the gun in one hand even if he died now vochek would have enough to put pressure on hector but he was not going to wait on juries and lawyers and trials to avenge emily ben took a shambling step forward in the darkness hand out he touched wall found the hinge and frame of the door he slid fingers along cool steel and closed them around a doorknob he stepped into a darkened hallway where a gleam of light lined the frame of a big set of double doors he headed for them his heart pounding loud enough he thought to echo against the walls he found a light switch flicked it on he tried the pilots cell phone againthe battery was completely drained useless he closed it and began to explore half the warehouse space was a maze of cubicles thrown up in apparent haste the other half held nothing most of the cubicles were empty bare of computer or chair he went to the largest office guessing it belonged to a senior manager he broke the door open with a fire extinguisher the laptop inside wasnt passworded he began to search the networks file hierarchy most of mlss business seemed tied to contracts for rebuilding government offices in new orleans and the mississippi gulf coast nothing of interest he searched for the name reynolds found payment spreadsheets financing months of software development he picked up the desk phone called the hotel marquis de lafayette asked to be connected to suite vochek my god ben where the hell are you she sounded furious he gave her the address i found hectors records of underwriting reynoldss research he funded a lot of stuff through one of these shell companies you should get over here he gave her the address and she hung up what else was here he thought of what hed found about mls when he hunted through the business databases back in the blarneys bar its founding had been close to the time of emilys death he opened the email database hunted for messages from hector from the time that the company was founded he found several searched through them one included a spreadsheet from hector with a note here are payments we need made please do electronically only

wall easing out of a black leather jacket his back wet with blood gasping jackies not here ben aimed jackies gun at hector his voice didnt sound like his own anymore cool quiet as though rage had reached a level that did not demand anger or screaming or confusion as to why a tragedy had destroyed his life now there was only what had to be done ben hector raised his gun and pulled the trigger clicked on empty hector closed his eyes its damaged anyway he dropped the gun with a clatter and with a black smile like he didnt need the gun it made bens skin prickle even i know to count my bullets

hectors brain listen ben how many laws have you broken in this insane pursuit dozens youre going to need serious help i can help you he slowed his speech as though he could double the persuasive power of each word we can help each other on the other side of the warehouse a window shattered you never told me why you killed emily ben said she must have found out about the multiple companies you were setting up that you wanted to have no trace back to hector global so you could spend money doing all sorts of dirty work he heard footsteps behind him you explain something to me i found a payment to the cellars financial front sparta consulting from one of your sham companies the day after she died ben pilgrim his shoulder bloodied he staggered into the warehouse holding a gun he came close to ben less than five feet away he aimed his gun at hector did you stop the attack bens voice rang hard as iron yes would you please shoot the bastard then maybe you can patch me up again pilgrim stumbled i will when you tell me who killed emily hector did pilgrim said no ben shook his head hectors buddies in the cia wanted her dead because the sham companies hector set up were for them and she found out they gave the dirty job to teach i found the payment i have to know who inside the cellar killed her maui hector said a helpful tone two years ago a single shot through a kitchen window i have pictures a friend in the cia gave me pilgrims face pale from loss of blood went the color of bone what who killed her pilgrim ben said ben i dont know i think you do know hectors voice was iron flight through dallas on the payment schedule ben i think you know who likes to fly through dallas see his kid whenever he can bens eyes went wide the gun shook in his hand the silence in the warehouse pressed like the dead air inside a sealed coffin ben pilgrim tried to say maui did you kill a woman in maui two years ago ben whispered answer me pilgrim opened and shut his mouth teach wrote up a list of all the jobs for me thats when i knew emily was a cellar job hector said i didnt order her death ben my friends at the cia did they sent their best to do the worst in the dallas apartment hector had started to speak of emily and hed said you mean who and raised the gun to shoot ben and teach had launched herself at him before he could finish ben closed his eyes for just a half second then turned the gun toward pilgrim drop your gun get over by the wall with him right now ben i i pilgrim stopped he dropped the gun put a hand to his forehead hector spoke in a low voice and to ben it sounded like bones cracking teach was told by one of her taskmasters that emily was selling secrets to china that she was meeting a chinese agent in maui to pass agency secrets shed learned through my contracts with the agency she had to be taken out is this true ben yelled he remembered pilgrims litany of sins a couple of times i killed people selling secrets to the chinese pilgrim looked up from the concrete and met his stare yes ben i yes i killed her ben thought his head would explode from the wave of pain you you i had no idea pilgrim said they gave me an address and her description nothing else about her ben thought he didnt even know her name he pulled the trigger ben thats all that matters hector said pilgrim swallowed tried to speak failed then managed i i was told to wait for a phone call it would mean to go ahead you have to kill him what ben had thought in the fury of the fight with jackie the thoughts crowded into his head like a cancer ben hector said your only hope is to make a deal with me what do you want in compensation ill give it to you bringing me down wont bring emily back your careers over now you know that you may be facing prison time my contacts in the government can pardon you i have the power to save you ben he has nothing you just have to stay quiet you stay quiet ben said he kept his stare locked on pilgrim my hands are clean his are bloodied you do whats necessary ben pilgrim said quietly the word necessary burned bens brain like a hot iron against flesh you do the necessary work hed reassured pilgrim more than once during the past few days his chest ached ben steadied the gun on pilgrim you shot my wife to death every word was ice in bens throat pilgrim nodded as though a noose already decorated his neck slowly he closed his eyes his mouth worked ben shoot him hector said nothing can bring back emily but you dont have to let him live shoot him youre a hero youve killed a rogue cia agent the government will exonerate you from all charges pilgrim made a square with fingers over his heart your aim sucks hit inside here and its done ben fired the bullet caught the chest perfectly and hector jerked and whimpered at the spreading crimson blossom on his shirt pilgrim killed her ben said but you gave the order hector sagged to the floor expression blanking a gurgle and then he was done the bullet perfect in the chest ben raised the gun again at pilgrim he still held the square for vengeance over his heart one bullet left bens grip tightened on the gun decide put your hands down ben said im not going to kill you they lied to you about her pilgrim lowered his hands he took a step toward ben im so sorry because you are my friend god help you the gun trembled in bens hand then he lowered it and turned away from pilgrim ben get the hell away from me please just go the door busted inward vochek and four men in homeland security windbreakers rushed the room guns out and ready ben and pilgrim froze five feet apart the guns swiveled on ben the only one obviously armed ben drop your weapon vochek ordered ben obeyed the pistol clattered to the concrete move away from the gun one of the men ordered and ben took a step back pilgrim on the ground now vochek said she softened her tone please pilgrim didnt move he ignored the men and vochek i thought we won i thought we finally won how many bullets left ben one ben said but dont shut up and get on the ground one of the agents yelled pilgrim looked straight into bens eyes necessary he said then jumped for bens gun his fingers closed around it lifted it from the floor the shots cannoned and echoed an awful salute pilgrim staggered against the wall sliding down while blood smeared the gray concrete behind him ben grabbed pilgrim and caught him before he sprawled on the floor held him through the rattle of his final breaths then lowered him to the ground khaleds reportvirginia i have not been asked to write my thoughts for a report for four months since the attack on the house in new orleans perhaps it is time again for another analysis of my handwriting by the folks in langley to see if i have lost my nerve to stay with my job at first when i realized the house was being breachedi thought it was a test then the gunfire simply sounded far too real i hurried down the steps and i saw an older man he raised a gun at me and stupidly i froze i will never make that mistake again then a second man shot the gun from the older mans hand and i shot at the second man because i was scared to death the man who saved mei will never forget his face determined courageous but hard unyielding like stone it is the face i try to wear as i do my job i wasnt sure that we would be permitted to begin our workthere was of course fear that we had been compromised our names found to be fed back to the terrorist networks we seek to destroy but then we were assured that everyone who had found out about our names was dead the people who attacked us were misled i do not know what happened to our attackers who escaped we were all moved that morning to another house this one in atlanta there we waited to know our fates now i am back for a short visit the terrorist rivals to blood of fire the scum who paid khaled murad to kill my brothers with a bomb have cells across europe i have infiltrated such a cell in pariswith a certain amount of ease as they believe i think my brothers were cut down by the israeli and americans and that i am a highly motivated convert to their cause the cell believes i am doing their filthy work by scouring bombing locations they want to start a wave of terror attacks against banks and stock brokerages in america saudi arabia jordan and france to weaken the economies to fray the strength of alliances i expect to have the details soon and if i do my job right the attacks will never happen and an interconnection of cells from paris to new york and beyond will be compromised and destroyed and no other innocent families will have to suffer that drives me keeps me sharp keeps me alive until the work is done they tell me if my cover and my name are blown they will give me a new life protect me perhaps they might just send me to work somewhere else which is fine as once the taste of deception gets in your bloodit is nearly unimaginable to live without it i have to go back to work i remember the mans face and i hope i wear a similar mask of strength and resolve a month after new orleans ben forsberg sat on a park bench under the shade of a pine tree in tyler texas he was waiting for the girl and her mother to walk by he had shadowed them for a few days carefully so that they didnt notice him watching them picking the right moment to say hello the east texas summer was in full brutal bloom and the humidity and heat beat like a whip but a temperamental wind rising and fading offered a touch of relief the park was full dogs walked beside their masters boys sliced the sky with frisbees picnickers lounged in the shade couples strolled under the pines then here came the mother and daughter holding a kite laughing he walked and then stopped in front of them mrs choate the woman froze and it took her a good five seconds to break her silence well i once was im kimberly dawson now the girl gaped at him ben flicked an awkward smile my name is ben forsberg i knew your husband randall in indonesia oh my god the woman said what was said about him wasnt true he wasnt a drug smuggler he was framed i thought you should know the truth the two women were silent the teenager trembled as if she might turn and run is this a sick joke mrs dawson said its not at all funny no joke please just give me a minute tamara you look like your dad i know tamara said ive seen pictures mrs dawson stepped closer to the girl did you want something mr forsberg she put a protective arm around the girl as though she were not happy with the past reaching out toward them in the sunlight of a perfect summer day i thought tamara might like to have a keepsake of her fathers he handed the girl a sketchbook small and black a hole marred the lower right corner im sorry its damaged tamara opened the book and gasped at the sketches of herself from babyhood onward her face captured in perfect details she put a hand over her mouth how did he know what i would look like tamara flipped through the pages my god mom these drawings theyre amazing she stopped at the drawing of herself sitting on a park bench in the cooling shade of the pines stared at the paper and then up at the park around her as if it could not be realizing what the picture meant looking up the hill to see where the man must have stood and watched good imagination mrs dawson said in a voice tinged with frost do you work for my late husbands company mr forsberg he sensed she knew something of his work for the cia noi was just his friend he leaned down to the girl tamara i didnt know your father for very long but i know that he loved you very much you can see it in the sketches his love for you and i know he always wanted to do the right thing i know he would have loved to have his life with you i really wish he could have everything would have been different everything pilgrims life bens life tamara closed the book folded her fingers around it she seemed too stunned to smile or cry thank you youre welcome ben said to them both and walked away out of the shadow of the pines into the bright sunlight into his beginning acknowledgments many thanks to ben sevier brian tart lisa johnson erika
