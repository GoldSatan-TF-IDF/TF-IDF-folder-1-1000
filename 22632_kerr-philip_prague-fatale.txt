prague fatale philip kerr prologue mondaytuesday june it was a fine warm day when together with ssobergruppenfuhrer reinhard tristan eugen heydrich the reichsprotector of bohemia and moravia i arrived back from prague at berlins anhalter station we were both wearing sd uniform but unlike the general i was a man with a spring in my step a tune in my head and a smile in my heart i was glad to be home in the city of my birth i was looking forward to a quiet evening with a good bottle of mackenstedter and some kemals i had liberated from heydrichs personal supply at his office in hradschin castle but i wasnt in the least worried he might discover this petty theft i wasnt worried about anything very much i was everything that heydrich was not i was alive the berlin newspapers gave out that the unfortunate reichsprotector had been assassinated by a team of terrorists who had parachuted into bohemia from england it was a little more complicated than this only i wasnt about to say as much not yet not for a long time maybe not ever its difficult to say what happened to heydrichs soul assuming he ever had one i expect dante alighieri could have pointed me in the approximate direction if ever i felt inclined to go and search for it somewhere in the underworld on the other hand ive a pretty good idea of what happened to his body everyone enjoys a good funeral and the nazis were certainly no exception giving heydrich the best sendoff that any psychopathically murderous criminal could have hoped for the whole event was mounted on such a grand scale you would have thought some satrap in the persian empire had died after winning a great battle and it seemed that everything had been laid on except the ritual sacrifice of a few hundred slaves although as things turned out for a small czech mining village called lidice i was wrong about that from anhalter station heydrich was carried to the conference hall of gestapo headquarters where six honour guards wearing black dress uniforms watched over his lyinginstate for a lot of berliners it was a chance to sing dingdong the witch is dead while sneaking a wary tiptoes look inside the prinz albrecht palace on a par with other semihazardous activities like climbing to the top of the old radio tower in charlottenburg or driving on the bank at the avus speedway it was nice to be able to say that youd done it on the radio that night the leader eulogized the dead heydrich describing him as the man with the iron heart which i assume he meant to be a compliment then again its possible that our own wicked wizard of oz might simply have confused the tin man with the cowardly lion the next day wearing civilian clothes and feeling altogether more human i joined thousands of other berliners outside the new reich chancellery and tried to look suitably gloomy as the whole ants nest of hitlers myrmidons came bursting out of the mosaic hall to follow the gleaming gun carriage as it bore heydrichs flagdraped coffin east along voss strasse and then north up wilhelmstrasse toward the generals final resting place in the invaliden cemetery alongside some real german heroes like von scharnhorst ernst udet and manfred von richthofen there was no doubting heydrichs bravery his impetuous parttime active service with the luftwaffe while most of the top brass stayed safe in their wolfs redoubts and their furlined bunkers was the most obvious example of this courage i suppose hegel might just have recognized heydrichs heroism as the incarnation of the spirit of our despotic times but for my money heroes need to have a working relationship with the gods not the titan forces of darkness and disorder especially in germany so i wasnt in the least bit sorry to see him dead because of heydrich i was an officer in the sd and pressed into the tarnished silver cap badge that was the loathsome symbol of my long acquaintance with heydrich were the hallmarks of hatred fear and after my return from minsk guilt too that was nine months ago mostly i try not to think about it but as another famous german lunatic once observed its hard to look over the edge of the abyss without the abyss looking back into you chapter september the thought of suicide is a real comfort to me sometimes its the only way i can get through a sleepless night on such a night and there were plenty of them i used to dismantle my walther automatic pistol and meticulously oil the metal jigsaw of pieces id seen too many misfires for the want of a welloiled gun and too many suicides gone badly wrong because a bullet entered a mans skull at an acute angle i would even unload the tiny staircase that was the singlestack magazine and polish each bullet lining them up in a rank like neat little brass soldiers before selecting the cleanest and the brightest and the keenest to please to sit on top of the rest i wanted only the best of them to blast a hole in the wall of the prison cell that was my thick skull and then bore a tunnel through the grey coils of despond that were my brain all of this might explain why so many suicides go wrongly reported to the cops he was just cleaning his gun and it went off said the dead mans wife of course guns go off all the time and sometimes they even kill the person holding them but first you have to put the cold barrel against your head the back of the head is best and pull the damned trigger once or twice i even laid a couple of folded bath towels under the pillow on my bed and lay down with the firm intent of actually going through with it theres a lot of blood that leaks out of a head with even a small hole in it i would lie there and stare at the suicide note that was written on my best paper bought in paris and placed carefully on the mantelpiece addressed to no one in particular no one in particular and i had a pretty close relationship in the late summer of after a while sometimes i would go to sleep but the dreams i had were unsuitable for anyone under the age of twentyone probably they were unsuitable for conrad veidt or max schreck once i awoke from such a terrible vivid heartstopping dream that i actually fired my pistol as i sat bolt upright on the bed the clock in my bedroom my mothers walnut vienna wall clock was never the same again on other nights i just lay there and waited for the grey light to strengthen at the edge of the dusty curtains and the total emptiness of another day courage was no good anymore nor was being brave the endless interrogation of my wretched self produced not regret but only more selfloathing to all outside eyes i was the same man i had always been bernie gunther kriminal commissar from the alex and yet i was merely a blur of who i had been an imposter a knot of feelings felt with gritted teeth and a lump in the throat and an awful echoing lonely cavern in the pit of my stomach but after my return from the ukraine it wasnt just me that felt different it was berlin too we were almost two thousand kilometres from the front but the war was very much in the air this wasnt anything to do with the british royal air force who despite fat hermanns empty promises that no english bomb would ever fall on the german capital had managed to put in irregular but nonetheless destructive appearances in our night skies but by the summer of they hardly visited us at all no it was russia that now affected each and every aspect of our lives from what was in the shops to how you occupied your spare time for a while dancing had been forbidden to how you got around the city the jews are our misfortune proclaimed the nazi newspapers but nobody really believed von treitschkes slogan by the autumn of and certainly not when there was the more obvious and selfinflicted disaster that was russia with which to compare it already the campaign in the east was running out of momentum and because of russia and the overriding needs of our army berlin felt more like the capital of a banana republic that had run out of bananas as well as almost everything else you could think of there was very little beer and often none at all taverns and bars closed for one day a week then two sometimes altogether and after a while there were only four bars in the city where you could regularly obtain a pot of beer not that it tasted like beer when you did manage to track some down the sour brown brackish water that we nursed bitterly in our glasses reminded me most of the liquidfilled shellholes and still pools of no mans land in which sometimes we had been obliged to take cover for a berliner that really was a misfortune spirits were impossible to come by and all of this meant that it was almost impossible to get drunk and escape from oneself which late at night often left me cleaning my pistol the meat ration was no less disappointing to a population for whom the sausage in all its forms was a way of life allegedly we were each of us entitled to five hundred grammes a week but even when meat was available you were just as likely to receive only fifty grammes for a hundredgramme coupon following a poor harvest potatoes disappeared altogether so did the horses that pulled the milk wagons not that this mattered very much as there was no milk in the churns there was only powdered milk and powdered eggs both of which tasted like the masonry dust shaken from our ceilings by raf bombs bread tasted like sawdust and many swore thats exactly what it was clothing coupons paid for an emperors new clothes and not much else you couldnt buy a new pair of shoes and it was almost impossible to find a cobbler to repair your old ones like everyone else with a trade most of berlins cobblers were in the army ersatz or secondrate goods were everywhere string snapped when you tried to pull it tight new buttons broke in your fingers even while you were trying to sew them on toothpaste was just chalk and water with a bit of peppermint flavouring and there was more lather to be had in queuing for soap than in the crumbling biscuitsized shard you were allocated to keep yourself clean for a whole month even those of us who werent party members were starting to smell a bit with all of the tradesmen in the army there was no one to maintain the trams and buses and as a result whole routes like the number one that went down unter den linden were simply done away with while half of berlins trains were physically removed to help supply the russian campaign with all the meat and potatoes and beer and soap and toothpaste you couldnt find at home and it wasnt just machinery that went neglected everywhere you looked the paint was peeling off walls and woodwork doorknobs came away in your hand plumbing and heating systems broke down scaffolding on bombdamaged buildings became more or less permanent as there were no roofers left to carry out repairs bullets worked perfectly of course just like always german munitions were always good i could testify to the continuing excellence of ammunition and the weapons that fired it but everything else was broken or secondrate or substitute or closed or unavailable or in short supply and tempers like rations were in the shortest supply of all the crosslooking black bear on our proud citys coat of arms began to look like a typical berliner growling at a fellow passenger on the sbahn roaring at an indifferent butcher as he gave you only half of the bacon to which your card said you were entitled or threatening a neighbour in your building with some party bigshot who would come and fix him good perhaps the quickest tempers were to be found in the lengthening queues for tobacco the ration was just three johnnies a day but when you were extravagant enough actually to smoke one it was easier to understand why hitler didnt smoke himself they tasted like burnt toast sometimes people smoked tea that is when you could get any tea but if you could it was always better to pour boiling water on the stuff and drink it around police headquarters at alexanderplatz this area also happened to be the centre of berlins black market which despite the very serious penalties that were inflicted on those who got caught was about the only thing in the city that could have been described as thriving the scarcity of petrol hit us almost as hard as the tobacco and alcohol shortages we took trains and buses to our crime scenes and when these werent running we walked often through the blackout which was not without hazard almost one third of all accidental deaths in berlin were a result of the blackout not that any of my colleagues in kripo were interested in attending crime scenes or in solving anything other than the enduring problem of where to find a new source of sausage beer and cigarettes sometimes we joked that crime was decreasing no one was stealing money for the simple reason that there wasnt anything in the shops to spend it on like most jokes in berlin in the autumn of that one was funnier because it was also true of course there was still plenty of theft about coupons laundry petrol furniture thieves used it for firewood curtains people used them to make clothes the rabbits and guinea pigs that people kept on their balconies for fresh meat you name it berliners stole it and with the blackout there was real crime violent crime if you were interested in looking for it the blackout was great if you were a rapist for a while i was back in homicide berliners were still killing each other although there wasnt a moment passed when i didnt think it risible that i should continue to believe that this mattered very much knowing what i now knew about what was happening in the east there wasnt a day when i didnt remember the sight of old jewish men and women being herded toward execution pits where they were dispatched by drunken laughing ss firing squads still i went through the motions of being a proper detective although it often felt like i was trying to put out a fire in an ashtray when down the road a whole city was the scene of a major conflagration it was while i was investigating the several homicides that came my way in early september that i discovered some new motives for murder that werent in the jurisprudence books motives that stemmed from the quaint new realities of berlin life the smallholder in weissensee who drove himself mad with coarse homemade vodka and then killed the postwoman with an axe a butcher in wilmersdorf who was stabbed with his own knife by the local airraid warden in a dispute about a short ration of bacon the young nurse from the rudolf virchow hospital who because of the citys acute accommodation crisis poisoned a yearold spinster in plotzensee so that she might have the victims betterappointed room an ss sergeant back on leave from riga who habituated to the mass killings that were going on in latvia shot his parents because he could see no reason not to shoot them but most of the soldiers who came home from the eastern front and were in a mood to kill someone killed themselves i might have done it myself but for the certainty that i wouldnt be missed at all and the sure knowledge that there were many others jews mostly who seemed to soldier on with so much less in life than i had yes in the late summer of it was the jews and what was happening to the jews that helped to persuade me against killing myself of course the oldfashioned sort of berlin murders the ones that used to sell newspapers were still committed husbands continued to murder their wives just like before and on occasion wives murdered their husbands from where i sat most of the husbands who got murdered bullies too free with their fists and their criticism had it coming ive never hit a woman unless wed talked about it first prostitutes got their throats cut or were battered to death as before and not just prostitutes in the summer preceding my return from the ukraine a lustkiller named paul ogorzow pleaded guilty to the rapes and murders of eight women and the attempted murders of at least eight more the popular press dubbed him the sbahn murderer because most of his attacks were carried out on trains or near sbahn stations that is why paul ogorzow came into my mind when late one night in the second week of september i was called to take a look at a body that had been found close to the line between the sbahn stations at jannowitz bridge and schlesischer in the blackout nobody was quite sure if the body was a mans or a womans which was more understandable when you took into account that it had been hit by a train and was missing its head sudden death is rarely ever tidy if it was they wouldnt need detectives but this one was as untidy as anything id seen since the great war when a mine or a howitzer shell could reduce a man to a mangled heap of bloody clothes and jagged bone in the blink of an eye perhaps that was why i was able to look at it with such detachment i hope so the alternative that my recent experience in the murder ghettoes of minsk had left me indifferent to the sight of human suffering was too awful to contemplate the other investigating detectives were wilhelm wurth a sergeant who was a big noise in the police sports movement and gottfried lehnhoff an inspector who had returned to the alex after having retired wurth was in the fencing team and the previous winter he had taken part in heydrichs skiing competition for the german police and won a medal wurth would have been in the army but for the fact that he was a year or two too old but he was a useful man to have along on a murder investigation in the event that the victim had skied onto the point of a sword he was a thin quiet man with ears like bellpulls and an upper lip that was as full as a walrus moustache it was a good face for a detective in the modern berlin police force but he wasnt quite as stupid as he looked he wore a plain grey doublebreasted suit carried a thick walking stick and chewed on the stem of a cherrywood pipe that was almost always empty but somehow he managed to smell of tobacco lehnhoff had a neck and head like a pear but he wasnt green like a lot of other cops hed been drawing his pension but with so many younger officers now serving in police battalions on the eastern front he had come back into the force to make a nice cosy corner for himself at the alex the little party pin he wore in the lapel of his cheap suit would only have made it easier for him to do as little real policing as possible we walked south down dircksen strasse to jannowitz bridge and then along the sbahn line with the river under our feet there was a moon and most of the time we didnt need the flashlights wed brought but we felt safer with them when the line veered back over the gasworks on holtmarkt strasse and the old julius pintsch lighting factory there wasnt much of a fence and it would have been easy to have stepped off the line and fallen badly over the gasworks we came across a group of uniformed policemen and railway workers further down the track i could just make out the shape of a train in schlesischer station im commissar gunther from the alex i said there seemed no point in showing him my beertoken this is inspector lehnhoff and sergeant wurth who called it in me sir one of the cops moved toward me and saluted sergeant stumm no relation i hope said lehnhoff there had been a johannes stumm who had been forced to leave the political police by fat hermann because he wasnt a nazi no sir sergeant stumm smiled patiently tell me sergeant i said why did you think that this might be a murder and not a suicide or an accident well its true stepping in front of a train is a most popular way to kill yourself these days said sergeant stumm especially if youre a woman me id use a firearm if i wanted to kill myself but women arent as comfortable with guns as men are now with this victim all of the pockets have been turned inside out sir its not something youd do if you were planning to kill yourself and its not something that a train would normally take the trouble to do either so that lets out it being an accident see maybe someone else found him before you did i suggested and just robbed him a copper maybe offered wurth wisely sergeant stumm ignored the suggestion unlikely sir im pretty sure i was the first on the scene the train driver saw someone on the track as he started to gain speed out of jannowitz he hit the brakes but by the time the train stopped it was too late all right lets have a look at him not a pretty sight sir even in the dark believe me ive seen worse ill take your word for that sir the uniformed sergeant led the way along the track and paused for a moment to switch on his flashlight and illuminate a severed hand that lay on the ground i looked at it for a minute or so before we walked on to where another police officer was waiting patiently beside a collection of ragged clothes and mangled human remains that had once been a human being for a moment i might have been looking at myself hold the flash on him while we take a look the body looked as if it had been chewed up and spat out by a prehistoric monster the corrugated legs were barely attached to an impossibly flat pelvis the man was wearing a workmans blue overalls with mittensized pockets that were indeed inside out as the sergeant had described so were the pockets in the oily rag that was his twisted flannel jacket where the head had been there was now a glistening jagged harpoon of bloody bone and sinew there was a strong smell of shit from bowels that had been crushed and emptied under the enormous pressure of a locomotives wheels i cant imagine what youve seen that could look worse than this poor fritz said sergeant stumm me neither observed wurth and turned away in disgust i dare say well all see some interesting sights before this war is over i said has anyone looked for the head ive got a couple of lads searching the area for it now said the sergeant one on the track and the other down below in case it fell into the gasworks or the factory yard i think youre probably correct i said it looks like a murder all right quite apart from the pockets which have been turned out theres that hand we saw the hand this was lehnhoff talking what about it i led them back along the track to take another look at the severed hand which i picked up and turned in my hands like it was an historic artefact or perhaps a souvenir once owned by the prophet daniel these cuts on the fingers look defensive to me i said as if he might have caught the knife of someone trying to stab him i dont know how you can tell that after a train just ran over him said lehnhoff because these cuts are much too thin to have been inflicted by the train and just look where they are along the flesh of the inside of the fingers and on the hand between the thumb and the forefinger thats a textbook defensive injury if i ever saw one gottfried all right lehnhoff said almost grudgingly i suppose you are the expert on murder perhaps only of late ive had a lot of competition there are plenty of cops out east young cops who know a lot more about murder than i do i wouldnt know said lehnhoff take my word for it theres a whole new generation of police experts out there i let this remark settle for a moment before adding very carefully for appearances sake i find that very reassuring sometimes that there are so many good men to take my place eh sergeant stumm yes sir but i could hear the doubt in the uniformed sergeants voice walk with us i said warming to him in a country where illtemper and petulance were the order of the day hitler and goebbels were forever ranting angrily about something the sergeants imperturbability was heartening come back to the bridge another pair of eyes might be useful yes sir what are we looking for now there was a weary sigh in lehnhoffs voice as if he could hardly see the point of investigating this case any further an elephant what something evidence youll certainly know it when you see it i said back up the track we found some blood spots on a railway sleeper and then some more on the edge of the platform outside the echoing glasshouse that was the station at jannowitz bridge below someone aboard a river barge that was quietly chugging through one of the many redbrick arches in the bridge shouted at us to extinguish our lights this was lehnhoffs cue to start throwing his weight around it was almost as if hed been waiting to get tough with someone and it didnt matter who were the police he yelled down at the barge lehnhoff was yet another angry german and were investigating a murder up here so mind your own business or ill come aboard and search you just because i can its everyones business if the tommy bombers see your lights said the voice not unreasonably wurths nose wrinkled with disbelief i shouldnt think thats very likely at all do you sir its been a while since the raf came this far east they probably cant get the petrol either i said i pointed my flashlight on the ground and followed a trail of blood along the platform to a place where it seemed to start from the amount of blood on the ground he was probably stabbed here then he staggered along the platform a ways before falling onto the track picked himself up walked a bit more and then got hit by the train to friedrichshagen it was the last one said sergeant stumm the one oclock lucky he didnt miss it said lehnhoff ignoring him i glanced at my watch it was three am well that gives us an approximate time of death i started to walk along the track in front of the platform and after a while i found a greyish green passportsized book lying on the ground it was an employment identification document much like my own except that this one was for foreigners inside was all of the information about the dead man i needed his name nationality address photograph and employer foreign workers book is it said lehnhoff glancing over my shoulder as i studied the victims details under my flashlight i nodded the dead man was geert vranken aged thirtynine born at dordrecht in the netherlands a volunteer railway worker living at a hostel in wuhlheide the face in the photograph was warylooking with a cleft chin that was slightly unshaven the eyebrows were short and the hair thinning to one side he appeared to be wearing the same thick flannel jacket as the one on the body and a collarless shirt buttoned up to the neck even as we were reading the bare details of geert vrankens shortish life another policeman was coming up the stairs of jannowitz station with what in the darkness looked like a small round bag i found the head sir reported the policeman it was on the roof of the pintsch factory he was holding the head by the ear which in the absence of much hair looked as good a way to carry around a severed head as any you could have thought of i didnt like to leave it up there sir no you were right to bring it along lad said sergeant stumm and taking hold of the other ear he laid the dead mans head carefully on the railway platform so that it was staring up at us not a sight you see everyday said wurth and looked away you want to get yourself up to plotzensee i remarked i hear the falling axe is very busy these days thats him all right said lehnhoff the man in the workers book wouldnt you say i agree i said and i suppose someone might have tried to rob him or else why go through his pockets youre sticking to the theory that this is a murder and not an accident then enquired lehnhoff yes i am for that reason sergeant stumm tutted loudly and then rubbed his stubbly jaw which sounded almost as loud bad luck for him but bad luck for the murderer too what do you mean i asked well if he was a foreign worker i cant imagine there was much more than fluff in his pockets its a hell of a disappointing thing to kill a man with the intent of robbing him and then find that he had nothing worth stealing i mean these poor fellows arent exactly well paid are they its a job objected lehnhoff better a job in germany than no job back in holland and whose fault is that said sergeant stumm i dont think i like your insinuation sergeant said lehnhoff leave it lehnhoff i said this isnt the time or the place for a political argument a man is dead after all lehnhoff grunted and tapped the head with the toe of his shoe which was enough to make me want to kick him off the platform well if someone did kill him like you say herr commissar itll be another of them foreign workers that probably did it you see if im wrong its dog eat dog in these foreignworker hostels dont knock it i said dogs know the importance of getting a square meal now and again and speaking for myself if its a choice between fifty grammes of dog and a hundred grammes of nothing then ill eat the dog anytime not me said lehnhoff i draw the line at guinea pigs so theres no way id ever eat a dog its one thing saying that sir said sergeant stumm but its another thing altogether trying to tell the difference maybe you havent heard but the cops over at zoo station are having to put on night patrols in the zoo on account of how poachers have been breaking in and stealing the animals apparently they just had their tapir taken whats a tapir asked wurth it looks a bit like pork i said so i expect thats what some unscrupulous butcher is calling it now good luck to him said sergeant stumm you dont mean that said lehnhoff a man needs more than a stirring speech by the mahatma propagandi to fill his stomach i said amen said sergeant stumm so youd look the other way if you knew what it was i dont know about that i said getting careful again i might have been suicidal but i wasnt stupid lehnhoff was just the type to report a fellow to the gestapo for wearing english shoes and i hardly wanted to spend a week in the cells removed from the comfort of my warm nighttime pistol but this is berlin gottfried looking the other way is what were good at i pointed at the severed head that lay at our feet you just see if im wrong chapter about a lot of things im not always right but about the nazis i wasnt often wrong geert vranken was a voluntary worker and had come to berlin in search of a better job than the one that was available to him in holland berlins railway which was experiencing a selfinflicted crisis in recruiting maintenance staff had been glad to have an experienced track engineer berlins police was less keen to investigate his murder in fact it didnt want to investigate the case at all but there was no doubting that the dutchman had been murdered when eventually his body was given its grudging cursory examination by the ancient doctor brought back from retirement to handle forensic pathology for the berlin police six stab wounds were found on what remained of his torso commissioner friedrichwilhelm ludtke who was now in charge of the berlin criminal police wasnt a bad detective it was ludtke who had successfully headed the sbahn murder investigation that led to the arrest and execution of paul ogorzow but as he himself explained to me in his newly carpeted office on the top floor of the alex there was an important new law coming down the pipe from the wilhelmstrasse and ludtkes boss wilhelm frick minister of the interior had ordered him to prioritize its enforcement at the expense of all other investigative matters ludtke a doctor of law was almost embarrassed to tell me what this important new law amounted to from september th he said all jews in germany and the protectorate of bohemia and moravia will be obliged to wear a yellow star inscribed with the word jew on their outer garments you mean like in the middle ages yes like in the middle ages well that should make them easier to spot great idea until recently ive found it rather hard to recognize who is a jew and who isnt of late they do look thinner and hungrier than the rest of us but thats about it frankly ive yet to see just one who looks anything like those stupid cartoons in der sturmer i nodded with fake enthusiasm yes this will certainly prevent them from looking exactly like the rest of us ludtke looking uncomfortable adjusted his wellstarched cuffs and collar he was a big man with thick dark hair neatly combed off a broad tanned forehead he wore a navyblue suit and a dark tie with a knot that was as small as the party badge in his lapel probably it felt just as tight on his neck when it came to speaking the truth a matching navyblue bowler hat was positioned on the corner of his doublepartners desk as if it was hiding something perhaps it was his lunch or just his conscience i wondered how the hat would look with a yellow star on the crown like a keystone kops helmet i thought something idiotic anyway i dont like this any more than you he said scratching the backs of his hands nervously i could tell he was dying for a smoke we both were without cigarettes the alex felt like an ashtray in a no smoking lounge id like it a whole lot less i think if i was jewish i said yes but you know what makes it almost unforgivable he opened a box of matches and bit one right now theres an acute shortage of material yellow material ludtke nodded i might have guessed mind if i have one of those help yourself he tossed the matches across the desk and watched as i fished one out and put it in the corner of my mouth im told theyre good for your throat are you worried about your health wilhelm isnt everyone thats why we do what were told in case we come down with a dose of the gestapo you mean like making sure jews wear their yellow stars thats right oh sure sure and while i can see the obvious importance of a law like that theres still the matter of the dead dutchman in case youd forgotten he was stabbed six times ludtke shrugged if he was german it would be different bernie but the ogorzow case was a very expensive investigation for this department we went way over budget youve no idea how much it cost to catch that bastard undercover police officers half the citys rail workers interviewed increased police presence at stations the overtime we had to pay out was enormous it really was a very difficult time for kripo to say nothing of the pressure we came under from the propaganda ministry its hard catching anyone when the newspapers arent even allowed to write about a case geert vranken was a rail worker i said and you think the ministry is going to be happy to learn that theres another killer at work on the sbahn this killer is different as far as i can tell nobody raped him and unless you count the train that drove over him nobody tried to mutilate him either but murder is murder and frankly i know exactly what theyll say that theres enough bad news around right now in case you hadnt noticed bernie this citys morale is already lower than a badgers arse besides we need those foreign workers thats what theyre going to tell me the last thing we want is germans thinking that theres a problem with our guest workers we had enough of that during the ogorzow case everyone in berlin was convinced that a german couldnt possibly have murdered all those women a lot of foreign workers were harassed and beaten up by irate berliners who thought that one of them must have done it you dont want to see any more of that do you christ there are problems enough on the trains and the underground as it is it took me almost an hour to come to work this morning i wonder why we bother to come in at all given that the ministry of propaganda is now deciding what we can and what we cant investigate are we really supposed to find people who look jewish and check to see if theyre wearing the right embroidery its laughable im afraid thats just how it is perhaps if there are any more stabbings like this one then we can devote some resources to an investigation but for now id rather you left this dutchy alone all right wilhelm if thats the way you want it i bit hard on my match but im beginning to understand your twentyaday match habit i guess its easier not to scream when youre chewing down on one of these as i stood up to leave i glanced up at the picture on the wall the leader stared me down in triumph but for a change he wasnt saying very much if anyone needed a yellow star it was him and sewn just over his heart assuming he had one an aiming spot for a firing squad the berlin city map on ludtkes wall told me nothing either when bernhard weiss one of ludtkes predecessors had been in charge of berlin kripo the map had been covered with little flags marking the incidents of crime in the city now it was empty there was it seemed no crime to speak of another great victory for national socialism oh by the way shouldnt someone tell the vranken family back in holland that their major breadwinner stopped a train with his face i will speak to the state labour service said ludtke you can safely leave it to them i sighed and rolled my head wearily on my shoulders it felt thick and heavy like an old medicine ball i feel reassured already you dont look it he said whats the matter with you these days bernie youre a real bat in the balls do you know that whenever you walk in here its like rain coming in at the eaves its like youve given up maybe i have well dont im ordering you to pull yourself together i shrugged wilhelm if i knew how to swim id first untie the anvil thats tied around my legs chapter prussia has always been an interesting place to live in especially if you were jewish even before the nazis jews were singled out for special treatment by their neighbours back in and the synagogues in neustettin and konitz and probably several other prussian towns too were burnt down then in when there were food riots and i was a young cop in uniform the many jewish shops of scheuenviertel which is one of berlins toughest neighbourhoods were singled out for special treatment because jews were suspected of pricegouging or hoarding or both it didnt matter jews were jews and not to be trusted most of the citys synagogues were destroyed of course in november at the top of fasanenstrasse where i owned a small apartment a vast but ruined synagogue remained standing and looking to all the world as if the future roman emperor titus had just finished teaching the city of jerusalem a lesson it seems that not much has changed since ad certainly not in berlin and it could only be a matter of time before we started crucifying jews on the streets i never walked past this ruin without a small sense of shame but it was quite a while before i realized there were jews living in my own building for a long time i was quite unaware of their presence so close to me lately however these jews had become easily recognizable to anyone that had eyes to see despite what id said to commissioner ludtke you didnt need a yellow star or a set of callipers to measure the length of someones nose to know who was jewish denied every amenity subject to a nine oclock curfew forbidden luxuries such as fruit tobacco or alcohol and allowed to do their shopping only for one hour at the end of the day when the shops were usually empty jews had the most miserable of lives and you could see that in their faces every time i saw one i thought of a rat only the rat had a kripo beertoken in his coat pocket with my name and number inscribed on it i admired their resilience so did many other berliners even some nazis i thought less about hating or even killing myself whenever i considered what the jews had to put up with to survive as a jew in berlin in the autumn of was to be a person of courage and strength even so it was hard to see the two fridmann sisters who occupied the flat underneath my own surviving for much longer one of them raisa was married with a son efim but both he and raisas husband mikhail arrested in were still in prison the daughter sarra escaped to france in and had not been heard of since these two sisters the older one was tsilia knew i was a policeman and were rightly wary of me we rarely ever exchanged much more than a nod or a good morning besides contact between jews and aryans was strictly forbidden and since the block leader would have reported this to the gestapo i judged it better for their sake to keep my distance after minsk i ought not to have been so horrified at the yellow star but i was maybe this new law seemed worse to me because of what i knew awaited those jews who were deported east but after my conversation with commissioner ludtke i resolved to do something although it was a day or two before i figured out what this might be my wife had been dead for twenty years but i still had some of her dresses and sometimes when id managed to overcome the shortages and have a drink or two and i was feeling sorry for myself and more particularly for her id get one of her old garments out of the closet and press the material to my nose and mouth and inhale her memory for a long time after she was gone that was what i called a home life when shed been alive we had soap so my memories were all pleasant ones these days things were rather less fragrant and if you were wise you boarded the sbahn holding an orange stuffed with cloves like a medieval pope going among the common people especially in summer even the prettiest girl smelled like a stevedore in the dog days of at first i figured on giving the two fridmann sisters the yellow dress so that they could use it for making yellow stars only there was something about this i didnt like i suppose it made me feel complicit in the whole horrible police order especially since i was a policeman so halfway down the stairs with the yellow dress draped over my arm i went back to my flat and fetched all of the dresses that were in my closet but even this felt inadequate and as i handed over my wifes remaining wardrobe to these harmless women i quietly decided to do something more it isnt exactly a page from some heroic tale as described by winckelmann or holderlin but thats how this whole story got started if it hadnt been for the decision to help the fridmann sisters id never have met arianne tauber and what happened wouldnt have happened back inside my apartment i smoked the last of my cigarettes and contemplated putting my nose in some records at the alex just to see if mikhail and efim fridmann were still alive well that was one thing i could do but for anyone with a purple j on their ration cards it wasnt going to help feed them two women who looked as thin as the fridmann sisters were going to need something more substantial than just some information about their loved ones after a while i had what i thought was a good idea and fetched a german army breadbag from my closet in the bread bag was a kilo of algerian coffee beans id purloined in paris and which id been planning to trade for some cigarettes i left my flat and took a tram east as far as potsdamer station it was a warm evening not yet dark couples were strolling arm in arm through the tiergarten and it seemed almost impossible that two thousand kilometres to the east the german army was surrounding kiev and slowly tightening its stranglehold on leningrad i walked up to pariser platz i was on my way to the adlon hotel to see the maitre d with the aim of trading the coffee for some food that i could give the two sisters the maitre d at the adlon that year was willy thummel a fat sudeten german who was always busy and so light on his toes that it made me wonder how he ever got fat in the first place with his rosy cheeks his easy smile and his impeccable clothes he always reminded me of herman goring without a doubt both men enjoyed their food although the reichsmarshal had always given me the impression that he might just have eaten me too if hed been hungry enough willy liked his food but he liked people more there were no customers in the restaurant not yet and willy was checking the blackout curtains when i poked my nose around the door like any good maitre d he spotted me immediately and quickly came my way on invisible casters bernie you look troubled are you all right whats the point of complaining willy i dont know the wheel that squeaks the loudest in germany these days usually gets the most grease what brings you here a word in private willy we went down a small flight of stairs to an office willy closed the door and poured two small glasses of sherry i knew he was seldom away from the restaurant for longer than it took to inspect the china in the mens room so i came straight to the point when i was in paris i liberated some coffee i said real coffee not the muck we get in germany beans algerian beans a whole kilo i put the bread bag on willys desk and let him inspect the contents for a moment he just closed his eyes and inhaled the aroma then he groaned a groan that id seldom heard outside a bedroom youve certainly earned that drink id forgotten what real coffee smells like i hit my tonsils with the sherry a kilo you say thats a hundred marks on the black market last time i tried to get any and since there isnt any coffee to be had anywhere its probably more no wonder we invaded france for coffee like this id crawl into leningrad they havent got any there either i let him refill my glass the sherry was hardly the best but then nothing was not even in the adlon not any more i was thinking that you might like to treat some of your special guests yes i might he frowned but you cant want money not for something as precious as this bernie even the devil has to drink mud with powdered milk in it these days he took another noseful of the aroma and shook his head so what do you want the adlon is at your disposal i dont want that much i just want some food you disappoint me theres nothing we have in our kitchens thats worthy of coffee like this and dont be fooled by whats on the menu he collected a menu off the desk and handed it to me there are two meat dishes on the menu when the kitchen can actually serve only one but we put two on for the sake of appearances what can you do we have a reputation to uphold suppose someone asks for the dish you dont have i said impossible willy shook his head as the first customer comes through the door we cross off the second dish its hitlers choice which is to say its no choice at all he paused you want food for this coffee what kind of food i want food in cans ah the quality isnt important as long as its edible canned meat canned fruit canned milk canned vegetables whatever you can find enough to last for a while you know canned goods are strictly forbidden dont you thats the law all canned goods are for the war front if youre stopped on the street with canned food youd be in serious trouble all that precious metal theyll think youre going to sell it to the raf i know it but i need food that can last and this is the best place to get it you dont look like a man who cant get to the shops bernie it isnt for me willy i thought not in which case its none of my business what you want it for but i tell you what commissar for coffee like this i am ready to commit a crime against the state just as long as you dont tell anyone now come with me i think we have some canned goods from before the war we went along to the hotel storeroom this was as big as the lockup underneath the alex but easier on the ear and the nose the door was secured with more padlocks than the german national bank in there he filled my bread bag with as many cans as it could carry when these cans are gone come and get some more if youre still at liberty and if youre not then please forget you ever met me thanks willy now i have a small favour to ask you bernie which might even be to your advantage theres an american journalist staying here in the hotel one of several as it happens his name is paul dickson and he works for the mutual broadcasting system he would dearly like to visit the war front but apparently such things are forbidden everything is forbidden now the only way we know whats permitted is if we do something and manage to stay out of prison now i know you are recently returned from the front and you notice i dont ask what its like out there in the east just seeing a compass these days makes me feel sick i dont ask because i dont want to know you might even say this is why i went into the hotel business because the outside world is of no concern to me the guests in this hotel are my world and thats all the world i need to know their happiness and satisfaction is all that i care about so for mr dicksons happiness and satisfaction i ask that you meet with him but not here in the hotel no not here its hardly safe to talk in the adlon there are several suites of rooms on the top floor that have been taken over by people from the foreign office and these people are guarded by german soldiers wearing steel helmets can you imagine it soldiers here in the adlon intolerable its just like all over again but without the barricades what are workers from the foreign office doing here that they cant do in the ministry some of them are destined for the new foreign travel office when its finished but the rest are typing morning noon and night theyre typing like its for a speech by the mahatma what are they typing theyre typing up releases for the american press most of whom are also staying here which means that there are gestapo in the bar possibly there are even secret microphones i dont know for sure but this is what i heard which is another source of grief for us this dickson fellow is he in the hotel right now willy thought for a moment i think so dont mention my name just tell him that if hes interested in a bit of life poetry and truth ill be beside the goethe statue in the tiergarten i know it just off herman goring strasse ill wait fifteen minutes for him and if he comes he should come alone no friends just him and me and goethe i dont want any witnesses when i speak to him these days there are plenty of amis who work for the gestapo and im not sure about goethe i hoisted the bread bag onto my back and walked out of the adlon onto pariser platz where it was already getting dark one of the only good things about the blackout was that you couldnt see the nazi flags but the brutal outlines of speers partly constructed foreign travel office were still visible in the distance against the purpling night sky dominating the landscape west of the brandenburg gate rumour had it that hitlers favourite architect albert speer was using russian pows to help complete a building that no one other than hitler seemed to want rumour also had it that there was a new network of tunnels under construction connecting government buildings on wilhelmstrasse with secret bunkers that extended under herman goring strasse as far as the tiergarten it was never good to pay too much attention to rumours in berlin for the simple reason that these were usually true i stood by the statue of goethe and waited after a while i heard a quite low in the sky as it headed southeast toward the airfield at tempelhof and then another for anyone whod been in russia it was an instantly recognizable and reassuring sound like an enormous but friendly lion yawning in an empty cave and quite different from the noise of the much slower raf whitleys that occasionally ploughed through berlin skies like tractors of death and destruction good evening said the man walking toward me im paul dickson the american from the adlon he hardly needed the introduction his old spice and virginia tobacco came ahead of him like a motorcycle outrider with a pennant on his mudguard solid footsteps bespoke sturdy wingtip shoes that could have ferried him across the delaware the hand that pumped mine was part of a body that still consumed nutritious food his sweet and minty breath smelled of real toothpaste and testified to his having access to a dentist with teeth in his head who was still a decade off retirement and while it was dark i could almost feel his tan as we exchanged cigarettes and conversational bromides i wondered if the real reason berliners disliked americans was less to do with roosevelt and his antigerman rhetoric and more to do with their better health their better hair their better clothes and their altogether better lives willy said youve just come back from the front he said speaking german that was also better than i had expected yes thats right care to talk about it talking about it is about the only means of committing suicide for which i seem to have the nerve i confessed i can assure you sir i am nothing to do with the gestapo if thats what youre implying i dare say thats exactly what someone who was a gestapo informer would tell you but to be quite frank with you theres nothing they have that i want except perhaps a good story id kill for a good story have you killed many frankly i dont see how i could have done as soon as they know im an american most berliners seem to want to hit me they seem to hold me personally responsible for all the ships weve been giving to the british dont worry berliners have never been interested in having a navy i said that kind of thing matters more in hamburg and bremen in berlin you can count yourself lucky that roosevelt never gave the tommies any beer or sausage or youd be dead by now i pointed toward potsdamer platz come on lets walk sure he said and followed me south out of the park anywhere in particular no but i need a few minutes to address the ball so to speak golfing man huh i used to play a bit before the nazis but its never really caught on since hitler its too easy to be bad at it which is not something nazis can deal with i appreciate your talking to me like this i havent told you anything yet right now im still wondering how much i can tell you without feeling like what was his name the traitor benedict benedict arnold thats right we crossed potsdamer onto leipziger platz i hope were not headed for the press club said dickson id feel like a bit of a fool if you took me in there to tell me your story he pointed at a door on the other side of the square where several officiallooking cars were parked i hear all kinds of bullshit in that place you dont say doctor froehlich the propaganda ministrys liaison officer for the american media he is always summoning us in there for special press conferences to announce yet another decisive victory for german forces against the red army him or one of those other doctors brauweiler or dietrich the doctors of deceit thats what we call them not forgetting the biggest deceiver of them all i said doctor goebbels dickson laughed bitterly its got so bad that when my own doctor says theres nothing wrong with me i just dont believe him you can believe him youre american provided you dont do anything stupid like declare war on russia most of you should live for ever dickson followed me across to wertheims department store in the moonlight you could see the huge map of the soviet union that occupied the main window so that any patriotic german might look at it and follow the heroic progress of our brave armed forces it wasnt like there was anything else in the store to put in the window when the place had been owned and run by jews it had been the best store in germany now it was little better than a warehouse and an empty one at that the shop assistants spent most of their time gossiping and ignoring the spectators you could hardly call them customers who wandered around the store in search of merchandise that simply wasnt there even the elevators werent working there was no one on the sidewalk in front of the window and it seemed as good a place as any to tell the american radio journalist the truth about our great patriotic war against the russians and the jews give me another one of your cigarettes if im going to cough up the whole story i want something inside me to help it along he handed me an almost full pack of american cigarettes and told me to keep it i lit one quickly and let the nicotine go and play in my brain for a moment i felt giddy and lightheaded like it was the first time i ever smoked but that was how it should have been it wouldnt have been right to have told dickson about the police battalions and resettlement and special actions and the minsk ghetto and pits that were full of dead jews without feeling a little sick inside which is exactly what i told him and you saw all of this now it was dickson who sounded sick inside im a captain in the sd i said i saw it all jesus its hard to believe you wanted to know i told you thats how it is worse than you could possibly imagine when they dont let you go somewhere its because they cant boast about what theyre doing you could have worked it out for yourself id be there right now but for the fact that im a bit particular about who i pull the trigger on they sent me home in disgrace im lucky they didnt send me to a punishment battalion you were in the sd dickson sounded just a bit nervous correct thats like the gestapo isnt it not exactly its the intelligence wing of the ss the abwehrs ugly little sister like a lot of men in the sd i came in through a side door marked no bloody choice i was a policeman at the alex before i was in the sd a proper policeman the kind who started out helping old ladies across the road not all of us make jews clean the street with a toothbrush you know i want you to know that me im a bit like frankensteins monster with the little girl at the lake theres a part of me that really wants to make friends and to be good dickson was quiet for a moment no one back home is going to believe this he said eventually not that id ever get it past the local press censor this is the trouble with radio you have to clear your copy in advance so leave the country go home and buy a typewriter write it up in the newspapers and tell the world i wonder if anyone would believe me there is that i can hardly believe it myself and i was there i saw it every night i go to bed in the hope that ill wake up and find that i imagined the whole thing perhaps if you told another american besides myself that would make the story more believable no thats your problem not mine look said dickson the man you should really meet is guido enderis hes the chief of the new york times berlin office i think you should tell him what you just told me i think ive talked enough for one evening odd but it makes me feel guilty in a whole new way before i only felt like a murderer now i feel like a traitor too please you know theres a limit to how guilty i can feel before i want to throw up or jump in front of a train dont do that captain whatever your name is the whole world needs to know whats happening on the eastern front the only way thats going to happen is if people like you are willing to talk about it and then what do you think its going to make a difference if americas not prepared to come in to the war for the sake of the british i cant believe theyre going to do it for the sake of russias jews maybe maybe not but you know sometimes one thing leads to another yeah look what happened back at munich in one thing led to absolutely nothing at all and your lot werent even at the negotiating table they were back home pretending it was nothing to do with the usa dickson couldnt argue with that how can i get in contact with you captain you cant ill speak to willy and leave a message with him if i decide im ready to puke another fur ball if its a question of money its not instinctively we both glanced up as another came rifling in from the northwest and i saw the moon illuminate the anxiety on dicksons smooth face when the sound was just a footnote on the horizon i heard him let out a breath i cant get used to that he confessed the way these fighters fly so low i keep expecting to see something blow up on the ground in front of me sometimes i wish it would but take my word for it a fighter tends to buzz a little louder when it decides to sting talking of things blowing up he said the three kings you hear anything only the doctors of deceit have been giving us the runaround back in may they said they had picked up two of the leaders and that it was only a matter of time before they got their hands on the third since when weve heard nothing we keep asking but no one says anything so we figure that number three must still be at liberty any truth in that you think i really cant say cant or just wont a cloud drifted across the moon like something dark over my soul cmon captain you must know something im just back from the ukraine so im a little behind with whats been happening here in berlin but if theyd caught melchior i think youd have heard all about that dont you through a megaphone melchior and i thought it was just the germans who were a godless race i walked away hey said dickson i saw that movie frankenstein and i remember that scene now doesnt the monster throw the little girl in the water yes sad isnt it i strolled south down to bulowstrasse where i turned west i might have walked all the way home but i noticed there was a hole in my shoe and at nolli i decided to get on the sbahn normally i would have taken the tram but the thirtythree was no longer running and since it was after nine oclock the only taxis around were those that were called by the police for the service of the sick the lame the old or travellers from railway stations with heavy bags and senior nazi party members of course they never had a problem getting a cab home after nine nolli was almost deserted which was not uncommon in the blackout all you could see were occasional cigarette ends moving through the darkness like fireflies or sometimes the phosphorescent lapel badge of someone keen to avoid a collision with another pedestrian all you could hear were the trains as they moved invisibly in and out of the art nouveau glass dome of the station overhead or disembodied voices snatches of passing conversations as if berlin was one big openair seance a ghostly effect that was enhanced by infrequent flashes of electric light from the rail track it was as if some modernday moses and who could have blamed him had stretched out his strong hand toward the sky to spread a palpable darkness over the land of germany surely it was time to let the israelites leave or at least to release them from their bondage i was almost on the stairs when from under the arches i heard the sound of a struggle i stopped for a moment looked around and as a cloud shifted lazily off the moon i got a son et lumiere view of a man attacking a woman she was lying on the ground trying to fight him off as with one hand over her mouth he fumbled under her skirt i heard a curse a muffled scream and then my own footsteps as they clattered down the stairs hey leave her alone i yelled the man appeared to punch the woman and as he stood up to face me i heard a click and caught a glimpse of the blade that was now in his hand if id been on duty i might have been carrying a firearm but i wasnt and as the man came toward me i shrugged the bread bag containing the food cans off my shoulder and swung it hard like a medieval ball and chain as he came within range the bag hit him on his extended arm knocking the blade out of his hand and he turned and fled with me in halfhearted pursuit the moonlight dimmed momentarily and i lost sight of him altogether a few moments later i heard a squeal of tyres from the corner of motz strasse and arriving in front of the american church i found a taxi with its door open and the driver staring at his front fender he just ran out in front of me said the driver you hit him i didnt have a chance well hes not here now he ran off i think where did he go toward the cinema theatre stay where you are im a police officer i told the driver and crossed the street but i might as well have looked inside a magicians top hat there was no sign of him so i went back to the taxi find him no how hard did you hit him i wasnt going fast if thats what you mean ten or fifteen kilometres an hour like youre supposed to do see but still i think i gave him a good old clunk he went right over the hood and landed on his head like he was off some nag at the hoppegarten pull into the side of the road and stay there i told the driver here he said how do i know youre a cop wheres your warrant disc its in my office at alex we can go straight there if you like and you can spend the next hour or two making out a report or you can do what i say the fellow you knocked down attacked a woman back there thats why he was running away because i chased him i was thinking you might take the lady home yeah all right i went back to the station on nollendorfplatz the girl whod been attacked was sitting up and rubbing her chin between adjusting her clothes and looking for her handbag are you all right i think so my bag he threw it on the ground somewhere i glanced around he got away but if its any consolation a taxi knocked him down i kept on looking for her bag but i didnt find it instead i found the switchblade here it is she said ive found it are you all right i feel a bit sick she said holding her jaw uncomfortably i wasnt feeling very comfortable myself i didnt have my beertoken and i had a bag full of canned food that within the limited purview of a uniformed bull would have marked me out as a blackmarketeer for which the penalties were very severe it was not uncommon for schmarotzers to receive death sentences especially if these also happened to be people who needed to be made an example of like policemen so i was anxious to be away from there no more did i want to accompany her to the local police station and report the matter not while i was still carrying the bread bag look i kept the taxi waiting where do you live ill take you home just off the kurfurstendamm next to the theatre centre good thats near me i helped her along to the taxi which was where id left it on the corner of motz strasse and told the driver where to go then we drove west along kleist strasse with the driver telling me in exhaustive detail just what had happened and how it wasnt his fault and that he couldnt believe the fellow hed collided with hadnt been more seriously injured how do you know he wasnt he ran off didnt he cant run with a broken leg believe me i know i was in the last war and i tried when we got to kurfurstendamm i helped the girl out of the car and she was promptly sick in the gutter must be my lucky night said the taxi driver youve got a funny idea of luck friend thats the only kind thats going these days the driver leaned out of the window and slammed the door shut behind us what i mean is she could have been sick in the cab and that fritz i hit i could have killed him see how much i asked that all depends on whether youre going to report this i dont know what the lady will want to do i said but if i were you id get going before she makes up her mind see the driver put the taxi cab in gear i was right it is my lucky night inside the building i helped the girl upstairs which is when i got a better look at her she was wearing a navyblue linen suit with a lacecotton blouse underneath the blouse was torn and a stocking was hanging down over one of her shoes these were plumcoloured like her handbag and the mark under one of her eyes from when shed been punched there was a strong smell of perfume on her clothes and i recognized guerlain shalimar by the time we reached her door i had concluded she was about thirty years old she had shoulderlength blond hair a wide forehead a broad nose high cheekbones and a sulky mouth then again she had a lot to feel sulky about she was about centimetres tall and against my arm felt strong and muscular strong enough to put up a fight when she was attacked but not strong enough to walk away without help i was glad about that she was goodlooking in a catlike way with narrow eyes and a tail that seemed to have a whole life of its own and made me want to have her on my lap for a while so that i could stroke it she found a door key and fumbled for the lock until i caught her hand and steered the key into the abus and turned it for her thanks she said ill be all right from here i think and but for the fact that she started to sit down on the floor i might have left her there instead i gathered her up in my arms and swung her through the door like an exhausted bride advancing into the barely furnished hall i encountered the house guard dog a barely dressed woman of about fifty with short bottleblond hair and more makeup than seemed strictly necessary outside of a circus tent almost at once and with a voice like baron ochs she started to reproach the halfconscious girl i was carrying for bringing disrespect upon her house but from the goingover the landladys eyebrows were giving me much of that seemed to be directed my way i didnt mind that for a while it made me feel quite nostalgic for my army days when some ugly sergeant would chew my ear off for nothing but the hell of it what kind of house do you think im running here fraulein tauber you should be ashamed to even think of coming back here in such a state as this with a strange man im a respectable woman ive told you about this before fraulein tauber i have my rules i have my standards this is not to be tolerated all of this told me two things one was that the woman in my arms was fraulein tauber and the other was that i was hardly through protecting her from attack someone tried to rape her i said so you can either help or you can go and put on some more makeup the end of your nose looks like it could use some red paint well really the landlady gasped theres no need to be rude raped you say yes of course ill help her room is along here she led the way down the hall found a key from the bunch in the pocket of her sagging dressing gown opened a door and switching on the ceiling light illuminated a neat wellfurnished room that was cosier than a cashmerelined leather glove and about the same size i laid fraulein tauber down on a sofa of the kind that was only comfortable if you were wearing a whalebone corset and kneeling at her feet i started to slap some life into her hands and face when she started working at the golden horseshoe i told her something like this might happen said the old woman this was one of the few remaining nightclubs in berlin and probably the least offensive so the chain of causation that was being suggested was hardly obvious to me but containing any argument because id already been too rough on the woman i asked her politely if she could fetch a cold compress and a cup of strong tea or coffee the tea or coffee was a longshot but in an emergency theres no telling what berlin women can come up with fraulein tauber started to come around again and i helped her to sit up seeing me she smiled a halfsmile are you still here the smile must have been painful because she flexed her jaw and then winced just take it easy that was quite a left hook he handed you ill say one thing for you fraulein tauber you can take a punch yeah maybe you should manage my fights i could use a big purse howd you know my name anyway parsifal your landlady shes fetching a cold compress and a hot drink for that eye of yours its just possible that we can stop it from going blue fraulein tauber glanced over at the door and shook her head if shes fetching me a hot drink you must have told her i was dying the landlady returned with the cold compress and handed it to me i laid it carefully on fraulein taubers eye took her hand and laid it on top keep some pressure on it i told her theres tea on the way said the landlady i had just enough left for a small pot she shrugged and gathered her dressing gown closer to a chest that was bigger than the cushions on the sofa i stood up stretched a smile onto my face and offered the landlady one of my american cigarettes smoke the old womans eyes lit up like she was looking at the kohinoor diamond please she took one tentatively almost as if she thought that i might snatch it away again its a fair exchange for a cup of tea i said lighting her cigarette i didnt smoke one myself i hardly wanted either of them thinking i was gustav krupp the old woman took an ecstatic puff of her cigarette smiled and went back into the kitchen and here was me thinking you were just parsifal looks like youve got the touch healing lepers is easier than raising a smile on her face but i get the feeling she disapproves of you fraulein tauber you make that sound almost benign like my old schoolmistress fraulein tauber laughed bitterly frau lippert thats her name she hates me if i was jewish she couldnt hate me more and whats your name i cant keep calling you fraulein tauber why not everyone else does the man who attacked you did you get a good look at him he was about your height dark clothes dark eyes dark hair dark complexion in fact everything about him was dark on account of the fact that it was dark see if i drew you a picture hed look exactly like your shadow is that all you can remember about him come to think of it he had nice fruity breath like hed been eating haribos its not much to go on that all depends on where you were thinking of going the man was trying to rape you was he i guess he was i shrugged maybe you should report it i dont know to the police i certainly didnt mean the newspapers women in this city get attacked all the time parsifal why do you think the police would be interested in one more he had a knife thats why he might have used it on you listen mister thanks for helping me dont think im not grateful because i am but i dont much like the police i shrugged theyre just people where did you get that idea all right parsifal ill spell it out for you i work at the golden horseshoe and sometimes the new world when theyre not closed for lack of beer i make an honest living but that wont stop the cops from thinking otherwise i can hear their patter now like it was a movie you left the horseshoe with a man didnt you hed paid you to have sex with him only you took his money and tried to dodge him in the dark isnt that what really happened fraulein tauber get out of here youre lucky we dont throw you in ravensbruck for being on the sledge i had to admit she had a point berlin cops had stopped being people when they married into the reich main security office the rsha and joined a gothiclooking family that included the gestapo the ss and the sd anyway she added you dont want the police buzzing in your ears any more than me not with your american cigarettes and all those cans in that bag of yours no i should think they might ask you some very awkward questions which you dont look able to answer i guess you do have a point there at that especially not wearing a suit like that her visible eye was giving me the up and down whats wrong with it nothing its a nice suit and thats the point it doesnt look like youve been wearing it very much lately which is unusual in berlin for a man with your accent which makes me think you must have been wearing something else most likely a uniform that would explain the cigarettes and your quaint opinions about the police and the tin cans for all i know ill bet you youre in the army and youve been in paris if that tie is what i think it is silk it matches your prewar manners parsifal manners are something else you cant get in berlin any more but every german officer gets to behave like a real gentleman when hes stationed in paris thats what ive heard anyway so youre not a professional blackie just an amateur blackie making a little money on the side while youre home on leave this is the only reason youre naively talking about the police and reporting what happened to me this evening you should have been a cop yourself i grinned no not me i like to sleep at night but the way things are going before very long were all going to be cops whether we like it or not spying on each other informing she nodded meaningfully at the door if you know what i mean i didnt say anything as frau lippert came back carrying a tray with two cups of tea thats what i mean added fraulein tauber in case i was too dumb to understand her the first time drink your tea i said itll help keep that eye down i dont see how this is good tea i told frau lippert thank you herr that is i dont see how it can help a blue eye i nodded appreciating the interruption it was fraulein taubers turn to help me it wasnt a good idea to tell frau lippert my name i could see that now the old woman wasnt just the house guard dog she was also the buildings gestapo bloodhound caffeine i said it causes the blood vessels to constrict you want to reduce the amount of blood that can reach your eye the more blood that seeps out of the damaged capillaries on that lovely face of yours the bluer your eye will get here let me have a look i took away the cold compress for a moment and then nodded its not so blue i said not when i look at you its not mmmhmm you know you sound just like a doctor parsifal you can tell that from mmhmm sure doctors say it all the time to me anyway frau lippert had been out of this conversation since it started and must have felt that it lacked her own imprimatur shes right said the old woman they do i kept on looking at the girl with the cold compress in her hand youre mistaken fraulein its not mmhmm your doctor is saying its shorter simpler more direct than that its just mmm i drained my tea cup and placed it back on the tray mmm thank you im glad you liked it said frau lippert very much i grinned at her and picked my bag of canned food off the floor it was nice to see her smile back well id better be going ill look in again sometime just to see youre all right theres no need parsifal im all right now i like to know how all my patients are doing fraulein especially the ones wearing guerlain shalimar chapter the pathological institute was at the charite hospital just across the canal from lehrter station with its redbrick exterior its alpinestyle wooden loggias its clock and distinctive corner tower the oldest teaching hospital in the city was much the same as it had always been inside however things were different within the main administrative building the portraits of more than a few of the charites famous physicians and scientists had been removed the jews were germanys misfortune after all these were the only spaces available in the hospital and if they could have put some beds on the walls they would have done it the wards and corridors even the landings outside the elevators were full of men who had been maimed or injured on the front meanwhile the morgue in the institute was full to overflowing with dead soldiers and the still unidentified civilian victims of raf bombings and blackout accidents not that their problems were over the army information centre wasnt always very efficient in notifying the families of those serving men who had died and in many cases the army felt that the responsibility fell on the ministry of health but however the deaths were caused the ministry of health believed responsibility for dealing with deaths in berlin lay properly with the ministry of the interior which of course was only too willing to leave such matters to the city authorities who themselves were inclined to dump this role on the police so you might have said that the crisis at the morgue and thats exactly what it smelled like was all my fault me and others like me it was however with the hope of taking advantage of this bureaucratic incompetence that i went there in search of geert vrankens corpse and i found what was left of it sharing a drawer in the cold room with a dead prostitute from lichterfelde and a man from wedding most likely a suicide who had been killed in a gas explosion i had the mortuary attendant lay out the dutchmans remains on a slab that looked and smelt worse than it ought to have done but with an extreme shortage of cleaners in the hospital not to mention carbolic soap the dead assumed less and less of the hospitals dwindling resources pity grumbled the attendant what is that youre not from the state labour service so i can get rid of him i didnt know he was looking for a job he was a foreign worker so im waiting on the paperwork that will enable me to send his remains down to the incinerator im from the alex like i said im sure there are jobs there that could be done by dead men my job for example for a moment the morgue attendant thought of smiling and then thought better of it ill only be a minute i said and took out the switchblade i had found on the ground under nolli station at the sight of the long blade in my hand the attendant backed off nervously here whats your game its all right im trying to establish if this knife matches the victims stab wounds relaxing a little he nodded at vrankens remains least of his problems i should have thought being stabbed youd think so wouldnt you but before a train ran him over that would explain a lot someone stabbed him several times evidently not his lucky day i slid the blade into one of the more obvious wounds in the dead mans pale torso before the war you used to get a proper lab report with photographs and descriptions so that you didnt have to do this kind of thing before the war you used to get beer that tasted like beer remembering who and more particularly what i was he added quickly not that theres anything wrong with the beer now of course i didnt say anything i was glad hed spoken out of turn it meant i could probably avoid filling out the morgues paperwork commissioner ludtke had told me to drop the case after all as a quid pro quo for ignoring the attendants unpatriotic remark about german beer besides i was paying nearly all of my attention to the knife in the stab wound i couldnt say for sure that it was the murder weapon but it could have been it was long enough and sharp enough with just one edge and a blunter upper side that matched the wound almost perfectly i pulled the blade out and looked for something to wipe it with being a fussy type im particular about the switchblades i keep in my coat pocket and i figured id already encountered enough germs and bacteria just walking through the hospital without squirrelling away a private cache of my own got anything to wipe this with here he said and taking it from me he wiped it with the corner of his lab coat thanks i said i could see that he was anxious to get rid of me and when i suggested that there was probably no need to bother with the paperwork he agreed with alacrity i dont think hell tell do you said the attendant besides i dont have a pen that works i went outside it was a nice day so i decided to walk back to the alex and eat lunch at a counter i knew on karl strasse but that one was closed because of a lack of sausage so was the one on oranienburger strasse finally i got a sandwich and a paper at a place near the stock exchange only there was even less of interest in the sandwich than there was in the paper and probably in the stock exchange too but its foolish to give up eating bread because you cant get the sausage to put in it at least i was free to still think of the bread as a sandwich then again im a typical berliner so maybe im just hard to please when i got back to the alex i had the files on all of the summers sbahn murders sent up to my office i suppose i wanted to make doubly sure that paul ogorzow was the real killer and not someone whod been made to measure for it it wouldnt have been the first time that a kripo run by the nazis had done something like that the only surprise was that they hadnt already tried to pin the murders of wallenstein baldur siegfried and cock robin on some hapless jew it turned out that i wasnt the first to review the ogorzow files the record memo showed that the abwehr military intelligence had also looked at the files and recently i wondered why at least i did until i remembered all the foreign workers who had been interviewed during the course of the investigation but paul ogorzow had been a german railwayworker rape and a violent hatred of women had been his motive he hadnt stabbed any of his victims he had battered them to death there was no telling if fraulein taubers attacker would have battered her or stabbed her after hed finished raping her but from the blow hed given her face there could be no doubting his dislike of women of course lust murders were hardly uncommon in berlin before paul ogorzow there had been other violent sometimes cannibalistic killers and doubtless there would be others after him much to my surprise i was impressed at the thoroughness and scale of commissioner ludtkes investigation thousands of interviews had been conducted and almost one hundred suspects brought in for interrogation at one stage male police officers had even dressed up as women and travelled the sbahn at night in the hope of luring the murderer into an attack a reward of ten thousand reichsmarks had been posted and finally one of paul ogorzows workmates another railway employee had fingered him as the murderer instead of one of the many foreign workers but among those foreign workers who had been interviewed was geert vranken i shouldnt have been surprised to discover his name on the list of those who had been interviewed and yet i was i read the transcript with interest a science graduate from the university in the hague vranken had been quickly eliminated from ludtkes inquiry when his alibi checked out but hardly wanting to rely on this alone after all his alibi relied on other foreign workers he had been at pains to adduce evidence of his good character and to this end he had offered the name of a german whom hed met before the war in the hague ludtkes team of detectives several of whom i knew had hardly needed to take up this reference because a week or so after vrankens interview paul ogorzow had been arrested the certainty on my part that for once the right man had been sent to the guillotine at plotzensee in july gradually gave way to a feeling of pity for geert vranken and more particularly the wife and baby he had left behind in the netherlands how many other families i wondered would be similarly destroyed before the war was over of course this was hardly normal for me id seen plenty of murder victims in my time at the alex many of them in even more tragic circumstances than these after minsk i suppose my conscience was easily pricked whatever the reasons i determined to find out if as commissioner ludtke had said it would the state labour service had yet informed vrankens family that he had met with a fatal accident thus it was that i spent a fruitless hour on the telephone being rerouted from one bureaucrat to another before i finally gave up and wrote a letter myself this to an address in the hague that was in vrankens work book and which prior to its issue by the state labour service was where previously he had been employed in my letter i made no mention of the fact that geert vranken had been murdered only that he had been hit by a train and killed his being stabbed six times was more than any family needed to be told chapter i had an office in the police praesidium on the third floor a small room on the corner underneath the tower and overlooking the ubahn station on alexanderplatz the view out of the window on a late summer evening was the best thing about it life didnt look quite so dismal at that kind of altitude i couldnt smell the people or see their pale undernourished and sometimes just plain hopeless faces all the streets came together in one big square just the same as they had done before the war with trams clanging and taxis honking their horns and the city growling in the distance the way it always did sitting on the windowsill with my face in the sun it was easy to pretend there was no war no front no hitler and that none of it had anything to do with me outside there wasnt a swastika in sight just the many varieties of specimen in my own favourite game of girl spotting it was a sport i was always passionate about and at which i excelled i liked the way it helped me tune in to the natural world and because girls in berlin are visible in a way that other berlin wildlife is not i never seemed to grow tired of it there are so many different girls out there mostly i was on the lookout for the rarer varieties exotic blondes that hadnt been seen since and fabulous redheads wearing summer plumage that was very nearly transparent id thought about putting a feeder on my windowsill but i knew it was hopeless the climb up to the third floor was simply too much for them the only creatures that ever made it up to my office were the rats somehow they never run out of energy and when i turned back to face the room with its awful portrait of the leader and the sd uniform that was hanging in an open closet like a terrible reminder of the other man id been for much of the summer there were two of them coming through the glass door neither of them said anything until they were seated with their hats in their hands and had stared at me for several seconds with preternatural calm as if i were some lesser being which of course i was because these rats were from the gestapo one of the men wore a doublebreasted navy chalkstripe and the other a dark grey threepiece suit with a watchchain that glittered like his eyes the one wearing the chalkstripe had a full head of short fair hair that was as carefully arranged as the lines on a sheet of writing paper the other was even fairer but losing it on the front almost as if his forehead had been plucked like one of those medieval ladies in a rather dull oil painting on their faces were smiles that were insolent or selfsatisfied or cynical but mostly all three at the same time and they regarded me and my office and probably my very existence with some amusement but that was okay because i felt much the same way myself youre bernhard gunther i nodded the man with the chalkstripe suit checked his neatly combed hair fastidiously as if he had just stepped out of the barbers chair at the kadewe a decent haircut was about the only thing in berlin that was not in short supply with a reputation like yours i was expecting a pair of persian slippers and a calabash he smiled like sherlock holmes i sat down behind my desk facing the pair and smiled back these days i find that a threepipe problems just the same as a onepipe problem i cant find the tobacco to smoke in it so i keep the calabash hidden in the drawer alongside my goldplated syringe and some orange pips they kept on looking saying nothing just sizing me up you fellows should have brought along a blackjack if you were expecting me to talk first is that what you think of us im not the only one with a colourful reputation true are you here to ask questions or for a favour we dont need to ask favours said the one with the basilica skull designed by brunelleschi usually we get all the cooperation we require without having to ask anyone a favour he glanced at his colleague and did some more smiling isnt that right yes thats right the one with the neat hair was like a thickerset version of von ribbentrop he had no eyebrows to speak of and big shoulders i didnt think he was a man you wanted to see taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves in search of answers most people are only too willing to help us and its rare we are ever obliged to ask for something as quaint as a favour is that so i put a match in my mouth and started to chew it slowly i figured that as long as i didnt try inhaling it my lungs would stay healthy all right im listening i leaned forward and clasped my hands with an earnest reverence that bordered on the sarcastic and if it persuades you to come quickly to the point then this is me looking all ready and willing to help the gestapo in any way that i can only do stop trying to make me feel very small or ill start to question the wisdom of letting you sit in my office with your hats in your hands chalkstripe pinched the crown of his hat and inspected the lining for all i knew it had his name and rank written there just in case he forgot them you know my name so why dont you introduce yourselves im commissar sachse and this is inspector wandel i nodded politely delighted im sure how much do you know about the three kings and please dont mention the bible or i shall conclude that im not going to like you youre talking about the three men who came to berlin from czechoslovakia in early arent you im sorry bohemia and moravia although im never quite sure of the difference and anyway who cares the three kings are three czech nationalists and officers of the defeated czech army who having conducted a series of terrorist attacks in prague it is still called prague isnt it good well then having orchestrated a campaign of sabotage there they decided to bring their war here to the streets of berlin and as far as i know for a while they were quite successful they planted a bomb at the aviation ministry in september not to mention one in the doorway here at the alex yes that was embarrassing for us all wasnt it no wonder the press and radio didnt mention it then there was the attempt on himmlers life at the anhalter railway station in february of this year i expect that was even more embarrassing for the gestapo anyway i believe the bomb was placed in the left luggage office which is an obvious place and one that should certainly have been searched in advance of the reichsfuhrersss arrival in the station i bet someone had a lot of explaining to do after that their smiles were fading a little now and their chairs were starting to look uncomfortable as the two gestapo men shifted their backsides around the wagonwheel backs creaked like a haunted house chalkstripe checked his hair again almost as if hed left the source of his ability to intimidate me on the barbershop floor the other man wandel bit his lip trying to keep the deaths head moth of a smile pinned to his delinquent mug i might have stopped my little history there and then out of fear of what their organization was capable of but i was enjoying myself too much i hadnt considered the concept of suicide by gestapo until now but i could see its advantages at least i might enjoy the process a little more than just blowing my own brains out all the same i wasnt about to throw my life away on some smalltimers like these two if ever i did decide to blow a raspberry in some senior nazis face i was going to make it count besides it was now plain to me that they really were after a favour you know the word here in kripo is that the three kings get a kick out of embarrassing the gestapo theres one particular story doing the rounds that one of them even stole oscar fleischers overcoat fleischer was head of the gestapos counterintelligence section in prague and that the same brazen fellow won a bet that he could cadge a light for his cigarette off fleischers cigar theres always a lot of gossip in a place like this said sachse oh sure but thats how cops work herr commissar a nudge here a wink there a whisper in a bar a fellow tells you that someone else says that his pal heard this or that personally ive always put a vague rumour ahead of anything as imaginative as three pipes worth of deductive reasoning its elementary my dear sachse oh yes and didnt these three kings send the gestapo a complimentary copy of their own underground newspaper thats the gossip since you appear to be so well informed i shook my head its common knowledge here on the third floor then i dare say you will also know that two of the three kings josef balaban and josef masin have already been arrested as have many other of their collaborators in prague and here in berlin its only a matter of time before we catch melchior i dont get it i said you caught josef a in april and josef b in may or maybe it was the other way round but here we are in september and you still havent managed to shake the third king out of their sleeves you boys must be going soft of course i knew this couldnt be true the gestapo had moved heaven and earth in search of the third man but mostly theyd employed a more infernal sort of help because there was another rumour around the alex that the prague gestapo had enlisted the services of their most notorious torturer in bohemia a sadist called paul soppa who was the commander of pankrac prison in prague to work on the two czechs in his custody i didnt give much for their chances but in the light of the continued liberty of melchior the certainty that neither man had talked was proof positive of their enormous courage and bravery there are different ways of approaching every problem said wandel and right now we should like you to help us with this problem colonel schellenberg speaks very highly of you walter schellenberg was close to general heydrich who was chief of the whole rsha of which kripo was now one part i know who schellenberg is i said at least i remember meeting him but i dont know what he is not these days hes the acting chief of foreign intelligence within the rsha said sachse is this problem a foreign intelligence matter it might be but right now its a homicide which is where you come in well anything to help colonel schellenberg of course i said helpfully you know the heinrich von kleist park of course it used to be berlins botanical garden before the botanical gardens were built in steglitz a body was found there this morning oh i wonder why i havent heard about it youre hearing about it now wed like you to come and take a look at it gunther i shrugged have you got any petrol sachse frowned for your car i added i wasnt proposing that we burn the body yes of course we have petrol then id love to go to the park with you commissar sachse kleist park in schoneberg had something to do with a famous german romantic writer he might have been called kleist there were lots of trees a statue of the goddess diana and on the western border of the park the court of appeal not that hitlers germany had much use for a court of appeal those who were convicted and condemned in a nazi court of first instance usually stayed that way on the southern border was a building i had half an idea might once have been the prussian state art school but given that the gestapo was now headquartered in the old industrial art school on prinz albrechtstrasse there seemed to be little or no chance that anyone was being taught how to paint someones portrait in the prussian state art school not when they could more usefully be taught how to torture people it was a fact that the gestapo had always taken its share of the citys best public buildings that was to be expected but lately theyd started confiscating the premises of shops and businesses that had been abandoned as a result of the shortages a friend of mine had gone into the singer sewing machine salesroom on wittenberg platz looking for a new treadlebelt only to discover that the place was now being used as an arsenal by the ss meyers wine shop on olivaer platz where once id been a regular customer was now an ss information bureau whatever that was in the centre of the park was a curving promenade where you could walk or perhaps sit but only on the grass since all of the citys many wooden park benches had been taken away for the war effort sometimes i imagined a fat wehrmacht general conducting the siege of leningrad while warming his hands over a brazier that was fuelled with one of these on the eastern edge of this promenade and bordering potsdamer strasse was an area of shrubs and trees that had been closed off to the public by several uniformed policemen the dead body of a man lay under a huge rhododendron that was in late flower but only just since he was covered with red petals that looked like multiple stab wounds he was wearing a dark blousontype jacket a lighter brown pair of flannel trousers and a pair of severely downatheel brown boots i couldnt see his face as one of my new gestapo friends was blocking the sun as was their habit so i asked him to move and as he stepped out of the way i squatted down on my haunches to take a closer look it was a typical mortuary photograph the mouth wide open as if awaiting the attentions of a dentist although the teeth were in remarkably good condition and certainly better than mine the wide eyes staring straight ahead so that all things considered he looked more surprised to see me than i was to see him he was about twentyfive with a small moustache and on the front of his left forehead below the line of his dark hair a contusion that was the shape and colour of an outsized amethyst and which more than likely was the cause of death who found the body i asked sachse and when a uniformed cop on patrol from the potsdamer platz station about six oclock this morning and how is it that you picked up the order the duty detective from kripo telephoned it in fellow named lehnhoff that was clever of him lehnhoffs not usually so quick on his toes and what did this fritz have in his pocket that marked him out as your meat a czech passport no this sachse dipped into his pocket and then handed me a gun it was a little model walther a palmsized calibre automatic smaller than the baby browning i had at home for when i wasnt expecting visitors but quite accurate a bit more lethal than a set of door keys wouldnt you say so said sachse that will open a door for you i agreed be careful its still loaded i nodded and handed the gun back to him this makes it a gestapo matter automatically i said i can see that but i still dont see how this connects him with the three kings one of our officers from the documentation section looked over his papers and found some discrepancies wandel handed me a yellow card with the dead mans photograph in the top lefthand corner it was his employment certificate he said notice anything wrong with it i shrugged the staples in the picture are a bit rusty otherwise it looks all right to me name of victor keil doesnt ring any bells the impression of the rubber stamp on the corner of the photograph can hardly be seen said wandel no german official would have permitted that then he handed me the dead mans identity card and this what do you make of this herr commissar i rubbed the document in my fingers which drew a nod of approval from sachse youre right to check it that way first he said the forgeries just dont feel right like theyre made of linen but thats not what gives this one away as a fake i opened it up and took a closer look at the contents the photograph on the id card had two corner stamps one on the top righthand corner and the other on the top left and these both looked clear enough the two fingerprints were similarly clear as was the police precinct stamp i shook my head beats me whats wrong with it it looks completely right the quality is actually quite good admitted sachse except for one thing whoever made that cant spell forefinger my god yes youre right sachse was starting to look satisfied with himself once more all of which prompted us to investigate further he said it seems that the real victor keil was killed during a bombing raid in hamburg last year and we now know or at least we strongly suspect that this man isnt a german at all but a czech terrorist by the name of franz koci our sources in prague tell us that he was one of the last czech agents operating here in berlin and he certainly fits the last description we had of him until october he was a lieutenant in a czech regiment of artillery that was deployed to the sudetenland after the capitulation of the benes government at munich he disappeared along with many others who subsequently worked for the three kings i shrugged it sounds like you know everything about him i said i cant imagine why you need me to look at his fingernails we dont know who killed him said wandel or why or even how i nodded for the how youll need a doctor preferably a doctor of medicine i smiled at my joke thinking of the american dickson and his aversion to the doctors of deceit at the ministry of propaganda but it wasnt a joke for sharing especially with the gestapo as for the who and the why maybe i could take a closer look i pointed at the body do you mind be my guest said sachse i took out my handkerchief and then laid it neatly beside the body somewhere to lay any evidence i find you see i intend going through the dead mans pockets help yourself but all of the useful evidence has already been collected oh i dont doubt that if theres anything of value that the uniforms and inspector lehnhoff have left behind ill be pleasantly surprised sachse frowned you dont mean cops in this city are just as crooked as anyone else sometimes theyre even as crooked as the crooks these days most of them only join so they can steal a mans watch without getting caught i lifted the dead mans left arm by way of illustration there was a tan mark on his wrist only the watch that might have made it wasnt there yes i see what you mean said sachse the bodys a little stiff which means that rigor is setting in or passing off it takes about twelve hours to get established lasts about twelve hours and takes another twelve hours to pass i tugged at the dead mans cheek it starts in the face however and this fellows face is soft to the touch which probably means the rigor is passing off you understand that all of this is very crude but id say your man has been dead for at least a day or so of course i might be wrong but ive seen plenty of dead men who would say im probably right about that i undid the buttons on the blouson and then pulled open the shirt to inspect the torso this man took a hard fall or received a substantial impact there is substantial bruising on the lefthand side of his body i pressed hard directly on the bruise and the lowest part of the ribcage feels like one of the ribs has separated from the chest wall in other words its broken i took out my pocket knife unfolded it carefully and starting at the cuff i began to cut up the length of the dead mans trouser leg but only because i didnt want to start unbuttoning his fly buttons generally speaking i prefer to know a man a little better before i will do that on the left thigh there was another heavy bruise that matched the broken rib and the contusion on the head i was trying not to appear nervous but on top of the bad feeling i had most of the time i now had a bad feeling about the dead man too the distance between kleist park and nollendorf platz was about a kilometre and even a man who had collided with a taxi on the corner of motz strasse might have staggered to the park in less than thirty minutes this wouldnt have been the only traffic accident in berlin that night but it was almost certainly the only one likely to have gone unreported you want to know what i think of course this man has been involved in a road traffic accident of course thats hardly uncommon what with the blackout and berlin drivers i was quite certain i was looking at the man who had attacked fraulein tauber and who had collided with the taxi a hundred different thoughts started to run through my mind did the gestapo know that already was that what this was all about to see how i would react when presented with the dead body like hagens treachery uncovered when he stands beside siegfrieds bier no how could they know none of the other parties involved fraulein tauber frau lippert the taxi driver even knew i was a cop let alone my name but for a moment my hand started to shake i folded the knife and returned it to my coat pocket anything wrong gunther no i like working with the dead on most nights when im not contemplating cutting my own throat you can catch me down at the local cemetery with my good friend count orlok biting my lip i steeled myself to go through the dead mans pockets weve searched his pockets said sachse theres nothing important left in them from the dead mans pocket i took out a packet of haribos and showed them to the two gestapo officers i dont know what that tells us objected wandel it tells us that the man had a sweet tooth i said although it told me a lot more than that any doubts that this was the man who had attached fraulein tauber were now removed hadnt she mentioned the smell of haribos on his breath apart from the false documentation said sachse and the gun of course all we found was a money clip a door key and a pocket diary may i see them i stood up the money clip was silver and in its fold was about fifty reichsmarks in twenties and ones but it was loose on the notes and made me think that it had held more money than was now present and it was all too easy to suppose that the policemen who had stolen franz kocis watch had also relieved him of at least half of his cash that would only be typical the door key was on a steel chain that must have been attached to his belt it was a key for an old mortise lock made by the ferdinand garbe lock company of berlin the diary was the most interesting item it was a redleather army pocket diary for that they handed out to german officers there was a little wallet at the front and at the back there was a useful guide to recognizing german army ranks and insignias as a boy id had a diary with a similar guide for recognizing the footprints of animals almost invaluable in a big city like berlin i turned to the current week and noted the only entry for the last fortyeight hours np pm it had been ninethirty when i had interrupted franz kocis attack on fraulein tauber which was time enough for them to meet on nolli at ninefifteen but why would a czech terrorist intent on avoiding the attention of the police risk carrying out a sexual assault on someone at an sbahn station someone he had arranged to meet there unless the person he had arranged to meet hadnt turned up and in frustration he had attacked the girl but that made no sense either i handed the diary back to sachse these diaries are even more useful to spies than they are for our men dont you think they tell the enemy whos worth killing and whos not i imagine he must have stolen it said wandel redundantly our intelligence suggests that some of these czechos are damn good pickpockets i nodded that sounded fair enough to me considering that we had just stolen their country i had a lot of thinking to do and i decided to do it at the golden horseshoe that was probably against the rules anyone with a thought in his head wouldnt ever have gone to the golden horseshoe so i figured a man with my chequered history was worth a discount it was a big round room with small round tables around a big round dance floor the floor was mostly given over to a mechanical horse on which the club hostesses and female customers were invited to take a musical ride and in the process flash a stockingtop or something more intimate if youd had a lot of beer it was possibly a lot of fun but in the middle of berlins drought a quiet game of cribbage had it beat one of the hostesses was perhaps the last black woman in berlin her name was ella she sat at a table playing solitaire using a pack of cards featuring photographic portraits of our beloved nazi leaders i joined her and watched for a while and she said that it improved her luck so i bought her a glass of lemonade and talked out the right cards for her and when i gave her one of my precious american cigarettes she was all smiles and offered to ride the horse for me for fifty pfennigs you can see my thighs for seventyfive you can see the mouse and everything in its mouth im not wearing any underwear actually i was rather hoping to see fraulein tauber she doesnt work here any more not for a long time where does she work now ella took a lazy puff of her cigarette and remained silent i pushed a note across the table there were no pictures on it like the ones on the backs of the cards but she hardly minded about that i let her reach for it and then put my finger on the little black eagle in the corner is she at the new world that dump i should say not she tell you that she works there she laughed it means she doesnt want to see you again darling so why dont you forget her and watch me ride that pony the negress was tapping morse code on the other end of the bill i let it go and watched it disappear into a brassiere as large as a barrage balloon so where does she work arianne she runs the cloakroom at the jockey bar has for a while for a girl like arianne theres plenty of money to be made at the jockey in the cloakroom you can do a lot more in a cloakroom than just hang a coat honey i guess so we got a cloakroom here fritz its nice and dark in there for five marks i could take real care of all your valuables in my mouth if you wanted youd be wasting your time ella the only reason they let me come back from the front was because i dont have any valuables not any more im sorry thats too bad nicelooking fellow like you her face fell a little and for a moment seeing her sympathy i felt bad about lying to her like that she had a kind way about her i changed the subject the jockey i said sure i know it its that place off wittenberg platz on luther strasse used to be a russian place called yar the negress nodded ive only ever seen it from the outside whats it like expensive full of amis and bigshots from the foreign ministry they still play american jazz there the real stuff id go myself but for one rather obvious disadvantage coloureds aint welcome i frowned the nazis dont like anyone except germans you should know that by now gorgeous she smiled oh i wasnt talking about them its the amis who dont like coloureds in the place from the outside the jockey bar certainly sounded like the old berlin from before the war with its easy morals and vulgar charms others thought so too a small crowd of jazz fans stood on the sidewalk in the dark enjoying the music but unwilling to pay the prohibitive cost of going inside to save paying the entrance fee myself i flashed the beertoken in my raincoat a little brass oval that said i was police unlike most berlin cops im not fond of trying to score a free one off an honest business but the jockey bar was hardly that five marks just to walk downstairs was little better than theft not that there werent plenty of people already down there who seemed more than willing to be robbed most of them were smart types with quite a few wearing evening dress and party buttons they say crime doesnt pay not as well as a job does at the foreign office or the ministry of propaganda there were also plenty of americans as ella had said there would be you could recognize them by their loud ties and their even louder voices the jockey bar was probably the one place in berlin you could speak english without some fool in a uniform trying to remind you that roosevelt was a gangster a negroid maniac a warmonger in a wheelchair and a depraved jewish scoundrel and the germans who really disliked him had some even more unpleasant things to say at the bottom of the stairs was a cloakroom where a girl was filing her nails or reading a magazine and sometimes she managed to do both at the same time you could tell that she was clever she had dark hair and plenty of it but it was tied up like a velvet curtain at the back of her head she was thin and she was wearing a black dress and i suppose she was goodlooking in an obvious sort of way which lacking all subtlety is the way i usually like my women but she wasnt arianne tauber i waited for the girl to finish her nail or her picture caption and to notice me and that seemed to take longer than it ought to have done with the lights on this is a cloakroom isnt it she looked up gave me the up and down and then with a wellmanicured hand ushered my eyes to the coats some of them made of fur that were hanging on the rail behind her what do those look like icicles from here it looks as if im in the wrong line of work you too if im not mistaken i had the strange idea that youre supposed to be the first line of welcome in this upmarket shellhole i took off my coat and laid it on the counter and she stared at it with distaste for a moment before dragging it away like she was planning to kill it and then handing me a ticket is arianne here tonight arianne arianne tauber thats tauber as in richard tauber only i wouldnt like to have him sitting on my lap shes not here right now not here as in not working or not here as in she just stepped outside for a few minutes who wants to know just tell her that parsifal is here thats parsifal as in the holy grail talking of which ill be in the bar if she does show up you and everyone else i guess theres the bar and then theres the bar see and if you get bored in there you can try the bar thats bar as in jockey bar you were listening after all i went into the bar the place needed a coat of paint and a new carpet but not as much as i needed a drink and a set of earplugs i like music when im drinking i even like jazz sometimes just so long as they remember where they left the melody the band at the jockey bar was a threepiece trio and while they knew all the notes of avalon these were in no particular order i sat down at a table and picked up the drinks card the prices felt like mustard gas on my eyeballs and when id picked myself off the floor i ordered a beer the waitress came back almost immediately carrying a tray on which stood a tall glass filled with gold which was the nearest thing to the holy grail id seen since the last time i bought a fortypfennig stamp i tasted it and found myself smiling like an idiot it tasted exactly like beer i must be dead that can be arranged said a voice oh take a look around parsifal this louse house is jumping with important nazis any one of these stuffed shirts could pick up the telephone and get you a seat on tomorrows partisan express i stood up and pulled out a chair for her im impressed that you know about the partisan express the partisan express was what german soldiers called the troop train that travelled between berlin and the eastern front ive got a brother in the army she explained thats hardly an exclusive club not any more nor is this place i guess that must be why they let you in arianne tauber smiled and sat down but you can buy me a drink if you like at these prices it would be cheaper to buy you a mercedes benz what would be the point you cant get the petrol so a drink will do just fine i waved the waitress toward me and let arianne order a beer for herself got any more of those ami cigarettes no i lied buying her a beer felt extravagant enough without throwing caution out of the window and giving her a smoke as well she shrugged thats all right ive got some luckies arianne reached for her bag and that gave me time to have another look at her she was wearing a plain navyblue dress with short sleeves around her waist was a purple leather belt with a series of shiny black or maybe blue lozenges that were arranged like the jewels on a crown on her shoulder was an interesting bronze brooch of the hindu goddess kali her purple leather bag was round and on a long strap and a bit like a watercarrier and out of it she took a silver cigarette box with three bits of inlaid turquoise that were as big as thrush eggs on the side there was a little matching compartment for a lighter but which contained a roll of banknotes and for a moment i pictured her lighting a cigarette with a fivemark note as a way of wasting money that was only a little less profligate than buying a girl a drink at the jockey bar when she opened the little cigarette case i took one and rolled it in my fingers for a moment and passed it under my nostrils to remind myself that it was better to have america as a friend than an enemy before poking it between my lips and dipping my head onto a match from a book off the table that was in her scented hand guerlain shalimar i said and puffed my cigarette happily for a second before adding you were wearing it when i last saw you a gift from an admirer seems like every fritz who comes back on leave from paris brings a girl perfume its the one thing theres no shortage of here in berlin i swear i could open a shop the amount of perfume ive been given since the war started men why dont they bring something useful like shoe laces or toilet paper she shook her head cooking oil have you tried buying cooking oil forget it maybe they figure you smell better wearing the perfume she smiled you must think im really ungrateful the next time im in paris ill buy you some paperclips and put you to the test no really the other night i didnt get a chance to thank you properly parsifal skip it you were in no state to be throwing me a cocktail party i took hold of her chin and turned her profile toward me the eye looks fine maybe just a little bruised around the edges then again i always go simple for blue eyes for a moment she looked bashful then she hardened again i dont want you being nice to me thats all right i didnt bring any perfume not until ive apologized to you for not being honest its a national habit she took a sip of her beer and then a kiss from her cigarette her hand was shaking a little really theres nothing to apologize for all the same i would like to explain something i shrugged if you want take your time theres no one waiting for me at home she nodded and then picked out another smile to wear this one was looking sheepish first of all i want you to know im not some joygirl sometimes when im in here ill let a man buy me a drink or give me a present like these cigarettes but thats as far as it goes unless well were all human arent we i certainly used to believe that thats the truth parsifal anyway being the cloakroom girl in a place like this is a good job the amis even a few of the germans they tip well theres nothing much to spend it on but i figure you still have to put something away for the bad times and ive got an ugly feeling that theres plenty of those yet to come worse than now i mean my brother says so he says whatever her brother had said she seemed to think better of telling me about it a lot of berliners were forgetful like that they would start talking then remember a little thing called the gestapo and just stop midsentence and stare into the distance for a minute and then say something like what she said next skip it what i was saying it wasnt anything important sure whats important is you know im not selling it parsifal i understand i said hardly caring if she was selling it or not but i was keen to hear her out although i was still wondering why she felt obliged to explain herself at all i hope so she picked a piece of tobacco off her tongue and her fingers came away red from her lipstick okay heres what happened that night household building contents everything because i figure i have to tell someone and i get the feeling you might be interested say if youre not and ill just shut up but you were interested enough to come down here and look for me right i nodded and as a matter of fact its in here that the story starts it was during my break magda shes the girl you met in the cloakroom was behind the desk and i was in the bar when we have our break were supposed to come in here and have a drink with the customers like you and me are doing now she tried on another smile this one looked wry some break frankly its not a break at all the fritzes here are generous with their drinks and their cigarettes and usually im glad to get back to the cloakroom to have a rest and try to clear my head she shrugged i was never much of a drinker but that kind of excuse really doesnt work in here i can imagine i glanced around and tried not to grimace theres something obscene about a nightclub in wartime all of those people having a good time while our boys are away fighting popovs or flying sorties over england somehow it didnt feel right to have a photograph of the english film star leslie howard on the jockey club wall for a while after the outbreak of war the nazis had been sensitive enough to ban all public dancing but following our early victories that ban had been lifted and now things were going so wonderfully for the german army that it was thought to be fine for men and women to let down their hair and throw themselves around on a dance floor but i didnt care for it at all and i liked it even less when i thought about the fridmann sisters in the apartment beneath my own sometimes when i go home i can hardly walk im so heavy with the stuff i can see im going to have to come here again this must be the only bar in berlin where the beer still tastes like beer but at a price and what a price anyway i was going to tell you about this fellow called gustav and how i came to be hanging around nollendorfplatz in the dark the other night were you come on parsifal pay attention a few nights ago when im in here i start talking to this fritz he said his name was gustav but i have my doubts about that he also said that he was a civil servant on wilhelmstrasse and that is what he looked like i suppose a real smooth type thin prick accent gold bird in his lapel silk handkerchief and spats oh yes and he had this little gold cigarette holder that he brought out of a little velvet box every time he wanted a smoke just watching him was kind of fascinating in an irritating way i asked him if he did that in the morning too i mean if he used the little gold holder and he said he did can you imagine that ill give it a go i shook my head no i cant he sounds like a fish in a glass case goodlooking though arianne grinned and rich he was wearing a wristwatch and a pocket hunter and both of them were gold just like his cufflinks and his shirt studs and his tie pin very observant of you she shrugged what can i tell you i like men who wear gold it encourages me like a red rag to a bull but its not the movement its the colour and the value of course men who wear a lot of gold bits and pieces are just more generous i suppose and was he gustav sure he tipped me just for lighting his cigarette and again for sitting with him at the end of the evening he asked me to meet him the following evening at the romanisches cafe i nodded just down from wittenberg platz yes at eight oclock anyway he was late and for a while i thought he wasnt coming at all it was nearer eighttwentyfive when eventually he showed up and he was sweating and nervous not at all the smoothassilk type hed been when we were in here the previous night we talked for a while but he wasnt listening and when i asked him why he seemed so out of sorts he came to the point he had asked me along to the cafe because he had a job for me an easy job he said but it was going to pay me a hundred marks a hundred by now i was shaking my head and telling him i wasnt on the sledge just yet but no he said it wasnt anything like that and what did i take him for all i had to do was wait under the station at nolli at ninefifteen and give an envelope to a man who would be humming a tune thats nice what was the tune dont say goodbye only say adieu zarah leander i like that one he even hummed it for me to make sure i knew it i had to ask the man for a light and then his name and if he said it was paul i was to give him the envelope and walk away well i could tell there was something peculiar about all this so i asked him what was in the envelope and he said it was best i didnt know which didnt make me feel any better about doing it but then he put five pictures of albrecht durer on the table and assured me that it would be the easiest hundred marks id ever earned especially in the blackout anyway i agreed a hundred marks is a hundred marks mmmhmm so i rode the sbahn one stop east to nolli and waited under the station just like gustav had told me to do i was early and i was scared but the five alberts felt good inside my stocking top i had time to think too much time perhaps because i got greedy thats a bad habit of mine you and the austrian corporal i kept on thinking that if i had been given a hundred from gustav for showing up with an envelope then i might make at least another ten or twenty from paul for handing it over and when eventually he turned up thats what i suggested but paul didnt like that and started to get rough with me he searched my coat pockets for the envelope and my bag he even searched my underwear took my hundred marks and thats when you showed up parsifal you see he wasnt trying to rape me he was only trying to find his damned envelope where was it the envelope i didnt have it on me when i tried to brolly him well that would have been foolish id already hidden it in some bushes near the taxi rank that was clever i thought so too right up until the moment he punched me where is it now the envelope when i went back the next day to look for it the envelope was gone hmm she shrugged now i really dont know what to do im scared to go to the cops and tell them naturally im worried about what was in that envelope im worried that ive landed myself in the middle of something dangerous she closed her eyes it seemed so easy when we were in the romanisches cafe just hand it over in the blackout and walk away if only id done that this gustav have you seen him in here since no does anyone else know him no it turns out that magda thought his name was josef and thats all she remembers am i in trouble parsifal you might be if you went to the police and told them about this yes i think you would be so you dont think i should tell them with a story like yours arianne the police the real police are the least of your worries theres the gestapo to consider she sighed i thought as much have you told your story to anyone else god no then dont it simply never happened you never met anyone called gustav or josef in this place and no one ever asked you to be a cutout for them at the sbahn on nollendorf platz a cutout thats what you call it when someone wants to give something to someone else without actually meeting them but thats all right too because there was no something no envelope you dont even have a hundred marks to show for it right she nodded i sipped the beer and wondered how it and the cigarette could taste so good and how much truth there was in what arianne tauber had told me it was just about possible that franz koci had taken a hundred marks out of her underwear although hed been carrying only half as much when the cops had found him in kleist park of course they could easily have helped themselves to half his cash and it was just about possible that some foreign office type who had an envelope for a three kings agent might have been spooked off a meeting and subcontracted the job to a moneyhungry girl from the jockey bar stranger things had happened but i have a question for you angel why are you telling me all this in case you didnt know parsifals not exactly a common name around here she bit her thumbnail look in spite of what i told you about getting all that perfume im not the most popular girl around town there are a lot of people who dont like me very much sounds like we have a lot in common angel she let that one go she was too busy talking about herself that was good too to me she looked like a more interesting subject than i was oh sure im attractive to look at i know that and there are a lot of men who want me to give them what men usually want women to give them but beyond a cigarette and a drink and a tip and maybe the odd present or two i dont want anything from anyone you should know that about me maybe youve worked that out already you seem bright enough but what im trying to say is that i dont have many friends and certainly none that are possessed of what you might call wisdom and maturity otto otto schulze the fritz who runs this place i couldnt tell him i cant tell him anything hed tell the gestapo for sure otto likes to keep in with the gestapo im almost certain he pays them off with information magda too i think and youve met frau lippert so theres no one else see my mother is old and lives in dresden my brother is on active service but frankly he wouldnt know what to say or do hes my younger brother and he looks to me for advice but you parsifal you strike me as the type who always knows what to say or do so if youre interested theres a parttime job going as my special counsel it doesnt pay very much but maybe you can think of me as someone who is in your debt suddenly i feel every one of my fortythree years i said thats not so old not these days just look around parsifal where are the young men there arent any not in berlin i cant remember the last time i spoke to someone less than thirty anyone my age is on active service or in a concentration camp youth is no longer wasted on the young because its wasted on the war instead she winced forget i said that i shouldnt have said that theyre fighting for their country arent they theyre fighting for someone elses country i said thats the problem arianne looked sly for a moment as if shed outsmarted me in a game of cards its not healthy putting your head under a falling axe parsifal you could get into trouble i dont mind a little trouble when it looks like you angel thats what you say now but you havent seen me throwing crockery volatile huh like my boiling point was on the moon smart too im not sure im qualified to be your special counsel fraulein tauber i dont know the boiling point on the moon from my own shoesize she glanced down at my feet ill bet youre a fortysix right mmmhmm then for a lot of liquids with higher vapour pressures the boiling point and your shoesize are probably the same if thats true then im impressed before the war i was a chemistry student why did you stop lack of money lack of opportunity the nazis like educated women almost as little as they like educated jews they prefer us to stay home polishing the hearth and stirring the pot not me she tugged my wrist toward her and checked the time on my watch i have to go back to the cloakroom in a minute i could wait but i might need to telephone the reichsbank to arrange a loan it might be worth it parsifal i finish at two you could walk me home if you like better still you could drive me if you have a car i have a car i just dont have any petrol and ill gladly walk you home but i dont think frau lippert would approve do you i said you could walk me home not up the stairs but if ever you did walk me up the stairs its actually none of her business and she knows that too the other night she was just mouthing off if i hadnt had that sock on the jaw i might have told her to shut up and mind her own business and she would have done up to a point theres nothing in our agreement that says i cant have gentlemen friends in my room for a little quiet conversation its hard to hear everything you say in a place like this you need to speak up im a little deaf now you tell me thats because last year i was near kottbusser strasse when a tame tommy went off a tame tommy was what berliners called an unexploded bomb it blew me through the air fortunately i landed in some bushes that broke my fall but for a few glorious moments i thought i was dead why glorious havent you ever wanted to be dead i have sometimes life is just so much trouble dont you think so i nodded yes ive wanted that too quite recently as a matter of fact i go to bed wanting to blow my brains out and wake up wondering why i didnt do it i guess thats why im here you make a very diverting alternative to the idea of selfslaughter im glad about that parsifal hey i dont even know your name and i should know something about you if im going to let you walk me home dont you think my name is bernhard gunther she nodded and closed her eyes as if she was trying to visualize my name in her minds eye bernhard gunther hmm yes what does that mean sssh im trying to connect with it im a little bit psychic you see while youre there see if you cant get a fix on where ive left my postal savings bank book theres five hundred marks in there id like to get my hands on she opened her eyes thats a solid name bernhard gunther dependable honest and wealthy with it too i can do a lot with five hundred marks this is looking good tell me what kind of work does bernie gunther do she pressed her hands together in supplication no wait let me guess its better that i tell you you dont think i cant guess im certain you were in the army but now im not sure if you were on leave then its been quite a long one hasnt it so maybe you were wounded although you dont look like a man who was wounded then again maybe you got injured in the head and that might be why you say youre suicidal a lot of boys are these days i mean a lot only they dont put that kind of thing in the newspapers because its bad for morale frau lippert had another lodger who was a corporal in a police battalion and he hanged himself off a canal bridge in moabit he was a nice boy you know i might say you were a civil servant but youre a little too muscular for that and the suit well no civil servant would ever wear a suit like that arianne listen to me youre no fun at all gunther i dont want you to get the wrong idea about why im here what does that mean it means im a cop from the police praesidium at alexanderplatz the smile dried on her face like id poured poison in her ears she sat there for a moment stunned immobile as if a doctor had told her she had six months to live i was used to her reaction and i didnt blame her for it there wasnt anyone in berlin who wasnt deeply afraid of the police including the police because when you said police everyone thought about the gestapo and when you started to think about the gestapo it was soon hard to think of anything else you could have mentioned that earlier she said stiffly or is that how it works you let someone talk themselves into trouble give them enough rope so that they can hang themselves like my friend its not like that at all im a detective not gestapo whats the difference the difference is that i hate the nazis the difference is that i dont care if you say hitler is the son of beelzebub the difference is that if i was gestapo you would already be in a police van and on your way to number eight number eight whats that youre not from berlin are you not originally she shook her head number eight prinz albrechtstrasse gestapo headquarters i wasnt exaggerating not in the least if sachse and wandel had heard even half of her story arianne tauber would have been sitting in a chair with her skirt up and a hot cigarette in her panties i knew how those bastards questioned people and i wasnt about to condemn her to that not without being damned sure she was guilty as it happened i believed at least half of her story and that was enough to prevent me from handing her over to the gestapo i thought she was probably a prostitute an occasional one to make ends meet a lot of single women were you could hardly blame them for that any kind of a living was hard to come by in berlin but i didnt think she was a spy for the czechs no spy would have volunteered so much to a man in a club she hardly knew well so what happens now are you going to arrest me didnt i already tell you to forget all about what happened didnt i tell you that there never was an envelope and there was no gustav she nodded silently but still i could see she was unable to grasp what i was telling her listen to me arianne provided you take my advice youre in the clear well almost there are only three people who could possibly connect you with what happened one of them is this fellow gustav and one of them is paul the man who attacked you only hes dead what you didnt tell me that how his body turned up in kleist park a day or so after that taxi hit him on nolli he must have crawled there in the blackout and died the third person who knows about this is me and im not about to tell anyone oh i get it i suppose you want to sleep with me before you hand me over to your pals in the gestapo you want to have me yourself is that it no its not like that at all then what is it like and dont tell me its because you think im special parsifal because i wont believe you im going to tell you why angel but not here not now until then you think about everything ive said and then ask yourself why i said it ill be waiting outside at two i can still walk you home if you want or you can walk home by yourself and i give you my word you wont be woken up at five am by men in leather coats you wont ever see me again all right chapter i went back to the alex for a while and sat at my desk and wondered if there might be a way of finding gustav without involving arianne tauber she and only she could have identified him and for that reason alone it seemed unlikely that he would ever go back to the jockey and risk seeing her again especially if he was what it seemed he was almost certainly a spy more than likely hed lost his nerve about meeting his czech contact on nolli possibly he thought he was already being shadowed by the gestapo but if they had been tailing him then surely theyd have picked her up when she met gustav at the romanisches cafe if he was under surveillance then the gestapo would never have risked allowing him to pass information to her it seemed more likely that gustav had lost his nerve in which case who better than a joylady to deliver something to his czech contact most of the prostitutes id ever known were resourceful courageous and above all greedy for a hundred marks there wasnt a silk in berlin who wouldnt have agreed to what gustav had asked handing over an envelope in the dark was a lot easier and quicker and on the face of it safer than sucking someones pipe working late it was lehnhoff victor keil aka franz koci i said the kleist park case yeah what about it the uniformed fairy that found him under the bushes sergeant otto macher do you know him well well enough do you think hes honest meaning what its a straightforward question gottfried is he honest as far as it goes these days in my book it goes all the way to the altar theres a war on so maybe not as far as that look gottfried were both in the shithouse agegroup and i certainly dont want to cause any trouble for you and sergeant macher but i need to know if our dead czecho was carrying more than just the fifty marks we found on him all of the lavatories at the alex had three numbers on the door of which two were always and the phrase shithouse agegroup was used to indicate anyone born before and therefore over the age of forty if you say youre in the shithouse then i believe you said lehnhoff but from what ive heard around the factory youre here not because youre ready for your pension but because youve got vitamin b he meant that i had connections with senior nazis who would keep me better nourished than other men with heydrich he added who told you that does it matter thats the splash on the mens porcelain the czechos watch was gone it wasnt at his apartment when we searched it and there wasnt a pawn ticket but i really dont care about that im guessing he had at least five alberts on him when he was first found in the park there were only fifty on him by the time i made his acquaintance i need to know if im right about that you dont have to say anything just nod or shake your head and well say no more about it lehnhoffs head remained still then he grinned i cant help you i just dont know but even if i did what makes you think id tell you i stood up and came around the desk i dont like threatening other men with my vitamin b i much prefer it if people pay attention to my natural authority me being a commissarn all that wont work either sir lehnhoff was still grinning as he left my office i picked up my coat and followed him out onto the landing cool air was drifting up the enormous stairwell down on the ground floor there were raised voices but that was normal in the alex even at the best of times the place was like a zoo full of all kinds of wild and noisy animals but up on the third floor things were quieter the blackout curtains were drawn and most of the lights were off at the other end of the landing was an abandoned floor polisher it looked a lot like me then the raised voices on the ground floor became a little more urgent and someone cried out with pain someone was working overtime and it gave me an idea hey gottfried i said catching him up you know what they used to say about this place lehnhoff stopped at the top of the stairs and looked at me with open contempt whats that be careful on the stairs i hit him in the stomach hard enough to bend him in two and fold him over the balustrade so that he could empty his fat gut into the stairwell if it was my lucky day some nazi would slip on lehnhoffs soup and break his collarbone holding him by the collar i pushed him down so that his feet tipped off the shiny floor and then slammed my forearm across one of his kidneys he yelled out with the pain of it but that was fine because nobody ever paid much attention to the sound of pain at the alex it was one more background noise like the sound of a typewriter or a telephone ringing in an empty room i could have slugged lehnhoff all night until he was groaning for his pastor and it would have been just another night at police headquarters to anyones ears now i said bending close to lehnhoffs waxy ear do i get an answer to my question or would you like to go downstairs three flights at a time yes yes yes okay god please his subsequent answers sounded exactly like a cry for help we took a hundred marks off him me and macher sixty for me and forty for him please in twenties yes yes twenties yes pull me up for gods sake i pulled him back off the balustrade and dumped him on the linoleum where he lay curled and twitching and whimpering as if his mother had just delivered him onto the alex floor he gasped what the hell hmm whats that what the hell difference does it make to you anyway a hundred fucking marks its not the money i dont care about that its just that i didnt have the time or even the inclination to wait until you were ready to answer my question you know something i think ive been affected deeply by working in an environment where within the context of a police interrogation violence is now endemic ill get you for this gunther ill make a fucking complaint just see if i dont hmm i wouldnt rush into that if i were you remember ive got vitamin b gottfried i twisted the hair on his scalp so that i could tap the back of his skull against the balustrade i can see in the dark and i can hear everything you say from a hundred miles away the jazz lovers outside the jockey bar had called it a night and several smartlooking mercedes cars were parked out front with drivers who were impatient to take their masters home in comfort and safety or as safe as could be managed with most of your headlights taped up there was a rumble in the sky but it wasnt the raf i could feel a breeze in the air and the breeze had an edge of moisture that was the vanguard of something heavier minutes later it started to rain i moved into an inadequate doorway and buttoned my coat tight against my neck but it wasnt long before it started to feel more like a shower curtain and i cursed my stupidity for not bringing along the nailbrush and the shard of soap that i kept in my desk drawer but an umbrella would probably have been better suddenly walking a prostitute home even a pretty one looked like a bad idea in a whole novel full of miserable ideas by some miserable french writer the sort of novel that gets turned into an even more miserable movie starring charles laughton and fredric march and reminding myself why i was there she was the only person who had met franz koci whose homicide i was supposed to be investigating i pulled my hat down over my ears and pressed myself hard into the doorway ten minutes went by most of the cars drove away with their passengers it was twofifteen a kilometre to the west of where i was standing the fuhrer purported to be a bit of a night owl was probably putting on his pyjamas combing his moustache and cleaning his teeth before sitting down to write his diary at around twotwenty the door of the jockey bar opened and for a brief moment an obtuse triangle of dim light fell on the patentshiny sidewalk long enough for me to see a woman wearing a raincoat and a hat and carrying a mans umbrella she looked one way and then the other before glancing at her watch it was arianne tauber abandoning my inadequate refuge i walked quickly forward and presented myself in front of her you look like a widows handkerchief she said its only what happens when air turns back into water youre a chemist you should know that and you should know i changed my mind about letting you walk me home looks like i got wet for nothing then thats precisely why ive decided to walk you home copper all that water dripping off your hat if we move your head the right way we can probably fill a couple of glasses so its probably lucky that i managed to steal a halfbottle of johnnie walker to go with it thats the only reason im late i had to wait for the right moment to lead the raiding party on ottos bar with a pitch like that i might just allow you to walk me home and then up the stairs well we can hardly drink it in the street its quite a walk from luther strasse to fasanenstrasse and it was fortunate that the rain eased soon after we began even so we were obliged to stop a couple of times and take a nibble off her bottle amundsen wouldnt have approved of breaking into our supplies so soon after setting off from base camp but then he had sled dogs and all we had were soaking wet shoes by the time we reached my apartment the halfbottle of johnnie walker was only a third which is probably why we took off our clothes and it being wartime when these things seemed to happen a little more quickly than of old we went straight to bed and after a few minutes of animal magic to remind us both of happier times before god got angry with the people who stole the fruit of his favourite tree we resumed our earlier conversation with small glasses in our hands and perhaps a little less front its pointless trying to maintain a persona concealing ones true nature from the world when your damp clothes are lying in a hurried heap on the floor i never slept with a cop before how was it now i know why cops have big feet i hate to sound like a cop so soon after you are going to arrest me no no i wont come quietly so i noticed no arianne ive been thinking about your job at the jockey bar and wondering if you should give it up or not in case gustav does go back there looking for you and what did you conclude commissar that if the gestapo had arrested him and brought him back to the bar to look for you then youd be in trouble true but even if i did leave the club they wouldnt have a problem finding me otto has all my details my work book number my address everything no if i left there id also have to leave my room and go underground which is impossible that sort of thing takes money and connections thats the very same conclusion i came to myself as i see it there are two other possibilities one is that he assumes you handed over the envelope as agreed and never comes back at all he gave you that envelope to give to paul because he was scared to give it to paul himself and that could mean hes too scared ever to return to the club and ask you anything more about it the other possibility is that he does come back and if he does then you find an excuse to telephone me at the alex and then i come along and arrest him conveniently leaving me out of it right i nodded and drank some more of the scotch it was the first proper liquor id tasted since coming back from the ukraine normally i dont drink scotch but this tasted just fine like some fiery drink of the gods that might have been gathered from a hive of immortal bees my own sting was gone at least for the moment but after the defilement of my flesh i was beginning to feel divine again conveniently leaving you out of it you said paul was found dead in kleist park but you didnt say any more no i didnt how do you know it was him i was as close to him as i am to you now and im not sure i would have recognized him again it was him all right his injuries were those of a man whod been hit by a car and its not like there were any other unreported traffic accidents in that area that night so who was he do you really want to know im not sure maybe maybe not maybe you should decide gunther i asked myself how much she ought to know and when i told her it was mainly because i wanted to see how she would react despite our being in bed together maybe because of it i wasnt yet satisfied that she was as innocent as she had led me to believe but even if she did turn out to be rather more culpable than i had previously supposed i couldnt imagine myself serving her up cold to the gestapo the man you were paid to meet at nolli he was really a czech called franz koci who was working for the three kings you mean those terrorists who were in the newspapers earlier this year yes now i am scared she closed her eyes and lay back against the pillow then sat up abruptly and stared at me with wide eyes you know what that means dont you it means that gustav must be some sort of spy for the czechs id say that was a pretty good guess what am i going to do you might try to remember some more about gustav and if that doesnt happen i might tie you over a table and beat it out of you myself like the gestapo do they really do that ive heard stories all of them are true im afraid maybe i should go underground after all she shook her head and shivered it must be bad enough to have someone hurt you to make you tell them something you know but to have someone hurt you when youve got nothing you can tell them that doesnt bear thinking of and thats precisely why i want you to tell me all about gustav once again from the very beginning everything you remember and everything you might have forgotten your best chance of disappearing from this picture is to paint another of him theres a little red warning card with a hole in the middle that the ministry of propaganda likes you to slip over the tuning dial of your radio racial comrades it says you are germans it is your duty not to listen to foreign radio stations those who do so will be mercilessly punished now me im a good listener a lot of being a good detective is knowing when to shut up and let someone else do the talking arianne liked to talk that much was obvious and while she told me nothing new about gustav she told me quite a lot about herself which was of course the main point of the exercise she was from dresden where shed gone to university her husband karl also a student from dresden had joined the german navy in the summer of and had been killed on a uboat in february three months later her father a commercial traveller had been killed during a bombing raid while on a business trip to hamburg naturally i checked up on all of this later exactly as arianne had described her fiances boat u had been sunk by depthcharges from a british minesweeper in the river clyde in scotland twentyfive men including karl and the boats commander were lost her younger brother albrecht had joined the army in but now he was with the military police her father had worked for the pharmaceutical works in dresden and often did business with eh worlee another chemical company in hamburg soon after herr taubers death arianne had come to berlin to work for bvg the berlin transport company as a secretary to the director of anhalter railway station but she had quit this job a good job because she said he couldnt keep his hands off her his was a predicament with which i strongly sympathized i couldnt keep my hands off her either chapter planting evidence was hardly uncommon at the alex for a lot of detectives lacking the skills or the patience to do the job properly it was the only way they could ever secure a conviction id never done it myself but theres a first time for everything and in the absence of the evidence that was legally held by the gestapo in the death of franz koci i decided to find some new evidence that hitherto was held only by me but first i had to make lehnhoffs earlier onthescene inquiry seem like what it was incompetent only more so and when i reviewed his case notes i discovered that no fingertip search of the area in kleist park where kocis body was discovered had ever been conducted so i telephoned sachse at gestapo headquarters to prick his ears with this new information i thought you told me that all of the evidence at the scene of the crime had been collected i did it was like hell with a homicide especially an important homicide like this one its standard practice to have ten or fifteen police officers on their hands and knees in a line to comb the general area or at least it was while this department had real police working here real police who did real police work but theres no record of a fingertip search of the ground where kocis body was found but looking for what evidence what evidence i dont know i cant tell you what it might be but i think id recognize it when i saw it you really think that parks worth another look under the circumstances yes i do between you and me inspector lehnhoff the first investigating detective is lazy and dishonest so it wouldnt have been your fault if the ground wasnt properly searched i suppose you just took his word for it that things had been done properly i was saying half of this in case lehnhoff decided to say anything about my assaulting him well yes i did i thought so all right you werent to know but under the circumstances youd better organize a search yourself commissioner ludtke has told us all that budgets at the alex are tight i dont want him coming down on my neck about the cost of this ill organize it immediately good please let me know if they find anything of course i knew exactly what they were going to find in kleist park i knew because id already put it there myself and when later on that same day sachse appeared in my office with a plastic bag containing a switchblade i made a big show out of looking surprised this is made by mikov i said examining the switchblade carefully thats in czechoslovakia isnt it i mean bohemia and moravia yes that would fit with our friend franz koci wouldnt it i leaned back in my chair and frowned a frown that could have made it big in silent movies i wonder what i made another big show of thinking hard i walked around my office which contained several filing cabinets a lot of empty ashtrays and on the wall a nice picture of adolf hitler the picture had been put there by the previous occupant and while i hated it for me to have taken it down would in the eyes of the gestapo have made me look like gavrilo princip i opened one of the filing cabinets this was as full as the prussian state library and contained unsolved cases and reports going back years very little of what was in there had anything to do with me and for all i know philipp melancthons report to the diet of worms was one of the older files at the back of the drawer but i knew what i was looking for i forced a gap and tugged out a grey folder with geert vrankens name on the corner geert vranken aged thirtynine a foreign railway worker from dordrecht in the netherlands educated at the university of the hague murdered earlier this month his body what remained of it was found on the railway line just south of jannowitz bridge after being struck by a train to friedrichshagen what about it sachse sat down on the corner of my desk folded his arms and then checked his hair this was still as neat as a field of wheat and approximately the same colour and i briefly wondered if it ever looked any different in a high wind or underwater probably not his head could have been found on the roof of the pintsch factory like vrankens after a train had gone over his neck and there wouldnt have been a hair out of place i was the investigating officer thats what and while its not uncommon for people to get hit by trains in the dark it is uncommon to find that they had already sustained multiple stab wounds i examined the torso myself and i seem to remember that the contour of the wounds was not unlike the shape of this bohemian switchblade how can we find out for sure got a car of course good you can drive me out to the charite lets hope that they havent incinerated the body sachse pulled up at the corner of the charite opposite the lessing theatre where ida wust was playing in a show called the main point is happiness i couldnt disagree with that how about it werner shall i go in and get us a pair of tickets while were here sachse smiled thinly and shook his head not an ida wust fan huh you surprise me that old trout you must be joking she reminds me of my motherinlaw but the other ones all right jane tilden shes a bit too wholesome for my taste i opened the car door but sachse stayed put arent you coming in you dont need me in there do you sachse was already looking a little green and after hearing me relate my favourite but strictly afterdinner anecdotes from the gay world of forensic science i couldnt blame him for not wanting to come in to the pathological institute this of course was the intention behind these gruesome stories i hardly wanted the mortuary attendant asking me any awkward questions in front of werner sachse about why i was back there with the same knife to check the same wounds in the same body strictly speaking i said there should always be two officers present when a body is examined however on this occasion perhaps that wont be necessary nothing ever quite prepares you for the sight of a body thats been chewed up by a railway locomotive sachse nodded thanks gunther youre all right chuckling sadistically the idea of a squeamish gestapo man just struck me as funny i went into the hospital and along to the morgue where i found the same attendant and having established that vrankens dismembered body was still safely stored there informed him that the investigation was now a gestapo matter and that in no circumstances was the body to be released for burial or incineration without first clearing it with me as always mention of the gestapo worked an almost magical effect akin to uttering open sesame and the attendant signalled his total compliance with a nervous bow of course there was no need to see or examine vrankens body again i already knew what i was going to tell werner sachse that franz koci had murdered geert vranken and feeling pleased that i had managed to reopen what was now a proper murder case i made my way back to the car a good humour never lasts long in berlin the smell of the war wounded in that hospital was asphyxiating dying men lay in dusty wards like so much left luggage while to walk through a hallway or public corridor was to negotiate an obstacle course of rickety old wheelchairs and dirty plaster casts and if all of that wasnt bad enough i came out of the hospital and encountered a little squad of hitler youth marching down luisenstrasse most likely from a trip to see the national warriors monument in the invaliden park their throats full of some stupid warlike song and quite oblivious of the german warriors true fate that was to be found in the notsoglorious charnel house nearby for a moment i stood and watched these boys with a kind of horror it was all too easy to think of them as carrying the infection of nazism the brownshirted bacilli of death and destruction and the typhus of tomorrow feeling more sombre than before i tapped on the window of the horchbuilt audi its a useful courtesy to observe with a man sleeping in his own car when he happens to be carrying a loaded automatic sachse sat up straight lifted the tip of his black felt hat and opened the passenger door any luck yes if you can call it that the dutchman was stabbed by the czech all right franz kocis knife fitted those stab wounds like theyd been cut for it by a good tailor well youre the expert the question is why why would a czech spy stab and kill a dutch railway worker chapter after this breakthrough thats what sachse called it anyway the investigation stalled again the way investigations usually do i wasnt too worried about that detective work is almost always a long game unless the newspapers get involved and then its still a long game only you have to pretend that its not this job isnt only a matter of paying attention to detail its also about knowing what to ignore and who as well its about reading the newspapers and staring into space and learning to be patient and to put your trust in your experience which tells you that something nearly always turns up yes sir the investigation is going very well no sir theres nothing we could be doing that we havent done already good morning anything new on the franz koci case no new leads as yet good night collect your pay go home and do your best to forget all about it if you can a lot of police work is police idle police baffled police at breakfast police at lunch police drinking coffee if there is any coffee and always police staring out of the window assuming there is one and it all adds up to the same thing that mostly being a detective is about coping with boredom and the huge frustration of knowing that it isnt ever like it is in books and movies other things have to take place before something else can happen sometimes these are other crimes sometimes theyre things other than crimes and sometimes its hard to know the difference for instance when a new law is passed or when a top policeman is promoted thats jurisprudence for you nazi style the new law was the yellow star which made a big difference when it finally came into practice on september the day before there were just people on the streets of berlin ordinary people you might say they were my fellow berliners the next day there were all these people wearing yellow stars which made me realize just how many jews were living in berlin and at the same time what a terrible thing it was to treat our fellow citizens in this way now and again there were even small demonstrations against the wearing of the yellow star not by jews but by gentile germans in favour of the jews people talked about the yellow badge of honour and the stoic way the jews endured their fate did not fail to impress even the most fanatical of nazis except of course the fanatical nazi who had signed this new police law into being and he was in my mind a great deal after saturday september when he was promoted reichsprotector of bohemia and moravia there was no way that the man who was my boss reinhard heydrich would ever have been impressed with the way jewishgermans conducted themselves when i heard that heydrich was on his way to prague i was glad although not of course for him i was glad he was to be gone from berlin where there always existed the possibility that he might hand me some special task as had happened at least twice before and for a day or two i even managed to relax i took arianne to the lido at muggelsee and then to a show at the schlosspark theatre in steglitz somewhere in the day i even managed to ask her about geert vranken never heard of him he was a foreign worker from dordrecht in the netherlands dordreck no wonder he came to berlin not dordreck dordrecht why ask me because i think he may have been murdered by your friend paul who franz koci the czecho that gustav asked you to meet on nolli platz arianne rolled her eyes oh him id only just managed to forget all about that business she uttered a profound sigh and smacked the wicker beach chair we were sharing with her fist what happened to him this dutchy i told her how geert vranken had died and i told her about franz kocis switchblade thats really awful and you mean to tell me that the poor man is still lying in the mortuary at the charite like last weeks onepot dinner i nodded what about his family i wrote to his wife telling her what had happened that was big of you i didnt have to do it in fact i was almost ordered not to do it but i thought someone should like you i felt sorry for her besides i was hoping that his wife might write back with some more information something that would help me to find her husbands murderer you didnt tell her no no i just said thered been an accident and that because of wartime regulations it was impossible for his body to be sent back but that id see to it personally that he got a decent burial and will you i mean that sounds expensive as a matter of fact im hoping to persuade the gestapo to pay for it how are you going to do that by lying i shall tell them that the mortuary needs the space which is true and also that its best vrankens remains are not cremated in case we need to examine the body again which is not something like that im really quite a good liar when the occasion demands it i dont doubt it gunther and the widow have you heard back from her not yet and i probably wont would you write to some nazi bastard who was occupying your country we were both silent for a while the way you are on a beach on the blue water there were lots of little white boats that looked as if they were made of paper we watched the boats and we watched children building sandcastles and some girls playing volleyball the beach was crowded with people who like us figured it was maybe the last day of summer and who were worried we might be in for another hard winter like the last one when the temperature fell as low as minus twentytwo degrees centigrade this of course was just one of many things we berliners had to worry about following the overthrow of kiev the german high command had issued a victory communique announcing that the army was now in charge of soviet prisoners this seemed like a fantastic figure and there were some who thought it meant that the war in the east was all but won but there were many others like myself who thought that there were probably a lot more soviet soldiers where those men came from eventually arianne said ive been thinking of going back to dresden to visit my mother good idea you could come with me if you like its only two hours on the train ill probably stay there for a couple of weeks but you might like to stay for the weekend she shrugged youd enjoy dresden its not like berlin where theres no room my mother has a huge apartment in johann georgen allee overlooking the park and of course its much safer than berlin i dont think theres ever been an air raid she was wearing a blue lastex swimsuit that was like a dress and showed off her legs which looked lovely to me i was trying to keep my eyes on her face as she talked but it was difficult when all i wanted to do was lay my muzzle on her lap and have her play with my ears and pull my tail i am supposed to be investigating a murder i said eventually two murders if you count geert vranken however neither one of them is paying out right now and i am owed some leave so maybe yes i could use a holiday only im going to have to clear it with the commissioner he worries when im not around im the last real cop in berlin when i go its just the two sentries out front of the alex and the cleaning lady so ill let you know angel tomorrow probably chapter im afraid thats quite impossible bernie i shifted uncomfortably in ludtkes office i felt about ten years old a schoolboy again in trouble with his headmaster would you mind telling me why sir i was about to ive just had a telephone call from an ss major called doctor achim ploetz never heard of him in prague ludtke grinned yes i thought that would shut you up major ploetz is the chief adjutant to general heydrich it seems that your presence is required in bohemia and moravia or perhaps its just bohemia im not sure he shrugged whichever one prague is in is where you are requested to go i felt a sudden chill on the back of my neck as if id run my finger along the edge of the blade of the falling axe at plotzensee heydrich had that effect on people which was probably why he was nicknamed the hangman did major ploetz explain why im needed in prague sir it seems that the general is planning some sort of weekend with friends at his country house outside prague to celebrate his appointment as the new reichsprotector of bohemia i had no idea that you and general heydrich were on such cordial terms bernie no sir nor had i oh come now you might not wear a scary badge on your lapel but everyone at the alex knows youve got vitamin b even the footballs handle you with care many gestapo officers were fond of wearing leather coats and hats and since many of them were also better fed than the rest of us and hence fatter too they were known as footballs but sadly kicking one was not an option perhaps ill have my own adjutant telephone the generals adjutant and inform him that i will have to decline the invitation i said you do that what about the case im working on this czech spy who got himself killed you told me it was a traffic accident didnt you happens every day and spies are apparently no exception yes but im pretty sure that he murdered that dutch foreign worker geert vranken you remember the fellow who got himself hit by a train after receiving multiple stab wounds im sure hell be waiting for you when you get back from your weekend with the general ludtke looked like he was enjoying my discomfort he knew the truth about my dislike for the nazis but it didnt stop him from savouring my dilemma for me not to be a party member and yet still in such apparent high favour with heydrich was amusing to him it amused me too which is to say it stopped me from thinking about much else doctor ploetz you say yes ludtke leaned back in his chair and folded his hands behind his head as if he was about to surrender i hear pragues very nice at this time of year ive often fancied going there with the wife she collects glass you know and theres a lot of glass in prague that should keep the nazis happy they like smashing glass here maybe you should go instead of me oh no ludtke smiled i wouldnt know what to say to a man as important as the reichsprotector of bohemia my god i should be surprised if he even knew i existed any man who can persuade berlin detectives to wear womens clothes in order to catch a murderer is certain to have been noticed upstairs its kind of you to say so bernie but of course i had lots of help remember georg heuser yes georg heuser was one of my best detectives on the sbahn murder case good man is georg of course he lacks your subtlety and experience but hes a promising young policeman and of more use here than where he is now and where is that in a special action group somewhere in the ukraine i didnt reply suddenly going to prague didnt seem so bad after all not when they were still sending good men to special action groups in the ukraine just thinking about georg heuser and what he was probably going through in minsk or pinsk or dnipropetrovsk or any one of a hundred jew towns where innocent people were being murdered in their thousands made me feel that i was much better off than i realized and all talk of an sbahn murderer seemed laughable when one of our own investigating detectives now seemed likely to chalk up more victims in twentyfour hours than paul ogorzow had managed in one murderous year ludtke played with the rocker blotter on his desk for a moment as if trying to measure something you hear stories he said finally about what is happening out east in ukraine and latvia for example the police battalions special action groups and what have you you were there bernie what is the truth about whats happening is it true what theyre saying that people are being murdered men women and children because theyre jews i nodded my god he said i think you once said that whenever i came in here it was like rain coming in at the eaves now you know why since i came home there hasnt been a day when i didnt feel ashamed and the nights are worse my god thats the third time youve mentioned god friedrichwilhelm and ive been thinking that there must be a god because after all the leader is always mentioning him and its inconceivable he could be wrong about that but what weve done to the jews and what were still doing to the jews and i think what we seem intent on doing to the jews for a good while longer well hes not going to forgive that in a hurry perhaps not ever in fact ive a very terrible feeling that whatever we do to them hes going to do to us only itll be worse much worse itll be much worse because hes going to get the fucking russians to do it i hear prague is very nice at this time of year ive often wanted to go there arianne shook her head i really cant imagine why i havent been already after all prague is only a couple of hours on the train from dresden and my mamas a germanspeaking czech from teplitz did i tell you that she moved to dresden when she met my papa not that she ever really thought of herself as a czech nobody does in teplitz at least thats what my mama says she paused maybe i could go and see my brother his unit is stationed near prague we were at kempinskis vaterland on potsdamer platz a department store of cafes and restaurants that described itself as the jolliest place in berlin and which was as ersatz as the coffee we were drinking in the grinzing cafe which with its diorama of old vienna and the danube river was itself pretty ersatz of the several bars and cafes in vaterland arianne much preferred the wild west bars logcabin walls american flags and the picture of custers last stand but immediately outside its door was an amusement machine with a lightgun on which you could shoot at pictures of aircraft and the citys young antiaircraft gunners were fond of using it for their boisterous practice this particular form of entertainment was too like the real thing for my money and so we sat in the grinzing and hugged each other fondly in sight of a trompeloeil of the austrian capital city with miniature bridges mechanical boats and an electric trainset while a little orchestra played strauss waltzes it was like being a giant or a god which in germany usually amounts to the same thing arianne was smaller than me by a head and while that didnt make her freia to my fasolt she was very much a goddess of feminine love id seldom had a lover as expert as arianne and after the depressing horrors of the ukraine which whenever possible i was keen to put out of my mind perhaps i was falling for her hell i had fallen for her since meeting her i hadnt thought about killing myself not once i knew she was riding for herself but i could hardly blame her for that the whole damned country was addicted to its own selfish pursuits so i heard her out as she made her play and probably smiled a fond indulgent sort of smile as she went about it because while there was a part of me that still didnt trust her there was an even larger part that simply didnt care not any more i was in gaza bound with new ropes and fresh bowstrings with my hair in knots and my head in her lap sometimes it just happens that way have you got a passport she nodded when i was working for bvg my boss told me to get one so i could accompany him on a business trip to italy i knew what i was in for and if wed ever actually got there i might have let him sleep with me only his wife found out that i was going and then i wasnt going and then i was out of a job its a very common story youd need a visa of course sure from the police praesidium on alexanderplatz isnt that convenient you working there and everything i dont know its possible you might need to produce some certification concerning the military importance of your journey in which case well there is no military importance angel not unless we count the restoration of my own morale but somehow i dont see them buying that one arianne shook her head no you only need that kind of certification if youre planning to take the express train smiling she added you forget i used to work for bvg i know all the rules and regulations that affect the railways no certification of a journeys relevance is required for any other train if we take the regular service between anhalter station and jan masaryk station there wont be a problem i could probably remember the timetable if i put my mind to it i dont doubt it but look angel im not sure where ill be staying or what ill be doing you might find yourself on your own for longer than youd like for longer than id like if it comes to that it could even be dangerous ill go and see the sights when youre not around that shouldnt be too difficult to do germans now the official language in prague and its not like ill be wearing a uniform so i cant see how im likely to get into any trouble or how it could possibly be dangerous she frowned i think youre just saying that because you dont want me to come with you i wasnt thinking about the danger you might be in from the czechos i said frankly theyre the least of our problems no theres something far more dangerous in prague than the damned czechos and whats that the new reichsprotector of bohemia and moravia thats what general reinhard heydrich someone once said theres no fool like an old fool in love but middleaged fools arent any less foolish i walked home and thought some more about taking arianne with me to prague no matter how smart you are sometimes you just have to sit down and lay out a balance sheet to help you decide on something on the credit side arianne was a potential liability and on the debit side she gave me a lot of pleasure and not all of it horizontal they say that if in every transaction you can identify what you received where it came from and what it cost then you have debits and credits mastered but what they dont say is that sometimes you just figure the world owes you a little bit extra and to hell with the consequences in truth thats how most people handle lifes bookkeeping if you believe prince hamlet conscience makes cowards of us all but i can attest that its just as likely that conscience especially a guilty one can make you just a little bit reckless chapter i got down to berlins anhalter station about an hour before the train was due to depart so that i could meet arianne and make sure that we both got a seat in a compartment the newspaper vendors were shouting about the greatest victory in all military history at kiev and now and then about some smaller italian air success against the british at gibraltar a squadron of pigeons up in the rafters of the station roof must have been listening because they flew south across the station concourse in formation as if in honour of our wonderful armed forces and their brave italian allies the station was busy with people nowadays anhalter was always busier than lehrter or potsdam germans were not travelling west toward raf targets like hamburg and cologne if they could help it south was better and southeast was better still even the pigeons knew that much the train filled among the other passengers with a seat in our compartment was an old jew easily identified by the yellow star recently sewn onto the left breast pocket of his suit nothing else about him was jewish according to the filthy caricature of a jew you saw in the newsreels or on the front of der sturmer and prior to the nineteenth of september and heydrichs new police law i should have assumed the old man was just another berliner except that he was without question a brave one the knights cross with oak leaves he wore on a ribbon around his neck was eloquent proof of that and probably a clever way to offset the stigma of the yellow star by now people were standing in the corridor and a man wearing the uniform of a labour corps leader loudly demanded that the old man give up his place to a german from his substantial girth his relationship with real work looked tenuous to say the least normally i didnt interfere in these matters maybe it was the sight of the knights cross around the old mans neck maybe it was just that like a lot of other berliners i didnt like the yellow star but i was feeling more querulous in the face of nazi bullying stay where you are i told the jew and stood up to face down the labour leader his face reddened like a muscovy duck as he tried and failed to lift his chest above the polished brown belt around his waist and who the hell are you to interfere it was a fair question i wasnt in uniform that was in my suitcase and for once i was almost regretting not wearing it but i had the next best thing in my pocket my warrant disc i showed it to him in the palm of my hand and it had the usual effect of cowing the man and the rest of the carriage into respectful silence do you see a sign that says this carriage is forbidden to jews the labour leader glanced around redundantly there was a small printed panel that read attention the enemy is listening but nowhere was there an antisemitic sign of the kind you sometimes saw on park benches or at public baths even i was surprised about that he shook his head i pointed at arianne this woman worked for bvg until about a year ago thats right she said i was secretary to the director himself is there anything in the bvg railway rules and regulations that says a jew must give up his seat to a german no there isnt so there i said let that be an end of it go away and keep your ignorant mouth shut i might also have mentioned the decoration around the old jews neck but i didnt want anyone in that compartment thinking that this was the only reason i was interfering on his behalf there was a murmur of approval as the labour leader barrelled his way out of the compartment and down the carriage i sat down thank you sir said the old man tipping his hat dont mention it i said and tipped my own in return someone else said quietly no one likes that yellow star by now the old man was looking thoroughly bewildered as well he might be and he could reasonably have asked any of us how it was if none of us cared for the yellow star we had allowed heydrichs police order to happen if he had i might have suggested a better question how had we allowed heydrich to happen there was no easy answer to a question like that the old man got off the train in dresden which was a relief to everyone the sight of the word jew emblazoned on a man of such obvious valour made all of us feel thoroughly ashamed of ourselves despite what had been said about the yellow star no one in our compartment no one at all talked about the war the injunction on the wooden wall that the enemy might be listening was more effective than might have been imagined and since there was little else but the war on anyones mind this meant that none of the other passengers in our compartment said very much even arianne who liked to talk was silent for most of the journey the train travelled north of the elbe until bad schandau where it passed over a bridge onto the south bank then east and south again until schona where it halted to allow several customs officers to board everyone myself included until i flashed my beertoken was obliged to leave the train and have their luggage searched in the customs shed none of my fellow passengers protested after eight long years of nazism people knew better than to complain to authority besides these officers were backed by twenty or thirty ss who stood thuggishly on the platform ready to see off any trouble the customs officers themselves were surprisingly courteous and polite they did not bother to search arianne or her bags when i informed them that she was travelling with me if they had i wonder what they might have found while the rest of the passengers were in the customs shed and we were alone in the compartment she looked at me strangely youre an odd one parsifal i cant figure you out what do you mean the way you stuck up for that old jew back there jesus i thought you were supposed to be a nazi whatever gave you that idea i dont know maybe its the company you keep we dont see much of general heydrich in my circle hes not an easy man to disappoint i can imagine can you i wonder i wasnt always his creature even before the nazis took over i was out of the police because of my politics which is to say that like most people who supported the old republic i didnt really have any politics except i wasnt a nazi and i wasnt a red but that was no good see not in the cops so i left but theyd have kicked me out anyway then in not being a nazi made me seem like good police again i wasnt about to chalk someone up for a crime just because they were jewish that was useful to heydrich and so he ordered me back into kripo and ive been stuck there ever since worse than that if im honest suddenly when war was declared if you were in kripo you were also in the ss and when we attacked russia i shook my head well from time to time im useful to him in the same way a toothpick might be useful to a cannibal youre worried he might eat you too is that it something like that perhaps if more people stood up to heydrich the way you stood up to that fat labour leader she shrugged i dont know you dont know heydrich people dont ever stand up to heydrich for very long most often they end up standing in front of a firing squad if theyre lucky youre a bit like faust i suppose and heydrich is your mephistopheles i nodded except that i havent had any of the pleasures of the world out of the deal i didnt even get to seduce a beautiful and innocent girl gretchen isnt it no arianne youre hardly innocent but i am beautiful yes you are beautiful angel theres no doubt about that chapter an hour later we were moving again and quickly through bohemia although from the number of nazi flags and banners and german troops we saw you would scarcely have been aware of this and almost every czech town we passed through had a new german name so that it felt less like visiting a foreign country or even an autonomous territory which strictly speaking is what a protectorate amounts to and more like a colony we reached prague in the late afternoon according to my austrian baedeker for some reason this edition included a section on prague as if it was still a city in the old austrohungarian empire the hotel was just around the corner from masaryk station so we decided to walk there and holding ariannes bag and mine i led the way through a tall archway and short colonnade of doric pillars into a square entrance hall with a glass roof and a peeling maroon and gold plaster architrave that resembled something out of an abandoned villa in pompeii the hall was full of fieldgrey uniforms some of which eyed arianne hungrily like wolves i didnt blame them in the least she had a figure like a snake charmers pipe arianne herself was not unconscious of this effect and smiling happily she put an extra couple of notes into the swaying and seductive melody of her walk it was less than a hundred metres to the end of the street where the imperial hotel was situated the outside of the building was grey and quite unremarkable but inside the place was a shrine to art nouveau on the face of it this seemed at odds with the hotels obvious popularity with the german army which isnt well known for its interest in art except of course when its stealing it from some poor jew for gorings personal collection on the walls of the small but impressive entrancelobby was a creamycoloured ceramic relief featuring six classically dressed ladies exercising their pet lions i knew they were classically dressed because they were wearing little gold circlets with asps on their heads and because they had bare breasts a fashion of which generally i approve the breasts of women are a little hobby of mine and while i know why i enjoy looking at them and touching them it continues to elude me why i seem to like looking at them and touching them so much as soon as i saw the hotel entrancelobby and the huge cafe with its templetall mosaic pillars i thought of the ishtar gate at berlins pergamon museum and i suppose this might have been one reason the imperial was a local favourite with the german army then again it might just have been because the hotel was also expensive the wehrmacht likes expensive hotels and if it comes to that so do i since i first worked as the hotel detective at the adlon i have come to realize that i am very easily pleased usually the best is good enough either way the imperials cafe was full of soldiers and their offduty laughter their offcolour jokes and their betterquality better than berlin cigarette smoke our fifthfloor cornerroom had two windows from one side there was a fine view of the southeast of prague which was mostly spires and smoking chimneys from the other to the west you could see the rooftop immediately opposite which had one of those pepperpot domes made of oxidizing copper it looked like a large green samovar almost immediately we went to bed which seemed like the sensible thing to do as i had no idea of how soon heydrich would summon me to his country house or for how long and strenuous sex was something that had been on our minds ever since the train had left berlin although to be more precise it had probably been on my mind more than hers either way she didnt have to be persuaded very much it was love or at least a good imitation of it on my part at least and then there was life which of course is loves nemesis sliding under the door in the shape of a brown envelope i rolled off ariannes naked body and walked across the room to collect it arianne rolled onto her belly lit only her second cigarette of the day and watched me read the note mephistopheles im afraid so his driver will collect me first thing tomorrow morning in front of the hotel that certainly gives us plenty of time to do all kinds of things who knows we might even find time to see the sights i hear the charles bridge is worth a look is that what youd like to do not right now she blew smoke at the ceiling and then gave me a narroweyed look right now i just want some more of what i came for she put down her cigarette and lying back on the bed opened her arms and then her thighs everything else you know is just tourism and i can do that on my own i threw heydrichs note aside climbed back onto the bed and crawled between her thighs but for this she said i need help chapter the generals driver was an ss sergeant who told me his name was klein he was a large heavy man with fair hair a high forehead and an expressionless face i soon learned he was also tightlipped working for the reichsprotector of bohemia and moravia there was a lot to be tightlipped about the car was a dark green mercedes convertible and with its less than discreet number plate ss it was what klein drove when heydrich was not on official or state duties for those i soon learned there was a larger model a mercedes the had an extra spotlight mounted on the front fender in case the general had to stop and interrogate someone at the side of the road there was no flag on the wing but that hardly made me feel any less obvious or insecure both of us were in uniform the top was down there was no armed escort we were in enemy territory to me it felt like visiting an indian thuggee village wearing a red coat and whistling the british grenadiers and noting with some amusement my obvious discomfort klein explained that the general scorned any escort as a sign of weakness which was why he preferred him to be driven around prague with the top down and how often do you drive him around prague between prague castle and the generals country house twice a day regular as sunrise youre joking nope with one of the three kings at liberty that seems unwise to me we set off and i shrank back into the front passenger seat as a tall man standing beside the road snatched off his battered felt hat out of respect for who but more probably what we were there was a lot of that in prague because the nazis liked this kind of thing but i didnt like it at all any more than i liked driving around with a threecolour target painted on my chest and taking out my pistol i worked the slide and dropped it into the leather pocket on the inside of the car door from where it might be easily and quickly retrieved in an emergency klein laughed whats that for just ignore me sergeant i was in the ukraine until the end of august in the ukraine there are lots of ivans who want to kill germans i assume the same holds true for almost any conquered country except perhaps france i never felt unsafe in france so why feel unsafe here to my ignorant ears at least the czech language sounds a lot like russian thats why then let me reassure you sir to attack this or the generals other car ss would be to risk the most severe retribution thats what the general says and i believe him but what do you think klein shrugged i think this is a fast car and the general likes me to drive fast yes i noticed i think youd have to be damned lucky to ambush this car and that in the long run would be very unlucky for the czechos and for the general id have thought possibly you too sergeant really yours is not much of a threat because it seems to me as if their bad luck is predicated on yours its like saying that if you drown youll make sure you take them with you when theyre dead so are you we drove about fifteen kilometres northeast of the city centre to a small village called jungfernbreschan the czechos called it panenskebrezany which is probably czech for a very quiet village thats surrounded by a depressingly featureless landscape just a lot of flat recently ploughed and very smelly fields the village itself was rather more quaint and picturesque as long as your idea of what was quaint and picturesque included a few checkpoints and the odd detachment of motorized ss anyone foolish enough to have attacked heydrichs car would have discovered that the countryside afforded them little cover from these soldiers a team of assassins at jungfernbreschan would have been caught or killed within minutes even so i had to wonder why heydrich had chosen to live out here in the middle of nowhere when he had at his disposal in the centre of prague a castle the size of the kremlin not to mention a handful of elegant bohemian palaces maybe he was worried about defenestration there was a lot of that kind of thing in prague i wouldnt have minded pushing heydrich or any number of nazis out of a high window myself we turned off the main highway and klein steered the mercedes down a gently sloping road that wound around to the right and then the left there were trees now and the air was strong with the smell of freshly mown grass and pineneedles and after the grey misery of prague this felt like a place where it might be easier for heydrich to escape from the cares of the world even the ones he himself had inflicted or was planning to inflict at jungfernbreschan he might get away from it all just as long as he didnt mind the several hundred ss stormtroopers who were there to protect his privacy a handsomely baroque pink stucco house came into view on our right behind a gated and guarded archway i counted six windows on the upper floor it looked like a hunting lodge but i couldnt be sure id rarely been hunting myself and never for anything more elusive than a missing person a murderer or an errant wife and it was hard to comprehend how anyone wanting to shoot a few pheasants also needed a matching russian orthodox chapel and a swimming pool in the grounds to be able to do it of course its always possible that if id prayed a bit more and learned to swim a bit better i might have bagged the odd snipe or two myself is that general heydrichs new house no thats the upper castle von neurath continues to live there for the moment anyway konstantin von neurath had been the reichsprotector of bohemia until hitler decided he was too soft and gave the job to his blond butcher but before that von neurath had been the german foreign minister a job now held by the most unpopular man in germany joachim von ribbentrop theres an upper castle and a lower castle explained klein both of them were owned by some jewish sugar merchant but when the jew bastard took off in the estate was confiscated the main house is the lower castle further down the hill its a nicer house doesnt the general mind that the place used to be lived in by jews sir youve seen the propaganda films i said those people carry diseases dont they like rats klein shot me a look as if he wasnt quite sure if i was serious and decided wrongly that i was to be fair to him my sarcasm had a cautious ambivalence about it since coming back from the ukraine no its all right he insisted this merchant he only owned the house since originally the house was owned by a german aristocrat who lost the place to the bank who sold it to the jew at a knockdown price and before either of them the estate was owned by benedictine monks well you cant be less jewish than a benedictine monk now can you klein grinned stupidly and shook his head i was toying with the idea of asking how a man with a name like klein got to be in the ss at all let alone driving for heydrich when the larger gates of the lower castle came in sight in front of the gate posts were a pair of stone statues that would have given any animallover a moments pause one statue depicted a bear being torn to bits by a pair of hunting dogs and the other a similarly beleaguered wild boar but you could see how that sort of thing would have been appreciated by heydrich who was certainly the incarnation of nature red in tooth and claw beside the wild boar an ss soldier stepped out of his sentry box and came smartly to attention as our car turned into the gateway at the end of a drive about fifty metres long was the lower castle itself it was a modest little place but only by the standards of hermann goring or mussolini perhaps this castle was actually a late nineteenthcentury french style chateau but no less impressive for that with sixteen windows on each of two wellproportioned floors front and back unlike the pink stucco upper castle the lower castle was canaryyellow with a red roof a squaretower portico painted white and a central arched window that was about the same size as a ubahn tunnel on the immaculate lawn was yet another piece of stone statuary an enormous stag and two deer who were running away from the house i took one look at the number of ss patrolling the grounds and felt like galloping away myself with a couple of females in season for frolicsome company i might even have made it over the high wall klein drew up at the front door and switched off the s threelitre fourstroke engine as it cooled it ticked away like there was a family of mice living underneath the metre long hood for a moment i just sat there looking up at the house listening to the soothing coo of some pigeons and it seemed to the sound of someone not too far away who was shooting at them executions i said retrieving my pistol from the door pocket klein grinned hunting theres always something to shoot around here something or someone i can get you a gun if youd care to go out and bag something for the pot we eat a lot of game here at the castle well i always say if you cant play the game properly eat it that reminds me who do i give my food coupons to the lower castle didnt look like a food coupon sort of place but i said it anyway just for the fun of it you can forget about that sort of thing for a while this is not like berlin there are no shortages of anything the general lives very well out here in the countryside cigarettes booze chocolate vegetarian anything you want just ask one of them klein nodded in the direction of an approaching ss valet wearing a white mess jacket who opened my door and came smartly to attention im beginning to see why he lives here were not just outside prague were outside what counts as normal as well i stood up returned the hitler salute and followed the valet inside the house the main hallway was two storeys high with a wroughtiron gallery and a large ornate brass chandelier that looked like dante beatrice and the heavenly host of angels waiting around for an appointment with saint peter behind the heavy oak door was a longcase clock the size of a beech tree and which i quickly learned was about as good at keeping time there was a big round walnut wood table with a bronze of a mounted amazon fighting a panther the panther was wrapped around the horse which looked like a mistake when you took into account the amazons breasts then again the amazon had a spear in her hand so maybe the panther knew what he was doing there are some women who no matter how goodlooking they are its best to leave well alone across the hall and down a short flight of marble steps was a large room with tieside knoll sofas and a hardwood coffee table that might once have been a small caribbean island the only reason you might have assumed this was a room was if you also assumed that somewhere further than the human eye could see there were more walls and windows and a door or two there was a big empty fireplace with brass firedogs and a castiron screen that belonged on the door of a gaol above this was a mantelpiece with a musclebound atlas at each corner and on the mantel itself several framed photographs of hitler heydrich himmler and a strongly featured blonde i assumed was heydrichs wife lina in another picture she and heydrich were wearing tyrolean costume and playing with a baby they all looked very german and it was difficult not to think of those atlases as two poor czechs groaning under the burden of their new masters above the mantel there was a large and unnecessarily wellpainted portrait of the leader who seemed to be staring up at the lower castles gallery as if he was wondering when on earth someone was going to come down and inform him exactly what he was doing there i had exactly the same feeling myself as my eyes gradually adjusted to the size of the place i saw in the distance a set of french windows and through them a lawn some shrubberies and trees and the clear blue sky that was the inevitable and very pleasant corollary of having no neighbours a tall butler wearing a tailcoat and a wing collar glided silently into the hall and bowed giving me time enough to get a good look at his hair which like the deferential expression on his face seemed to have been painted on his head the iron cross first class ribbon on his coat lapel was a nice touch reminding everyone wearing a uniform that he too had done his bit in the trenches he had a thick jowly face and an even thicker beefsoup of a voice welcome sir to jungfernbreschan i am kritzinger the butler the general presents his compliments and asks you to join him for drinks on the terrace at twelvethirty pm he lifted one arm in the direction of the french windows as if he had been directing traffic on potsdamer platz please let me know if theres anything i can do to make your stay here more comfortable until then if youll come this way ill show you to your quarters my room in the north wing was larger and better appointed than id been expecting there was a goodsized bed a secretaire desk with three ebonized drawers for the clothes i had brought from the imperial a tablechair and a leather armchair that stood next to a fireplace that was laid but not lit in the window was a folding traytable with a princely range of alcoholic drinks chocolate newspapers and american cigarettes and as soon as kritzinger had made himself scarce i set about throwing away my johnnies and filling my cigarette case with a drink in my hand and a decent cigarette in my mouth i inspected my principality in more detail on the desk was a brumberg table lamp with a parchment shade and on the floor a dull maroon turkish kilim there were some towels on the end of my bed and the door had a key and a bolt for which i was grateful absurdly so when youre in a house thats already full of murderers its perhaps foolish to think that locking your door is going to keep you safe there were bars on the lowerfloor windows but not on those of the upper floor the window in my room which had some sturdy brass bolts had a fixed windowpane and two casements that opened out onto the back garden there was a roller blind for summer and some thick red curtains for when the weather turned colder which in that part of the world it always does i poked my head outside the ground was about five or six metres below the window ledge in the centre of a circular bed of flowers a sprinkler was a whirling dervish of water and rhythm beyond that was a gravel path lined with neatly trimmed bushes and then a thick clump of trees and on the lawn was another stone group of escaping deer that was perhaps a pair to the one in the front garden i lay on my bed and finished my drink and smoked my cigarette these did little to calm me to be under the same roof as heydrich made me nervous i got up and poured myself another drink which helped but only a little whatever he wanted i knew it wouldnt sit well with my conscience which was already badly bruised and i resolved that when eventually he got around to explaining what this was i would tell him as politely as i could to go to hell there was no way i was ever going back to the ukraine to perform some loathsome act of genocide and it really didnt matter if that meant being sent to a concentration camp i wasnt the same as any of those other bastards in uniform i wasnt even a nazi perhaps they needed reminding of that perhaps it was time i repeated my allegiance to the old republic if they were looking for an excuse to throw me out of the sd then i would hand them one arianne was surely right if more people stood up to heydrich the way id stood up to the labour leader on the train then maybe things would change more people would be dead too including myself but that couldnt be helped lately that didnt seem so bad thats what i told myself anyway it might have been the schnapps and of course i wouldnt know for sure until the time came but i knew it was going to take some courage on my part because i was also afraid thats the only way i know that you can distinguish being brave from being stupid thats rather beautiful dont you think i was looking at a dazzling modern picture of a darkhaired femme fatale she was wearing a fabulous long dress that seemed to be made of golden argus eyes all set against a radiantly primordial golden background there was something terrifying about the woman herself she looked like some remorseless egyptian queen who had been made ready for eternity by a group of economists who were slaves to the gold standard unfortunately its a copy the original was stolen by that greedy fat bastard herman goring and is now in his private collection where nobody but him can see it mores the pity i was in the lower castle library through the window i could see the back garden where several ss and sd officers were already collected on the terrace the officer speaking to me was about thirty tall thin and rather effete he had white blond hair and a duelling scar on his face the three pips on his black collarpatch told me he was an sshauptsturmfuhrer a captain like me and the monkey swing of silver braid on his tunic properly called an aiguillette but only by people who knew their way around a dictionary of military words indicated he was an aidedecamp most likely heydrichs are you doctor ploetz i asked good god no he clicked his heels hauptsturmfuhrer albert kuttner fourth adjutant to general heydrich at your service no youll know when you meet ploetz it will feel like someone left a freezer door open cold huh ive met warmer glaciers how many adjutants does he have oh just the four a man for each season theres myself captains pomme and kluckholn and major ploetz whos the chief adjutant youll have the great pleasure of meeting them all while youre here i cant wait kuttner smiled a knowing smile as if he and i were already occupying the same forbidden radio frequency and you i assume must be captain gunther he shook his head the berlin accent its quite unmistakable by the way the general doesnt go in for the hitler salute very much while were here at the castle that suits me i dont go in for hitler salutes much myself yes the general likes to keep things very informal so mess rules apply no belts worn he nodded at my crossbelts that kind of thing thanks i said unbuckling the crossbelt i was wearing also its fine to introduce yourself with your ss rank but after that do try not to use ss ranks when describing yourself or a brother officer army ranks or surnames save time the generals very keen on saving time he often says that while we delay time does not and that lost time is never found again very true what hes always been very quotable the general you must try to write some of these sayings down for the sake of posterity kuttner shook his head it seemed he wasnt quite on my own frequency after all that wouldnt do at all the general hates people writing down what he says its an idiosyncrasy he has i smiled its evidence thats what it is kuttner smiled back yes i see what you mean very good very good i guess thats why he has four adjutants i added to help keep everything off the record yes i hadnt thought of that but you could be right i turned back to the golden picture in front of us who is she anyway her name is adele blochbauer and her husband ferdinand used to own this house a jew which makes you wonder why goring likes her so much but there it is consistency not his strong suit id say its a nice copy of course but i think it a great pity that the original isnt in the house where it truly belongs were trying to persuade the reichsmarshal to give it back but so far without much success hes like a dog with a bone when it comes to paintings i believe anyway one can easily see why he likes it so much to say that frau blochbauer looked like a million marks hardly seems to do her portrait justice wouldnt you agree i nodded and allowed myself another look not at the painting but at captain kuttner for a man who was heydrichs adjutant his free and frank opinions seemed to veer toward the dangerous a bit like my own it was clear we had more in common than just a uniform and a keen appreciation of modern art its different i allowed superficially stylish perhaps but somehow even a copy is deeper than the gold paint which seems almost to have been spilled onto the canvas eh you sound like bernard berenson captain kuttner lord dont say that at least not within earshot of the general berensons a jew what happened to her anyway i lit a cigarette to the golden lady in the picture sad to say and rather ingloriously given how she looks in this painting the poor woman died of meningitis in still that might turn out to be just as well when one considers what is happening to jews in this country and in her native austria and ferdinand her husband oh ive no idea what happened to him and i dont much care quite frankly he sounds like your typical grasping jewish merchant and he quite wisely cleared off the minute we walked into the sudetenland but i do know that the artist another austrian named gustav klimt died at the beginning of the influenza epidemic in poor fellow but he was a frequent guest here i believe adele was rather fond of old klimt by all accounts perhaps a bit too fond funny to think of them all here isnt it especially now that general heydrich owns the house o quam cito transit gloria mundi i nodded but said nothing while the eccentric young adjutant seemed to be a cut above the average sd automaton i wasnt in the mood to mention the loss of my own wife to the influenza epidemic if klimt had been an early victim my wife had been one of the very last to die of flu in december besides there was something just a bit unpredictable about captain kuttner that made me wonder how someone like heydrich could tolerate him then again the general also managed somehow to tolerate me and that spoke either of his enormous toleration which seemed improbable or his enormous cynicism kuttner tried and failed to stifle a yawn the general working you late is he sorry no actually im just not sleeping very well hardly at all if im honest he has the same effect on me ive hardly slept a wink since i received his kind invitation to prague and its not from excitement either really kuttner sounded surprised really you surprise me actually hes been very understanding of my situation very understanding he even referred me to his own doctor he gave me something called veronal which is quite effective for sleeping although you have to be careful not to mix it with alcohol then id better make sure i never take any i grinned im usually very careful never to let anything stand in the way of my drinking but what i meant was that the generals reputation goes before him hes not exactly mohandas k gandhi is he and i might sleep a little better knowing exactly why the hell im here i dont suppose you can shed any light on that can you in the same thoughtful and wellinformed way that you have illuminated this picture for me kuttner scratched the duelling scar on his cheek he seemed to do it when he was nervous which was often it was my understanding that you and the general were friends if you mean like a friend in need is a friend to be avoided then yes were friends but i guess the friends we have are probably the friends we deserve you do surprise me commissar gunther well maybe youve put your finger on it captain maybe im supposed to be the licensed jester here to make everyone else but the general feel uncomfortable knowing heydrich as i do i can easily see how that might amuse him i can assure you that what you say simply cannot be the case most of the people here this weekend are the generals most intimate friends and hes gone to considerable trouble to make sure that everyone enjoys themselves good food excellent wine fine brandies the best cigars perhaps its just you who is supposed to feel uncomfortable commissar that is always possible the general always did like what the english call a roman holiday where one man suffers for the pleasure of others kuttner was shaking his head please let me reassure you gunther i was joking just now your fears are entirely without foundation the general was most anxious that you should be comfortable he chose your quarters himself he chose everyones quarters including my own ive known the general for quite a while now off and on and i can attest to his generosity and thoughtfulness hes not at all the capricious cruel man that you seem to know really yes im sure youre right captain i nodded at the femme fatale in gold all the same i wonder if the unfortunate sugar merchants wife would agree with you it was one of those early october afternoons that made you think winter was just a word and that there was no earthly reason why the sun should ever stop shining the flowers in the lower castles welltended beds were mostly pink dahlias white asters and red marigolds providing a riot of autumn colour which was the only kind of riot that the ss was likely to tolerate the lawn was as green and smooth as a pythons eyeball crystal glasses clinked heels clicked and somewhere someone was playing a piano a soft breeze in the trees sounded like an enormous silk dress they had turned off the sprinklers but there was strawberry cup with real strawberries and delicious sekt so i managed to get nicely wet all the same about eighteen of us went in for lunch with only another four we could have tossed a coin for kickoff the white tablecloth was as stiff as a sail on a frozen schooner and there was enough silver on it for an army of conquistadores otherwise things were informal as captain kuttner had promised and i was glad we had abandoned crossbelts as the food was as spectacular as it was plentiful pea soup with real peas and bacon liver dumplings with real liver and real onions holstein schnitzel with real veal a real egg and real anchovies served with a real leipziger everything i hardly had room for the real strudel and the real cheese that followed the wines were equally impressive there was a box on the table for food coupons but no one was paying any attention to that and i figured it was just for show i looked at it and wondered about the two fridmann sisters in the apartment beneath mine back in berlin and how they were getting on with the canned food id given them but mostly i just kept on filling the hole in my face with food and wine and cigarette smoke i didnt say much there wasnt much need to say anything very much everyone paid close attention to heydrichs table talk which was the usual nazi twaddle and it was only when he started talking about the stupidity of trying to turn czechs into germans that i gave my jaws a rest and let my ears take over people of good race and good intentions they will be germanized those we cant germanize and educate to think differently from the way they think now well have to put up against the wall the rest thats potentially at least half the population of bohemia and moravia they will have to be moved out and resettled in the east where they can live out their miserable days in arctic labour camps however whenever we can we must act with fairness when all is said and done the czechs should be made to see the advantages of cooperation over opposition and when the current state of emergency has ended i will increase the local food ration and do everything in my power to hunt down blackmarket profiteers there was a lot more of this guff and i looked at the fat faces of my fellow officers to see if anyone felt the same way about it that i did but i saw only consent and agreement probably they looked at me and thought the same thing among these faces there was only one apart from heydrichs long thin witchdoctors mask that i recognized and this was the former foreign minister and exreichsprotector konstantin von neurath at almost seventy he was the oldest person at the table and easily the most deserving of respect not that his ambitious young successor heydrich accorded him much of this from time to time he would pat the old man on the hand like a pet dog and speak to him in a louder voice as if the baron were deaf although it was quite plain to anyone who had talked to him that there was nothing at all wrong with his hearing i suspected that von neurath was only present to make the new reichsprotectors triumph complete heydrich avoided conversation with me until well after we had risen from the table and were out on the terrace again with brandies and cigars or in my case coffee and cigarettes it was there that he caught my eye and having walked me down the upper castles back garden finally explained the point of my being there you remember our conversation at my office in berlin the day we defeated the french in june i remember it very well how could i forget the day when germany defeated france so thats what this is all about yes again someone is trying to kill me i shrugged any number of czechos must want you dead sir i assume that were not discussing one of them naturally has there been a recent attempt on your life you mean am i imagining this all right then are you no there was an attempt made to kill me just days ago a serious attempt when where and how at the wolfs lair hitlers own field headquarters in east prussia yes i thought that would surprise you as a matter of fact i was surprised myself it was september th i had been summoned to rastenburg to be told by hitler that he was appointing me as von neuraths successor here in bohemia well thats the when and where the how is that someone tried to poison me toxicologists in the sds laboratories are still trying to isolate the particular substance that was used however theyre inclined to believe that it may have been a proteinbased toxin called botulinum from latin botulus meaning sausage that sounds especially lethal for a german its a bacterium that often causes poisoning by growing in improperly handled meat i might have assumed it was just a simple case of food poisoning were it not for the fact that some of our ss doctors have been trying to synthesize it and other antibiotic compounds such as sulphanilamide as a means of treating wound infection but also as a compound neurotoxin or to put it another way as a poison perhaps it was a simple case of food poisoning i said have you considered that possibility ive considered it and ive rejected it you see mine was the only food that was contaminated fortunately i wasnt hungry and didnt eat instead i fed the food off my plate to major ploetzs dog which subsequently died obviously the leader could not have been the target because he is vegetarian naturally all inquiries that could be made without alarming the leader were made and all of the foreign workers at the wolfs lair were replaced as a precaution but so far nothing has been discovered that sheds any light on who was responsible for the incident and there i feel we have to leave the matter at least as far as rastenburg is concerned as i say i have no wish to alarm or embarrass the leader but here in prague i am able to take other precautions you gunther are to be one of these precautions if you agree so you want me to do what be your food taster i shrugged you should have mentioned this before lunch id have sat beside you heydrich shook his head keep a lookout for someone who might be trying to kill you is that it yes in effect i want you to be my personal bodyguard said heydrich you mean you have four adjutants and no bodyguard klein my driver is quite capable of pulling out a gun and shooting at some witless czecho as am i but i want someone around me who understands murder and murderers and who can handle himself to boot a proper detective who is trained to be suspicious the gestapo isnt known to be naive in my experience i want someone who is usefully suspicious as opposed to officious yes i see the difference and since i cant offer the position to hercule poirot naturally i thought of you hercule poirot heydrich shook his head a fictional detective created by an english lady novelist it doesnt matter youre obviously not a reader hes very popular and so is she i shook my head you know that most bodyguards are supposed to care about what happens to their employers dont you heydrich grinned this didnt happen very often and when it did his youngish beaky face looked more like a nasty schoolboys meaning youre not qualified is that it something like that i can get any number of yes men from the sd said heydrich the trouble is will they be honest with me will they tell me unpalatable truths what i need to know and can i trust them its true sir without a gun in my hand youre not an easy man to contradict you ive known for five years i know youre not himmlers man i know youre not even a nazi i know you probably hate my guts but while you almost certainly dislike me i dont believe you would actually murder me in other words i can trust you gunther trust you not to kill me and trust you to tell me those unpleasant truths that others would shrink from that seems to me to be essential for what i need from a bodyguard of course in many ways youre a fool only a fool would continue to remain in the police without joining the party only a fool would remain sentimental about the weimar republic only a fool could fail to see that the new germany cannot be resisted but i have to admit youre a clever and resourceful fool i can use that most important of all youre a damned good policeman if you become my detective youll have a room here at the lower castle your own car and an office at hradschin castle in the city from time to time youll even get to see that charming little whore you brought with you from berlin whats her name arianne isnt it that surprised me although i suppose it ought not have done there wasnt much that happened in prague that heydrich didnt know about frankly im not at all sure what she sees in you the sort of woman who goes to the jockey bar is usually looking for someone with a bit more vitamin b than you have gunther of course that particular disadvantage will be quickly remedied if you agree to take this position suddenly your status will be improved youll forgive me for saying so but this is an important job throughout our conversation heydrichs long thin pianists hands were deep in the pockets of his uniforms riding breeches and this seemed to make his horsemans bandy legs even more ushaped than normal now he pulled them out and from the pocket of his fartcatcher an sd service tunic that was covered with so many gold and silver badges it looked more like a priests reliquary he produced a small silver cigarette case and offered me one smoke thank you sir finding a match i lit us both so what do you say just how honest do you want me to be general imprudently honest unflinchingly honest or just brutally honest and whats in it for me apart from some more vitamins in my otherwise lousy diet one of those opinion reflectors on your breast pocket if i manage to keep you alive or a oneway ticket on the partisan express if i dont whenever were alone you can say what the hell you want at least on matters concerning my personal security in fact im counting on it on everything else politics government racial policy your stupid republican opinions are of no interest to me and youll have to keep your trap shut as for whats in it for you i should have thought that was obvious youll have free board and lodging of course and look around we germans live well here in bohemia better than in berlin good food good wine plenty of cigarettes and women should your tastes run to more than one woman at a time i know mine do its all to be had here in prague and if i am unlucky enough to be murdered by our own side all i ask is that you present the evidence to arthur nebe or walter schellenberg between them theyll find some way of putting it in front of martin bormann all right general but heres my price that you have to listen now to some of those stupid republican views that you mentioned the ones regarding politics and government and racial policy you said are of no interest to you ill say my piece and you listen and when ive done ill do what you ask ill be your detective heydrichs eyes narrowed i preferred his profile when you saw his profile it meant he wasnt looking at you when he looked at you it was only too easy to feel like the helpless prey of some deadly animal it was a face without expression behind which some ruthless calculation was in progress he flicked away his halfsmoked cigarette and glanced at the rolex on his wrist all right youve got five minutes but it wont do any good you know when the panzers have finished doing their work in russia what you say now will seem quite irrelevant even to you gunther even to you well make a nazi of you yet after lunch heydrich and generals frank henlein hildebrandt and von eberstein a couple of colonels and three of the adjutants convened a meeting in the castle library leaving me and some others to amuse ourselves which is probably overstating what i was likely to do i was feeling tired which was a combination of good wine and the adrenalin that was still in my blood after telling heydrich what i really thought about his aim of germanizing the czech population as well as several words on what was happening in the ukraine true to his word heydrich listened for exactly five minutes after which he walked silently back to the house leaving me feeling like a novitiate toreador who has just taunted his first bull perhaps i was still a little suicidal its the only possible explanation for what id done for a while i contemplated returning to my room and having a sleep i also contemplated returning to the imperial hotel and spending what remained of my life with arianne but i was unable to find klein or anyone who could organize me a car and mindful of the warm sunshine i went for a walk in the castle grounds instead naturally i was unnerved by how much heydrich already seemed to know about arianne but more importantly i was already regretting my candour with him which i attributed to the amount of alcohol i had consumed during lunch and i asked myself how long it would be before a couple of ss guards came and fetched me for execution at some pit that was even now being dug in the adjacent forest that was surely one advantage of living in the countryside there was always plenty of space to bury a body halfconvinced that this was to be my fate i found myself heading out of the front gates smiling a nervous smile at the stonefaced sentry and then setting off up the fairytale road in the general direction of the upper castle this wasnt exactly an escape but i needed to be away from my socalled colleagues thinking about escape i got to wondering about ferdinand blochbauer the jewish sugar merchant whose estate this had once been had the statues been placed at the gates by him or the aristocrat who had owned the house before and where was he now england america switzerland or was he one of those unfortunate czech jews whod fled to france thinking it was safe there only to find it overrun with nazis in time would tell who had been luckier ferdinand or his late wife adele further along the quiet road i came in sight of the orthodox chapel and as i rounded the bend i saw the matching pink gateway of the upper castle and walking toward me another ss officer a general whom i recognized from lunch but whose name eluded me i wasnt wearing a cap or belts and neither was he which meant i was able to forgo a salute all the same i came to attention as he got nearer id irritated enough ss generals for one day even in uniform this general was a poor example of the master race a bespectacled himmler type with thinning hair a wide mouth and a double chin he was one of those pale bloodless nazis that reminded me of a very cold fish on a very white plate nevertheless he smiled and stopped to talk rippling his fingers in the air as though he was playing the upper register of a church organ as he tried to remember who i was ah yes now youre hauptsturmfuhrer gunther sir yes now i have it youre the police commissar from berlin are you not the kripo detective thats right sir im jury doctor hugo jury no reason why you should remember me either especially after a lunch like that eh ill say one thing for our new reichsprotector he knows how to entertain thats the best lunch ive eaten in god knows how long jury was an austrian his accent or rather his vocabulary unmistakably viennese walk with me for a while if you will captain id like to hear more about the exciting life of a real berlin detective if you like sir but theres not much to tell im fortythree years old i got my school certificate but didnt go to university the war got in the way and then there didnt seem to be much call for a degree when there was a more urgent call to make a living and earn some money so i joined the police and got married to a woman who died almost immediately afterward influenza they called it but these days im not so sure a lot of different illnesses got swept into that bin by a lot of overworked doctors and by some who were maybe not so much overworked as just inexperienced or even incompetent and youd be absolutely right to have doubts i should know you see im not one of these legal doctors we seem to be overrun with these days im a medical man i took my degree in and the chances are that i was one of those overworked inexperienced and very possibly incompetent doctors you were talking about during the influenza epidemic i remember sleeping for less than four hours a night hardly a recipe for good medical care is it throughout the twenties i was a specialist in tuberculosis tbs one of those infectious diseases that present a lot of symptoms that are common to influenza indeed ive sometimes thought that what we thought was a flu virus was actually pneumonia brought on by a massive outbreak of tb but thats another story id like to hear it sometime if i may ask how old was she your wife twentytwo im sorry thats young very young and youve never remarried not so far sir most women dont seem to find my being a berlin detective as exciting as you ive been married for almost thirty years and i cant imagine what id have done without my wife karoline youll forgive me for saying so sir but i cant imagine youre an ss general because youre a doctor sir no im the district leader of moravia and head of the party liaison office in prague before the war i was deputy leader of the nazi party in austria and if all of that sounds important well it isnt not any longer not since general heydrich took over i had hoped to persuade the leader to break up the protectorate in order that moravia could become a separate state which is really what its always been but that isnt going to happen or so ive been told i had also hoped to be able to discuss the matter with heydrich but one of his minions told me that this wouldnt be possible which leaves me rather wondering why i bothered to come along on this little weekend in the circumstances im surprised that i was asked at all that makes two of us sir general heydrich and i were never what you might call close then again one hesitates to decline such an invitation quite so by now we were about halfway back down the road to the lower castle and during our stroll no traffic had passed us not even a man on a bicycle or a horse somewhere in the distance shots were being fired presumably one of heydrichs guests was trying to bag something for the pot there were certainly plenty of pheasants about up ahead we saw captain kuttner standing in the lower castle gateway and seeing us he threw down his cigarette and ran toward us he was light on his toes but there was also something vaguely girlish about the elbowsout way he ran i loathe this little bastard murmured doctor jury this is the cunt who told me i wasnt going to be able to have any time with general heydrich jury let out a sigh just look at him little fucker hmm like all of the generals henchmen hes a bit of a golem except that hes a german of course the original golem of prague was jewish yes i know like his master doctor jury smiled rabbi loew that is not general heydrich kuttner clicked his heels and bowed a curt little bow general he said captain i regret i forgot to inform you both that for security reasons if you leave the grounds of the lower castle you will need a password to get back in and that is asked doctor jury lohengrin very appropriate sir the new king has assembled all of the german tribes in order to expel the hungarians from his dominions said doctor jury thats the plot of wagners opera or at least thats how it begins oh i didnt know unlike you sir i dont go to the opera very often in fact hardly at all hmm waste of a life sir you seem to be as ignorant as you are stupid said jury then he smiled at me bowed slightly and said nice talking to you captain gunther he walked quickly down toward the sentry box and then having uttered the password passed through the gate leaving me alone with captain kuttner bastard said kuttner did you hear what he said how unbelievably rude i wouldnt let it bother you captain i dont much like opera either especially wagner theres something about wagner thats just too pissgerman too fucking bavarian for a prussian like me i like my music to be every bit as vulgar as i am myself i like a bit of innuendo and stocking top when a womans singing a song kuttner smiled thanks he said but the real reason why doctor jury likes opera so much is every bit as vulgar as you describe rumour has it that hes been having an affair with a young singer at the deutsches oper in berlin rather an attractive creature by the name of elisabeth schwarzkopf and that would be vulgar enough were it not for the fact that shes also singing a duet with doctor goebbels at least thats what general heydrich says then it must be true yes thats what i thought general heydrich always knows our dirtiest little secrets oh god i hope not well he certainly knows mine i said you see after lunch we went for a short walk in the castle grounds and i made the mistake of reminding him exactly what they are just in case hed forgotten i hardly think that can be true not if hes appointed you as his new bodyguard kuttner lit a cigarette is it true that youre going to be his detective i had thought i might have been arrested by now so it would seem so congratulations im not so sure about that youre right it wont be easy but hes fair you know and a good man to have on your side i dont know what would have happened to my ss career if he hadnt taken me on by the way hows your stomach for flying not good what a pity the general insists on flying himself to berlin and rastenburg frankly im always terrified he thinks hes a much better pilot than he really is hes had several crashes thats a comforting thought i shrugged perhaps well get lucky and end up in scotland like hess yes quite kuttner laughed still i hate to think what would happen if we ever flew into some real trouble as a matter of fact thats what i was doing just now looking for trouble i thought id get out of the house and scout the area kuttner winced noticeably the lie of the land so to speak he said yes generally trouble sort of comes looking for me so i dont have to venture too far ive always been lucky that way quite a few of us in the ss have been lucky that way dont you think kuttner sighed a faint sigh of regret with trouble frankly ive had a bit of a rough summer youve been east too huh kuttner nodded how did you know i shrugged i look at you and maybe i see something of myself yes that must be it where were you posted riga i was in minsk how was that loathsome and riga the same and really quite unnecessary a lot of it you go to war you expect to kill people i was almost looking forward to it to being in action when one is young one has such romantic ideas of what war is like but it was nothing like that of course no it never is kuttner tried to smile but the part he needed inside himself to make the smile work properly was broken he knew it and i knew it its an odd state of affairs dont you think when a man feels guilty for doing his duty and obeying orders he took a sharp drag of the cigarette he was smoking as if he hoped it might suddenly kill him not that guilt even begins to cover the way i feel believe me captain i know exactly how you feel do you yes i can see that you do its in your eyes and thats the reason youre not sleeping can you kuttner shook his head i dont think ill ever sleep properly again not ever not in this life talk about it now if it makes you feel any better does it make you feel any better to talk about it not much i talked about it once quite recently to an american journalist and i felt a little better about it i felt that it was at least a start kuttner nodded and then dredged up something from his memory i didnt have to wait long when you mentioned scouting the area it made me think of something something awful we were on our way through poland this was before our assignment in riga we had stopped at a town called chechlo its a brokendown shitonyourshoes nowhere sort of place with a lot of drooling peasants whose tongues are too big for their mouths but i dont suppose i shall ever forget it now not for as long as i live we had been burning down polack villages for no real reason that i could see certainly there was no military necessity in it we were just throwing our weight around like brutes some of my men were drunk and nearly all of them were animals anyway we came across a troop of polish boy scouts the oldest of them couldnt have been more than sixteen and the youngest perhaps as young as twelve and my commanding officer ordered me to put all of them up against a wall and shoot them shoot them all they were in uniform he said and we have orders to shoot anyone in uniform who hasnt surrendered i said they were just schoolboys who didnt know any better because they didnt speak german but he didnt want to know orders are orders he said get on with it i remember their mothers screaming at me to stop yes ill always remember that i wake up sometimes still hearing them beg me to stop but i didnt i had my orders so i carried them out you see and thats all there is to it except it isnt of course not by a long way after several stiff drinks i can talk to anyone even to myself but mostly i was drinking so that i could talk to heydrichs other guests i like to talk talking is something you need to do if youre ever going to encourage a man to talk back at you and you need a man to talk a little if hes ever going to say something of interest men dont trust other men who dont say much and for the same reason they dont trust men who dont drink you need a drink to say the wrong thing and sometimes saying the wrong thing can be exactly the right thing to say i dont know if i was expecting to hear anything as romantic as a confession to an attempted murder or even a desire to see heydrich dead after all i felt that way about him myself it was just talk a little bread on the water to bring the fish around and the alcohol helped it helped me to talk and to anaesthetize myself against the more revolting chat that came my way but some of my colleagues were just revolting as i glanced around the library it was like looking at a menagerie of unpleasant animals rats jackals vultures hyenas who had sat for some bizarre group portrait its hard to say exactly who was the worst of the bunch but i didnt speak to lieutenant colonel walter jacobi for very long before i was itching all over and counting my fingers the deputy head of the sd in prague was a deeply sinister figure with he told me an interest in magic and the occult it was a subject i knew a little about having investigated a case involving a fake medium a few years back we talked about that and we talked about munich which was where he was from we talked about him studying law at the universities of jena tubingen and halle which seemed like a lot of law and we even talked about his father who was a bookseller but all the time we were talking i was trying to get over the fact that with his charlie chaplin moustache his wireframed glasses and his prayingmantis personality jacobi reminded me obscenely of what might have resulted if hitler and himmler had been left alone in the same bedroom jacobi was a hitlerhimmler hybrid equally unpleasant to talk to was hermann frank the tall thin ss general from the sudetenland whod been passed over to succeed von neurath as the new reichsprotector frank had a glass eye having lost the real one in a fight at school in carlsbad which seemed to indicate an early propensity to violence it was the right eye that was fake i think but with frank you had the idea he might have changed it around just to keep you guessing frank had a low opinion of czechs although as things turned out they had an even lower opinion of him five thousand people filled the courtyard of pankrac prison in the centre of prague to see him hanged the old austrian empire way one summers day in theyre a greedy barbarous people he told me candidly i dont feel in the least bit czech the best thing that ever happened to me was to be born in the germanspeaking part of the country otherwise id be speaking their filthy slavic language now which is nothing more than a bastardized form of russian its a language for animals i tell you do you know that its possible to speak a whole sentence in czech without using a single vowel surprised at this startling display of hatred i blinked and said oh like what for example frank thought for a moment and then repeated some words in czech which might or might not have had some vowels only i didnt feel like looking inside his mouth to see if he was hiding any it means stick a finger through your throat he said and every time i hear a czech speak thats exactly what i want to do to them all right you hate them i get the picture and losing your eye at school like that must have been pretty tough it explains a lot i guess i went to a pretty tough school myself and there are some boys i might like to get even with one day then again probably not lifes too short to care i think and now youre in such an important position sir the police leader in bohemia effectively the second most powerful man in the country well thats the part i dont understand at all sir why do you hate the czechs so much general frank straightened absurdly it was almost as if he was coming to attention before answering an effect enhanced by the fact that he was wearing spurs on his boots which seemed an odd affectation to me even in heydrichs country home which had stables with horses in them pompously he said as germans its our duty to hate them it was the failure of the czech banks that helped to precipitate the financial crisis that brought about the great depression yes its the czech bankers we can thank for that disaster resisting my first instinct which was to shiver with disgust as if frank had vomited onto my boots i nodded politely i always thought that was because our economy was built on american loans i said and when they came due our own german banks failed frank was shaking his head which was full of grey hair combed straight back so that the top of his head seemed to be in a line with the tip of his longish nose it wasnt the biggest nose in the room so long as heydrich was around but at the same time you wouldnt have been surprised to see it pointing out the way at a crossroads take it from me gunther he said i do know what im talking about i know this damnable country better than anyone in the fucking room frank spoke with some vigour and he was looking at heydrich as he did which made me wonder if there was not some grudge he nursed for his new master i was glad when frank walked away to fetch himself another drink leaving me with the impression that spending an eternity with men like heydrich jacobi and frank was the nearest thing to being in hell that i could think of but the knights cross with oak leaves and berries for that matter the whole damned tree for the curling turd of the evening went to colonel doctor hans geschke a yearold lawyer from frankfurt on the oder who was chief of the gestapo in prague while studying in berlin hed seen my name in the newspapers and in spite of our differences in rank this was a good enough reason for him to try to make common cause with me which is another way of saying he needed someone to patronize after all he explained were both policemen you and i doing a difficult job in very difficult circumstances so it would seem sir and i like to keep abreast of ordinary crime he said here in prague we have to deal with more serious stuff than some fritz slicing his wife up with a broken beer bottle theres not so much of that around sir beer bottles are in rather short supply in berlin he wasnt listening you should come in and see us very soon at the pecek palace thats in the bredovska district of the city a palace eh it sounds a lot grander than the alex sir oh no to be quite honest with you its hard to see how it was ever a palace except in some dark corner of hades even the executive rooms have very little charm geschkes was a waxworks expressionless face captain kuttner had said that at the pecek palace geschke was known as babyface but this could only have been among people who knew some very frightening babies with duelling scars on their left cheeks geschke was one of those factorymanufactured nazis they turned out like unpainted meissen porcelain pale cold hard and best handled with extreme care i havent seen much of the city yet i said but it does seem rather infernal geschke grinned well we do our best in that respect so long as they fear us they do what theyre told we mustnt let these czechos make fools of us you see we have to be the master in our own house so we cant afford to overlook any wrong we really cant you let them get away with one thing there will be no end to it but tell me gunther in the weimar republic when you had a suspect at the alex and he refused to cooperate what did you do how on earth did you manage we never hit anyone if thats what youre driving at sir we werent allowed to the prussian police regulations forbade it oh some cops smacked a suspect around now and then but the bosses didnt like that we got results because we got the evidence once you have the evidence its hard for a man not to sign a confession find the evidence and everything else follows we were good at that finding evidence the berlin detective service was for a while the envy of the world and its backbone was the police commissars but werent you at all frustrated by the stupidities of prussian justice sometimes it seemed to be absurd that penal servitude for life rarely ever lasted longer than twelve years and that so many criminals deserving of their death sentences were reprieved by the prussian government for example those two jews saffran and kipnik remember them i shrugged honestly i can think of many others id like to see under the falling axe before those two why just a few months ago there was the sbahn murderer case fellow named paul ogorzow who killed six or seven women and tried to kill as many more again now he deserved his fate is it true that he was a party member yes unbelievable lots of other people thought so too thats probably why it took so long to catch him but what you were saying is absolutely right we cant afford to overlook any wrong especially when its a wrong committed by our own dont you think ah now there speaks a true policeman i like to think so sir well if theres anything i can do to help you gunther in your new capacity as the generals personal detective then please let me know geschke raised his glass and bowed anything to help general heydrich and keep him safe for the new germany thank you sir i glanced around the room and tried to picture which if any of the generals guests might actually try to poison him and found that in the new germany it wasnt so hard in a room full of murderers anything seemed possible about halfway through this unforgettable evening major dr ploetz heydrichs first adjutant and number one myrmidon turned on the library radio so that we could listen to hitlers speech from the sports palast in berlin gentlemen please he said while the radio was warming up if i could ask you to be silent thank you hansachim said heydrich as if he and not the leader had been at the microphone and then solemnly as the sound of the sports palast crept into that room he intoned the leader it was typically thoughtful of heydrich i suppose he thought it would be a treat for those of us who were feeling a little homesick and it was a bit like hearing my mother reading the old story of how the bad boy friedrich terrorized a lot of animals and people it remained to be seen if the third reichs ranting answer to bad friedrich might yet be bitten by the same dog that had eaten the naughty boys sausages but for me at any rate there was always the hope that he would be it was hard to think of a treat half as enjoyable as the idea of the leader being bitten by a greedy dog his own perhaps in the corridor outside the library a man was on the telephone and i poked my head out of the door to see who among heydrichs guests had dared to make or take a call in the middle of hitlers speech whoever he was i certainly didnt blame him even at the best of times the leader was always too loud for me probably hed honed his oratorical skills in the trenches during bombardments not that you couldnt have heard every rasping word of the broadcast in the corridor the radio was an aeg super orchestra as big as a polish peasants barn and with the speech playing at full volume there was no chance of not hearing it almost anywhere in the house probably you could have heard the speech at the centre of the earth no you did the right thing in calling me here sergeant soppa the man speaking was oscar fleischer head of the gestapos resistance section in prague the same man who had been taunted so infamously by one of the three kings all right ill be there in half an hour just dont let the bastard die until i get there he did so it was him after all fleischer caught my eye and turned his back on me no no im perfectly certain hell want to know yes of course ill tell him ill do it right now yes goodbye fleischer replaced the telephone and grinning excitedly scribbled something on a piece of paper before handing it to captain pomme and then running upstairs two steps at a time i lit a cigarette and drifted out into the corridor next to captain pomme good news i asked i should say so said the adjutant and went back into the library without further eludication i was about to follow when i glanced out the window above the telephone and had a good view of heydrichs other adjutants kuttner and kluckholn standing under the flagpole on the front lawn although the window was open i couldnt hear what was said not with the radio in the library so loud but it was plain that a heated argument was in progress indeed that the two men were on the edge of exchanging blows i was about to go outside and play saturday night policeman when kuttner strode angrily up the drive toward the gatehouse a moment later fleischer wearing belts and his cap galloped downstairs again and went straight out the front door as a car drew up and then took him away in a furious spray of gravel a little disappointed that i was not going to break up a fight between two ss officers i turned my attention back to what was being broadcast in the library hitlers speech was the traditional opening of the winter relief campaign this was the nazi partys annual charitable drive to provide food and shelter for the less fortunate during the coming winter months and was as near as it ever got to real socialism failure to donate was not an option people who forgot to donate were quite likely to find their names in the local newspaper or sometimes worse hitlers oratorical style for the winter relief speech was calculated to impress rather more than the actual content and usually it wasnt so much what he said as the way he said it but my normal reaction was that it was a little like listening to emil jannings recite a bit of cudgel verse caruso singing a song from a silly symphony or mark antony eulogizing a dead cat this year it was different however as it soon became clear that there was more at stake than a few fat germans going hungry in january as well as the more predictable bromides about the glory of giving and being generous something that was second nature to us germans of course the leader proceeded to make an announcement concerning the beginning of the great decisive battle of the coming year which would be devastating to the enemy now many of us in that library and in the country at large were already under the impression that the great decisive battle was already as good as won we had certainly been told as much by doctor goebbels on several previous occasions but here was hitler more or less admitting that hed bet the family silver on what was yet to happen that hed gambled all of our futures on something that was not a castiron certainty and the upshot was that anyone listening to him now was left inescapably with the distinct idea that things in the east were not going entirely to plan for our hitherto invincible armed forces when the speech and the thunderous applause that greeted it in the sports palast had finally concluded and the aeg radio was at last turned off by major dr ploetz it was immediately apparent that there were several others in that library who had the same thought as me someone in the government hitler himself perhaps had woken up to the painful reality of just what germany had undertaken to do in russia and this being the third reich of course which was based on lies it meant that things were probably much worse than we had been told our sombre faces told the same grim story indeed general von eberstein who was some big noise in the ss general staff may actually have muttered some desperate imprecation to a god who was certainly some place else if anywhere at all general hildebrandt who was heydrichs equivalent rank in danzig merely hurled his cigarette into the fireplace as if he was as disgusted with it as he was with everything else this might have been what prompted heydrich to say a few words to resurrect our visible lack of enthusiasm more likely it was fleischers handwritten note that captain pomme had handed him a few minutes earlier heydrich himself was grinning like hed just eaten the last slice of honeycake gentlemen he said if i could have your attention for just a few more minutes ive been given a note by criminal commissar fleischer of the gestapo which contains some excellent news as most of you know since may of this year weve had two of the three kings josef balaban and josef masin in custody at pankrac prison here in prague these are of course two of the three leaders of czech terrorism here in bohemia however the third king melchior as we like to call him has eluded us until now it seems that one of our two prisoners i dont know which but somehow i feel sure that his name must be josef has agreed to cooperate with our inquiries and finally has revealed that melchiors real name is vaclav moravek formerly a captain in the czech army we have already begun a search for him here in prague and at his home town of kolin near losany and it is now expected that we shall shortly make an arrest i felt oddly sick it seemed that while wed been stuffing ourselves with veal holstein and leipziger everything a brave man had been tortured into revealing the name of the most wanted man in the third reich bravo said one of my brother officers an abwehr major named thummel others also present applauded this news which seemed to please heydrich no end and there he might and perhaps should have left the matter but full of his own importance heydrich continued to talk for several more minutes he was not however a public speaker selfconscious and calculating he lacked hitlers common touch and rhetorical flourish his voice was pitched too high to inspire men worst of all he used a string of big german words where one or two smaller ones would have worked better of course this was typical of the nazis for whom language was often used to mask their own ignorance and stupidity which they possessed in an inexhaustible supply as well as to give their words the placebo effect of authority like a doctor who has an impressive latin name for what is wrong with you but sadly not a cure fortunately for everyone present captain kuttner and kritzinger the butler appeared with champagne and a tray of bohemian glass flutes and before long there was something of a party atmosphere in that library i drank a glass without much pleasure and when i thought i was unobserved i slipped away onto the terrace and smoked a cigarette in the darkness it felt like somewhere i belonged a crepuscular world of creatures that hooted and howled and where one might hide to avoid larger predators after a while i glanced through the leaded library window and seeing no sign of heydrich i decided i might sneak off to bed but i had not reckoned on heydrichs study being immediately at the top of the first flight of stairs the doors were open and he was seated behind his desk signing some papers under the cold bespectacled eye of colonel jacobi insouciantly i headed toward the north wing corridor and my room but if i had hoped not to catch the generals eye i was quickly disappointed gunther he said hardly looking up from his signature file come in very well sir entering heydrichs study in the lower castle at jungfernbreschan i had the distinct feeling that i was in a smaller more intimate version of the leaders own study at the reich chancellery and this would have been typical of heydrich not that there was very much that was small or intimate about that room the ceiling was about four metres high and there were marble relief columns on the walls a fireplace as big as a mercedes and enough green carpet on the floor for a decent game of golf the refectorystyle desk had more glass protecting its smooth oak surface than a goodsized shop window on this were a marbleurn lamp a couple of telephones a leather blotter an inkstand and a brass model of a plane quite possibly the same siebel fh he used to fly himself to and from berlin in the arched window was a bronze bust of the leader and behind a thronesized desk chair was a green silk wallhanging with a gold german eagle holding onto a laurel wreath enclosing a swastika as if it was something worth stealing heydrich put down his fountain pen and leaned back in the chair that girl back at your hotel he said arianne tauber have you called her to tell her you wont be coming to see her tonight not yet sir then dont have klein drive you into prague i think i will be safe enough tonight dont you if you say so sir oh no in future its for you to say so that was rather the point of your appointment but im sure youll get the hang of it meet me at pecek palace tomorrow morning at ten o clock i have a meeting there to coordinate the arrest of this moravek fellow very well sir and thank you i may even have clicked my heels and bowed my head working for heydrich was like being friendly with a vicious tom cat while you were looking around for the nearest mouse hole chapter arianne was pleased to see me of course although not as pleased as i was to see her in our bed alone naked and willing to use her body to help divert my thoughts from heydrich jungfernbreschan the three kings and pecek palace i told her nothing of my worries where heydrich was concerned it was best to know very little as i was beginning to discover myself what did i tell her as exhausted by our lovemaking we lay intertwined like two primitive figures carved from the same piece of antlerhorn only that my duties kept me out of prague in jungfernbreschan otherwise i should certainly have visited her at the imperial hotel before now thats all right she said really im quite happy here on my own youve no idea how nice it is just to sit and read a book or to walk around the city by myself i do i muttered i can imagine anyway i left a message for my brother and there are plenty of other germans in prague i can talk to as a matter of fact this hotel is full of germans theres a very beautiful girl in a suite on the same floor as us whos having an affair with some ss general and shes a jew doesnt that sound romantic romantic it sounds dangerous arianne shrugged that off her name is betty kipsdorf and shes utterly sweet whats his name the general konrad something hes more than twice her age but she says you really wouldnt know it she laughed on account of the fact that he used to be a gymnastics teacher i said i didnt know who that could be and i didnt i wasnt exactly on firstname terms with any ss generals even the ones i knew hes very vigorous apparently for a general me i always say that if you want a job done and done properly its a captain you want not some effete flamingo with clockwork heels flamingos were what the ranks called officers of the general staff a reference to the red stripes on their trouser legs what do you know about flamingos youd be surprised who we get through the doors of the jockey bar no but im still surprised that youd prefer a captain to one of them and perhaps a little suspicious thats probably no fault of yours wed get on like a house on fire if you werent a cop dont you think so parsifal these are the times we live in im afraid all sorts of things make me suspicious angel two aces in a row doublesixes a sure thing for the state lottery a kind word or a compliment venus rising from the sea im the kind of fritz whos apt to look for a makers mark on the scallop shell i might get insulted if i knew what any of that was about after all theres a little part of you thats still in me now its my turn to get insulted dont be gunther i enjoyed it a lot i think that maybe you underestimate yourself perhaps i might even call it an occupational hazard except that so far its helped to keep me alive is staying alive so very important to you no then again ive seen the alternatives and at close quarters in russia or twenty years ago back in the trenches she gave me a little squeeze the kind that feels like a wonderful sort of conjuring trick and that doesnt need any limbs whenever a woman holds me tight like that its the best argument there is against the solipsistic idea that one can be truly certain only of the existence of ones own mind how much more suspicious would you get if i said id fallen for you gunther youd have to say it a lot for me to believe it might be true maybe i will yeah maybe when youve said it the first time we can review the situation but right now its just a hypothetical all right i she paused for a moment uttering a sigh that was as unsteady as a whippets hind leg as i nudged up deep against the edge of her latest thought go on im listening its true parsifal im falling for you youre a long time in the air angel by now anyone else would have hit the ground i nudged into her again hard damn you gunther her breath was hot in my ear except it sounded cold and erratic like someone laughing silently i prompted her a little more and said go on lets hear what it sounds like all right i love you satisfied not by a long way but i will be if this keeps up she hit me on the shoulder but there was pleasure on her face you sadistic bastard im a nazi you said so yourself remember no but youre also rather wonderful gunther all the more so because you dont realize it since karl my husband there have been other men but youre the first man ive cared anything about since he died stop talking go ahead and make me i didnt say anything conversation between us had become unnecessary we didnt need speech to act out a story that many others had told before it wasnt original but it felt like it was an almost silent film that seemed both familiar and new we were still performing our own highly stylized homage to german expressionism when the telephone rang on the bedside table leave it i said is that wise it sounds like trouble it stopped ringing when our own motion picture finished she got up to fetch one of my cigarettes i rolled onto my back and stared out of the window at the little pepperpot dome on top of the building opposite the telephone started to ring again i told you i said it always rings again when its trouble especially first thing in the morning before breakfast i picked up the receiver it was major ploetz heydrichs first adjutant he sounded shaken and angry a car is coming to pick you up and bring you back here immediately all right whats up theres been a homicide said ploetz here at the lower castle a homicide what kind of homicide i dont know but you should be outside your hotel in fifteen minutes and then he hung up for one glorious moment i allowed myself to hope it was heydrich who was dead that one of those officers and gentlemen of the ss and the sd jealous of heydrichs success had shot him or perhaps there had been a machinegun attack by czech terrorists while heydrich was out for his early morning ride in the countryside around jungfernbreschan perhaps even now there was a horse lying on top of his lifeless body and yet surely if it had been heydrich who was dead ploetz would have said so ploetz wouldnt ever have used the phrase a homicide for someone as important as his very own general the victim had to be someone of lesser importance or else ploetz would have said heydrich has been murdered or the general has been murdered or theres been a catastrophe general heydrich has been assassinated a homicide didnt begin to cover the lexicon of words that would probably be used by the nazis if ever heydrich was unfortunate enough to meet with a welldeserved but premature death is it is it what i answered her absently trouble said arianne i have to go back to jungfernbreschan immediately theres been a death oh who i dont know but im sure its not heydrich some detective you are she shrugged well it certainly wont be the gardener whos dead if they want you to go back immediately it must be someone important i can dream i suppose fifteen minutes later i was washed and dressed and standing outside the imperial hotel as a black sedan drew up the driver wearing an ss uniform it wasnt klein stepped smartly out of the car saluted opened the door and pulled down the middle row of seats because there were two men wearing plain clothes who were already seated in the back they were wellfed hefty types probably the kind who couldnt run very fast but who could hand out a beating without breaking the skin on their knuckles commissar gunther the man who spoke had a head as big as a stonemasons bucket but the face carved on the front of it was small like a childs the eyes were cold and hard even a little sad but the mouth was a vicious tear thats right a grappling iron of a hand came across the back of the seat kurt kahlo said the man criminal assistant to inspector willy abendschoen from prague kripo he looked at the other man and grinned unkindly and this is inspector zennaty of the czech police hes only along for the sake of appearances arent you sir after all technically speaking this is a czech matter isnt it zennaty shook my hand but he didnt say anything he was thin and hawklike with shadowy eyes and a hair style that looked like an extension of a short stubbly beard im afraid our czecho friend doesnt speak much german do you ivan not very much said zennaty sorry but hes all right is our ivan kahlo patted zennaty on the back of the hand arent you ivan very much mister abendschoen would have attended himself said kahlo but almost everyone in prague is now looking for this moravek fellow general heydrich has made his apprehension the number one police priority in the whole of the protectorate i nodded so whos dead they didnt say one of general heydrichs adjutants a captain named kuttner albert kuttner did you know him at all sir i met him for the first time yesterday i said how about you i only met him a couple of times to me one adjutant looks like another adjutant id expect this one might look a bit different now dont you good point kahlos eyebrows were almost permanently at an angle like a sad clowns but somehow he managed to raise them even higher up his forehead how about you i asked zennaty politely did you know captain kuttner not very much said zennaty kahlo grinned at this which helped persuade zennaty to stare out of the window it was a kinder view than kahlos sneering ugly mug we drove east for a while to kripo headquarters in carl maria von weber strasse where zennaty briefly left the car and kahlo informed me he had gone to fetch an evidence box he and zennaty had been across the river at the justice ministry when abendschoen kahlos boss had telephoned telling him to pick me up and then go to jungfernbreschan after a few minutes zennaty returned and we drove north again to see prague in the autumn of was to see a crown of thorns with extra points as painted by lukas cranach a city of church spires it certainly was even the spires had smaller spires of their own the way little carrots sometimes grow bigger ones these lent the unfeasibly tall bohemian capital an unexpectedly sharp jagged feel everywhere you looked it was like seeing a swiss halberd in an umbrella stand this sense of medieval discomfort was accentuated by the citys omnipresent statuary all over prague there were statues of jesuit bishops spearing pagans heavily muscled titans stabbing each other with swords agonized christian saints horribly martyred or ferocious wild animals tearing each other to pieces to that extent prague appeared to suit the cruelty and violence of nazism in a way berlin never did the nazis seemed to belong here especially the tall spindly figure of heydrich whose austere pale face reminded me of a flayedalive saint the red nazi flags that were everywhere looked more like blood dripping down the buildings that they hung on the polished bayonets on german rifles at sentry points across the city glittered with an extra steely edge and goosestepping jackboots on the cobbles of the charles bridge seemed to have a louder crunch as if beating down the hopes of the czechs themselves that was shameful if you were a german but worse if you were a czech like the impotent inspector zennaty worst of all if you were one of pragues jews prague was home to one of the largest communities of jews in europe and even now there were still plenty of them left for the nazis to kick around kick them around they duly did and it remained to be seen if the legendary golem that was reputed to dwell in the citys old new synagogue would as legend supposed emerge from the attic one night and climb down the outside wall to avenge the persecution of pragues jews part of me hoped that he had already put in an appearance at jungfernbreschan and that captain kuttners unexplained death was just the beginning if things were anything like the silent movie called the golem id seen not long after the great war then we germans were in for some fun twenty minutes later the car stopped outside the front door of the lower castle and we went inside kritzinger the butler ushered kahlo zennaty and me upstairs to heydrichs study where he was waiting impatiently with major ploetz and captain pomme heydrich and pomme were wearing fencing jerkins and it was clear from their flushed and stillperspiring faces that they had not long finished their absurd sport since i was the only one wearing uniform i saluted and then introduced kahlo and zennaty heydrich looked coldly at zennaty you can wait downstairs he told the czech policeman zennaty nodded curtly and left the room you took your time getting here said heydrich sourly the remark appeared to be directed at me so i glanced at my watch and said i received the call from major ploetz in my hotel just fortyfive minutes ago i came as quickly as i could sir all right all right heydrichs tone was testy there was a cigarette in his hand his hair looked dishevelled and uncombed well youre here now thats the main thing youre here and youre in charge dyou hear youre the experienced man in this situation incidentally i dont want that fucking czech involved at all dyou hear this is a german matter i want this thing investigated quickly and discreetly and solved before it can reach the ears of the leader ive every confidence in you gunther if any man can solve this case its you ive told everyone that you enjoy my complete confidence thank you sir i said although this wasnt at all how i felt or indeed what he meant i wasnt about to enjoy heydrichs confidence for any longer than he took to say it and that i expect everyone to cooperate fully with your inquiry i dont care what you ask and who you upset dyou hear as far as im concerned everyone in this house is under suspicion does that include you sir heydrichs blue eyes narrowed and for a moment i thought id gone too far and that he was going to bawl me out i was relieved he wasnt holding a sword i had gone too far of course and it was clear the two adjutants thought so too but just for now neither man was prepared to protest my insolence unpredictable as always heydrich took a deep breath and nodded slowly i dont see why not he said if it helps anything that will get this sorted out as quickly as possible before my tenure in this position descends into farce and i become a fucking laughing stock in berlin he shook his head and then stubbed out his cigarette irritably that this should happen now when were just about to put paid to uvod uvod i shook my head whats that uvod its the central leadership of home resistance said heydrich a network of czech terrorists he leaned down on the desk with both fists and then hammered the glass surface hard enough for the model plane to shift several centimetres nearer the lamp damn it all i lit a cigarette and drew down a lungful of smoke and blew it back at him hard hoping it might help to distract him a little from what i was about to say and the way i meant to say it why dont you take it easy general this isnt helping me and its certainly not helping you instead of beating up the furniture and biting my head off why dont you or whoever else has the best grip on the story tell me exactly what happened here the whole onceuponatime in a town called hamelin and then i can do what i do heydrich looked at me and i sensed he knew i was taking advantage of him everyone else was looking at me too as if surprised that i should dare to speak to the general in this way but just as surprised that he should continue to hold off shouting me back into my shell i was a bit surprised about that myself but sometimes it can be interesting just how wide the door can open for a moment he bit his fingernails yes youre absolutely right gunther this isnt getting us anywhere i suppose well its a great shame thats all kuttner was a promising young officer yes he was said pomme heydrich looked at him strangely and then said why dont you fill in some of the details for the commissar yes sir if you wish mind if i sit down i said like any copper i listen better when im not thinking about my feet yes please gentlemen be seated said heydrich i picked a chair in front of the leaders bust and almost immediately regretted it i didnt care for hitler staring at the back of my head if ever he learned about what was at the back of my mind i was in serious trouble i reached into my fartcatchers pocket and took out my officers diary it was more or less the same kind of diary the gestapo had found on franz kocis dead body in kleist park if you dont mind i said to pomme ill make some notes pomme shook his head why should i mind i shrugged no good reason i paused whenever youre ready captain pomme well albert thats to say captain kuttner was supposed to awaken me at six oclock this morning as usual he awakens me or major ploetz or captain kluckholn because its our job to awaken the general at sixthirty i suppose thats just the pecking order him being the fourth adjutant you understand however this was no longer a satisfactory arrangement kuttner was never a good sleeper and lately hes been dosing himself with a sleeping pill which meant he started to oversleep in the morning this made me late and that made the general late this morning was fairly typical in that respect and anticipating some sort of a problem i managed to awaken myself at six and then went to see if kuttner was awake he wasnt or so it seemed at the time i knocked on the door several times without success again that wasnt so very unusual when hes taken a pill it can be a while before he can be roused but after ten minutes i was still knocking without a reply and well i suppose i began to worry a little couldnt you just have gone in there and shaken him awake i asked im sorry gunther i didnt make myself clear he always locked his door he was quite a nervous person i think something to do with what happened to him in latvia he said i dont know anyway the door was locked and when i bent down to take a look through the keyhole i saw that the key was still in the lock pomme was a handsome little martinet not much more than thirty years old lugubrious with a wide but narrowlipped mouth in his white fencing jerkin he resembled a nervous dentist having failed to awaken kuttner i quickly awoke the general and then went to find herr kritzinger to see if there was perhaps some other means of gaining entry to kuttners room what time was this i asked it would have been about sixfortyfive said pomme he glanced at the butler who was the only man in the room who remained standing for verification the butler looked at me that is correct sir he said i went to find the spare key i keep spare keys for all of the doors in my safe i noticed the time on the clock on my mantelpiece when i was opening the safe i went back upstairs with the room keys but i was unsuccessful in using the spare to push the key out of the lock so that i could open captain kuttners door from the outside i considered telling him about the keyturners wed used at the adlon hotel for just such a situation but it hardly seemed relevant now i then instructed one of the footmen to go and find the gardener said kritzinger and have him fetch a ladder to take a look through the window and perhaps open it from outside the house meanwhile i resumed knocking on the door explained pomme and calling captain kuttners name and by now i was late for my fencing bout with the general heydrich nodded every morning i fence with one of the adjutants before breakfast kuttner was the best he was outstanding with the sabre but of late he had too much on his mind to be competitive this morning when i arrived at the gymnasium there was no sign of pomme so i went to look for him and met the footman whod been sent to fetch the gardener when i asked him if hed seen captain pomme he explained the situation that would have been around sixfiftyfive so i went to see if i could assist and found pomme still knocking on kuttners door it was now seven oclock i suppose i also became a little concerned for kuttners safety the fact is hed been rather depressed of late and i ordered pomme and kritzinger to break down the door which they proceeded to do that cant have been very easy i said the doors here are thick instinctively pomme rubbed his shoulder it wasnt it took us all of five or ten minutes and when the door was open what did you see very little said pomme the curtains were drawn and the room was quite dark was the window closed or open closed sir said kritzinger the general ordered me to pull back the curtains so that we could see and i noticed then that the window was closed and bolted then i called kuttners name said heydrich and hearing no reply i approached the bed it was immediately clear to us all from his position that something was very wrong he was still wearing his uniform and his sleep seemed abnormally sound to me what with the sound of the door coming down and our voices it didnt seem right that he shouldnt even stir so i pressed my fingers on the side of his neck to look for a pulse and i noticed straight away that his skin was cold to the touch colder than it ought to have been and then i noticed that there was no pulse no pulse at all have you been trained to take a pulse like that i asked heydrich frowned why do you ask its a straightforward question sir youd be amazed how many dead men turn up fit and well after someone has taken their pulse and pronounced them dead very well yes i have during my luftwaffe training at the werneuchen aerodrome in i received basic training in first aid and again in may that was in stavanger he shook his head theres no question about it gunther the man was quite dead that would have been at approximately ten minutes past seven kritzinger was nodding what happened next i asked him the general ordered me to telephone for an ambulance where did you call the bulovka hospital is the nearest he said its on the northeast outskirts of prague about ten kilometres away i drive past it every morning said heydrich a czech doctor called honek attended said kritzinger in fact hes still downstairs and what did you do i asked pomme general heydrich told me to go and fetch general jury right away why because hes a doctor too said pomme yes i remember now he was a specialist in tuberculosis i believe before he joined the ss i nodded so you went to fetch him what happened then im afraid he was feeling rather the worse for wear after last night it was at least another fifteen minutes before he was dressed and on the scene i looked at heydrich meanwhile sir you were still in the room with kuttner isnt that right yes what did you do while you were waiting for doctor jury lets see now i opened the window to get some air i was feeling a little queasy for some reason no thats not fair he was a friend of mine i lit a cigarette to calm my nerves but i tossed the end out of the window when i was finished the crime scene is substantially uncontaminated he shook his head and then ran a thin hand through his short hair i cant think of anything else after a while doctor jury turned up with pomme the doctor was as pomme says very hung over but not so hung over that he was incapable of pronouncing poor kuttner dead after that i had ploetz call you and the local police right away at approximately seventhirty wheres doctor jury now i asked in the library sir said kritzinger with doctor honek he asked for a pot of strong black coffee to be brought to him there has doctor honek examined the body no said heydrich firmly i decided that there was no urgency about doing so i thought it might be better if he waited until you had had a chance to examine the body yourself i nodded ill do that now if i may of course said heydrich mister kritzinger i said would you ask doctor jury to join us in captain kuttners room yes sir captain pomme perhaps youd like to lead the way i stood up and looked at kahlo the criminal assistant from prague kripo youd better fetch the evidence kit that zennaty brought i said right you are sir general if youd care to join us heydrich nodded major ploetz youd better inform the rest of my guests of what has happened and that they will be required to answer the commissars questions before anyone is allowed to leave and that includes everyone at the upper castle yes sir kuttners room was on the same floor as mine but it was in the south wing and overlooked a little glass winter garden on the pinkpapered walls were some pictures of english hunting scenes that made a welcome change from the czech ones with which i was more familiar the fox who appeared to be smiling must have believed he stood a good chance of escaping from the hounds and that was all right with me lately im the kind of antisocial type who cheers when the fox makes a clean getaway before i looked at the body i made my way around the room noting a large pile of books by the bed and a bottle of veronal beside a water carafe on the desk the screw cap was still off the bottle there were several pills on the floor but oddly the bottle was upright kuttners belts and the holster containing his walther automatic were hanging on the back of his chair heydrich saw me pick up the open bottle of veronal until i realized the true nature of his injuries i assumed that the veronal was the culprit he said it was only when doctor jury opened the tunic of his uniform to examine captain kuttner that we realized hed suffered a lethal wound to his abdomen mmm hmm kuttner lay at an angle across the bed as if hed collapsed there his eyes were closed one of his arms lay neatly alongside his torso the other was sticking straight out at right angles to the rest of his body like a dead christ well half of a dead christ anyway but both hands were unscathed and empty there were four buttons on his captains fartcatcher tunic with three of them unbuttoned from the top he was wearing a white collarless shirt unbuttoned at the neck and no tie it was easy to see how anyone could have missed the fact hed been shot it was only when you lifted the flap of the tunic that you could see the blood covering the shirt he was still wearing his riding breeches and just one boot the monkeyswing his adjutants braided rope was off his top button but still attached to the right epaulette he looked like a man who had been shot while he was still undressing has anyone been over the floor yet i asked heydrich to look for evidence no said heydrich i nodded at kahlo who without complaint dropped onto his hands and knees and began to look for a bulletshell or perhaps something as yet unimagined i collected the p from kuttners holster sniffed the barrel and then checked the magazine the gun was dirty and not well maintained but clearly it hadnt been fired in a while your conclusions asked heydrich beyond the fact that he was shot in the torso and that it hardly looks like a suicide i dont yet have any i said why do you think it doesnt look like a suicide asked pomme its unusual to shoot yourself and then neatly replace the weapon in the holster i said especially when you werent being neat about so much else if you were going to shoot yourself you would take off both boots or neither of them quite apart from that his own pistol has a full magazine and hasnt been fired in a while i shrugged then again there is no other gun in the room but all the same its hard to imagine that he was shot returned to his room locked the door lay down on the bed took off one boot and then quietly died even if thats what it looks like what i cant understand said heydrich is why nobody seems to have heard a shot well we dont know that until we ask everyone i said i can ask around if you like offered pomme what i mean heydrich said firmly is that the sound of a shot would surely have raised the alarm especially here in a house full of policemen i nodded so the chances are that somehow the shot was muffled or someone did hear the shot and either chose to ignore it or thought that it was something else i went to the open window and put my head outside today i cant hear anything i said but yesterday when i arrived here at around the same time someone was out there shooting birds rather a lot of birds that would have been general von eberstein said captain pomme he likes to shoot but not this morning i observed this morning he has a hangover said pomme like general jury kahlo stood up apart from all of these pills theres nothing on this floor sir he said not so much as a bloodspot what nothing at all i frowned no sir ill organize a more thorough search after the bodys gone but this floor is clean sir he shook his head its a mystery maybe he shot himself threw the gun out of the window closed it again and then collapsed on the bed and died good thinking said heydrich sarcastically or maybe captain kuttner was just shot by a man who could pass through solid walls youd better check outside anyway i told kahlo he nodded and left the room heydrich shook his head that man is an idiot how well do you know this house general you mean are there any false walls and secret passages perhaps i havent the faintest idea ive not been here for very long at all von neurath had the house before i did he knows this place much better than me so youd better ask him that absently i drew open kuttners drawers and found several shirts a toilet bag some underwear a shoecleaning kit some der fuhrer magazines a clay pipe a book of poems and a framed picture of a woman can i ask von neurath something like that as i told you already gunther i expect everyone to cooperate no matter who or what they are thank you sir i smiled do i have to be polite or can i just be myself why change the habit of a lifetime youre the most insubordinate fellow i know gunther but sometimes that yields results it might however be a good idea if while you were conducting your investigation and practising your habitual impertinence you wore civilian clothes so that you cant be accused of something that would get you courtmartialled in a uniform yes i think that might be best have you any civilian clothes with you yes sir theyre in my room good and that reminds me gunther youll need a suitable space from which to conduct your investigations you can use the morning room see to it will you captain pomme yes herr general pomme will be your liaison officer for the inquiry for sd ss gestapo or military matters go through him anything else speak to kritzinger come to think of it hes the real lower castle expert not von neurath kritzinger bowed his head in heydrichs direction general jury appeared in the doorway breathing heavily he was perspiring and looked pale as if he really did have a severe hangover he closed his eyes for a moment and let out a sigh ah jury youre here heydrich was trying to keep the smirk out of his voice but without success it was obvious that he was enjoying the other generals hangover as another man might have taken pleasure at watching someone slip on a banana skin what else would you like to know about the captain jury asked biliously beyond the fact that hes dead and that there appears to be a gunshot wound in his abdomen i can tell you very little without examining his body in the morgue and its been many years since i did that kind of thing what made you think it was a gunshot wound i asked rather than a knife wound theres what looks like a neat bullet hole in his shirt explained jury not to mention a neat hole on his body and yet theres very little blood on the captains torso or for that matter elsewhere its rare in my experience that a man who is stabbed doesnt bleed more i saw no blood on the floor or the bed but it was only an educated guess and i could yet turn out to be wrong no i think youre right i said he was shot all right well then commissar he said stiffly i fail to see the need for the question indeed im inclined to consider it impertinent i am a doctor after all i decided to let jury have it between his oyster eyes in his present crapulous state assuming it was for real he was weak and vulnerable and it might take a while to find him like that again besides i thought it important that i make a very early test of heydrichs declaration that i enjoyed his full confidence and that he didnt care what i asked or indeed who i upset just as long as i solved the case if heydrich stood by and let me bully general jury then it would surely send out an early message to other senior officers in the lower castle that i was to be taken seriously all right i said youre a doctor but that doesnt mean you didnt kill him did you kill him i beg your pardon you heard me doctor jury was it you who shot captain kuttner if thats your idea of a joke commissar gunther then kindly take note of the fact that no one in this room is laughing including myself this wasnt quite true heydrich was smiling almost as if he approved of me putting jury on the spot in this way which at least told me he was serious about my investigating the murder i can assure you its no joke sir yesterday afternoon when we talked on the road up to the upper castle you told me that you hated captain kuttner nonsense spluttered jury you told me you thought he was a cunt and that you detested him that was before you went on to describe captain kuttner as general heydrichs golem jury coloured with embarrassment golem said heydrich thats an interesting choice of words remind me gunther what exactly is a golem a sort of creature created long ago by a local jewish mystic called rabbi loew sir to do his bidding on behalf of pragues jews jury was still protesting his innocence but for the moment heydrich ignored him if captain kuttner was the golem then i suppose that makes me comparable to this jewish mystic rabbi loew that was certainly my impression sir general heydrich sir said jury i can assure you that i meant nothing of the sort commissar gunther is entirely mistaken in no way did i mean to compare you to that person leaving that aside for a moment i said roughly why did you detest captain kuttner jury advanced on heydrich though i was the one asking the questions all of his answers were directed a little desperately at the reichsprotector it was an entirely private matter he insisted and nothing at all to do with the captains death its true i did dislike the man however if the commissar is suggesting that it was a reason for killing him then i really must protest a man has been murdered i said an officer of the ss in circumstances that compel investigation regardless of personal feelings im afraid there is no such thing as a private matter in a situation like this general jury you know that as well as anyone else this is now a criminal investigation and ill decide if your reason was sufficient reason to kill him and who made you judge and jury captain demanded the doctor i did said heydrich commissar gunther is one of the most competent detectives in kripo with an admirable forensic record he is only doing the job that i have asked him to do and doing it rather bravely i think can i see your gun doctor jury what your pistol sir i notice youre wearing it this morning may i examine it sir jury glanced at heydrich who nodded firmly im not sure why i put on my belts this morning he muttered i suppose it was because i was suddenly roused from sleep by captain pomme i mean i wouldnt normally he unbuttoned his holster and handed over the walther p standard issue for most ss officers unless like me they were anything to do with the criminal police in which case they were given the ppk he checked the safety ejected the magazine quickly and placed both in my hands it was an impressively competent display for a man who was a doctor and an ss bureaucrat i inspected the breech which was empty sniffed the barrel and then glanced at the singlestack magazine in the palm of my hand only three rounds i said and its been fired recently yes i did some shooting practice with my gun yesterday afternoon in the woods near the upper castle it was just to keep my hand in its my belief that one cannot be too careful what with all these czech terrorists from uvod running around and are you a good shot sir no not good competent perhaps i nodded at kuttners body obviously we wont know the kind of gun that was used to kill the captain until a postmortem has been performed however im afraid i will have to keep your weapon for now sir is that really necessary yes i may need to try to match the bullet that killed captain kuttner with a bullet fired from your gun what were you using for target practice yesterday songbirds pigeons hit anything no did anyone see you baron neurath perhaps i dont know youd have to ask him i suppose i will i didnt kill captain kuttner he repeated i said nothing but i think that perhaps i could explain my opinion of him to you and the general in private i think thats an excellent idea hugo said heydrich he glanced at kritzinger and pomme gentlemen if you would excuse us for a moment please the butler and the captain left the bedroom i closed the door as best i could given the fact that it had been broken in i stayed there for a moment running my fingers over the splintered wood and broken brasswork while jury blustered his way through an explanation of why he had disliked the dead man the matter is a delicate one involving a lady i know she is a woman of probity and reputation you understand however the other day i overheard captain kuttner talking about her in a way i considered extremely distasteful im sure youll understand if i dont mention her name or the specific details of the scurrilous gossip that was being relayed jury cleared his throat nervously removed his glasses and started to polish the lenses with a handkerchief but i can assure you it was not the sort of thing one would expect to hear from an officer and gentleman its true admitted heydrich kuttner had an unfortunate tendency to be indiscreet even outspoken i had occasion to speak to him about this i nodded exactly who did kuttner tell about your affair with this little opera singer i asked him bluntly well i really must protest jury proceeded to give me a look as if he wished it was me lying on the bed with a bullet hole in my torso what was her name again elizabeth something elizabeth schwarzkopf wasnt it suppose we just leave her name out of this said jury all right suppose we do only thats going to make it a little difficult to try to clear your name general you see ill need to speak to this other officer that kuttner was speaking to about your girl friend who was he jury bit his lip this took some doing given how thin it was major thummel he said and by the way you were right i said captain kuttner was a gossip he told me the same thing about you and fraulein schwarzkopf and doctor goebbels kuttner seemed to think that there might be some other reason behind the ministers patronage than just her singing you are impertinent captain gunther theres no question about that sir the question is what else was said and whether any of that is enough of a motive for murder need i remind you that you are speaking to a general you can sit on the highest branch if you want sir but it certainly wont stop me from shaking the tree and i can shake it quite hard if i have to hard enough to dump you on your backside im afraid gunther is right hugo said heydrich this is really no time to be sensitive i must have this situation cleared up as soon as possible if i am to avoid any embarrassment thats embarrassment to me and my office you understand not to you hugo i cant allow anything to get in the way of an early conclusion to this unfortunate matter even if that does mean us riding roughshod over your feelings and quite possibly your whole future too if you refuse to cooperate with the commissars inquiry heydrich looked at me now the fact is gunther that captain kuttner heard this story from me it was i who told him about general jurys affair with fraulein schwarzkopf im sorry hugo but everyone in berlin knows whats been going on except perhaps the leader and your wife karoline let us hope that she above all people can remain in ignorance of all this but herr commissar i think that the part of the story at which poor general jury will have taken most offence relates not to her talents in the bedroom which i assume are considerable but to her talent as a singer im afraid its true hugo if the fraulein was really any good as a soprano shed be singing with the berlin state opera and not the german opera and you may not know it for sure but the commissar is quite right that she has been sharing her sexual favours with the minister of propaganda i have the incontrovertible proof of that which at some future stage i would be happy to show you so theres no need to get on your high horse about all of this youve both been fucking her and thats all there is to it i mean how else do you think she was made a principal soprano so soon after joining the chorus it was goebbels who fixed that for her in return for services that she rendered to him horizontally jurys cheeks were now quite red and his hands were fists i wondered if that showed a man who was angry enough to kill a brother officer in cold blood i dont care for your manners general heydrich said jury that is of small account to me hugo heydrich paused well how about it did you kill captain kuttner he paused if you did then i promise that we can arrange things so as to avoid too much of a scandal you can resign quietly and go back to your loyal wife karoline perhaps you can even pick up your medical career again but i can promise that if you deny it and it turns out to be you after all who murdered the captain then it will go very hard for you we have plenty of filthy prison cells in terezin castle where even a distinguished man such as you can be forgotten for years right up until the moment when i sign his deathwarrant and have him hanged the old austrohungarian way by strangulation from a pole i didnt kill him insisted jury and then with a short click of his heels and a bow of the head he left the room abruptly i hope you enjoyed that capricious demonstration of your new powers said heydrich i know i did a few seconds later there was a knock on the open door it was kurt kahlo i searched underneath the window sir he told me nothing but i found this lying on the floor further down the corridor i marked the spot so dont worry he placed a small brass object in my hand what is it asked heydrich i held the object up in my fingers it looked like a metallic cigarette end unless im very much mistaken sir its a shell case from a walther p heydrich tossed the shell case back to me well gunther much as i should like to stay and observe you destroy the character of another of my guests i do have urgent business to attend to the rather more urgent matter of finding vaclav moravek yes of course sir ive told major ploetz that no one is to leave until youve had a chance to question him no one apart from him and me and klein my driver thank you sir i shall see you this evening when you can tell me of the progress youve made all right sir when he was gone i opened captain kuttners tunic and pulled up his bloody shirt to inspect the bullet wound and was surprised to find not one but two holes both in the centre of his chest and each about the size of the nail on a mans little finger kahlo was searching the floor again i didnt say anything about there being two gunshot wounds after a minute or so i turned the dead man onto his side so that i could inspect his back theres no exit wound i said carefully using the singular i rubbed my hand up and down the dead mans back but sometimes you can find the bullet just underneath the skin ive seen bullets just fall out of people whod been shot after which they can end up just about anywhere but i think this poor sonofabitch is still carrying metal i pushed kuttner onto his back again and stood up show me where you found that shell case kahlo led the way out of kuttners bedroom and in the corridor outside he pointed to a box of matches on the floor that hed used to mark the spot where hed discovered the shell casing all right i said you cut along to the morning room and make it look as much like an interview room as possible on second thought no leave it as it is but well need pencils and paper a jug of water some liquor some glasses a fresh pot of coffee every hour a telephone some cigarettes and a typewriter yes boss and tell doctor honek that the ambulance men can remove the body to the hospital and have him arrange an autopsy will you today if possible yes boss i glanced back to kuttners door about twenty metres away and once kahlo had gone dropped onto my hands and knees and made my way slowly along the corridor after a few minutes a door opened and out of a bedroom stepped the only officer in the lower castle who wasnt a member of the ss or the sd he was wearing the uniform of a major in the german army you look how i feel he observed hmmm last night i drank far too much but on top of all that there was the champagne which never agrees with me at the best of times still under the circumstances i didnt want to turn it down we were celebrating after all werent we all the same i do regret it now woke up with a bit of a head this morning i felt like i wanted to curl up and die you have to be alive to feel like that i suppose whats that oh yes i heard one of the adjutants got stalins greatcoat a terrible business stalins greatcoat was a coffin which one was he all of these adjutant fellows sort of look the same to me i found what i was looking for the second shell casing i stood up and found myself facing a man of about the same age as me captain kuttner he shook his head as if he couldnt remember him and youre the detective fellow from berlin arent you gunther isnt it thats correct sir i suppose that accounts for why youre crawling around the place on your hands and knees i do quite a lot of that anyway sir even when im not hunting for evidence i like to drink you see sir that is when i can get it theres no shortage of it here gunther if this keeps up i shall need a new liver major paul thummel at your service if theres anything i can do to help just let me know major ploetz says that you want to interview everyone who was staying here last night fine by me just say when always glad to help the police i pocketed the little shell casing thank you sir perhaps we could speak later on ill have captain pomme contact you to arrange a time sooner the better old man ploetz says that none of us can leave the house until weve given a statement frankly it all sounds a bit excessive after all its not like any of us is going to run away is it i think it has rather more to do with remembering details that might seem unimportant anywhere else in my experience its always better if you can interview witnesses as close to the crime scene as possible well you know your job i suppose just dont interview people in alphabetical order thats all youll find that puts me last i think ill certainly bear that in mind sir investigating the murder of one young sd officer who had almost certainly participated in the murders of hundreds perhaps thousands of latvian jews gypsies and other undesirables struck me as absurd of course a mass murderer whod been murdered what was wrong with that but how many had i killed myself there were the forty or fifty russian pows i knew about for sure nearly all of them members of an nkvd death squad id commanded the firing squad and delivered the coup de grace to at least ten of them as they lay groaning on the ground their blood and brains had been spattered all over my boots during the great war there had been a canadian boy id put the bayonet into when it was him or me only hed died hard with his head on my shoulder god knows how many others id killed when another time id taken over a maxim gun and squeezed the trigger as i pointed it at some brown figures advancing slowly over no mans land but it seemed that albert kuttners death mattered because hed been a german officer and a close colleague of general heydrichs that was supposed to make a difference only it didnt at least not to me investigating a murder in the autumn of was like arresting a man for vagrancy during the great depression but i did what i was told and started to go through the motions the way a proper policeman would have done what choice did i have besides it kept my mind off what i knew was happening out there in the east most of all it kept my mind off the growing sense that id been to the worst place on the planet only to realize that the worst place of all was inside me ive prepared a list of everyone who stayed at the lower castle last night and therefore who you will want to interview said major ploetz he handed me a sheet of neatly typed headed notepaper thank you major we were in the morning room with its greenish silk chinoise wallpaper the room felt like an extension of the garden and a little more natural than the rest of the house there were a couple of big sofas facing each other like very fat chessplayers across a polished wooden coffeetable in the window was a grand piano and in the fireplace there was a fire that cheered the room either side of the marble fireplace was a mosaic of picture frames featuring heydrich and his family kahlo was inspecting these one at a time as if looking to judge a winner now wearing my civilian clothes i was seated on one of the sofas smoking a cigarette here is your mail commissar forwarded from the alex in berlin and here is a copy of albert kuttners sd personnel file the general thought it might help you to get a better sense of the man and what he was like and you never know perhaps why he was killed the personnel files of everyone staying here this weekend are being sent over from hradschin castle this morning thats very efficient of you major it was easy to see why ploetz was heydrichs chief adjutant there was no doubting his efficiency with his lists and memoranda and facts and figures achim ploetz was a real electric nazi before the war id been to a town called achim it was near bremen in a nice part of the country that in its natural state is mostly moorland but there was nothing natural about achim ploetz and in that respect at least doctor jury was right all of heydrichs adjutants were a bit like the golem of prague outside the morning room window a mercedes drew up and heydrichs driver got out and opened the passenger door expectantly ploetz saw him out of the corner of his eye well id better go and tell the general that our car is here he said if there is anything you want just ask pomme yes i will then he was gone and kahlo and i were standing at the window peering around the heavy drapes like two comedians getting ready to take a curtain call the convertibles top was down and the engine was purring smoothly like some green metal dragon ploetz climbed aboard first and sat in the rear heydrich sat up front with the driver as if that might help him to control the car despite the fact someone else was at the wheel he was just like that i guess as we watched them drive away there was no sign of an armed escort so what do you make of it sir bloody fool i muttered hows that sir heydrich the way he drives around the city like hes invulnerable like achilles as if daring the poor bastards to come and have a go the czechos are just mad enough to do it too you think so kahlo nodded how long have you been in prague long enough to know that the czechos have got guts more than we like to give them credit for kurt isnt it kahlo nodded where are you from kurt mannheim sir how did you become a cop im not exactly sure my dad was a carworker at the daimlerbenz factory but i never much fancied being stuck in a factory myself he wanted me to become a lawyer only i wasnt clever enough so becoming a cop seemed like the next best thing so what do you make of it its a puzzle sir a man is found shot dead inside a firstfloor bedroom thats locked from the inside the windows are bolted and theres no murder weapon present down the corridor theres a spent ninemillimetre parabellum round on the floor so clearly a gun was fired at some time between the hours of midnight and say five oclock this morning and yet youd also expect someone to have remarked on that because a p wasnt picked as the armys choice of firearm because its so bloody quiet they cant all have been so pissed they didnt hear anything the staff werent pissed not with kritzinger in charge why didnt they hear something and not just a gunshot either i cant imagine kuttner standing on the landing upstairs and saying nothing as someone is about to shoot him me id have shouted help or dont shoot or something like that i agree kuttner was under the influence of a sleeping pill he said maybe he didnt realize quite how much peril he was in maybe it was dark and he didnt see the gun maybe he was shot outside and because he was drugged he didnt realize the severity of his injury so he comes back in the house goes back to his room locks the door lies down and dies maybe i shook my head youve got more maybes there than fritz bloody lang i know he said frankly i wouldnt know where to start with this one sir however im keen to learn from someone who does such as you that is if general heydrich is to be believed anyway you have my full cooperation sir just tell me what to do and ill do it with no questions asked questions are good kurt its obedience i have a problem with in particular my own kahlo grinned then i think yours should be an interesting career sir i opened kuttners sd file and glanced over the details of the dead mans short life albert kuttner was from halleandersaale interesting is it i cant say i know the place what i mean is halle is where heydrich is from so he could be taking this personally yes true kuttner was born in that makes him seven years younger than heydrich his father was a protestant pastor at a local church but instead of pursuing a career in the church or in the navy like his boss heydrich was in the navy i didnt know that its said he got kicked out of it for conduct unbecoming when he knocked up some admirals daughter but dont tell anyone i said so this admirals daughter is that the present frau heydrich no its not so he is human after all i wouldnt go that far kuttner studied law at the martin luther university of hallewittenberg and the humboldt university of berlin where it seems he was a brilliant student he received his doctor of laws in and worked for the ministries of justice and the interior before joining the sd so far so predictable hmm near the top of his class in officer school highly praised by everyone who assessed him he was being groomed for one of the top jobs in berlin in may this year he was transferred to the einsatzgruppen and ordered to pretzsch where he was assigned to group a and sent east nothing unusual about that lots of decent men have been sent east decent men and some lawyers on june rd he and the group were ordered to proceed to riga in latvia to help with the resettlement of the indigenous jewish population resettlement yes i know what that entails good it will save me having to explain the distinction between resettlement and mass murder am i to assume that your appreciation of the distinction is based on personal experience sir you are but please dont assume that i did a good job there are no good jobs out east albert kuttner didnt take to his work any more than i did which is why he felt guilty like me and why he wasnt sleeping thus the veronal in his room i turned the page in kuttners file and read on a little before speaking again that guilt appears to have manifested itself for the first time just three weeks into his tour of latvia when he put in for a transfer to the army but the request was refused by his commander major rudolf lange well that hardly surprises me i knew rudolf lange when he was with the berlin police the cat never stops catching mice he was a bastard then and hes a bastard now reason given for refusal of request for transfer personnel shortages but a week later he puts in for another transfer this time hes given an official reprimand for conduct likely to damage morale its a dirty job so someone has to do it right something like that i suppose i turned another page in kuttners file by august however albert is back in berlin facing a disciplinary inquiry it seems he threatened a superior officer with a pistol it doesnt say who but i hope it was lange ive often wanted to stick a gun in that fat fuckers face kuttners placed under close arrest but not close enough because he then attempts suicide no details on that either but hes sent back to berlin for that disciplinary inquiry a socalled ss court of honour only the disciplinary inquiry is suspended no reason given do you think heydrich might have pulled some strings thats what it looks like because the next thing is that albert is on the generals staff in berlin lighting his cigarettes booking seats at the opera and fetching coffee now that is a good job said kahlo you dont strike me as an opera fan not the opera the cigarettes his eyes were on my cigarette the tobacco ration being what it is sorry i opened my cigarette case help yourself kahlo took one lit up and then puffed with obvious satisfaction holding the cigarette in front of his eyes like a rare diamond he grinned happily id forgotten how good a cigarette can taste he said theres a page missing from this file i said in my own sd file theres a page headed personal remarks ive only ever seen it upside down but its full of things my superiors have said about me like insubordinate and politically unreliable you read good upside down kahlo grinned im a bit of a beefsteak nazi myself sir brown on the outside but red in the middle although im not as rare as my old dad being a carworker he was red all the way mm hmmm i handed kahlo the file its not much to go on he said flicking through it lets see what we can find out for ourselves i picked up the telephone and asked the lower castle switchboard to connect me with the alex in berlin a few minutes later i was able to speak with the records division i asked them if they had a file on albert kuttner they didnt so i had them run a check on his address which was always something you could do in berlin because it wasnt just individuals who generated records in prussia it was places too the prussian state police were nothing if not thorough and a few minutes later records called back to tell me that flat pestalozzi strasse in charlottenburg was home to another man besides albert kuttner and when i had the records people check him out i started to believe i had something lothar ott i said reading aloud my notes of these several telephone conversations born berlin february st two convictions for male prostitution one the other not only that but his previous address was number one friedrichsgracht near berlins spittelmarkt that wont mean much to a cop from mannheim but to a bull from berlin it means a lot until number one friedrichsgracht was a notorious homosexual club called the burger casino either the late captain kuttner was very tolerant of homosexuals or or he was maybe a bit warm himself kahlo nodded i mean you wouldnt live with someone like that unless you were would you what do you think you met him youre asking if kuttner struck me as the type i dunno a lot of officers strike me that way its possible i suppose he could have been the type you know a bit fastidious a bit too careful about his appearance a bit too much cologne on his hair the way he walked now i come to think of it yes i can see it when he shrugged it looked just like my brothers daughter i agree someone ought to give this other fellow ott a knock and see how he takes the news that kuttners dead thats an idea so i telephoned the alex again and explained kahlos idea to an old friend in kripo called trott who promised to go and see lothar ott and give him the bad news in person and then report back on the show as soon as i replaced the receiver the telephone rang kahlo answered it its doctor honek he said handing me the candlestick calling about the autopsy i took the phone this is gunther i managed to find someone to perform an autopsy on captain kuttner said honek today like you asked me commissar in view of the circumstances professor hamperl from the pathological institute of the german charles university in prague has agreed to carry out the procedure at four oclock this afternoon hes most distinguished where at the bulovka hospital all right well be there at four after i hung up kahlo said we whats this we you dont want me there do you you said you were keen to learn didnt you yes but well the thing is ive never seen an autopsy before theres nothing to it besides we have a distinguished professor to perform the autopsy i dont know he said anxiously i mean dead people i dont know they look like theyre dead right its best that way when they look alive it puts the pathologist a bit off his knife i shrugged its your choice now lets have a look at that list of names that major ploetz gave us i think some of them look like theyre people those present at the lower castle on the night of ndrd october included the following ss obergruppenfuhrer reinhard heydrich ss obergruppenfuhrer richard hildebrandt ss obergruppenfuhrer karl von eberstein ss gruppenfuhrer konrad henlein ss gruppenfuhrer dr hugo jury ss gruppenfuhrer karl hermann frank ss brigadefuhrer bernard voss ss standartenfuhrer dr hans ulrich geschke ss standartenfuhrer horst bohme

kriegshelferin victoria kuckenberg maid for obvious reasons it is recommended that you conduct your interviews at the lower castle in strict order of seniority for reasons of security and confidentiality please confine all interviews to the morning room interviews at the upper castle should be conducted by arrangement with the barons adjutant ss hauptsturmfuhrer eduard jahn a safe will be provided for your use in the morning room all documents pertaining to this inquiry should be placed in it when not in use for reasons of confidentiality signed ssmajor dr achim ploetz adjutant to ss obergruppenfuhrer heydrich my eyes slid off the page and landed on the floor with a loud sigh if one were to assume that anyone at the lower castle might have had the opportunity and the motive to kill captain kuttner i said that leaves us with thirtyone suspects christ muttered kahlo thats at least one for every day of the month thirtynine including the personnel at the upper castle with von neurath its only a short walk from there to the upper castle so i dont see how they can be excluded and god knows how many if we include all of the ss up at the guard house i grunted do you want to include them how many are in the garrison at least two hundred i dont want to include them no no but i hardly see how i can exclude them given the possibility that albert kuttner may have been warm a bit of rough trade with an enlisted man in the woods might have been just his beer the first thing we have to do you mean apart from interviewing the senior ranks i paused so far no ones complained about being kept waiting by you said kahlo but it wont be long i nodded all right while i start with the formal interviews the first thing you have to do is to try and speak to everyone informally and get a sense of kuttners movements last night who was the last person to see him alive and at what time that kind of thing now i saw him at about nine oclock when he was having a fairly heated discussion in the garden with one of the other adjutants captain kluckholn i think then about half an hour later after heydrich had made a speech he appeared in the library with some champagne so you might start with that in mind i want times and places and see if you cant get a plan of the house that way we can start plotting his various positions yes i suppose that might help any suggestions of your own will be gratefully considered then a clairvoyant with a crystal ball couldnt do any harm strikes me thats the only way were going to find a murderer who walks through locked doors and shoots people without making a sound you make me begin to wonder what im doing here kurt by the way sir if you dont mind me asking what are you doing here what i mean is all this damned cauliflower its like a market garden in this house he was referring to the oakleaf collar patches that distinguished ss generals brigadiers and colonels from lesser mortals whats it all about whats the reason for it you ask some pretty good questions for a man who promised to work for me no questions asked so whats the answer i believe general heydrich wanted a quiet weekend with friends to celebrate his appointment as the new reichsprotector of bohemia i see you sound surprised but not as surprised as i was to be asked along on this jaunt the general and i weve grown apart you understand schiller once wrote a pretty good poem to his friends when i was at school we were obliged to learn all five verses i used to think he said all there was to say about what friendship means in germany only i dont remember a verse covering the kind of friend i have in general heydrich goethe did it better i think you know what happens when mephistopheles invites you over for real coffee and american cigarettes even as i said it arianne came into my mind it was she who had made the comparison between heydrich and mephistopheles on the train from berlin and ever since then id been wondering just how long i had to work for heydrich before my soul was forfeit oh yeah said kahlo temptation and temptation like real coffee and american cigarettes well thats very tempting i figure that the alternative is worse i cant answer for why all the cauliflower is here but thats why im on board because the general asked me to dance because he doesnt like it when you say no all right ill buy that good now lets see what we can do about getting a bead on the invisible man ss obergruppenfuhrer richard hildebrandt was the higher police leader in danzig and commander of a large unit of ss that was stationed in west prussia in the event of the citizens of berlin rising up against hitler hildebrandt would be in charge of suppressing that particular revolution born at worms in he was an old friend of heydrichs smooth neat fastidious and of only average height he had the look and manner of a prosperous businessman certainly he had the best tailoring of any officer who was staying at the lower castle on his left breast pocket he wore a knights cross of the war merit cross with swords a silver nazi medal that had nothing to do with the proper knights cross and everyone whod seen proper combat thought of this decoration as a substitute iron cross but i suppose a general has to have some kind of furniture on his tunic if ever people are going to listen to him but the gold party badge he wore next to the faux knights cross was the real hallmark of his sterling nazi status and nearuntouchability that little gewgaw occupied pride of place on his uniform and was the cynosure of anyone who knew what was what in nazi germany he sat down on the sofa opposite me lit a cigarette and crossed his legs will this take long commissar not long sir good because i have some important paperwork i need to get through how well did you know captain kuttner i didnt know him at all until i arrived here the day before yesterday i had perhaps spoken to him twice and only on the telephone how did you find him he struck me as efficient well educated diligent as one might expect of an officer working for a man like general heydrich did you like him what kind of stupid question is that a fairly easy one id say did you like him hildebrandt shrugged i did not dislike him can you think of any reason why someone would want to kill him no and my own opinion is that a czech must have committed the crime there are czechs working here in the house and grounds my advice commissar would be to start by questioning them not senior generals in the ss my apologies herr general i was led to believe by major ploetz that i should conduct these interviews in strict order of seniority so as not to keep anyone important such as yourself hanging around hildebrandt shrugged i see my apologies commissar i shrugged back however i still fail to see why senior ranks should be questioned at all in my opinion my word should be good enough and what word is that sir that i had nothing at all to do with this mans death of course i dont doubt it sir however it is not the point of this interview to find out if you murdered captain kuttner the immediate purpose of this inquiry is to build a detailed picture of the mans last few hours and having done so to identify some genuine suspects you do see the difference of course do you take me for an idiot i didnt answer that you were with us all in the library to listen to the leaders speech were you not naturally and then to hear heydrichs speech hildebrandt nodded impatiently he took a last puff of his cigarette and then extinguished it in a heavy glass ashtray that lay on the table between us do you remember captain kuttner bringing in some champagne after that yes did you stay celebrating very long yes i confess i drank rather too much i think like everyone else i have a bit of a headache this morning yes sir only i have a bigger one i have to solve this murder that wont be easy you do see that dont you at some stage its possible im going to have to accuse a brother officer of killing kuttner perhaps even a senior officer i think you might try to be a little more understanding of my position sir dont tell me my duty commissar gunther with the scary badge in your lapel i wouldnt dream of it sir hildebrandt glanced down at his gold party badge and smiled you mean this dont you ive heard thats what some people call it although i cant imagine why anyone would be scared of this it means that you joined the party very early on doesnt it yes in my case it was the following year i took part in the munich putsch i was right behind the leader as we left the beer hall you must have been very young sir i was twentysix if you dont mind me asking what happened to you sir after the putsch failed his eyes misted over for a moment before he answered things were difficult for a while very difficult i dont mind telling you apart from the harassment i received at the hands of the police i was short of money and i had little choice but to go and work abroad he seemed relieved to be talking about something that was nothing to do with kuttner relaxed even which momentarily was my intention where did you go america there i tried my hand at farming for a while but after that failed i became a bookseller in new york thats quite a switch sir did you fail at being a bookseller too hildebrandt frowned or did you come back to germany for another reason sir i came back because of the wonderful things that were happening in germany because of the leader that was and you joined the ss when may i ask that is when i first met heydrich but i dont see what any of this has to do with the death of captain kuttner im coming to that if youll bear with me i suppose you must have a high regard for the standards of the ss having joined as early as yes i do of course i do what kind of a question is that do you suppose that captain kuttner lived up to those standards im sure he did are you sure he did or do you suppose he did what are you driving at gunther if i told you that captain kuttner was a practising homosexual what would your reaction be nonsense general heydrich would never have tolerated such a thing ive known him long enough to be quite sure of that what if general heydrich didnt know about it there are no secrets from heydrich said hildebrandt you should be aware of that and if youre not you soon will be what he doesnt know probably isnt worth knowing would it surprise you if i told you that there are some things even heydrich doesnt know nonsense he repeated this whole line of questioning is nonsense commissar kuttner was artistic at worst but we dont condemn a man for enjoying good music and appreciating good paintings with respect i dont think it is nonsense sir kuttner was living with a man in berlin a man with convictions for male prostitution a man who used to frequent a notorious homosexual bar called the burger casino dressed in a schoolboy sailorsuit and who used to take his clients to a nearby pier on the river in order to have sex with them rubbish i just dont believe it and i think it very poor taste on your part to malign a fellow officer who is no longer in a position to defend himself from that kind of defamation let us assume for one minute that im right about this why please sir indulge me for a moment very well what would your opinion be of a man like that my opinion yes sir what do you think of an ss captain who shares his bed with a male prostitute hildebrandts smooth face darkened the lips tightened and the jaw turned pugnacious i mean sir its said it was ernst rohms homosexuality that was one of the reasons the party turned on him why he was executed thats probably true admitted hildebrandt rohm was a degenerate as were some of the others edmund heines klausener schneidhuber schragmuller they were loathsome specimens and richly deserved their fate of course they did i wasnt sure they had deserved their fate not all of them erich klausener had been the leader of the police department at the prussian interior ministry in berlin and not a bad fellow at all but i wasnt there to debate with hildebrandt do you think that sort of thing should be tolerated in the ss of course it shouldnt and it isnt tolerated never has been do you think it brings dishonour to the ss is that why certainly it brings dishonour to the ss commissar gunther what a fucking question its obvious if the man was as you say homosexual although i still dont believe kuttner was then id go further than that such a man should be put in front of a firing squad like rohm and those other queers its the pansies and the jews who almost destroyed germany during the weimar republic oh surely i said who continue to threaten the moral fibre of our country we are cultivating increasingly healthy blood for germany and it must be kept pure as the father of three children myself two of them boys i say it quite emphatically if such a man was under my command i should not hesitate to denounce him to the gestapo not for a minute no matter how serious the consequences well of course i said i know its illegal under paragraphs and of the criminal code but i thought that homosexuals could only be sent to prison for up to ten years so let me get this straight there are extra punishments that apply to such people in the ss is that right like being shot as you say i assume you would know sir he lit another cigarette as a matter of fact i do know and in the strictest confidence i will tell you what happens in the ss we have about one case of homosexuality a month when they are uncovered by order of the reichsfuhrerss himself they are degraded expelled and handed over to the courts and following completion of the statutory punishment which you mentioned they are then sent to a concentration camp where they are most often shot while attempting to escape i see personally i cant see the need for the camp if it was up to me it would be the commanding officer who would shoot such a man summarily so let me get this straight if you had absolute incontrovertible proof that captain kuttner was a homosexual and hed been your junior officer youd have shot him yourself is that right absolutely thank you general that will be all sir i do appreciate your candour in this matter hildebrandt paused are you playing games with me commissar i was merely testing a theory sir and what theory is that only that its quite possible he wasnt murdered by a czech after all as you insisted earlier but by another german i dare say youre not the only man who thinks kuttner was probably murdered by a czech its a common enough prejudice we germans have a suspicion of other lesser races take berlins sbahn murderer this summer paul ogorzow remember him yes before he was caught everyone thought the murderer was a foreign worker but paul ogorzow was a german not only that but he was a party member not as early a member as you sir but i think he joined well before hitler became reich chancellor i shrugged when it comes to murder i like to keep an open mind hildebrandt got up to leave he straightened his immaculate ridingbreeches which were the expensive kind with the suede inside legs as if he actually went riding and moved toward the morning room door by the way sir how did you find living in america i beg your pardon did you enjoy living in america sir yes i did id love to work in a foreign country so far its been france bohemia and the ukraine and i didnt much like the ukraine and i certainly didnt like the work hildebrandt remained silent neither did captain kuttner i said did you know that no yes he told me that himself it bothered him a lot made him feel disgusting theres no doubt that its difficult work said hildebrandt not everyone is suitable for this kind of duty however theres no shame in that i think no shame for you anyway commissar thank you sir ill try to bear that in mind i had about thirty minutes before my next appointment in the morning room so i went upstairs to search kuttners room i wanted to do this without anyone else looking over my shoulder just in case i found something interesting that i had to show ploetz or heydrich or whoever else took it upon themselves to scrutinize my work but kuttners bed had already been stripped the sheets and blankets lay in a heap on the floor the window had been opened wider than before and the room was full of the scent of freshly cut grass the gardener at jungfernbreschan was forever tending the lawns outside the window the motorized lawnmowers were already at work seated on the end of kuttners bed was a girl of about twentyfive she had blond hair and a handkerchief in her hand and was wearing a sleeveless grey pinafore and a regulation ss black dress the one with the big floppy collar trimmed with white piping she was an ss helferin a helper and in this case a maid i watched her silently from the doorway for several minutes and not noticing me she didnt move except now and then to press the handkerchief to her nose as if she had a head cold finally my curiosity could no longer be contained and clearing my throat i advanced into the dead mans room abruptly the helper stood up and looked the other way at least she did until i caught hold of her arm im sorry sir she said i didnt mean any harm coming in here mister kritzinger sent me to strip the bed and i was just overcome for a moment at the thought of that poor man being murdered she was older than i had first supposed and not particularly goodlooking too thin and highly strung for my taste her skin was clear as tissue paper and you could see the little blue veins at the side of her forehead like the makers mark on good porcelain the mouth was wider and sadder than it ought to have been perhaps but it was her big eyes i was really interested in because they were red and full of tears im commissar gunther yes sir i know who you are i saw you when you arrived here yesterday she gave a little curtsy im investigating captain kuttners murder she nodded she knew that too did you know him not really sir we talked a few times he was kind to me what did you talk about nothing really sir nothing important it was just incidental talk you might say idle conversation about nothing very much its all right im not going to tell anyone im just trying to get the handle on what kind of a fellow he was maybe when ive done that ill have a better grip on why someone killed him i pointed at the bed where shed been sitting can we sit down and talk just for a minute all right she sat down and i sat beside her albert was a very sweet gentle man well he was more of a boy really such a handsome boy i cant imagine anyone wanting to hurt him let alone kill him he was thoughtful and considerate and very sensitive you liked him then oh yes much more than some of these other officers he was different he certainly was thinking i might have sounded insincere i added i liked him too even as i said this i realized for the first time since hearing about kuttners death that i really had liked him probably it was mostly the fact we had both shared a terrible experience in the east but more than that i had also liked his wit and candour which bordered on the indiscreet to that extent at least kuttner reminded me of me and i wondered if i had started to take his murder a little more personally than seemed appropriate go on she shook her head i dont want to get in any trouble i can promise you that you wont but if theres anything you know that sheds any light on what happened here last night then i think i need to know about it dont you general heydrich is very determined that i find out who murdered the captain and the only way that is going to happen is if i persuade people like you to have confidence enough in me to tell the truth all right sir good whats your name steffel rosa steffel well rosa why dont you tell me what happened last night she said when all of the officers started to go to bed he insisted on helping me collect up the glasses even though i could see he was dead tired that was kind of him i said what time was that it must have been after one oclock i heard the clock chime in the hall some of the cauliflowers were still up of course swigging brandy in the library and one or two were drunk one in particular i wouldnt like to say who he was but he got a bit too familiar with me if you know what i mean you see theres something about this uniform when some of the cauliflowers get drunk they think were little better than campfollowers and they take liberties with us this particular officer touched my breasts and he tried to put his hand up my dress i didnt care for it and told him so but hes my senior officer and its not easy trying to put a man in his place when hes a general it was captain kuttner who came to my assistance rescued me if you like he told the general off in so many words the general was furious and swore a lot at the captain and told him to mind his own effing business but captain kuttner was wonderful sir he ignored the general and escorted me back below stairs before the general could touch me again i shook my head some of these ss generals are loathsome i said ive just come out of a rather rough meeting with general hildebrandt and he really put me back in my shell was it he who touched you no i sighed rosa please im in a real spot here one of these men yes maybe even one of these cauliflowers murdered a man in cold blood right here in this room the room was locked from the inside and the window was bolted which means that this investigation is already difficult dont make it impossible you need to tell me who it was who touched you last night it was general henlein thank you what happened when captain kuttner escorted you below stairs rosa we talked a bit like we usually did about nothing much really tell me one of the things you used to talk about rosa she shrugged prague we talked about prague we both agreed that its very beautiful and we also talked about our home town youre not from halleandersaale too sort of im from reidesburg which is just outside halle it seems as though everyone but me is from halle general heydrich is from halle do you know that of course everyone knows about the heydrichs in halle someone else here is from halle too at least thats what albert told me but im afraid i dont remember who that is what else did he tell you that he went to the same school as the general the reform realgymnasium my brother rolf went there too its the best school in town sounds like they had a lot in common albert and the general yes he said things had been difficult for him lately but that the general had been very kind to him the idea of heydrich being kind was not something i felt like contemplating it was like hearing that hitler liked children or that ivan the terrible had owned a puppy did he elaborate on any of that on why things had been difficult on exactly how the general had been kind to him rosa looked at her handkerchief as if the answer lay crushed inside its sodden interior albert made me promise not to tell anyone about it he said that people in the ss were not supposed to talk about such things and that it might get me into trouble so why was he telling you about it because he said he had to tell someone to get it off his chest well hes dead now and so is that promise i think i suppose so but do you promise not to tell anyone that i spoke about this with you yes i promise rosa nodded and hesitantly she gave voice to what kuttner had told her he said he was in our latvian provinces during the summer and that germany had done terrible things there that lots of people thousands of people had been killed for no other reason than that they were jews old men women and children whole villages full of defenceless people who had nothing to do with the war he said that at first he carried out his orders and commanded the firing squads that murdered these people but after a while hed had enough and refused to have anything more to do with these killings himself only this landed him in trouble with his superior officers she shook her head it seemed unbelievable to me but when he talked about it he started to cry and so i couldnt help but believe him at the time i mean a man especially an officer he doesnt cry for nothing does he but now i dont know do you really think it can be true what he told me commissar gunther about the killings im afraid its true rosa every word of it and not just in latvia its going on everywhere east of berlin for all i know its even going on here in bohemia but he was wrong about one thing within the ss and the sd its an open secret whats been going on in the eastern territories and just to put your mind at rest im almost certain it wasnt his talking about this that got him killed but something else rosa nodded gratefully thank you commissar i was worried about that tell me something when captain kuttner intervened on your behalf with general henlein you said the general swore at albert thats right did he threaten him yes can you remember his exact words perhaps not exactly as well as a lot of horrible words i dont want to repeat the general said something along the lines of ill remember you kuttner you worthless little coward and ill make you pay for this just see if i dont did anyone else hear that besides you rosa mister kritzinger general heydrich they must have heard it and i suppose some of the others too but i dont remember their names in their uniforms they all look the same to me i have the same problem and thats partly why i took mine off sometimes when im playing detective its necessary to put myself apart from everyone else but frankly i hope i never have to put the uniform on again youre beginning to sound a lot like albert i suppose thats why i liked him youre a strange one too commissar for a policeman i get a lot of that remember that wild kid they found walking around nuremberg during the last century the one who claimed hed spent his early life alone in a darkened cell kaspar hauser yes i remember he ended his days in ansbach didnt he everyone knows that old story the only difference between me and kaspar is that i have a terrible feeling im going to end my days in a darkened cell so for that reason alone it might be best if you made me a promise not to tell anyone that weve had this conversation i promise all right you can run along now im going to search alberts room i thought you already did what do you mean i mean that the other two adjutants captains kluckholn and pomme were here already when i came in to strip the bed theyd emptied the drawers into some cardboard boxes and took them away no that was nothing to do with me however they probably wanted to collect alberts personal effects to send back home to his parents the way your pals do when you catch the last bus home yes i expect so but rosa steffel didnt sound any more convinced of this than i was on the way back to the morning room i found kritzinger winding the longcase clock i looked at it and checked my wristwatch but the butler was shaking his head i wouldnt ever set your watch by this clock sir he said its running very slow is that wellknown in the house i was thinking of the approximate times that had been given to me in heydrichs study earlier on generally yes the clock urgently needs to see a clockmaker there must be plenty of those in prague this citys got more clocks than salvador dali you would think so sir but so far my own inquiries have revealed that all of them seem to be jews a jew cant fix a clock not in this house sir no i suppose not that was naive of me wasnt it this is an interesting time we live in wouldnt you say even if it is always the wrong one i glanced at the gold pocket watch in kritzingers hand how about your watch herr kritzinger can that be relied upon yes sir its a glashutte and belonged to my late father he was a station master on the railways in posen a good watch is essential for a railwayman in prussia if the trains are to run on time and did he get the trains to run on time yes sir me i always thought it was the leader who did that kritzinger regarded me with polite patience was there something i could help you with sir according to that glashutte of yours kritzinger what time did the party in the library fold last night the last gentlemen went up to bed just before two sir and they were i believe it was general henlein and colonel bohme i believe general henlein made himself a latenight snack out of captain kuttner is that right im not sure what you mean sir sure you do the general cut the captain off at the tops of his boots didnt he i believe the general might have said something to the captain yes sir didnt he threaten him i wouldnt like to say sir kritzinger snapped the lid shut on the gold pocket watch and dropped the timepiece into his vest pocket it was an impatient action quite at odds with his general demeanour which was always to be of service even when it was in the face of the provocation i offered like asking him apparently frivolous or trivial questions that bordered on the impertinent or the unpatriotic i can understand that nobody likes a petzer especially when the petzer is the butler in relation to their employers and perhaps their guests too good butlers are expected to behave like the three wise monkeys right kritzingers head bowed almost imperceptibly that describes my position vis a vis my superiors only up to a point sir as you suggest i am obliged always to observe but i never judge one must always guard against such unnecessary distractions in service particularly now id have thought working for general heydrich i really couldnt say sir herr kritzinger i respect you and i wouldnt ever try to bully a man who wears an iron cross ribbon in his lapel the way i figure it you probably won yours the same way i won mine in hell fighting a real war against real soldiers who fought back most of them so youll know that im not likely to be a man who makes idle threats but this is a murder inquiry kritzinger and that means im supposed to behave like a very nosy fellow and take a peep between the pots on everyones window ledge i dont like doing it any more than you do but i will do it even if i have to throw every fucking pot through your window now what did general henlein say the butler stared at me for a long moment blinking with silent disapproval like a cat in an empty fishmongers i can assure you i do appreciate your position theres no need for profanity please sir i sighed and thumbed a cigarette into my mouth i think theres every fucking reason for profanity when someone is murdered profanity helps to remind us that this isnt something that happened politely and with good manners kritzinger you can polish the silver on this all you want but a man was shot last night and every time i put a cigarette near my mouth i can still taste his blood on my fingers i see a lot of bodies in my line of work sometimes it looks like i brush it off but fuck is what i still say to myself every time i see some poor bastard with a leaky hole in his chest it helps to focus on the true profanity of what happened do i have to swear more loudly and twist your face in my hand while im doing it or are you going to heave it up what did general henlein say to captain kuttner kritzinger coloured and then glanced around nervously the general did threaten the captain sir with what a blanket bath a kiss on the cheek come on kritzinger im through dancing with you general henlein had taken a fancy to one of the maids sir rosa rosa steffel shes a good girl and she certainly did not encourage him but the general had consumed a little too much alcohol you mean he was drunk thats not for me to say sir but i do believe he was not quite himself he made a pass at rosa that left the girl embarrassed and i would have intervened had not the captain done so first this earned him a reprimand from general henlein more than just a reprimand perhaps he was abusive but i recall it wasnt just general henlein sir who spoke so violently which is another reason perhaps i did not interfere sooner colonel bohme had something to say as well and between them they straightened the unfortunate captains tie for him give me some verbs here kritzinger what were they going to do to him when they were sober i do believe that the general called the captain a filthy coward and said hed make him pay for his damned interference then the colonel came in with his two pfennigs worth he accused captain kuttner of insubordination and of being a jew lover what did captain kuttner say to that mostly nothing at all sir he just took it as you might have expected given their difference in ranks pointedly he added the way a butler might have to take abuse from one of his employers more uncouth and loutish house guests that made me smile it was easy to see how kritzinger had won his iron cross colonel bohme also mentioned something about sending captain kuttner to the eastern front where his cheek and insubordination would receive short shrift from his commanders captain kuttner replied and i believe im quoting him here that it would be a privilege and an honour to serve with real soldiers in a real army commanded by real generals he said that yes sir he did good for him i thought so too sir thank you herr kritzinger im sorry if i was loutish with you thats all right sir we both of us have jobs to do i glanced at my wristwatch again and saw that i had five minutes before i was supposed to see general von eberstein in the morning room one more thing kritzinger did you see captain kuttner before he went to bed yes sir it was after two by my watch not this clock how did he seem a little depressed and tired very tired oh i remarked upon it and wished him a good night what did he say to that he gave a bitter sort of laugh and said that he thought hed probably had his last good night for a long while i confess this struck me as an unusual thing to say and when i asked him what he meant he said that the only way he would sleep would be if he were to take some sleeping pills which he intended to do so you had the impression that he hadnt yet taken them kritzinger paused and thought about this yes but as i say he certainly didnt look like a man who needed sleeping pills because he looked so tired already thats right sir did you see him drink very much last night no he hardly drank at all he had a glass of beer in his hand before he went to bed but now i come to think of it that was all i saw him drink the whole evening he seemed to be a most abstemious sort of person if im honest thank you by the way i should like to have a plan of the house with an indication of who was in each of the bedrooms is that possible yes sir ill see to it all right kritzinger thatll be all for now thank you sir will you be lunching with everyone sir i really hadnt thought about it but i missed breakfast and now i find im ravenously hungry so yes i will ss obergruppenfuhrer karl von eberstein was chatting with kurt kahlo when i came into the morning room he was a genial type for an aristocrat ah commissar gunther there you are we were beginning to think youd forgotten me he was early and he knew it but he was also a general and i wasnt yet ready to start contradicting him i hope i havent kept you waiting for long sir no no i was just admiring general heydrichs grand piano its a bluthner very fine he was standing right in front of the instrument which was as big and black as a venetian gondola and touching the keys experimentally like a curious child do you play sir very badly heydrich is the musical one but of course it runs in that family his father bruno was something of a star at the halle conservatory he was a great man and of course a great wagnerian you sound as if you knew him sir bruno oh i did i did im from halleandersaale myself someone else from halle thats a coincidence not really my mother was heydrichs godmother it was me who introduced the general to himmler and set him on his way then you must feel very proud of him sir i do commissar very much so hes a credit to his country and to the whole national socialist movement i had no idea that you and he were so close von eberstein came away from the piano and stood beside me in front of the fire warming his backside with conspicuous enjoyment he was in his late forties on his grey tunic was an iron cross first and second class indicating hed been given it twice no small feat even for an aristocrat still there was a pious air about him a bit like a hypocritical priest i like to think of him as my protege im certain he wouldnt mind me saying that the way he said this made me think that heydrich just might mind him saying that how about captain kuttner i asked he was from halle too did you know him well well enough his father i know rather better we were in the army together during the last war pastor kuttner was our regimental chaplain but for him im not sure id have fared as well as i did he was a tremendous comfort to us all im sure von eberstein shook his head its a great pity that this happened a great pity yes it is sir and youre quite certain it was murder and not suicide of course well have to wait for the autopsy this afternoon to be completely sure but im more or less certain yes well you know your business i suppose why do you mention suicide only because of what happened to albert in latvia he tried to kill himself there or at least threatened to kill himself exactly what did happen im still a little unclear about that i believe he suffered a nervous breakdown brought on by the difficulty of his war assignments i mean of course the evacuation of the jews in the eastern territories not everyone is equal to the tasks that have been set before us as a people i wonder if you might be a little more specific sir under the circumstances i think i should know all there is to know yes i agree with you commissar perhaps you should von eberstein proceeded to explain using words and phrases that made the whole filthy business of murdering thousands of people sound like an engineering job or perhaps an exercise in crowd control after a large game of football it was typical of the nazis that they should call a spade an agrarian implement and as i listened to one weasel word after another i felt i wanted to slap him responding to fundamental orders issued in berlin lieutenant kuttner was assigned the task of tactically coordinating the activities of a special detachment of ss that was made up of units of latvian auxiliary police throughout the summer this same detachment carried out many extensive special actions in and around the riga area principally kuttners function was to perform a rudimentary census for the purpose of apprehending communists as well as identifying provincial jews after the census jews were ordered to assemble at a given location and from there they were evacuated it was later found that some of these evacuations were carried out with unnecessary brutality and this seems to have occasioned feelings of guilt and depression in poor kuttner he started drinking heavily and following one protracted bout of drinking he threatened a superior officer with his pistol subsequent to that he tried but was prevented from shooting himself because of these incidents he was sent home to face a court martial well thats clear enough i said and watched kahlo cover the smile on his face with a hand and its cigarette yes it was an unfortunate business and might have severely blighted what was a very promising career albert was a brilliant young lawyer but the reichsfuhrer is not an insensitive man and fully understands the problems that are sometimes provoked by these special actions i talked it over with him at some length im sorry sir i interrupted to clarify what you said just now you mean you discussed lieutenant kuttners case with reichsfuhrer himmler on an individual basis thats right he and i agreed that it should not be held against a man that he was too sensitive for such psychologically arduous duties given his legal talents it was a waste of a fine mind just to allow him to be cashiered without a second chance to redeem himself consequently heydrich agreed to take kuttner onto his personal staff and if he had not then i would certainly have done so captain kuttner was far too able an officer to let go you were referring to lieutenant kuttner sir this is only a few weeks ago and now he is a captain am i to understand that not only was there no court martial but that lieutenant kuttner was promoted captain upon joining general heydrichs staff for reasons of administrative efficiency its usually best if adjutants are all of an equal rank it saves any petty bickering if you dont mind me saying so sir but kuttner was lucky to have that kind of vitamin b i mean to have two patrons who can count the reichsfuhrerss as a friend yes perhaps how long have you and reichsfuhrer himmler been friends sir oh lets see now i joined the party in and the ss in that explains the gold party badge observed kahlo it seems as if youve been part of the movement since the very beginning sir if id had the good sense you had then i might be something better than a criminal assistant now no disrespect intended sir oh i wasnt always so resolute in my devotion to the party go on sir kahlo grinned no really there was a time after the failure of the beer hall putsch and despairing of our cause when i even left the party von eberstein wagged a finger at kahlo so you see we all make mistakes for three years i was he paused and looked thoughtful for a moment well i was doing other things like what sir it doesnt matter now what matters now is that we find the person who murdered captain kuttner is that not so commissar yes sir have you any ideas on that score ive got plenty of ideas sir we germans have never been short of those but mostly what i know is limited by the terms in which the mind can think which means its probably best i dont try to explain what those ideas are not yet anyway what i can tell you is that not everyone liked the young captain as much as you and general heydrich and im not talking about the czechs sir i figure that given half a chance theyd shoot any one of us wearing a german uniform no im talking about yes i know what youre talking about von eberstein sighed no doubt youve heard about that unfortunate incident in the library last night when general henlein spoke with unnecessary harshness to captain kuttner im not saying it demonstrates a motive for murder but when youve seen men murdered for no motive at all as i have it gives pause for thought henlein was drunk he was armed clearly he didnt like kuttner and he certainly had the opportunity all of us had that commissar youve a difficult job to do here and no mistake but ive known konrad henlein ever since i was the police president of munich and i can tell you this hes no murderer why the man used to be a teacher in a school what kind of teacher a gymnastics teacher so hes the one i said thinking of the girl in the suite at the imperial hotel the one arianne had spoken to what i was just thinking the gym teacher at my school was a regular sadist now i come to think of it i cant imagine a man who was more likely to murder someone than him von eberstein smiled im sure that henlein isnt like that indeed im confident that none of the senior ranks here in heydrichs own house could have committed such a heinous crime but i didnt share his confidence when this is all over commissar when you have as im sure you will solved the crime i believe well find that the solution is much less remarkable than we might suppose right now isnt that usually the case i might agree with you except for the very singular circumstances of this particular case most murders are simple its true simple sordid violent crimes of passion greed or most likely alcohol this isnt anything like that there appears to be no love interest here nothing was stolen and if the murderer was drunk then he was an unusually thoughtful drunk who was very careful not to leave a trace of his presence in captain kuttners room its only an opinion at this stage however i have the feeling that someone is playing a game here possibly to embarrass general heydrich its true there are those who are jealous of heydrich admitted von eberstein possibly to embarrass all of you in which case i wonder that you can write off the czechs as possible culprits quite so quickly commissar perhaps youve forgotten how fond the three kings were of teasing the local gestapo one of them even left a provocative and embarrassing message in poor fleischers coat pocket and it strikes me that this is just the sort of stunt they might pull especially now when their organization is under threat if i were you id be trying to examine the backgrounds of the house staff in closer detail they may be in the ss but some of them have a germanczech background i wouldnt be at all surprised if that throws up something that wasnt found when they were checked the first time general von ebersteins got a point sir said kahlo it could be them thumbing their noses at us just like before and nothing would give those bastards more pleasure than to have us chasing our own tails i grinned thats what it feels like doesnt it i dont believe it said kahlo krautwickel i thought that was it after the potato soup that had real bacon in it and real potatoes too but this is even better i havent had krautwickel since the war started if this keeps up sir i might just have to kill someone myself just so that we keep this investigation going for a good while longer thats as good a motive for murder as any ive heard today i said i may even have to put you down on my list of suspects after that remark we were in the dining room but with heydrich and ploetz and some gestapo officers away in pursuit of vaclav moravek there were fewer of us for lunch at the lower castle than there had been for dinner at my direction kahlo and i were seated at the opposite end of the table from everyone else not because i disliked their company which of course i did but mostly because i wanted to avoid discussing the case with any of them besides i hoped that our position at the table would set us apart and help to remind the cauliflower that a murder investigation was being conducted doubtless that suited doctor jury very well and probably general hildebrandt too who following their interviews now regarded me as they would have regarded a large and verminous dog another reason i wanted to sit apart from the ss cauliflower was to give me a chance to get to know kurt kahlo who to my surprise i liked more than i had ever expected to like anyone at heydrichs house why do they call mannheim the chequerboard because its the most regularly built city in germany thats why the city centre is divided into one hundred and thirtysix neat squares and the blocks of houses are only distinguished by letters and numerals my dad used to live at k he was a factory foreman at daimler but he got hit hard by the inflation me and my brother had to go to work to help supplement the family income and so that we could stay on at school if that doesnt sound like a contradiction you married five years to eva she works at a local hotel which one the park any good too pricey for me i was in the hotel business for a while i was the house bull at the adlon nice how does eva like the hotel business she likes it the guests can be a bit much sometimes especially the english at least when they were still coming to germany they used to try it on a bit and give themselves airs you know sounds a lot like this place yeah kahlo looked sideways at the cauliflower howd you come to know general heydrich the way you know a dangerous dog most of the time i just cross the road or walk the other way when i see him coming but sometimes he corners me and i have to humour him or end up badly bitten really im like one of those four animals on his way to the town of bremen a donkey probably and like the donkey id just like to live without an owner and become a musician what instrument do you play nothing of course whoever heard of a donkey that could play a musical instrument but i seem to be in the robbers house all the same just like in the story kahlo grinned its not what youd call a relaxing place is it some of these bastards would frighten himmler himself he shook his head i almost feel sorry for captain kuttner almost i met him remember what did you think of him kahlo shrugged hardly matters now does it hes dead if you think thats going to save you from telling everything to your barber youre wrong all right i thought he was an arrogant little prick like all these fucking adjutants he thought he was more than just his masters voice he turned up at kripo headquarters here in prague a few days ago demanding this and that and as soon as possible my boss willy abendschoen had to deal with him and that meant to some extent i did too a right little cunt he was a few days ago monday heydrich wanted a report on something specifically ota transmission intercepts ota is the codeword for all the intercepts you mean radio broadcasts to the british by the czechos no no thats what made this interesting the czechos were receiving broadcasts and whats more from somewhere in the fatherland intelligence tipoffs abendschoen reckoned that the czechos were sending the information on to benes in london so that he could boost his standing with churchill and the tommy intelligence community a czech spy in germany kahlo shook his head no a german spy in germany as im sure you know theres nothing worse than that im not entirely privy to all of this you understand sir it goes well above my pay grade but here in prague the word on the cobbles is that theres a highlevel traitor in berlin whos behind the ota transmissions whos been feeding the czechos with topgrade information about reich policy on a number of things heydrich wanted everything we had on ota so that he could hand it all over to a special search group hes setting up inside the sd the traitor x group its called or vxg for short catching moravek the third of the three kings is just half the game you catch him then you stand a better chance of identifying traitor x yes i see i think im going to need to know more about kuttners movements in the days leading up to his death very good sir but right now all ive got are his movements in the hours leading up to his death lets hear them we sat back in our chairs as the ss waiters cleared away kahlo found his notebook and flicked through several pages until a wet thumb found his place he was about to read when the waiters returned with dessert kahlos eyes were out on stalks thats mishmash he said groaning with anticipated pleasure with real cherrysauce i tasted the sauce actually its cranberry i said no he breathed ill eat while you talk kahlo looked at his shredded pancake pudding licked his lips and hesitated you wont finish all that sauce will you sir no of course not now lets hear it reluctantly kahlo started to read out his notes yesterday lunchtime you know about because you were here according to elisabeth schreck heydrichs secretary at three pm kuttner made a couple of telephone calls one to carl maria strasse sorry sir thats kripo hq and one to the pecek palace gestapo hq at around four you saw him again sir on the road to the upper castle at five he spent an hour in general heydrichs office i dont yet know what that was about then he went to his room kritzinger saw him go through the door at eight oclock there were drinks in the library and then all of you listened to the leaders speech on the radio fleischers telephone call from gestapo headquarters was put through just after nine and thats when you saw kuttner outside having an argument with captain kluckholn do you know what that was about sir not yet kuttner helps to bring some champagne into the library after the speech and after that things are understandably vague just after one am there is some sort of altercation between kuttner and general henlein and colonel bohme im not quite sure what that was about general henlein made a pass at one of the maids her name is rosa steffel kuttner was her champion i see then hes in heydrichs office for a while with the general and colonel jacobi kahlo lowered his voice hes the one who i find to be the most sinister of the lot then kritzinger sees kuttner just before two and wishes him a good night says he seemed dogtired kahlo made a note of that and then continued reading his notes at six oclock this morning kuttner fails to awaken captain pomme as arranged nothing new there he often overslept because he was taking sleeping pills at sixthirty pomme says hes still knocking on kuttners door trying to awaken him at sixfortyfive pomme goes to fetch kritzinger to see if theres some other means of opening the door which is locked from the inside there isnt kritzinger tells one of the footmen to go and fetch a ladder and see if he cant get in from the outside and did he yes but the ladder was locked up and the footman had to go and fetch the gardener so it was sevenfifteen am by the time he brought it around to the window coming back a bit though at seven am heydrich is also outside kuttners door and thats when he tells pomme and the butler to break it down entering the room they find kuttner dead and captain pomme is dispatched to fetch doctor jury jury arrives in the room just as the footman arrives with the ladder we shall want to speak to that footman maybe he saw something his name is fendler sir then at seventhirty i get the call from ploetz in my room at the imperial and at eightthirty we viewed the scene of the crime what were you doing at the imperial anyway why werent you staying here in your room sir i was sleeping what do you know about veronal its barbital sleeping pills take too many and you dont wake up thats about it really ever use them yourself the wife did shed been working nights at the park and couldnt sleep in the day so the doctor gave her some veronal but she didnt care for the stuff at all they always left her feeling like shed been coshed strong then very kuttner goes to bed at around two am having told the butler that he intended to take some sleeping pills nobody sees him enter his room im not sure if id take sleeping pills knowing i had to be up at six observed kahlo then again you do get used to them so its possible he didnt see that as a problem which may be why he doesnt undress for bed hes still dressed when we found him looked like he took one boot off and then got tired or dead so then maybe he was shot before he entered his room in the corridor but i was shaking my head even as i said it sure after hes shot and by the way nobody hears the shot perhaps the murderer used a sound suppressor for a p hasnt been invented yet so after hes shot in the corridor and no one hears anything he staggers along to his room without mentioning it to anyone or shouting for help locks the door carefully behind him as you do when youve just been shot lies down on the bed just to get his breath back removes a boot and then dies sometime between two and fivethirty am its a mystery isnt it no not really i solve this kind of case all the time usually in the penultimate chapter i like to keep the last few pages for restoring some sort of normality to the world you know what i reckon sir i reckon that if you solve this case heydrich will probably promote you thats what im worried about and then you wont ever get to bremen to live there without an owner shut up and eat your mishmash kahlos mention of the traitor x group and a toplevel spy in germany who had been transmitting information to the czechos got me wondering about arianne and her friend gustav the man she claimed to have met in the jockey bar a smooth type with a thin prick accent and spats or so she had described him a civil servant with a gold cigarette holder and a little gold eagle in his lapel a man whose nerves had prevented him from meeting franz koci a former lieutenant of czech artillery and possibly one of the last members of the three kings group operating in berlin at least he had been until a collision with a taxi cab in the blackout had terminated his career as a spy was it possible that gustav and heydrichs traitor x were one and the same person arianne struck me as an unlikely sort of spy after all hadnt she confessed to being gustavs unwitting courier before i had told her that i was a cop and having told her i was a commissar from the alex what kind of spy was it who instead of disappearing the very next day chose to begin a relationship with someone who very probably ought to have seen it as his duty to inform the gestapo about her what kind of spy was it who was prepared to risk so much for so little after all i was privy to no secret information she could have passed to anyone surely she was just what she seemed to be a goodtime girl with a dead husband and a brother who was a kennel hound with the field military police id checked him out too what else did she want but a chance to see a bit of what life had to offer before the nazis turned her into yet another dutiful little german wife producing children for her firstclass rabbit medal the honour cross for the german mother all the same now that i knew about the local sds vxg it had become very obvious that bringing arianne along to prague for my own pleasure had helped put her in considerable danger and it seemed imperative that she return to berlin as soon as possible it was while i was deciding to send arianne back to berlin that i remembered major ploetz had given me a letter forwarded from the alex sitting in the morning room with a coffee and a cigarette awaiting the next senior officer on my list i read it the letter was from a girl i knew in paris her name was bettina and she worked at the lutetia hotel id stayed there during my posting to the french capital i had fixed her up with a better job at the adlon and she was writing to thank me and to tell me that she would be coming to berlin before christmas she hoped to see me then she wrote a lot of other things besides and since i didnt get many letters least of all from attractive girls i read it again i even passed it under my nose a couple of times as it seemed to be scented then again that might have been my own imagination i was reading the letter a third time when kahlo ushered general henlein into the morning room henlein wore round metallicframed glasses that flashed in the firelight like newly minted coins his hair was dark and wavy but the wave was on the ebbflow his mouth was sulky and facially he was not unlike doctor jury it was hard to connect this yearold from maffesdorf and the leader of the sudeten german movement with the vigorous gymnastics teacher described by ariannes girl friend at the imperial kahlo handed me the plan of the house that kritzinger had given him and while henlein made himself comfortable i glanced over it briefly and for the moment noted only that henlein had occupied the room immediately next to captain kuttners kahlo sat down on the piano stool henlein seated on the sofa opposite me picked some fluff off his breeches checked the cutlery on his tunic lapel another war merit cross with swords and smiled nervously several times he had good teeth ill say that for him they were the only vigorouslooking thing about him let me say something before we go any further he spoke quietly as if he was used to being listened to its no secret that i was blue last night i think we all were after the leaders speech and the good news about the three kings he paused for a moment as if waiting for me to agree with him but i didnt say anything i just lit another cigarette and let him hang there momentarily discomfited he swallowed noticeably and then continued toward the end of the evening i believe i may have made certain remarks to the unfortunate captain kuttner that i now regret they were spoken in the heat of the moment and under the influence of alcohol i have never been much of a drinker alcohol does not agree with my constitution i try to keep myself fit you understand as all of us should who are in the ss it is an elite after all and a higher standard is expected of us not just physically but in matters of behaviour too consequently it seems to me that my own behaviour was not all that it could have been and in retrospect the poor captain was quite right to remonstrate with me indeed it is very much to that officers credit that he did so of course when i heard what had happened i was shocked and saddened i deeply regret this brave young officers passing and also the fact that i was unable to apologize to him in person in my own defence i should like to reiterate that it is quite out of character for me to behave in such an inappropriate fashion but the circumstances of his death being what they are i feel it is incumbent on me to state upon my word as a german officer that i did not shoot captain kuttner nor do i have any knowledge of his death after returning to my own room at around two oclock this morning i have very little knowledge of anything except that i went to bed and awoke with a filthy hangover it was after nine when major ploetz informed me of what had happened and explained that you were handling the official inquiry at the request of general heydrich and let me assure you commissar gunther that i will cooperate with your investigation in any way i can im sure that this cant be easy for you i appreciate your candour almost to my amusement henlein got up to leave i let him get as far as the door before throwing a grappling hook after him however there are a few questions i should like to ask you henlein smiled again this time the smile was sarcastic do i take it that you intend to crossexamine me you would have thought he was hitler himself the way henlein pronounced that personal pronoun i shrugged if thats what you want to call it but look here im only taking you at your word you just offered to cooperate with my investigation in any way you can or am i mistaken i know what i said commissar gunther he said crisply his glasses flashing angrily as his head moved with jerky indignation i assumed that my word as a german officer and not just any german officer would suffice he straightened a little and put his fists on his hipbones as if challenging me to knock him over i wouldnt have minded punching him on the nose at that if only to find out for myself how vigorous he really was youre quite right sir i paused to achieve the full amount of mockery that was implied in my next remark that was an assumption im afraid and it isnt correct as you also said yourself general heydrich has authorized me to handle an official inquiry and that does necessitate my asking a lot of questions some of which might very well sound impertinent to a man of your high standing but im afraid that cant be helped so perhaps youd like to sit down again ill try not to keep you too long henlein sat down and regarded me with some disfavour according to a plan i have here of all the officer accommodations in the lower castle which has been prepared by herr kritzinger you were in the room right next door to captain kuttner what of it i smiled patiently whenever a man is murdered i usually go and speak to his neighbours to ask if they heard or saw anything suspicious thats what of it henlein sighed and then leaned back against the cushion and made a little steeple out of his fingers which he tapped together with a pedants impatience werent you listening i already said i went to bed drunk i saw nothing and heard nothing youre sure about that henlein tutted loudly really this is too much i had assumed heydrich had chosen you because you were a detective now i find youre nothing but a stupid policeman i was getting tired of all this i was tired of a lot of things but being made to feel i was lucky to breathe the same air as the regional governor of the sudetenland was close to the top of the whole tiresome heap i decided to take heydrich at his word and dispense with good manners for me this was never particularly difficult but when i let go i took even myself by surprise i sprang to my feet and coming around the back of the sofa henlein was sitting on i pushed my jaw into his face listen you pompous shitcurl a man was murdered in that room and in case youd forgotten while you were sitting behind your nice desk on that lazy fat arse of yours guns make loud noises when you pull the trigger i clapped my hands hard in front of his nose they go bang and bang and bang and other people are supposed to do something about that noise when they hear it henlein was colouring now lip quivering in anger so dont give me what of it and make like you were a hundred miles away with a castiron alibi you were right next door to a man you had earlier threatened in front of several witnesses thats just a bricks width away from being in the same room with him see so you may be a senior officer you might even be a gentleman for all i know but youre also a goddamn suspect how dare you speak to me like that commissar gunther ask me that again i snarled back how dare you speak to me like that he stood up with the look of a man who was about to challenge me to a duel ive a very good mind to punch you on the nose he said i suppose that counts as brave coming from a man with that kind of tinfoil on his chest i pointed at his war merit cross i said flicking his party badge with my forefinger well im not scared i am going to make a point of breaking you commissar i am going to take great pleasure in making sure that by the time this weekend has ended you will be directing traffic on potsdamer platz ive never been insulted like this in all my years as a german officer how dare you henlein walked toward the morning room door that deserves an answer general ill tell you how you see i know all about your little friend on the top floor of the imperial hotel betty isnt it betty kipsdorf apparently you and she get along very well and why not shes a real sweet girl from what i hear henlein had stopped in his tracks as if commanded to do so on a parade ground by a particularly tough drill sergeant i havent seen her myself but my source tells me she thinks youre very vigorous somehow i doubt she means that you and she like to go for energetic walks in the countryside and i do wonder how our host will greet the news that dear betty is a jew he turned slowly and then sat down on a chair by the door like a man awaiting a doctors appointment he took off his glasses and turned several shades of white before settling on the colour of a goats cheese that seemed to reflect the greenish wallpaper yes sit down good move general how did you find out he whispered for one glorious moment i thought i was about to hear a confession of murder about the girl you idiot im a cop not a brass monkey if youre going to keep a joylady in a hotel then make sure shes the kind of girl who can keep her peep shut it was good advice i hoped i was paying attention to it myself the spectacles in his hand were trembling four years later while being held by the americans at the military barracks in pilsen konrad henlein would use the glass in those spectacles to cut open his veins and kill himself but for now they were just a pair of harmless trembling specs then he started to cry which was tough because id put him through all of that without the least suspicion hed shot captain kuttner you get a feel for these things henlein was a lot of things a pompous ass a nazi agitator a womanizer but he wasnt a murderer it takes a lot of nerve to pull the trigger on a man in cold blood and if his tears proved anything it was that he didnt have what it takes relax were not going to tell anyone are we kurt i went over to the piano and offered kahlo a cigarette he took one stood up and lit us both no sir he said your little secret is quite safe with us general provided of course that you cooperate of course ill do anything you want anything but i am telling you the truth herr commissar i didnt kill the captain its as i told you i was drunk i went to bed around two even thats a blur im afraid im only aware of what i said to the unfortunate captain because one of my brother officers drew it to my attention this morning i feel terrible about what happened but the first i knew that captain kuttner was dead was when major ploetz came and told me this morning im not the type of person to kill anyone honestly im almost a vegetarian like the leader you know its true i do have a gun its in my room but i am certain its never been fired while its been in my possession i can fetch it now if you like and then perhaps you can check for yourself i believe that we have scientists in police laboratories who can determine such things somewhere during the course of henleins miserable pleading speech i stopped listening i stared at the keys of the piano for a moment and then i stared out of the window all the while wondering what the hell i was doing with my life at least the cigarette tasted good id reacquired a taste for good tobacco and i told myself that when this was all over and heydrich had kuttners murderer i was probably going to have to get used to the ration line again and three johnnies a day because i had the strong feeling that finding kuttners killer was going to impact upon my becoming heydrichs bodyguard after all i couldnt see how i was going to keep a job like that when id finished insulting all of his closest colleagues at least that was my earnest hope then kahlo was talking again and henlein was answering him and it was another moment or two before i realized that the subject had changed we were no longer speaking about captain kuttner or even betty kipsdorf but something entirely different your friend heinz rutha said kahlo the furniture designer he hanged himself in prison didnt he in wasnt it yes said henlein because he was queer too i wouldnt know about that is that why you decided to work for admiral canaris and the abwehr because of what happened to your friend because you held the nazis responsible for that i dont know what youre talking about but maybe not just canaris eh maybe because of that you went to work for the british maybe youre a british spy maybe youve always been a british spy general henlein you help to destabilize the czech sudetenland for hitler while all the time youre really working for the tommies good cover id have thought i mean it doesnt get better than that does it frankly i cant really say that i blame you the way you were passed over first by frank and then by heydrich youve every reason to feel aggrieved havent you sir so how about it are you spying for the tommies please henlein looked desperately at me i really dont know anything about this neither do i i said im no more a spy than i am a murderer says you said kahlo thats quite enough i told kahlo suppose we let the gestapo find out persisted kahlo suppose we were to hand you over to sergeant soppa youve heard of him havent you general hes the specialist they brought in to question the three kings i havent seen him in action myself but apparently he uses this technique he calls the bascule they strap you onto a wooden board just like the one they use on a guillotine thank you general henlein that will be all for now sir kahlo was still speaking only now i was talking over him not only that but i had henlein by the arm and i was steering him out to the door of the morning room if theres anything else you think we need to know then please dont hesitate to contact me sir as for your friend at the imperial my advice would be to get her out of there find somewhere else for your trysts an apartment perhaps but not a hotel general if i know about betty it wont be long before someone else does too yes i understand thank you herr commissar thank you very much indeed henlein glanced uncertainly at kahlo and then he was gone i closed the door behind him and for a moment or two kahlo and i faced each other in awkward silence what the hell was all that about you heard i guess i did at that you had him on the ropes kahlo shrugged it seemed a pity not to take advantage of that sir i thought that there might never be a better opportunity to ask him some questions that needed asking its those questions that im interested in kurt you see i thought i was supposed to kick the ball only it turns out that youre allowed to pick it up and run with it that makes me wonder what kind of game were playing here kahlo looked sheepish were on the same side sir thats all that matters isnt it actually i wonder about that too this vxg the traitor x group you mentioned the one that heydrich was setting up to find the highlevel spy whos been giving information to the czechos you wouldnt be part of that group would you kurt didnt i say you know you damn well didnt i should have thought it was obvious after what i told you over lunch about the vxg about how captain kuttner came down to kripo hq to brief us about it how would i have known about those ota radio intercepts if i wasnt part of the group that stuff is highly sensitive by rights i shouldnt have told you about that at all so what else havent you told me frankly i thought that enjoying general heydrichs confidence as you do you knew about traitor x yourself that you knew that and that you knew what that everyone in this house is under suspicion of being traitor x yes sir i assumed you would certainly know that much at least i shook my head let me get this straight everyone in this house is suspected of being a spy for the czechos kahlo nodded i dont think you are and i know im not and im damned sure heydrich isnt or his three adjutants everyone else well theres a question mark against everyone else yes he shrugged im sorry sir i really thought you knew about all this i didnt well thats hardly my fault is it i just do what im fucking told its up to heydrich what he tells you not me im just a criminal assistant he kissed his cigarette and continued maybe it slipped his mind maybe he assumed that i would tell you which i have when we were discussing a possible motive for someone murdering captain kuttner no sir he said firmly you never discussed that with me you discussed that with general henlein well dont you think you might have mentioned it before now in passing i mean if someone suspects you of being a spy then that would be a pretty powerful fucking motive for murder dont you think maybe kuttner was onto someone in this house maybe thats why he was killed but why should i have to know about that im just the investigating detective jesus i feel like a parrot with a cloth over my cage try to look at it from my point of view commissar kuttner turns up at prague kripo on monday several of us are picked out to join heydrichs traitor x group but kuttner tells us that on no account are we to talk about this to anyone its all topsecret he says anyone opens his pie hole about this group to anyone the reward is a ticket on the partisan express then he gets killed and youre in charge of the investigation heydrichs clever dick thats what ploetz says christ thats what everyone says and the way you speak to the general like you had a special licence how am i to know that youre not fully in the picture sir im used to being told this but not that see im just a footsoldier sir all this fucking cauliflower im not familiar with it and im certainly not used to hearing them getting roughed up by a mere captain like you everyone in the house i repeated dumbly more or less like i said its everyone except me and you and the adjutants and heydrich of course theres a list see of suspects i havent got a copy myself but i can remember who was on it and henleins name was certainly one of them i poured myself a cup of coffee and sipped it thoughtfully hildebrandt kahlo nodded but hes an old friend of heydrichs i said to say nothing of the fact that hes an old friend of hitler von eberstein what about him is he suspected too kahlo nodded again but how how can they be under suspicion that little gold party badge is supposed to mean something i only know what ive been told and thats not everything hildebrandt is a suspect because for two years from until he was in america while he was there he went bankrupt as a farmer but someone paid off all his debts and then helped to set him up as a bookseller in new york the suspicion in the sd is that it was the british secret service and that it was them who persuaded him to return to germany and join the ss in to spy for the british von eberstein was a banker after the war and a bit of a weekend nazi if you know what i mean he actually quit the party after the putsch which automatically makes him suspect for three years he had no party affiliation at all and during this time he goes from being a banker with the commerce and private bank to running his wifes factory in gotha but when that goes belly up his debts are paid off anonymously and he starts a travel agency that business takes him to london for much of and but by hes back in the party again so did the tommies set him up with the travel agency and train him to operate a radio while he was in london thats the sort of thing heydrich wants to know kahlo grinned and wagged his finger you see how easy it is to fall under suspicion and it doesnt matter who you are or how high up in the party you have flown doctor jury is a suspect because before he joined the austrian nazi party in he attended several medical conferences in paris and london while he was in paris he had an affair with a woman who also had an affair with a french colonel in their intelligence service also his friendship with martin bormann automatically makes him a suspect in himmlers eyes since it seems himmler would love to discredit any friend of bormanns in the eyes of hitler general frank is a suspect because of something his exwife anna has told her new husband doctor kollner he succeeded frank as the deputy governor of the sudetenland and he has made certain allegations based on what anna kollner told him about his loyalty to the leader and also because his new wife karola blaschek is suspected of having contact with several czech resistance figures she comes from the local town of brux and theres a suspicion that some of her friends and relations in that town may have been part of uvod the home resistance what about von neurath not him surely he was the foreign minister for christs sake konstantin von neurath is suspected of being recruited as a british spy as early as when he served as a diplomat at the german embassy in london or possibly when he was at the german embassy in denmark in while he was german ambassador to london in he came under the suspicion of the abwehr but he was cleared after an investigation but in the abwehr was burgled by a special ss team and certain papers were removed that showed the whole investigation to have been a sham subsequent to this von neurath joined the nazi party for the first time as a sign of his loyalty as if he suddenly needed to underline his loyalty instead of which it seems to have put him under suspicion kahlo stubbed out his cigarette and helped himself to coffee but he wasnt yet finished and thats possibly the reason major thummel is suspected of being the traitor x he was in charge of the abwehr section that was supposed to have investigated von neurath he may be a friend of heinrich himmler and he may wear a gold party badge but hes also a close friend of the abwehrs boss admiral canaris who is himmlers most bitter rival heydrichs too lets see now who else was on that list brigadier voss he commands the ss officer school at beneschau until he was in charge of the officers training school at bad tolz where theres a powerful radio transmitter when officers from that school were mobilized for the invasion of czechoslovakia in someone tipped off the czech intelligence service about it voss was one of only a handful of people who knew the invasion was about to happen hes also a keen amateur radio enthusiast who better to broadcast secrets to the czechos he even speaks the language walter jacobi was dismissed from the sd in by his then boss general werner lorenz im afraid i dont know why in the spring of he took a holiday in marienbad in the sudetenland coincidentally perhaps or perhaps not one of the other guests taking the cure at the spa was a retired british naval commander who is currently believed to be the head of an operational czech section within the british sis after his holiday jacobi rejoined the sd guilt by association possibly kahlo nodded henlein well you heard what i said to him and fleischers been under suspicion for a while now because of his failure to arrest the third of the three kings you probably know as much about that as i do its common knowledge that the czechos were making a fool of him for a while the rest of the cauliflower i really dont remember or i dont know your guess is as good as mine i doubt that very much i said and by the way what happened to im keen to learn and you have my full cooperation and its a puzzle sir you dont think its a puzzle of course it is i just dont much like the fact youve had one of the pieces in your trouser pocket all along and i dont suppose youve ever kept your mouth shut about something kahlo shook his head come on sir we both know that saying one thing and thinking another is what this job is all about tell me its not like that for you go on i found myself silent tell me that youve told me everything that theres something youre not keeping from me still i didnt answer how could i when arianne was back at the hotel if id told him less than half of what i knew about arianne tauber there was no telling what might happen to her kahlo grinned no i thought not you see when it comes right down to it commissar i reckon your piss is just as yellow as mine i sighed and fetched myself a brandy from the decanter suddenly i felt very tired and i knew the brandy wasnt going to help maybe youre right look sir you want to know what i think i think we should go through the motions of trying to find kuttners killer just like you were told to do we ask the right questions we do our duty right like regular cops thats all we can do and its pointless thinking we can do any more than that but when it comes right down to it what does it fucking matter eh you tell me who cares who killed the bastard not me not you from what i heard he did his own fair share of murder out east and the chances are he had it coming probably we all do but whats one more murder eh one tiny drop in a very tall glass of beer thats what it is take my advice sir dont sweat it enjoy the free forage and the booze and the cigarettes for as long as we can eh maybe thats the spirit sir and who knows maybe well get lucky even a blind chicken finds the corn now and again i needed a walk and some fresh air after all that information although it might have been the brandy and the mishmash i went around the house to the little winter garden that kuttners room looked out on inside the glass house was a fountain shaped like a shrine with a water nymphs head spouting water and above him a bronze statue of a centaur with a winged cherub on his back on either side of the fountain was a veritable jungle of sago palms and geraniums it seemed an odd place to find a centaur or a cherub but i wasnt surprised at anything any more the water nymph could have told me my fortune lay in farming guinea pigs and i wouldnt have batted an eyelid anything looked like a better bet than being a detective in jungfernbreschan a ladder lay on the ground and assuming that this was probably the one kritzinger had ordered fendler the footman to fetch around to captain kuttners window i spent the next ten minutes propping it up against the wall of the house then i climbed up to take a look at the window ledge but that told me only that the glass roof needed cleaning that the sun was still strong for the first week in october and that i was not at all certain to kill myself cleanly if i threw myself from the top i descended the ladder and found one of the footmen waiting at the bottom fendler sir he said unprompted herr kritzinger saw you were out here and sent me to see if i could be of any assistance sir he was not far off being two metres tall he wore a white mess jacket with ss collar patches a white shirt a black tie black trousers a white apron and grey oversleeves as if he might have been cleaning something before receiving his order from the butler to wait on me he was lumpish in appearance with an expression that suggested he was none too bright but id gladly have changed places with him polishing silver or removing the ash from a fireplace looked like more rewarding work than the domestic task i had been set youre the one who kritzinger told to fetch the ladder to look in captain kuttners window are you not thats right sir and what did you see when eventually you got up there by the way what time was that do you think about a quarter past seven sir i tugged my shirt off the sweat on my chest i was about to ask you why it took so long to fetch a ladder and prop it up against the window but i think i know the answer to that already its heavy yes sir but it wasnt in the winter garden like it is now sir thats right it was locked up wasnt it bruno the gardener bruno kopkow he helped me carry it around here and prop it up how did you know which window to choose kritzinger told me it was the room overlooking the winter garden sir and to be careful i didnt drop it on the glass roof sir so you prop the ladder up against the window then what tell me everything you saw and did fendler shrugged we kopkow and i we heard a loud bang sir and then just as i was stepping on the lowest rung sir general heydrich looks out of the window and seeing me and bruno tells us that theres no need to bother coming up now as they had just broken down the captains bedroom door and what did you say if anything i asked him if everything was all right and he said that it wasnt because it looked as if captain kuttner had probably killed himself with an overdose then what did you do we took the ladder down and left it where you found it sir just in case anyone decided they needed it again how did he seem the general a bit upset i suppose like you would be sir he and the captain were friends i believe the footman paused i knew he must be upset because he was smoking a cigarette usually the general doesnt smoke at all in the morning and never before he fences sir mostly he only smokes in the evening hes very disciplined that way sir i glanced up at the window of kuttners room and nodded i dont doubt it will there be anything else sir no thats all thank you i went back to the morning room kahlo was waiting for me police commissar trott telephoned while you were out sir from the alex he said to tell you that he went to see lothar ott at captain kuttners apartment in petalozzi strasse and told him that the captain was dead apparently ott wept like a baby the commissars exact words that would seem to confirm it wouldnt you say that the captain was warm i nodded it only confirmed what i already knew whod have thought it said kahlo i mean the fellow seemed quite normal in a lot of ways like you or me really i guess thats the point that maybe they are just like you or me speak for yourself sir i used to think like you but the nazis have taught me to think differently ill say that for them these days i say live and let live and if we can learn to do that then maybe we can behave like a civilized country again but i suspect its already too late for that i glanced at my wristwatch a cheap bulova it had two ways to remind me that we had an autopsy to view at the bulovka hospital at four and that only one of them was the time come on i said to kahlo wed better get going youre about to discover just how like you and me albert kuttner really was sergeant klein had returned from hradschin palace in prague to drive us out to the hospital hed read the leaders sports palast speech in the morning newspaper and instead of depressing him hitlers facts and figures had left him feeling optimistic about our prospects in the east two and a half million russian prisoners he said no country could ever recover from losing that many men if that was all it would be enough but as well fourteen thousand russian planes have been shot down and eighteen thousand of their tanks destroyed its hard to imagine and yet the leader still believes we have a fight on our hands i remarked because hes wise insisted klein hes saying that so as not to raise our hopes in case the impossible should happen but its obvious the ivans are as good as beaten thats what i think lets hope youre right said kahlo i hate to think what were going to do with two and a half million russian prisoners if hes wrong i said if it comes to that i hate to think what were going to do with them if hes right i paused for a moment before adding what was sometimes called the political postscript something that was usually said for the purposes of selfpreservation not that i expect him to be wrong of course and i dont doubt that the leader will be delivering a victory speech in moscow before very long then i bit off the end of my tongue and spat it onto the road only i did it subtly so that klein didnt notice set on a hill overlooking the northeast of the city bulovka hospital was a four or fivestorey building made of beigecoloured stone with a red mansard roof and a greenish little belltower that stuck up in the air like an infected finger built before the great war the hospital was surrounded with lush gardens where recuperating patients could sit on wooden benches enjoy the many blooms in the flower beds and generally appreciate the democratic ideals of the sovereign state of czechoslovakia at least they could have done when there had still been a sovereign state of czechoslovakia like every other public building in prague the hospital was now flying the flag of the least democratic european state since vlad the third impaled his first wallachian boyar klein drew up in front of the entrance two men wearing surgical gowns were already waiting for us which only seemed excessively servile until you remembered heydrichs reputation for obsessive punctuality and ruthless cruelty one of the men was honek the czech doctor who had attended the crime scene at the lower castle earlier that day he introduced the other man a handsome germanczech in his early forties this is professor herwig hamperl said honek who is most distinguished in the field of forensic medicine he has kindly agreed to take charge of this autopsy thank you sir i said swiftly as if he wanted us to be gone and out of his hair as quickly as possible hamperl muttered a curt good afternoon and led the way upstairs and along a wide bright corridor with walls that showed the grimy blank squares where signs and posters written in czech had been displayed until german became the official language of bohemia hamperl might have been a german czech but i soon discovered he was no nazi has either of you two gentlemen attended an autopsy before he asked yes i said many this is my first said kahlo and youre feeling nervous about it perhaps a little being dead is like being a whore said hamperl you spend most of your time on your back while someone else in this case me gets on with the business in hand the procedure can seem embarrassing sometimes even a little preposterous but it is never disgusting my advice to anyone who hasnt witnessed an autopsy before is to try to see only the lighter side of things if it starts to seem disgusting then thats the cue to leave the room before an accident occurs the smell of a dead body is usually quite bad enough without the smell of vomit to cope with is that clear yes sir hamperl unlocked a wooden door with smoked windows and led us into an autopsy suite where a stoutlooking body lay under a sheet on a slab as hamperl started to draw back the sheet to reveal kuttners head and shoulders i saw kahlos eyes widen jesus he muttered i dont remember his stomach being that big hamperl paused i can assure you its not big with fat he said the man might be dead but the enzymes and bacteria in his belly are still very much alive and feeding on whatever still remains in his stomach probably last nights dinner in the process these enzymes and bacteria produce gas here let me demonstrate hamperl pressed hard on the sheet still covering kuttners stomach which caused the body to fart loudly see what i mean hamperls behaviour was a piece of crude theatre that seemed intended to make us feel uncomfortable in a way i didnt blame him for this at all the nazis were past masters at making others feel uncomfortable doubtless the professor was just paying us back in kind a fart from a dead nazi was as eloquent a comment on the german presence in czechoslovakia as i was ever likely to hear or indeed smell but kahlo winced noticeably and then bit his lip as he tried vainly to steady his nerves hamperl collected a long sharp curette off a neatly prepared instrument table and held it at arms length like a conductors baton the light from the abbeysized windows caught the flat of the curette and it glittered like a bolt of lightning instinctively kahlo turned away and noting his discomfort at the symphony of destruction he was about to begin hamperl grinned wolfishly exchanged a meaningful look with doctor honek and said theres one thing you can say about the dead my dear fellow they have an extraordinary ability to deal with pain any pain no matter how bad it might seem to you believe me this poor fellow wont feel a thing as i seem to do my absolute worst much worse than perhaps you have ever seen inflicted on any human being before however do try not to let your imagination run away with you the most terrible thing that could happen to this man happened several hours before he arrived in this hospital kahlo shook his head and swallowed loudly which sounded as if a very large frog had taken up residence in his throat im sorry sir he said to me i just cant do this i really cant he covered his mouth and left the room quickly poor fellow said hamperl but probably its just as well hes gone we need all our attention for the task that now lies before us surely that was your intention i said to scare him off not at all commissar you heard me try to reassure him didnt you however its not everyone who can witness this procedure with a cool head are you sure about yourself oh i have no feelings at all professor hamperl none whatsoever im like that curette in your hand cold and hard and best handled with extreme care just one slip would be most unfortunate do i make myself clear quite clear commissar hamperl threw back the remainder of the sheet covering kuttners body and went quickly to work having photographed the two entry wounds on the dead mans chest and then probed them both first with his finger and then with a length of dowel he made a yshaped incision from kuttners porcelainpale shoulders across his hairless chest and down to the pubic area which unusually appeared to have been shaved and recently too hamperl remarked upon this well you dont see that every day not even in my profession i wonder why he should have done this ive a good idea i said but it will wait hamperl nodded then he was cutting through subcutaneous fat and muscle and the speed of his scalpel was something to behold with the flesh swiftly shrugged off the bone like the skin of a very large snake and within only a few minutes there was just a mess of intestines and prime rib that might have been the envy of any good berlin butcher especially in wartime there appears to be something lodged at the top of the oropharynx said hamperl he looked up at me and added thats the part of the throat just behind the mouth he collected a small white object flicked it off his fingers ends into a kidney dish and then held it up for our joint inspection it appears to be a troche perhaps he said and then no this was not designed to dissolve in the throat but in the stomach it has hardly dissolved at all a pilule a tablet perhaps he was taking veronal i said a barbiturate is that so hamperls voice was dripping with sarcasm well then that is probably what it is only it could not have affected him very much in the condition you see it in now although this would be quite consistent with a case of overdose where someone has swallowed several pills all at once doctor honek said there was initially some suspicion that this might have been a barbiturate overdose thats right i said until i found the bullet wounds quite at an almost imperceptible nod from professor hamperl doctor honek stepped forward with a set of surgical bolt cutters and began to cut the ribs which under the steel jaws snapped loudly like thick twigs one by one in order to expose the chest cavity but there was one he hesitated to cut one of these ribs looks damaged dont you think so sir asked honek hamperl bent down to take a closer look chipped he said like a tooth but not from a veronal pilule most probably from a bullet honek went back to work he was even quicker than the professor and within a couple of minutes hamperl was slicing through the remains of the diaphragm and reflecting back the whole chestplate like the top of a boiled egg to expose the dead mans heart and the lungs quite a lot of blood has pooled inside the diaphragm he murmured by now albert kuttner was hardly recognizable as a human being his intestines most of them were resting on the upturned palm of his own hand as if like the perfect aidedecamp he had possibly hoped to become he might assist even in the process of his own dissection hamperl placed the chestplate on a nearby table where it remained like the remains of a christmas goose i cleared my nose noisily commissar are you all right im just trying to see the lighter side of things that you were talking about earlier sir good but the professor sounded almost disappointed that i was not yet lying on the floor cutting the pulmonary artery he said to honek checking for blood clots which we have probably a postmortem bloodclot he slashed some more of the lungs and then squeezed the heart feels like something hard in here a bullet probably see if you can find it will you doctor honek he handed the heart to the other man and got to work with the scalpel again slashing at the flesh holding what looked like a shiny red football the liver is it i asked very good commissar gunther the liver it is hamperl laid the liver in another dish before removing the spleen as well looks like this got hit too he said its almost in pieces i went over to the table where honek was still palpating the heart to isolate the bullet and glanced briefly at the spleen its a mess all right that certainly covers all of whats in the medical dictionary observed hamperl honek had isolated the bullet he cut it out and laid it in a separate metal tray like a goldprospector putting aside a precious nugget this was easier on the eye than watching hamperl clamp kuttners small intestine so that he could haul it out in one block id seen one too many of my comrades in the freezing cold of the trenches with their steaming guts hanging out of their tunics to view that particular sight with any equanimity so far we had been there for less than thirty minutes and already the kidneys were being removed the second bullet was lodged deep in the spine and took several minutes to gouge out when that was done hamperl asked do you wish me to remove the brain no i dont think it will be necessary then that would appear to be that for now he shrugged of course it will take a while to analyse the organs the haematology and the contents of the stomach naturally i will test the quantities of veronal present then at this moment in time i must ask you both not to make any verbal reference to a second bullet i said as far as anyone else is concerned just the one shot was fired am i to understand that you plan on using this subterfuge as the basis for some incriminating piece of crossexamination said the professor yes i said i am you can mention your real findings in your written report of course very well said the professor itll be our little secret until you say otherwise commissar when both bullets were lying in a tray i took a closer look id seen enough spent lead in my time to recognize metal from a thirtyeight when i saw it right now id be grateful if you were to indulge me with your first thoughts sir all right professor hamperl sighed and then thought for a moment both shots seem to have been fired at fairly close range he said of course i should have to check the shirt for powder burns to give you an accurate distance but the size of the entry wounds persuades me strongly that the shooter could not have been more than half a metre away when these shots were fired the angle of the entries would seem to indicate that the person who fired the shots was immediately in front of him the grouping of the shots was tight as if the two shots were fired in very quick succession before the victim moved very much if the shooter fired at only half a metres distance why didnt the slugs go straight through him one clipped the rib and lost most of its velocity before it penetrated the heart i shouldnt wonder hamperl said thoughtfully and the other lodged deep in the spine as you saw thats why as i say well have to see how much barbiturate was absorbed by his organs but on the basis of the organ damage and the amount of blood that was in the diaphragm id say it was the shots that killed him not the veronal what do you know about that stuff barbital its been around for a good while almost forty years it was first synthesized by two german chemists bayer sells the stuff as a soluble salt or in tablet form ten to fifteen grammes would be a safe dose but fifty or sixty could be lethal thats not much of a margin for error i said of course for someone using it regularly they would soon develop a tolerance of the drug and possibly require a higher dose which they might easily accommodate without any mishap but if they left off taking it for a while itd be a mistake to start again with a high dose possibly a lethal one so it has to be handled with care oh yes its powerful stuff my own sleep would have to be very disturbed to want to take it myself all the same its a lot better than its predecessor bromides theres no unpleasant taste with veronal in fact theres not much taste at all any side effects it would certainly affect the heart rate the pulse and the blood pressure and of course that would substantially affect the bleeding perhaps there would have been more blood exiting from the wounds if this man hadnt sedated himself as it is most of the blood from the wounds was in the diaphragm anything else you wouldnt want to mix the stuff with alcohol it reacts badly in the stomach ive seen cases of people who mixed it and were choked to death when they vomited in their sleep thank you will there be anything else i believe theres a way that you can find out if he was homosexual hamperl didnt bat an eyelid ah yes i see the shaven pubic area yes it is unusual for a man to shave himself down there it might indicate an effeminate inclination yes i see what you mean intriguing isnt it there were other things that make me think he might be homosexual i added things i cant tell you about but i would like to know for sure sometimes agreed hamperl in a habitual sodomite the anus becomes dilated it loses its natural puckered orifice and develops a thicker keratinized skin or even becomes like an open shutter on a camera i assume youre referring to that would you like me to take a look yes doctor honek would you help me to turn the cadaver over please the two men wrestled the gutted body onto what there was of its front and spread the dead mans buttocks after a moment or two hamperl started to shake his head the anus looks all right to me of course the fact that there has been no apparent interference doesnt indicate that he wasnt homosexual but i could always swab the anus for semen when i do some of the other tests and swab his penis for traces of faecal matter please do that hamperl was trying to conceal a gleeful triumphant smile an ss officer who was homosexual perhaps thats why he was murdered i cant imagine this sort of thing goes down well in berlin hamperl exchanged a look with doctor honek who was looking equally amused of course one hears things about berlin and transvestitism i nodded all the same if i were you i wouldnt mention this either the ss doesnt have much of a sense of humour about that sort of thing it would be a shame to find that out the hard way youll have my histological report on the organs and my pathological diagnosis in fortyeight hours commissar thanks again the professor escorted me to the door so commissar will you be leaving your own body to science do you think for medical students to use in the anatomy lab i glanced at the shambles that was a man i had been speaking to about a painting by gustav klimt at jungfernbreschan just twentyfour hours earlier no i dont think i will pity a man as tall as you must have a fine skeleton i sometimes think that the real fun stuff for our bodies doesnt start until were dead im already looking forward to it kahlo apologized again as klein drove us away from the hospital you get used to it i said not me not ever it was the smell of the ether that really got to me i think reminded me of when my mother died bad huh said klein kahlo shook his head but his expression told a different story and seeing it in his rearview mirror klein reached into the leather pocket on the inside of the drivers door and took out a silver flask i keep this for cold days he said and handed it to me it doesnt get much colder than that i said not for captain kuttner anyway i took a bite off the flask which was full of good schnapps and handed it back to kahlo that bastard kahlo upended the flask that bastard professor was enjoying it too my discomfort did you hear him sir the way he started laying it on i thought fuck this im off hes having a laugh at my expense that he was i said but a man has to take pleasure in his work where and when he can especially in this country i bent forward to the floor of the car lit a cigarette and handed it back to him there was a time when i took pleasure in my work too when i was good at it those were the days when the berlin murder squad was the best in the world when i was a real detective a professional what i didnt know about the science of murder wasnt worth knowing but now i shook my head now im just an amateur a rather quaint and oldfashioned amateur it was fivethirty in the afternoon and back in the library at the lower castle irritation and disappointment hung in the air like mustard gas ready to contaminate the lungs of all who were unfortunate enough to breathe it in ss and gestapo officers shook their heads and smoked furiously and looked around for someone to blame opinions were offered and rejected angrily and offered again until voices were raised and accusations made there appeared to be several of them in the library and while ultimately there was only one man whose opinion counted there were others who were determined not to be held responsible for the failure kahlo and i had crept into the morning room so as to avoid being drawn into these recriminations but we left the door wide open so that we could hear and increase our strength for a wise man is strong and a man who listens at doors increases his strength we let him slip through our fingers raged heydrich we have at our disposal the most powerful police force ever seen in this city and yet we dont seem to be able to catch one man its too early to give up hope sir this sounded like horst bohme the head of the sd in prague his berlin accent was instantly recognizable to me were continuing to conduct housetohouse searches for moravek and even now im certain that something will turn up we know his name said heydrich ignoring him we know what he looks like we even know hes somewhere in the city and yet we cant find him its a total bloody failure an embarrassment yes sir an opportunity thrown away gentlemen stormed heydrich however i suppose i shouldnt really be all that surprised given what happened here in may at the uvod safe house in what was the name of that dumb czecho street fleischer pod terebkov street sir said fleischer you had them all in your fucking hands yelled heydrich they were trapped in that damned apartment and still you managed to let two of them escape jesus i should have you shot for incompetence or for being complicit in their evading capture either way i should have you shot sir protested fleischer with all due respect they were thirty metres off the ground they used a steel radio aerial to slide out of the window thirty metres down to that courtyard it was covered in blood when we found it a mans fingers were on the ground why didnt you have men in the courtyard is there a shortage of ss and gestapo here in prague well bohme is there no sir fleischer no herr general so this time you would think we could get it right this time we have a photograph of vaclav moravek we know the safe house hes been using for the last five months and what do we find a note addressed to me remind me of what moraveks note said fleischer id rather not sir it said lick my arse general heydrich its even written in german and czech as the law says it ought to be which is an especially insolent touch dont you think lick my arse general heydrich it would seem that im an even bigger prick than you are fleischer youre already a laughing stock after that incident in the prikopy bar on that particular occasion you mention sir the man was wearing a party badge in the lapel of his jacket and that makes all of the difference does it i wish i had ten marks for every bastard wearing a party badge ive had to shoot since someone tipped him off sir moravek must have been told we were coming that much is obvious my dear commissioner what isnt fucking obvious is what were doing about finding the traitor who might have told him major ploetz sir who is liaising with the special sd squad that i ordered to be set up the vxg it was captain kuttner sir i know who it was achim im asking who it is now well sir you havent said do i have to think of everything apart from my children who incidentally will be arriving here in less than fortyeight hours nothing i repeat nothing is more important than finding the man behind the ota transmissions traitor x or whatever you want to call him nothing these are the reichsfuhrers own orders to me not even vaclav moravek and the three kings and the uvod home resistance network are as important as that do you hear another voice spoke up but it was one i didnt recognize frankly sir i dont wish to speak ill of the dead but captain kuttner was not a good liaison officer whos that speaking i asked kahlo he shook his head dont know the fact is kuttner was arrogant and rude and often quite unpredictable and he managed to piss off the local kripo and gestapo in doublequick time while he was here like i said murmured kahlo he was a prick he did not serve you well general continued the same voice and now that hes gone might i suggest sir that i handle the liaison with the vxg i can promise you ill make a better job of it than he did very well captain kluckholn said heydrich if captain kuttner was as bad as you say he was he was insisted another voice sir then said heydrich you had better get yourself over to pecek palace and then kripo and try to smooth over any ruffled feathers and make sure they know what theyre supposed to be doing clear yes sir i heard a chair move and then someone kluckholn i imagined clicked his heels and left the room talking of ruffled feathers sir this was major ploetz your detective gunther has already managed to upset the whole chicken coop ive already had several complaints about his manner which leaves a great deal to be desired i nodded at kahlo true i said too true i agree with major ploetz sir this was colonel bohme again i suppose you think i should have picked you to handle this inquiry colonel bohme well i am a trained detective sir heydrich laughed cruelly you mean you once went on the detectivelieutenants training course at the police institute in berlincharlottenburg dont you yes i can easily see how that might make anyone think he was hercule poirot my dear bohme let me tell you something we dont have any good detectives left in the sd or in the gestapo within the kind of system that we operate we have all sorts of people ambitious lawyers sadistic policemen brownnosing civil servants all i dare say good party men too sometimes we even call them detectives or inspectors and ask them to investigate a case but i tell you they cant do it to be a proper detective is beyond their competence they cant do it because they wont stick their noses in where theyre not wanted they cant do it because theyre afraid of asking questions theyre not supposed to ask and even if they did ask those questions theyd get scared because they wouldnt like the answers it would offend their sense of party loyalty yes thats the phrase theyd use to excuse their inability to do the job well gunther may be a lot of things but he has the berlin nose for trouble a real schnauz and thats what i want but surely party loyalty has to count for something sir said bohme what about that what about it a promising young ss officer is dead yes thats what he was gentlemen in spite of your own reservations he was murdered and by someone in this house i shouldnt wonder oh we can pretend that it might have been some poor czecho who killed him but we all of us know that it would take the scarlet pimpernel to get past all these guards and to walk into my house and shoot captain kuttner besides i flatter myself that if a czecho did take the trouble to penetrate our security he would prefer to shoot me instead of my own adjutant no gentlemen this was an inside job im convinced of it and gunthers the right man my man to find out who did it he paused for a moment and as for party loyalty thats my job not yours colonel bohme ill say who is loyal and who isnt id heard enough for the moment i stood up and closed the door to the morning room hardly a ringing endorsement said kahlo was it sir from heydrich i shrugged dont knock it thats as good as it gets i sat down at the piano and fingered a few notes experimentally all the same i get the feeling im being played and played well were all being played said kahlo you me even heydrich theres only one man in europe who has his mitts on the keyboard and thats the grofaz the grofaz was a derogatory name for hitler maybe all right whos next on our list i have a sudden desire to ruffle some more feathers general frank sir hes the one with the new wife right the wife whos a czech thats right sir and believe me shes tiptop a real sweetheart twentyeight years old tall blond and clever frank must have some hidden qualities yes sir or better still some hidden vices lets find out which it is did you know captain kuttner very well general frank not very well but well enough ploetz pomme and kluckholn and kuttner frank smiled it sounds like an old berlin tailors shop well they all sort of merge into one really thats what you want from an adjutant i suppose me i wouldnt know i dont have an adjutant myself i seem to manage quite well without one let alone four but if i did have an adjutant i should want him to be as anonymous as those three are they are efficient of course heydrich can tolerate nothing less and being efficient they stay out of the limelight i knew kuttner slightly before his prague posting when he was at the ministry of the interior he helped me in some administrative way for which i was grateful so when he turned up here i tried to help him out consequently he shared a few confidences with me which is why i know what im talking about kuttner was the latest addition to heydrichs stable of aidesdecamp and that meant that he and heydrichs third adjutant kluckholn were never likely to get on very well since the first principle of doing the job well is i imagine to make your superior redundant so kluckholn resented kuttner and feared him i shouldnt wonder well thats understandable kuttner was a clever man much cleverer than kluckholn he was a brilliant lawyer before he went east in june kuttner on the other hand felt that kluckholn tried to keep him in his place or even to put him down for a moment i picture the two men arguing in the garden the previous evening was that what i had witnessed kluckholn trying to put kuttner in his place kuttner resisting it or something more intimate perhaps was heydrich aware of this rivalry of course theres not much that heydrichs not aware of ill say that for him but he likes to encourage rivalry heydrich believes it persuades people to try harder so it wouldnt have bothered him in the least that these two were vying with each other for his favour its a trick hes learned from the leader no doubt no doubt general karl hermann frank looked almost ten years older than his fortythree years his face was lined and furrowed and there were bags under his eyes as if he was another nazi who didnt sleep very well he was a heavy smoker with two of the fingers on the hand holding his cigarette looking like hed dipped them in gravy and teeth that resembled the ivory keys on an old piano it was difficult to see what a beautiful yearold woman saw in this thin stifflooking man power perhaps hitler might have passed him over to succeed von neurath but as ss and police leader of bohemia and moravia frank was effectively the second most important man in the protectorate more interesting than that perhaps was why a beautiful czech physician should have married a man who by his own admission hated czechs so much the hatred id heard him articulate about the czechos the day before was still ringing in my ears what i wondered did mr and mrs frank talk about after dinner the failure of the czech banks czechlanguage sentences that didnt use any vowels uvod the three kings sir when you say there was no love lost between captains kluckholn and kuttner do you mean to say they hated each other there was a certain amount of hatred yes thats only natural however if youre looking for a man who really hated captain kuttner hated him enough to kill him perhaps then obersturmbannfuhrer walter jacobi is your man hes the sd colonel whos interested in magic and the occult isnt he thats right and in particular ariosophy dont ask me to explain it in any detail i believe it is some occult nonsense thats to do with being german for me reading the leaders book is enough but jacobi wanted more he was forever badgering me to become more interested in ariosophy until i told him to fuck off i wasnt the only one who thought his interest in this stuff to be laughable kuttner whose father was a protestant pastor and no stranger to religious nonsense himself thought that ariosophy was complete rubbish and said so to colonel jacobis face most certainly to his face thats what made it so very entertaining for the rest of us it happened when they were both at the ss officer school in prague that was last sunday the th of september the day after heydrich arrived here in prague the school asked him to come to a lunch in his honour and naturally his adjutants accompanied him someone not kuttner had asked colonel jacobi about the deaths head ring he was wearing a gift from himmler apparently one thing led to another and before very long jacobi was talking balls about wotan and sun worship and the masons in the middle of this captain kuttner burst out laughing and said he thought all of that german folk stuff was complete poppycock his exact words for a moment or two there was an embarrassed silence and then voss hes the officer in charge at beneschau and one of the guests here at the lower castle and i might add an idiot voss tried to change the subject but kuttner wasnt having any of it and said some other stuff and thats when jacobi said it frank frowned for a moment said what im trying to think of his exact words yes he said something like if it wasnt for the fact that you are wearing an ss uniform captain kuttner i would cheerfully kill you now and in front of all these people youre quite sure about that sir oh yes quite sure im sure voss will confirm it come to think of it he didnt say kill he said shoot what did kuttner say to that he laughed which didnt exactly defuse the situation and he made some other remark that i didnt understand at the time but which relates to the fact that there was already some previous bad blood between them apparently they knew each other at university and they were enemies i thought jacobi was from munich sir said kahlo he is and that he studied law at tubingen university kahlo added at least thats what it said on his file oh he did but he also studied law at the martin luther university in halle the same as kuttner he might not look like it but jacobi is only a year or two older than kuttner was according to heydrich they even fought a duel while they were students a duel kahlo guffawed what with swords thats right about what exactly he asked they were in a duelling society it doesnt have to be about anything at all thats the whole point of being in a duelling society so it might even have been jacobi who put the schmisse on kuttners face its possible you should certainly ask him given that jacobi was kuttners superior i said then surely kuttner was being grossly insubordinate when he said what he said surely there would be repercussions of saying something like that why wasnt kuttner put on a charge for one thing this was the mess and it wasnt a formal occasion as you may know there is supposed to be a certain amount of leeway in what officers can say to each other upon these occasions up to a point but beyond that well that wasnt a problem either because kuttner had vitamin b of course you mean with heydrich of course with heydrich frank lit a cigarette with a handsome gold lighter before crossing his legs nonchalantly affording us a fine view of his spurs maybe his czech wife karola liked the dashing cavalryofficer look this was certainly better than franks natural look which was that of a man recently released from a prison his bony head drawn features strong fingers sad smile and chain smoking were straight out of a french novel what you also have to understand said frank is that after kuttners breakdown in latvia and because it was heydrich and von eberstein who saved the young man from being cashiered his brother officers were already cutting him quite a bit of slack and for jacobi to have pressed the matter through official channels would have meant taking on heydrich and since heydrich is now the source of all advancement in bohemia you would only do that if you were prepared to park your career in the toilet jacobi might be a cunt and a complete waxed moustache but hes not entirely stupid no not entirely but is he a killer i said to shoot a fellow officer in cold blood that does seem stupid franks tired eyes tightened and a few seconds after that a smile arrived on his lean face like a winning card and i thought you were supposed to be a detective its jacobi whos keen on the occult sir not me and generally i question witnesses because more often than not it turns out to be more reliable than a crystal ball or a set of tarot cards leaning forward in a way that made him seem almost simian frank played with a ring on his right hand for a moment and kept on smiling as he enjoyed the superiority of knowing something i didnt at least for a few seconds longer it was obvious to both of us that he was going to tell me eventually exactly what this was heydrich thinks highly of you gunther but im not so sure to some coppers that might seem like a crushing blow sir but im sure ill get over it with a drink or two i dont mind if i do frank glanced at kahlo who went over to the drinks tray yes sir whatll it be brandy me too i said and have one yourself why dont you i waited until we were all holding a glass and then toasted the general heres to getting over our superiors not thinking as highly of us as wed like frank knew that was meant for him that of course he might have been the new reichsprotector of bohemia and not heydrich if the leader had thought more of him to his credit frank took the jab on his chin without blinking but he took the drink even better like he was swallowing a babys cordial id seen men drink like that before and it helped explain how we were both the same sort of age but with different maps on our faces mine was all right i guess but his looked like the ganges delta i think wed better have the decanter over here kurt i said good idea said frank when there was a fresh glassful in his fingers frank studied it carefully for a moment and said usually theres a payoff for a good informer isnt there sometimes i said but with all due respect you dont look like a man whos going to be happy with five marks and a cigarette a favour commissar more than one favour perhaps what kind of favour information you see since being passed over for the top job here in bohemia as you were kind enough to remind me i dont hear as well as i used to and youd like us to be your eartrumpet is that it frank looked critically at kahlo i dont know about him but youll do for now i see i just want to be kept in the loop thats all right now im the last to know everything its heydrichs little way of reminding me hes in charge you saw the way he dealt with von neurath the other evening well i get the same treatment he shrugged its not like im asking very much commissar after all he poured the second brandy on top of the first and then licked his lips loudly its not like im a spy or anything kahlo and i exchanged a swift look smiling i poured myself another drink are you sure about that sir i kept on smiling to make him think i might be joking and to keep him listening without taking offence lets look at it logically a man with an axe to grind like you i think youd make a pretty good spy frank ignored me dont change the subject not now when were making progress just tell me this do we have a deal to trade information now and in the future yes i think so i could use a few friends in prague right now i dont have any come to that i dont have any at home either frank nodded his eyes glistening all right he said you first some information a sign of good faith yes if you like whats the name of this bit of mouse that henlein has got stashed in the imperial hotel i hear you know all about her her name is betty kipsdorf is it now now tell me why you want to know maybe i just wanted to see if you were prepared to keep your end of the bargain before i told you about lieutenant colonel jacobis interesting past what more interesting than fighting a duel with my murder victim and threatening to shoot him oh this is very much more interesting than that commissar that was merely an appetizer here is the main dish jacobi joined the sa in while he was still a law student in tubingen nothing unusual about that of course but i would suggest that there are not many law students who get themselves arrested for murder in the same week that they graduate yes i thought that would catch your breath in jacobi murdered someone in stuttgart which is only twenty kilometres from tubingen the victim was a kpd cadre although it seems that might not be the real reason the boy was killed there was it seems some suspicion he was queer and that this was the real motive for the murder now i dont have to tell you of all people what things were like in in some ways von papens government was every bit as rightwing as hitlers the stuttgart prosecutors office was rather slow in putting together a case against walter jacobi so slow in fact that the case was never actually brought because of course in january the nazis were elected and nobody was interested in bringing a case against a loyal party member like jacobi any more all the same its no wonder he joined the ss and then the sd soon afterward it was probably the best way of staying out of jail and of course one of the very first things he did when he achieved a certain position of authority within the ss was to have the papers in the case destroyed that almost got him kicked out of the sd in but himmler stepped in and pulled his nuts out of the nosebag and you were thinking that a good detective might have found that out for himself sir something like that you overestimate me general then again theres only so much i can find out in less than twelve hours thats how long ive been on this case and of course theres a limit to how much i can ask my superior officers without bringing down a charge of gross insubordination on my head frank laughed we both know thats not true he laughed again in a way that made me think that there were probably a lot of things he found funny that i would have felt very differently about we both know that it suits general heydrich to have you humiliate us all especially at this particular moment as he becomes reichsprotector of bohemia it becomes an object lesson in power for us all perhaps to test our loyalty hitler admires heydrich because he suspects everyone of everything me included me especially and why would he suspect you general frank looked at kahlo almost as if he knew it had been kahlo who told me about the vxg dont pretend to be naive im married to a czech woman commissar karola my first wife anna hates my guts and is married to a man who affects to look like the leader and now makes it his business to tell lies about me and my new wife just because shes german czech between them they have already turned my two sons against me and now theyre doing their best to allege that the only reason my wife married me was because she is a czech spy and that when i go home at night she persuades me to part with state secrets well its simply not true and its why i didnt think your joke was funny im loyal to germany and the party and one day i hope that i will have the opportunity to demonstrate to the whole world just how devoted to the leader and the cause of national socialism i really am until then i hope i can count on your help yes both of you to put paid to this baseless innuendo he stood up and i shook hands with him and in my defence so did kurt kahlo it was franks idea that we should not mine and at the time i thought nothing of it a handshake seemed like a small price to pay for some important information about a potential new suspect it was another eight or nine months before i realized id shaken hands with the man who had ordered the destruction of the small town of lidice and the murder of everyone in it in reprisal for the assassination of reinhard heydrich i glanced at my watch it was seven oclock if i wasnt confused before admitted kurt kahlo im certainly confused now every time we speak to someone we find out a little bit more the only trouble is that it leaves me a little bit less enlightened its curious really you might even call it a paradox even as i think im getting a proper grip on this case i find theres something interrupting my thoughts as though someone had built a wall between the two halves of my brain just as i find a big enough chair to stand on and look over at the other side i forget what im supposed to be looking for anyway and then before you know it ive even forgotten why im standing on the chair in the first place kahlo sighed and shook his head ruefully sorry sir thats not helping i know even as kahlo spoke i was trying to put up a fight against the rampaging contagion of his utter confusion in my mind i seemed to hear a lost chord and see some words underneath the palimpsest an elusive fragment of real insight flashed like a pan of magnesium powder inside the dark chamber that was my skull and then all was black again for a brief moment everything was illuminated and i understood all and i was on the cusp of articulating exactly what the problem was and where the solution might lie and didnt he kahlo know that what he was describing was precisely the intellectual dilemma that afflicted every detective but the very next moment a grey mist descended behind my eyes and before i knew it this same thought that looked like an answer was slowly suffocating like a fish landed by an angler on a riverbank its mouth opening and shutting with no sound emerging i told him i needed to get away from the lower castle so that i might order my own thinking thats what i also told myself id had enough of them all for one day and suddenly that included kahlo too i decided that i wanted to go back to the hotel and devote my energies to arianne for a while and that we could spend our last night together before i sent her home in the morning ask major ploetz to find a car that will take me back into prague i said kahlo looked sad for a moment as if disappointed i was not ready to be honest with him about where i was going yes sir i did not have long to wait before a car became available but i was less than pleased to discover that i was to share a ride with heydrich himself now you can tell me what conclusions youve come to he said as klein steered us left out of the lower castles infernal gates and onto the picturepostcard country road i havent any yet i was rather hoping you would have everything wrapped up by this weekend before my wife lina gets here yes i know you told me that before and before my guests are obliged to leave they do have duties to perform mmmhmm i must say i find it rather odd than you think you can just take the evening off while a murderer remains at liberty in my house perhaps i didnt make myself clear this morning it is urgent that this case is solved before news gets back to berlin no you made that perfectly clear sir and yet youre still going to see that whore of yours i nodded tell me something sir do you play chess yes but i dont see what that has to do with this or your whore well then you might know that in major tournaments it isnt uncommon for players to get up and leave the board between moves reading sleeping or indeed any pleasant distraction can refresh the human mind enabling the player to perform at a higher intellectual level now while i dont expect to do any reading this evening i do expect my lady friend will provide some very pleasant distractions after which its perfectly possible that i may get some sleep all of which is a long way of saying that i need some time away from you and your house in order to try to make sense of everything ive discovered today such as reaching the main road at last klein stepped hard on the accelerator leaving jungfernbreschan behind and we sped toward prague at almost eighty kilometres an hour obliging me to raise my voice to answer the general i know of at least three people who are staying at the lower castle who hated captain kuttner henlein jacobi and kluckholn i cant yet say if they hated him enough to kill him they hated him for a variety of reasons that mostly come down to the fact that kuttner was insubordinate and clever and perhaps a bit conceited and really not quite the senior officers toady that a good adjutant ought to be but there were other reasons too probably more important reasons that might have got him murdered principally the fact that he was your liaison officer for the sds traitor x group if hed found out something concerning the identity of the traitor that would have been a pretty good reason for someone to kill him you might have told me about that yourself general when this morning when we were in your office when you handed me this case i hardly wanted to broadcast the news about the existence of such a squad in front of my own butler besides i had assumed your criminal assistant would inform you about that major ploetz tells me kahlo is part of the vxg he assumed it was a secret ive only just found out about it well you know now is everyone who has been invited to your house under suspicion until the traitor is apprehended yes of course what a ridiculous question oddly enough gunther traitors have a habit of turning out to be the people we trusted most it would be foolish to assume that there are some people who are simply above suspicion merely by virtue of a long acquaintance with the leader or me or their continuing demonstration of party loyalty a czech spy would be no good if he was suspected of being a czech spy would he however i do agree that this might conceivably have been the reason why kuttner was murdered which makes it all the more imperative that we catch the bastard as soon as possible wouldnt you agree i have another reason why he might have been murdered im listening captain kuttner was homosexual nonsense whatever gave you such a ridiculous idea let me tell you i knew kuttner for more than a decade and i would have known its impossible that i wouldnt have known such a thing nevertheless its a fact youd better have some damned good evidence for an assertion like that gunther ill spare you the details sir but you can take it from me that i would hardly have told you in front of your butler and i wouldnt mention it now in front of your driver unless i was damned sure about what im saying moreover i think we can agree that being homosexual especially in the ss is in these enlightened times that we live in more than enough reason to get you killed i suspect any number of ss officers would feel entirely justified in shooting that kind of man equally i suspect one or two would have felt quite justified in having kuttner shot for what shall we call it sir his dereliction of duty with that special action group in latvia thats something you should know quite a bit about yourself gunther perhaps you have asked yourself why you were allowed to leave your own police battalion in minsk so easily if you have not done so already then perhaps you should i nodded arthur nebe said something to me at the time by way of an explanation and nebe takes his orders from me wouldnt you agree yes sir you remind me of someone gunther a rather stubborn belgian by the name of paul anspach he used to be president of the international fencing association after belgium was defeated in june anspach who had acted as a military judge advocate was arrested for alleged war crimes and put in prison after he was released i had him summoned to berlin where i ordered him to surrender the presidency to me he refused i cant tell you how irritating that was however i admired his courage and sent him home not even you can always get what you want general i can actually with the help of the italian president of fencing i managed to have him stripped of the international presidency anyway its pointless being stubborn with me gunther i always get what i want in the end you should know that by now that its not wise to oppose me in case you didnt understand thats the point of the fucking story ive never believed it was wise to oppose you i said even when i was doing it no more than i think its wise for you to drive without an escort in an opentop car you are an invitation to any wouldbe gavrilo princip to have a go in case you had forgotten the archduke franz ferdinand of austria also travelled in an open car heydrich laughed and although such a thing seemed almost impossible i found i disliked him even more than before if i should ever gain the impression that my conduct in this respect was wise or illconsidered if ever someone were to attack this car i would not hesitate to respond with unheardof violence i suspect that the population of prague is well aware of this fact and while your concern is touching gunther i think it unlikely that i will ever need to take your advice about this oh i dont mean to sound like i care what happens to you sir any more than i mean to sound touching what i mean to say is what your detective ought to say your bodyguard whatever it is you choose to call me i dont know a hell of a lot about fencing but if its anything like boxing then a fighter is told to protect himself at all times thats not weakness general any more than its weakness to look out for a fellow officer from halleandersaale who went to the same school with you its clear to me by now that not everyone agreed with that tell me sir was kuttner any good at his job in so far as it went meaning i have three other adjutants all of whom are quite competent i had thought that one more wouldnt make any difference one is enough for most people of course of course i am not most people however the only reason i have four adjutants correction three adjutants is to remind me to delegate more i have a great problem trusting people to carry out my orders ordinarily theres nothing any of them do that i couldnt do better myself but seeing them at my every beck and call reminds me that there are other more important tasks that require my attention having three adjutants makes me more productive more efficient frankly however i cant stand the sight of any of them kuttner was at least someone i thought i liked but adjutants are a necessary evil for a man in my position much like yourself im flattered that certainly was not my intention your father knew kuttners father is that right yes but since you ask what is more relevant perhaps is that my mother gave albert kuttner music lessons is that how you met i think it must have been i seem to recall seeing him when i was back on leave from the reichsmarine i couldnt have been more than twenty at the time kuttner was much younger of course i may even have tried to talk albert into joining the naval academy just like me after all he went to the same school that i did but his father was less of a nationalist than my own which might be why he chose to pursue a legal career instead not that any of this is relevant i disagree finding out everything there is to know about a man who has been murdered and a lot more besides is in my opinion always the best way to discover why he was murdered and once i find out why its often a very simple matter to discover who heydrich shrugged well its your business you know best in these matters you must do what you think fit gunther about halfway between jungfernbreschan and prague the road ran between recently ploughed fields it was a desolate scene with little in the way of other traffic until nearing bulovka hospital we encountered an ambulance and further on a tram grinding up the hill that led to the city suburbs crossing troja bridge the car slowed and rounded a corner and a man snatched off his cap and bowed as he caught sight of a german staff car it was easier to hear heydrich now that we werent going quite so fast and once again i tried to question him about albert kuttner did you like albert kuttner is that your way of asking if i killed him did you no and to answer your other question no i didnt like him not any more once i did a while ago but not lately he was a disappointment to me and to some extent he was becoming something of a liability since you mentioned colonel jacobi i assume you know the details of what happened there the quarrel they had to be frank gunther i am not at all sorry that kuttner is dead but my conscience is clear i gave the man every opportunity to atone for his inadequacies at the same time i cant have people murdering my staff just because they dont like them christ if you and i were to murder all of the people back at the lower castle i didnt like then we should have hardly anyone left in the local sd jacobi fleischer geschke von neurath i wouldnt shed a tear if any of them caught a bullet thats straightforward enough i suppose henlein and jury are particularly awful dont you think cunts the pair of them when first we talked sir in the garden yesterday you mentioned an attempt on your own life do you think kuttners murder might be related a case of mistaken identity perhaps kuttner was tall and blond much like you his voice and accent were not unlike yours either you mean high yes sir in the dark who knows the killer might simply have shot the wrong person the thought had occurred to me of course in which case i might very well be wasting my time looking for one of our colleagues with a good reason to murder captain kuttner when my energies might be better spent looking for one of them who badly wants you dead interesting idea and of my dear friends and esteemed colleagues back at my new home which of them would you say has the best reason to want me dead you mean apart from me you have an alibi dont you you werent actually in the house at the time when kuttner was murdered thoughtful of you to have provided me with one i said isnt it i should have thought that frank or von neurath have the best reasons from a professional point of view von neurath might like to be revenged on you for the sake of it although he doesnt strike me as a murderer but frank does with you dead frank probably gets your job this is intriguing anyone else henlein and jury probably hate you too dont you think almost certainly and i wouldnt trust jacobi as far as i could kick him he does make the flesh creep does he not geschke and fleischer are hardly my idea of good friends either not friends perhaps but colleagues and good nazis and since we are discussing those among my staff who might hate me theres kritzinger too im not suggesting that he might kill me but i shouldnt be at all surprised if he hates me hes an austrian from vienna and before the war he worked for the jew who used to run the estate ferdinand blochbauer kuttner told me after the anschluss he and his master fled here from vienna hoping to escape the inevitable before blochbauer finally took off for switzerland in but kritzinger is in the ss most of the staff are in the ss arent they of course but very few of them were in the ss until the reich acquired the lower castle i thought thats why they were hired because you knew you could trust them they are all in the ss because it means the reichsprotector doesnt have to pay them out of his own pocket gunther otherwise i should never be able to keep a house as big as that not on my salary that made me sit up a little heydrich had never struck me as mean with money meanspirited yes but not an embezzler and to be so honest about it too of course i knew hed never have told me if himmler didnt know about it and approve which meant that they were all in it the whole rotten crew living high on the hog while the ordinary fritz went without his beer and his sausage and his cigarettes oh im sure kritzinger is a good german continued heydrich but it has to be faced he was devoted to the blochbauers then why on earth do you keep him on because hes an excellent butler of course good butlers like him dont grow on trees you know especially now that were at war i wouldnt expect someone like you to understand what that means but kritzinger puts his professional duties as a butler ahead of his own personal opinions always he sincerely believes that it is his duty to provide good service and concentrate only on that which lies within his realm as a butler if you were to question him he would probably tell you that he wouldnt care to say or something else that was courteously evasive and yet you said that he might hate you of course i have to recognize that its a possibility it would be stupid not to consider it doing what i do gunther its wise not to trust anyone all i ask of people is that they do their duty and in that respect at least kritzinger is beyond reproach he looked impatient for a moment that may be too subtle a distinction for a man like you but there it is such are the dilemmas that afflict everyone who finds himself in a position of great authority all right general whatever you say yes it had better be when we were still several blocks east of the imperial hotel klein drew up outside an apartment building with massive fiercelooking atlantes jugendstil windows and a roof like a bavarian castle the portal was covered in mosaic and topped with a decorative filigree balcony the building looked as if it had been designed by someone whose architectural influences were homer and the brothers grimm but the address was chiefly remarkable for the absence of any ss or even regular army sentries and it was immediately clear to me that this was not an official building whats this place i asked the pension matzky a brothel run by the gestapo for the entertainment of important czech citizens its staffed by twenty of the most beautiful amateur courtesans in all of bohemia and moravia you need a password just to get through the door i bet that keeps the tone up occasionally i visit the place myself or when i wish to reward the men who work for me with something special and everything at the pension matzky is special as we were sitting there a furtivelooking man went through the front door but he was not so furtive that i didnt recognize him it was professor hamperl the man who had carried out the autopsy on captain kuttner whos he i asked one of these important citizens of prague i really have no idea said heydrich but i expect so incidentally the password is rothenburg now ask me why i told you that gunther why did you tell me that so that youll be thinking about what youre missing when you see that whore you brought from berlin i ask you klein with the thousands of very willing girls there are in this town can you imagine such a thing klein grinned no sir heydrich shook his head thats like taking an owl to athens maybe i just like german owls heydrich smiled his wolfs smile stepped out of the car and went inside the pension without another word oh good youre back now we can go out somewhere it was sevenfortyfive but a short while later when i looked at my watch it seemed like it was nine oclock with her head in shadow arianne was just a naked torso lying on the bed like a piece of marble sculpture dominated by light and form she herself was almost secondary and not a person at all so that i was reminded a little of what id seen during my time at the bulovka hospital i sat down on the edge of the bed and laid my hand on the curving white skislope that was the summit of her behind descending the broad field of her thigh to her nearinvisible knee its not that i dont want you here i know you want me all right said a disembodied voice youve made that perfectly clear all you do is fuck me its no longer safe for you here in prague i told you theres a special group of sd thats been set up to look for gustav if they had any idea youd actually met him no matter how innocently well you cant imagine what would happen at least i hope you cant imagine what would happen youre in danger arianne real danger thats why you urgently have to go back to berlin first thing tomorrow for your own protection and you what will you be doing ill be going back to heydrichs house in jungfernbreschan is that his car the mercedes you went away in yesterday morning she paused i followed you downstairs to say goodbye and changed my mind when i saw those other men in the car yes thats his car one of them anyway what are you doing there anyway at heydrichs house you dont tell me anything theres nothing to tell not yet i had a couple of rather boring meetings with some very boring generals including him heydrich is a lot of things but hes never boring most of the time im much too afraid of him to be bored arianne sat up and put her arms about my neck you scared i dont believe it parsifal youre brave i think youre very brave to be brave you first have to be scared take my word for it anything else is just foolhardy and its not bravery that keeps people alive angel its fear she started to cover my head and neck with kisses not you she said i dont believe it im afraid of him yes im afraid of all of them afraid of what they might do to me afraid of what they might do to germany but right now im afraid of what they might do to you thats why i went to the masaryk station before i came here and bought you a ticket back to berlin arianne sighed and wiped a tear from her eye will i see you again of course when soon i hope but right now everything is confused youve no idea how confused and sending me back to berlin makes things simpler yes but i told you thats not the reason you have to go back home all the same ill sleep a lot sounder knowing youre all right she stroked my head for a moment and then said on one condition no conditions that you tell me you love me parsifal oh i love you all right as a matter of fact i love you very much arianne thats why i have to send you away it was a mistake bringing you here i can see that now it was selfish of me very selfish i did it for me and now i have to do this for you see i dont in the least want you to go home but because i love you i really do have to send you away maybe i did love her at that only it didnt matter very much one way or another not now that she was leaving prague and somewhere inside me i knew that i couldnt ever see her again so long as she knew me she would be in danger because of who and what i was after she had gone home she would be safe because i was the only person who could connect her with gustav and franz koci i knew i was going to feel bad about losing her but this was nothing to how i knew i would feel if ever being with me put her into heydrichs cold white hands hed gut her for information the way hamperl had gutted poor albert kuttner on the slab at bulovka ill always love you i said for effect and i love you too i nodded all right lets go and find some dinner chapter i couldnt sleep that night but arianne had very little to do with that although she didnt sleep well either sometime before dawn i must have slept a little because i dreamed i had returned to an almost preternatural time and place that was before the nazis but this was a recurring dream for me we made a desultory attempt at intimacy but our spirits were not in it hers even less than mine we washed and dressed and ate some breakfast in the mosaic cafe downstairs she seemed depressed and spoke very little almost as if she was already on the train back to berlin but then again i wasnt exactly gabby myself you seem very quiet this morning she said i was thinking the same of you me im fine she sounded defensive i didnt sleep very well you can sleep on the train yes perhaps i will pushing aside the salt and pepper cellars i tried to take her hand but she pulled it away dont pretend bernie you look like you cant wait to get rid of me lets not go over this again arianne as you like we walked toward the elevator the boy opened the double doors to admit us to his little vertical world but just as i was about to follow arianne inside the hotel clerk appeared in front of us and handed me a sealed envelope as the car groaned its way up the shaft i read the note that it contained what is it asked arianne i just lost my ride to the jungfernbreschan she frowned oh why heydrich reminding me whos boss probably you mean youve got no car thats right well how will you get there its fourteen kilometres apparently i will have to walk over to hradschin castle and beg a lift there the elevator car arrived on the top floor where we got out thats quite a walk from here she said to the castle i did it yesterday at least forty minutes maybe more you should telephone them and make them send a car she smiled uncertainly then you could spend some more time with me i shook my head believe me im in no hurry to get there besides its a nice day and the walk will do me good it will give me some time to think now i can see you off at the station yes that would be lovely on our way along the floor she went into the bathroom and i went back to the room i lit a cigarette and lay down on the bed and waited for her arianne was quite a while although this wasnt unusual she was always well dressed and well groomed which was one of the reasons i liked her theres something very sexy about disassembling something that has taken so long to put together belt dress shoes suspenders corselette brassiere stockings panties but when she returned after at least fifteen minutes she seemed even stiffer than before as if the paint she had applied to her lovely face was meant not just to enhance her beauty but also to cover her true feelings actually she said a little breathlessly as she came through the door id rather you didnt come to the station if you dont mind ive just done my makeup and i know ill cry if youre standing on the platform waving goodbye so if you dont mind darling let me go on my own its only five minutes walk my bag isnt heavy and i can manage perfectly well on my own i didnt protest clearly her mind was made up and that was it when i walked out of the hotel and turned right and west to walk to the charles bridge and the castle that lay beyond it i never expected to see arianne tauber again and it was as if a great load had been lifted off my shoulders i felt if not carefree then certainly a profound sense of liberation strange how wrong we can be about so much being a detective even a bad one i should have been used to that being wrong is an important part of being right and only time can tell which it turns out to be in the old town square i took a moment to remind myself of that a few tourists mostly offduty german soldiers had assembled in front of the town halls astronomical clock to witness the hourly medieval morality lesson involving vanity delight greed and death which took place in two little windows above the elaborate astrolabe the offduty soldiers took lots of photographs of the clockwork figures and checked their wristwatches but none of them looked like they were learning much thats the thing about morality lessons nobody ever learns anything we were face to face with the past but none of us seemed to understand that we were also face to face with an allegory of our future i got back to the lower castle at around ten oclock and found kurt kahlo waiting patiently for me in the morning room captain kluckholn was just here he said what did he want he handed me a sheet of paper its a list of kuttners personal effects he said apparently these are available for our inspection in major ploetzs office i glanced over the list kahlo handed me a brown envelope and smiling shook his head hes also given us two tickets each for the circus next wednesday evening the circus what the hell for kahlo nodded pragues crown circus i hear its very good everyones invited even me its an outing for the sd and the ss and the gestapo isnt that nice mr and mrs heydrich are going and so are mr and mrs frank apparently your lady friend fraulein tauber is also invited whoever she is i didnt even know you had a lady friend here in prague i dont not any more right now shes on a train back to berlin god i wish i was me too now i understand why you wanted to get away last night at the time i thought you were headed for the pension matzky you know about that do you more than you might think a mate of mine in the local vice squad had to interview the girls heydrich set the place up even before he became reichsprotector he never struck me as the type to pimp for his fellow officers oh hes not the place is a honey trap its equipped with listening devices so that he can eavesdrop on important czechos or the top brass when they come down from berlin my mate reckons hes blackmailing half of the general staff apparently hes got a similar place planned in berlin in geisebrechtstrasse if i were you sir id keep away from both thanks for the tip i think i will dont mention it anything else there was a second envelope in kahlos hand he handed it over in the envelope was a letter from geert vrankens father in the netherlands thanking me for contacting his daughterinlaw she was too upset to write herself and for informing them of his sons accident he also asked me to keep him informed of exactly when and where his sons remains were eventually interred news from home not exactly i put the letter and the circus tickets in my pocket whos our next witness brigadier bernard voss remind me who he is in charge of the ss officer school at beneschau and everything youd expect from the commandant of an officer training school a real stiff prick very probably you could use some uglier words than that especially if youre a czech in november some students from the local university organized a demonstration during which franks driver was injured he shouldnt have been there at all but thats another story anyway twelve hundred students were arrested and voss commanded the firing squads that shot several of them as an example to the rest i pulled a face it was easy to despise a man whod done something like that i knew because id done something like that myself and voss once met hitler added kahlo which is not so unusual in this house however when you talk to him it seems to have been the most important day in his life it was easy to believe this after just ten minutes in vosss company hitler he regarded as the modern equivalent of martin luther and maybe he wasnt so far wrong luther was another hugely deluded german i regarded with more than a little distaste fortunately for my inquiry it seemed voss was just as happy to talk about the incident at beneschau involving kuttner and jacobi as he was about the day he met hitler captain kuttner was a highly intelligent young officer and i was surprised that he should have said what he did however i was not at all surprised that colonel jacobi should have answered him in that way but then thats jacobi for you where was general heydrich when this happened in the dining hall at beneschau we have a long refectorystyle table i was right next to jacobi but heydrich was at the opposite end of the table why didnt he sit next to you sir surely that would have been customary voss shrugged the general was late delayed by some official business his voice was about as thick as a recently tarred road why werent you surprised that jacobi should have said what he said voss shrugged again he wasnt as tall as he should have been these days you dont have to look commanding to be in command but he did look tough for a man of almost fifty which is about the number of stitches it must have taken to sew up the schmisse on his left cheek and you couldnt argue with an iron cross first class or the courageous even foolhardy way he smoked like every cigarette was his last its no secret that he and i dont agree on a number of issues still there was no excuse for young kuttner to be insubordinate like that that was a surprise i always thought him a very polite courteous young man always ever since i first met him several years ago so you knew him before he came to prague oh yes he was a cadetofficer at the ss junker school in bad tolz when i was the commander there when was that when i was the commander at bad tolz lets see now july until november kuttner was one of the best young officers that was ever produced there he graduated at the top of his class as you might have expected after all he was a law graduate of some brilliance and great things were expected of kuttner he was certainly being groomed for one of the top jobs in the ss yes its true he had important connections but he had considerable ability of his own if only things hadnt gone wrong for him in latvia hed have been a major by now with an important desk job in berlin voss shook his head of course hes not the first ss officer that this sort of thing has happened to i know because i keep up with a lot of the young men who passed through my hands at bad tolz men like kuttner the work is too much to expect anyone to carry out without it having some effects on morale and character theyre only flesh and blood after all it was odd how the same did not seem to apply to the victims of the work that voss described a new approach is needed to the work of evacuation and resettlement a different solution to the jewish problem a better solution and ive told heydrich as much something is needed that takes into account the humanity of the men we ask to carry out these special actions he sounded so reasonable i had to remind myself that he was talking about mass murder after bad tolz when you next saw kuttner again which was when at the luncheon where the incident we were talking about took place when you saw him again would you say that hed changed oh yes very much and the change was obvious to me he looked a nervous wreck which is what he was of course but still highly articulate and likeable yes i still liked him in spite of everything its a great shame this has happened after i finished with brigadier voss captain kluckholn appeared in the morning room and explained that major thummel had to be back in dresden that evening and with their agreement he had leapfrogged the list of witnesses ahead of geschke bohme and jacobi is that all right with you gunther yes but now that youre here captain i have a couple of quick questions id like to put to you to me to you yes of course and by the way thanks for the circus tickets dont thank me thank the general i will i opened my cigarette case and offered him one kluckholn shook his head dont smoke hermann isnt it i lit my nail and whistled down the smoke he nodded which adjutant are you first second or third i never can remember third kluckholn folded his hands at his back and waited politely he was the tallest and most distinguished of heydrichs remaining three adjutants he was also the leanest his hair was dark and worn slightly longer than most other officers in the sd which added an almost glamorous filmstarrish aspect to the way he looked a uniform suited him and he knew it there was a secondclass iron cross ribbon worn from the second buttonhole on his tunic and the right angles on the flares of his riding breeches looked like theyd been put there by pythagoras the spanishcut topshaft boots were polished like horse brass and had almost certainly been supplied by an expensive dressage company like konig i had half an idea that if heydrich ever accused him of being improperly dressed kluckholn would have hanged himself with his own aiguillette tell me hermann the night before captain kuttner was found dead what did you two argue about im afraid youre mistaken we never argued oh come on i saw you in the front garden while the leader was on the radio telling us how wonderfully things were going for our armies in russia you two were at each others throats like one of those stone sculptures on the front gate im sorry to contradict you gunther you may have seen what you assumed to be an argument but if you had been privy to our conversation you would have heard something quite different from an argument so what was it a gentlemanly discussion clenched fists gritted teeth face to face like a couple of boxers at a weighin i think i recognize an argument when i see one are you calling me a liar captain gunther i let my lips tug at my cigarette for a long second before i answered him no not at all but all the same im still wondering if the gentlemanly conversation you had that was very different from an argument makes you a suspect in a murder you hardly liked the man after all who said so you did yesterday afternoon when general heydrich was biting everyones ears in the library i couldnt help but hear your handsome eulogy of captain kuttner i would say i was eavesdropping except that i imagine your boss left the door open and meant me and some others in the house to hear exactly what was said theres not much he does that hasnt got a damned good reason behind it incidentally im not the only one whos wondering if you were up to putting a bullet in adjutant number four some of the other officers arent exactly slow when it comes to casting aspersions on the characters of their fellow officers are they kurt im afraid so but it is disappointing sir i thought that among brother officers of the ss and the sd there would be a greater sense of honour and camaraderie to be honest there have been times in the last couple of days when this room seemed more like the school principals office the number of tales that have been told in here so how about it hermann kluckholn shook his head whatever you heard captain gunther i can assure you i did not murder captain kuttner perhaps my language was a little intemperate yesterday in the library but i had a better opinion of him than perhaps you heard me say kluckholn spoke as if his voice was being recorded on a gramophone disc i looked at kahlo kurt would you please close that door kahlo moved away from the piano and closed the door behind him quietly what are you hiding hermann kluckholn shook his head i can assure you im not hiding anything sure you are hermann i shrugged everyone in this damned house is hiding something or other small secrets big secrets dirty secrets and youre no exception hermann i would rather you did not call me hermann in that familiar way i prefer kluckholn or captain kluckholn and your suggestion that im hiding something is not only nonsensical it is also insulting colouring with irritation and injured pride kluckholn moved toward the closed door and i am not going to remain here to endure your insinuations yes you are hermann i nodded at kahlo who quickly turned the key in the lock and then pocketed it meanwhile kluckholn looked as if i had just stood on his corn you really are a most vulgar tiresome fellow gunther has anyone told you that many times it must have something to do with all the vulgar murders ive investigated not to mention all the murders that i myself have been obliged to commit of course that hardly makes me unusual in this house but like captain kuttner i found there was something about it i didnt like which is the reason im here now speaking to you instead of carrying on the good work out east with all the special action boys by the way how was it that you escaped that particular tour of duty hermann im ordering you to unlock that door kluckholn told kahlo kahlo folded his arms and looked sad as if disappointed that he couldnt obey the order i didnt doubt that he was more than equal to the task of dealing with kluckholn if the third adjutant decided to try and get tough with him kahlo looked tougher kahlo would have looked tough in a bath full of turkish wrestlers maybe you had vitamin b too i said better still perhaps you had vitamin a whats the big name in berlin thats been helping you to keep your nice polished boots out of the murder pits of minsk and riga hermann kluckholn stood immediately in front of kahlo and held out his hand as your superior officer i am ordering you to hand over that key why dont you sit down and tell us what youre hiding hermann for example why dont we talk about this list of captain kuttners personal effects it was you who compiled that wasnt it open that damn door or youll regret it the trouble is im afraid that you left some items off the list and i dont like it when people try to deceive me you see i conducted a very swift search of the room before you tidied up which is how i know that this list doesnt include those copies of der fuhrer magazine that were in kuttners drawer i felt kahlo frown at me theyre not quite what you think i told kahlo der fuhrer is or rather was a homosexual magazine used to be quite popular with some of berlins warmer boys so were the others in that drawer der kreise and der insel lots of naked men playing with medicine balls or doing pressups on top of each other i shook my head you see the corrupting things ive had to deal with in my career as a police officer kurt its a wonder im not in the cement myself some of the filth ive seen lots of bums was it sir lots collectors items now on the berlin black market pornography being so hard to obtain these days expensive stuff for connoisseurs of that kind of thing you might say kahlo pulled a face that was a pantomime of disgust its a dirty job sir being a detective dont tell anyone kurt not in this house theyll all want to do it kluckholn had calmed down a bit and was looking a little less inclined to fight kahlo for the key to the morning room door but another minute passed before he turned away and sat down on the sofa of course said kahlo its possible the captain here took those dirty magazines off the list not because he wanted to deceive you sir but because he wanted to keep them for himself no said kluckholn loudly i never thought of that kurt good thinking kahlo grinned enjoying himself there wasnt much licence to insult senior officers in the gestapo and ss and he was going to take full advantage of it now of course i said he took them to use while he was rubbing his own pipe no insisted kluckholn no i was merely trying to safeguard kuttners reputation not to mention the reputation of the squadron the squadron was what nice wellbred people like kluckholn called the ss kuttner wasnt like that im sure of it he liked women those filthy magazines must have belonged to someone else perhaps they were already here when the house was taken over perhaps they belonged to the jews who owned the place before von neurath after all as far as i could tell they were hardly recent copies he shook his head anyway i talked it over with my own conscience and i decided that it was best to burn them it was obvious they had no bearing on the case you burned them yes i burned them all it was quite bad enough that kuttner should be murdered but we hardly wanted you questioning his reputation as an officer and a gentleman we you mean you and ploetz burned them yes and we certainly didnt want those filthy magazines being sent to his parents in halle along with all his other personal effects that much i can understand i doubt that gunther i really do what makes you think he liked women hermann because he talked about a girl hed met a girl here in prague thats why this girl have a name grete i dont know her surname she wouldnt be the woman in the framed photograph thats still listed among his possessions no thats his mother maybe this grete was just his black face i said to help persuade you that he was as normal as the rest of you or maybe offered kahlo he was just dipping his toe into the water to see if he liked it or maybe hermann here is just making it up i said to make his fellow adjutant seem like less of a queer in our eyes than he really was perhaps hes a bit warm himself sir perhaps he has to give kuttner an alibi so he can have one too could be thats what they were arguing about a lovers tiff kluckholn stood up and stared angrily at kahlo i dont have to take that from you he turned to glare at me i dont have to take it from either of you sit down i said before i make you sit down kluckholn remained standing by the way i said what other evidence did you destroy when you were burning kuttners puppy mags kluckholn shook his head and sat down nothing he said nothing at all a diary perhaps some love letters photographs of the two of you on a nice trip to rugen island with all the boys i wasnt interested in any of these although i might have been if i had ever supposed that they had been among his possessions there was however one more thing i was interested in something i knew had been in his drawer because i had seen it what about the pipe what pipe there was a broken clay pipe in his drawer what happened to that i didnt see a clay pipe but i fail to see what relevance a broken old pipe might have to anything that all depends i said doesnt it kurt depends on what kluckholn asked depends on what he smoked in it kahlo said tobacco marijuana opium they say a clay is best for opium dont they sir clay keeps the heat better thats right i said opium or marijuana might be just the thing for a man who was having trouble sleeping or just to ease the conscience of a man who felt very guilty about what hed done in riga of course added kahlo you would only throw it away if you suspected thats what it had been used for you wouldnt throw it away if you thought hed only used it to smoke tobacco good point i said of course if we still had it we could have tested it in the lab they might have cleared him of any suspicion on that score but now well never know kluckholn was about to say something and then seemed to think better of it for a moment his brown eyes met mine pleadingly as if he wanted me to stop and he really did have some secret he couldnt bring himself to reveal he took hold of his fist in the palm of his other hand and started to squeeze it trying to stop it from punching me almost as if belshazzar had managed to get hold of the disembodied hand that was interrupting his famous feast go ahead i said punch me on the nose then well have all the excuse i need to beat it out of you wont we kurt just say the word sir id love to smack this bastard kluckholn regarded us with real hatred before he seemed to shrink into a silence and then a shape that made me think we really would have to beat anything else out of him which effectively meant that the interrogation was over back at the alex when a suspect wont talk we put him down in the cells to think it over thats what id do with you hermann if we werent doing this in a nice country house with a good piano and some choice works of art thats what wed do if we were doing this back in berlin wed lock you up for the night if we were doing this the proper police way not like some bullshit scene in a crappy detective novel by that english lady novelist heydrich seems to admire so much i flicked my cigarette into the fireplace where it smashed against the chimney wall in a hail of tiny sparks you can go i said but i shall certainly want to speak to you again hermann you can depend on it kluckholn stood up and without uttering another word he made straight for the door which kahlo then unlocked with a deliberate insolence that reminded me strongly of myself when the captain was gone kahlo went over to the coffee table where id left my cigarette case and helped himself guilty conscience do you think he asked around here im not sure what that might look like the bastard was shaking like a rice pudding if he didnt do it or knows who did it then im a blue dragoon the blue dragoons was the nickname of an army punishment battalion stationed on the peatbog moors of the ems river region they said that if the damp didnt kill you the labour digging peat in all weathers was certain to do it thats probably what hes worried about i said being sent there or whatever the ss equivalent of the blue dragoons might be some lesser circle of hell probably a firing squad looks like a better bet if you ask me he destroys evidence and wont say what he and kuttner were arguing about fuck off not to mention his declared dislike of the man if it was me id arrest him now and tap it out of him with a small hammer kahlo took a fierce drag of his cigarette and then bared his teeth like he was enduring pain and you know something sir kluckholn might be just as good as it can get for us in fact i think hes perfect for it meaning what exactly only that hes standing right in front of your box camera with a name and number chalked on a piece of board no really you could just as easily snap him for this murder as anyone else you sound so like the gestapo sometimes that i wonder why i like you kurt youre the one with heydrichs breath in your ear when youve got a suspect whos suspicious its foolish to go and look for someone with a kind face and a good alibi come on sir every bull does it now and then even when they dont have to and if you ask me you have to he paused we have to i grinned its quite like old times working with you you remind me of why i left the police the first time its your funeral kahlo shrugged i just hope that im only the chief mourner you neednt worry im not about to reach up and pull you in the grave beside me its not just that what then i need to get on in the job i cant stay being a criminal assistant for the rest of my bloody life unlike you ive got a wife to support the only way im going to get a promotion is if you deliver someones head for kuttners murder or if i join one of those ss police battalions in russia come on sir youve been there everyone says its the holiday in hell i nodded that it is it sent kuttner over the edge we know that i dont want that happening to me i want kids i want to be able to look them in the eye when they go to bed at night yes i can understand that right then so far ive managed to avoid all that resettlement shit but i dont know how much longer i can do it i cant afford for you to fuck this case up because youre a bit squeamish about sewing someone into the bag for this sir so you admit you dont actually think he did it then it doesnt matter what i think what matters is if it will stand up in front of general heydrich well i dont think it will i agree kluckholns keeping something from us but if you remember he said that major ploetz was party to the decision to burn those puppy mags for all we know he knew about the pipe too you cant put a man in front of a firing squad just because he tries to sidestep a few awkward questions no this is germany sir remember it happens every day someone has got to go down for this and if you ask me it might as well be him besides adjutant or not hes only a fucking captain and its going to be a lot easier pinning a charge on him than on any of the cauliflower theres not one of these bastards that doesnt have a supply of vitamins that goes all the way to the top he had a point i didnt like it but what he was saying made a lot of sense am i interrupting you an officer in army uniform put his head around the door and for a moment i failed to recognize him only captain kluckholn said he was going to try to get me bumped up your list but peculiar fellow he wouldnt answer me when i asked him just now if that was all right with you seemed rather upset about something had a face like thunder he paused well is it all right i mean i can come back in a few minutes if youd prefer only i was rather hoping to catch this afternoons train to dresden theres quite a lot of work waiting on my desk the admiral thats admiral canaris he keeps me pretty busy these days i can tell you im sorry major thummel isnt it thats right youd better come in good of you he warbled paul thummel advanced into the morning room he moved with flatfooted nonchalance like a golfer approaching a putt he expected to sink without any trouble and sat down on the sofa recently vacated by hermann kluckholn all right here am i he smoothed his hands along the silk cushions like a schoolboy and then leaned back comfortably i havent been in this room he added looking around very cosy although maybe a bit too feminine for my taste not that i have any at least thats what my wife says she gets to choose the wallpaper in our house not me i just pay for it thummel was about forty he had dark hair which like almost everyone wearing a german uniform he wore very short at the sides so that what was on top of his skull resembled a little cap his face was sharp and he had a very pronounced hook nose that looked as if it was trying its best to meet halfway his equally prominent chin he was friendly and as smoothly confident as you might have expected of a man wearing a gold party badge a firstclass iron cross a decent cologne and a silver wedding band any suspects yet its still a little early for that major hmm bad business all round leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth to think that some fellow sitting next to you at dinner might have murdered some other fellow you knew in cold blood have you anyone in mind who me no thummel crossed his legs took hold of the shin of his boot and hugged it toward him like an oar in a twoman scull but fire away with your questions commissar all the same are you feeling better today hmm the hangover oh that yes fine thanks ill say one thing for heydrich he keeps a spectacular cellar himmler will be jealous when i tell him that was a little heavyhanded i thought just as he was doing so well creating an easygoing impression of himself he had to go and spoil it by mentioning himmler with whom he was quite probably familiar i looked at kahlo who rolled his eyes eloquently as if to suggest that in comparison to kluckholn i was wasting my time that thummel was one of the people with a kind face and a good alibi he had been talking about nevertheless i shant be at all unhappy to go back to dresden i dont feel at all comfortable here in bohemia nothing to do with the reichsprotectors hospitality of course but theres something about this country that makes you feel as if you might get your head bashed in on your way to church like poor old king wenceslas or that one might be defenestrated by a bunch of malodorous hussites awkward stinky mob the czechos always were right the way through history always will be if you ask me the generals got his work cut out with these bastards you were in paris before this i hear thats right sir well i dont have to tell you how different prague is from paris the frenchies are nothing if not pragmatic they know what side their bread is buttered on for now but the czecho is a very different kettle of fish hes a real festering sore is your average czecho you mark my words commissar theres going to be a lot of blood spilled here if were ever going to hold on to this country he frowned sorry rattling on like a milkmaid as usual you want to talk about poor old captain kuttner dont you not my opinion of the czechos i found a spent cartridge on the landing in front of your door from a p which would seem to indicate that a shot must have been fired in that vicinity on the morning of the murder did you hear a shot fired you mean in the house not outside seems to me theres always someone shooting something out there no i didnt hear a thing mind you that night i slept like a pickled marmot after all the booze id consumed slept right through until about lets see now well it must have been about seven oclock in the morning when i heard a couple of loud bangs i got up to see what the commotion was about and captain pomme i think explained to me that he and the butler had been obliged to batter down kuttners door on account of how they thought he must have taken an overdose of barbitol at least thats what i think he said so i wandered along to see if i could help and heard dr jury say that the poor fellow was dead there was nothing i could do of course so i went back to bed stayed there until just about nine had a wash dressed came out my door again and there you were crawling around on the floor looking for that bullet casing frankly ive been racking by brains ever since for a reason why anyone would have killed him not to mention how the room door was locked and bolted from the inside wasnt it window bolted and no murder weapon yet found a regular mystery i nodded i even had a look about the dead mans bedroom last evening in search of some inspiration im not trying to show the hen how to lay an egg and all that but while i was there i found several floorboards underneath the rug that were loose loose enough to pull them up there was a good space underneath them easily big enough for a decentsized man to have hidden there and it occurred to me that the murderer with a sufficiently cool head might have been lurking in there all the while that you were all in the room on top of him so to speak of course he would have to have devised a means of replacing the floorboards on top of his place of concealment and then pulling the rug back with a couple of lengths of fishing line perhaps yes thats what id have used if it had been me in there with a couple of strategicallyplaced nails on the skirtingboard you could have wound the rug in as easily as a venetian blind i looked at kahlo who shrugged back at me sorry thummel smiled ruefully i just sort of thought you ought to know really i wasnt trying to make you look a fool or anything commissar gunther actually sir i seem to be managing that particular task perfectly well on my own i sighed and stared up at the ceiling where immediately above kuttners room was situated why didnt i think of that you cant think of everything such an investigation as you are trying to conduct in this house would try the patience and ingenuity of any mortal man and look here i am not saying that is where the murderer was hiding i am merely suggesting it as a possibility although not a strong one i think he shrugged however i will say this in the abwehr we are constantly impressed by the resourcefulness and imagination of the enemy especially the tommies desperation is the father of innovation after all he sighed i do not say that is how it was done commissar i say only that is how it could have been done i nodded thank you sir dont mention it commissar i certainly wont if you receive my meaning we had better go up there and take a look for ourselves we all three stood up and moved simultaneously for the morning room door by the way major thummel i said remembering the letter i had received from berlin that morning does the name geert vranken mean anything to you geert vranken thummel paused for a moment and then shook his head no i dont think so why should it there was a murder investigation in berlin this summer the sbahn murderer vranken was a foreign worker on the railways who was interviewed by the police as a potential suspect and he mentioned a german officer who might be prepared to stand as a character witness for him and you think that was me i just received a letter from his father in the netherlands and he said that his son had met a captain thummel in the hague before the war in well there you are commissar it must be another officer called thummel last time i was in the hague was or maybe thirtyfour but certainly not in in i was stationed in paris you know thummel is not an uncommon name the maitre d at the adlon hotel is called thummel did you know that yes sir i do know that youre right it must be another officer called thummel thummel grinned cheerfully besides im hardly in the habit of giving guest workers a character reference he nodded upstairs but i dont mind showing you those loose floorboards commissar after thummel had left kuttners bedroom kahlo climbed into the space in the floor and waited patiently while i replaced the boards then i took them up again kahlo climbed out covered in dust well its possible all right i said but hardly probable why do you say that sir the amount of dust on you if someone had been hidden there on friday morning id have expected a little less dust than there is in there now or at least was until you got in there i handed kahlo the clothes brush id picked up from the top of the dresser lucky its not a good suit i said kahlo growled an obscenity and began to brush off his jacket and trousers depends on how much dust there was down there before doesnt it he muttered maybe and with all of the cauliflower still pissed in their rooms any one of them might have hidden himself in there and no one would have been any the wiser ive looked at the rug too and i can see no means whereby someone drew the rug back over the boards while he was hidden down there no fishing line no nails on the skirting perhaps said kahlo the murderer has been back in here and removed them perhaps anyway if the murderer did manage to conceal himself down there that puts kluckholn in the clear immediately after the murder he was here in the room remember with you and me pity but i still like him for it and like you said yourself its hardly probable is it that the killer would have hidden in here kahlo shook his head no youre right kluckholn must have done it some other way it might just be that he turned himself into a bat i grinned and shook my head he couldnt have done it that way either the window was closed remember so the general says we all assume that because hes the general his evidence is one hundred per cent what if he made a mistake about that what if the window was open after all heydrich doesnt make mistakes about things like that why not hes only human whatever gave you that impression kahlo shrugged itll be lunchtime soon he said you could ask him then why dont you ask him yourself yeah sure i meant what i said about that promotion you know he handed me the clothes brush and then turned around do you mind sir i brushed the worst of it off his jacket and thought of arianne brushing off my own jacket the previous day i liked that she had been so particular about my appearance straightening my tie adjusting my shirtcollar and always picking my trousers off the floor and tucking them under the mattress so that they might keep the crease it was a caring touch i was missing already by now she was probably across the bohemian border and back in germany and a lot safer than she was in prague i knew what thummel had been talking about there was something about prague that i didnt care for at all im looking forward to lunch said kahlo he was sniffing the air like a big hungry dog whatever it is smells good everything smells good to you everything except this case true look you go ahead to lunch im going to stay here for a while and do what oh nothing much stare at the floor listen to that crow outside the window shoot myself or perhaps pray for some inspiration youre not going to miss lunch are you kahlos tone made this sound as serious as if i really was planning to shoot myself which wouldnt have been so very far from the truth now i come to think of it thats a good idea i said eating has a habit of interfering with my thinking in that respect its almost as bad as beer if i fast for a while maybe ill be given a vision as to how this murder was done yes why not maybe if i starve myself like moses for forty days and nights then perhaps the almighty will just come and tell me who did it of course he might have to set the house on fire to get my full attention but itll be worth it besides im pretty sure i have a head start on moses in one respect oh whats that i opened my cigarette case a smoke a very small burning bush from whence a great deal of wisdom can be imparted i reckon any one of those saints could have saved themselves a lot of time and discomfort with a simple cigarette after kahlo had left me alone with my angst i sat on the edge of kuttners mattress and lit one and when id had enough of looking at my cigarettes little mystic trail of holy inspiration i decided to take a look around the house with more or less everyone now gathered in the dining room i was able to go where i pleased without having to furnish an explanation of what i was doing besides i wasnt sure there was an explanation for what i was searching for all i knew was that i needed to have an idea any idea and to have one fast hearing a loud cheer downstairs in the dining room gave me my first idea it wasnt much of an idea but it had at least the merit of being practical an experiment an empirical test of an assumption i and everyone else had made right from the very beginning of the case i went along to my own bedroom and fetched the walther ppk from my bag back in kuttners room i closed the door as best i could racked one bullet into the chamber fired the weapon twice in quick succession and then sat down to wait for whatever was going to happen but if i had expected the shots to summon the arrival of a concerned group of officers in kuttners room i was wrong a minute passed then two and after five minutes i was quite certain that no one was coming because no one had heard the shots of course this told me only that kuttner might easily have been shot without anyone hearing or bothering to investigate the shots but that still felt like something it was one assumption id made that could easily be proved to have been false and where there was one there might easily be another i went back to my room and replaced the gun in my bag before heading out and along the landing with its blackamoor figures the huntingstyle leather chairs the decorative meissen and the less decorative framed photographs of hitler himmler goebbels goering bormann and von ribbentrop it was a home from home if you lived at the berghof i was familiar with the more attractive parts of the lower castle including the library the dining room the billiard room the winter garden the conference room and the morning room but there were other parts of which i knew nothing or which felt forbidden heydrichs study certainly felt like it was out of bounds even to someone who was supposed to be heydrichs detective outside the door i paused for a moment knocked and then hearing no one and expecting to find the door locked i turned the thick brass handle the door opened i went inside i closed the heavy door behind me the room one of the largest in the house was quiet and cool it felt more like a sepulchre than a study i walked around for a good minute before i was retracing my footsteps which like a ghosts were completely silent in that room as if i hardly existed at all heydrich could have arranged that of course and only too easily as easily as emptying out the crystal ashtray on the desk which looked very clean and brightly polished one of kritzingers duties perhaps i dont know that i expected to find anything i was just being nosy but like any detective i felt i had the licence to indulge this tendency which only feels like a vice when it is accompanied by something more venial like envy or greed there was nothing in there i really coveted although i had always wanted a nice desk with a comfortable office chair but maybe this furniture was a little too grandiose for my purpose all the same i sat down spread my hands along the reichsprotectors desk leaned back in his chair glanced around the room for a moment handled some of the books on his shelves mostly popular fiction looked over his many photographs inspected the blotter for some recent correspondence there wasnt any and then decided i was very glad i wasnt reinhard heydrich not for all the world would i have changed places with that man the leather desk diary was full of appointments and not much else there were many previous meetings at the wolfs lair in rastenburg at the berghof at the reich chancellery and future evenings at the circus strangely that was underlined a day at rastenburg a weekend at karinhall a night at the deutsches opernhaus christmas at the lower castle and then a january conference at an ss villa in grosser wannsee as heydrichs detective would i be required to go to all of these places rastenburg the reich chancellery the thought of actually meeting hitler filled me with horror i searched the wastepaper bin underneath the desk and found only a sock with a hole in it there were no office drawers for me to search if heydrich had secret files they were certainly kept somewhere secret i looked around the room the safe i decided at last was behind the portrait of hitler and so it proved but i wasnt about to try and open it even my impertinence had its limits besides there were things i really didnt want to know especially the secret things that heydrich knew the heavily lined curtains looked like they belonged in a theatre and might easily have afforded me a hiding place if someone came into the study the big windows were as thick as my little finger and quite possibly bulletproof too at the back of the curtains were a couple of machine pistols and a box of grenades heydrich wasnt leaving much to chance if anyone attacked him in his house he clearly intended to defend himself to the last but did i want him or one of his adjutants to catch me in there perhaps being thrown out of his office might also have resulted in my being thrown off the case and sent back to berlin in disgrace which seemed like an outcome devoutly to be wished but it didnt happen and finally after id been in there for almost fifteen minutes i got up and went out onto the landing still unobserved the next door along from heydrichs study was a suite of rather more feminine rooms doubtless these had been set aside for lina heydrich where among the rosepatterned sofas elegant chairs and long mirrors was a dressing table as big as a messerschmitt i went downstairs and managed to creep unnoticed past the open door of the dining room which was full of cauliflower nearer the back garden i put my head around the door of a play room and then a nursery as yet i had no knowledge of the extensive servants quarters in the basement so i descended a narrow flight of stairs and walked along a dimly lit corridor that seemed to serve as the spine and nervous system of the house even on a sunny day like this one the stoneflagged basement corridor felt more like the lockup at the alex although it smelled a lot better kahlo was right about that in the big kitchen several cooks were hard at work preparing the next course of lunch which was being served by waiters whose faces were more familiar they regarded me with suspicion and alarm fendler the footman id spoken to earlier who happened to be smoking a cigarette near the back door came over and asked me if was lost i said i wasnt of course but a little deterred by the horrified looks i was getting i was about to return upstairs and get some lunch after all when at the furthest dimmest end of the corridor a door opened and an ss sergeant whom i was certain id never seen before came out closed the door carefully behind him and then went into the room opposite in the moment before the door closed i saw a brightly lit busy room containing what looked like a telephone switchboard and thinking that this was as good a time as any to introduce myself in person there was another call to the alex i wanted to place i went along the corridor and opened the door immediately a burlylooking ss corporal jumped up from a wooden bench threw down his newspaper and blocked my way at the same time he kicked another door shut behind him but not before i caught a glimpse of several large taperecorders and seated in front of them some more ss men wearing headphones im sorry sir said the corporal but im afraid you cant come in here im a police officer i showed him my warrant disc commissar gunther from the alex general heydrich has given me the run of the house to investigate a murder i dont care who you are sir you cant come in here this is a restricted area whats your name corporal you dont need to know that sir you dont need to know anything about what happens in here it doesnt concern you or your particular investigation my particular investigation thats my call corporal not yours what is this place anyway and what happens behind that door it looks like deutsches grammophon in there im afraid im going to have to insist that you leave sir right now corporal did you know that youre obstructing a police officer in the execution of his duty i have no intention of leaving until i have a full explanation of whats going on in here by now voices were raised my own included and there had been a certain amount of chestonchest pushing and shoving i was angrier at myself than at the corporal frustrated at having missed finding the loose floorboards before and now irritated to discover what looked to me like a listening post for eavesdropping on the house guests only the corporal didnt know that and when someone appeared behind me in the door i had just come through and i turned around to see who this was the corporal hit me hard i didnt blame him i didnt blame anyone like raising your voice and arguing and pointing blaming people is not something you can do when youre heading down through the black hole that suddenly appears underneath your shoes doctor freud didnt give it a name and strictly speaking you only know what being unconscious really means if a thug with a hardwood fist like a zulus knobkerrie has used this same lethal object to hit you expertly on the back of the neck as if trying to kill a large and argumentative and rather gullible rabbit no wait i did blame someone i blamed myself i blamed myself for not listening to the eavesdropping ss corporal in the first place i blamed myself for missing the trick with the floorboards in kuttners bedroom i blamed myself for taking heydrich at his word and thinking i really did have the run of the house to pursue my investigation but mostly i just blamed myself for thinking it was even possible to behave like a real detective in a world that was owned and run by criminals i dont suppose i was unconscious for longer than a couple of minutes when i came to i could have wished it had been a lot longer another thing you cant do when youre unconscious is feel sick or have a splitting headache or wonder if you should dare to move your legs in case your neck really is broken ignoring the severe pain of opening my eyelids i opened my eyelids and found myself staring down the blunderbussbarrel of a large brandy balloon it was a big improvement on a real blunderbuss or the pistol that these circumstances usually produce i took a deep heady breath of the stuff and let it toast my adenoids for a moment before taking the glass from the hand that was holding it in front of me and then pouring all of the contents carefully tipping my head meant moving my neck down my throat i handed the glass back and found it was kritzinger who took it from me i was in a neat little sitting room with a window onto the basement corridor a small desk a couple of easy chairs a safe and the chaiselongue i was lying on where am i this is my office sir said kritzinger behind him were two ss men one of whom was the corporal who had argued with me a few minutes before the other was major ploetz who hit me i did sir said the corporal what were you trying to do make a bell ring sorry about that sir no dont apologize kritzinger sir give this boy a piece of sugarloaf i reckon he won it fair and square the last time i got hit like that i was wearing a pointy hat and sitting in a trench if only youd listened to me sir said the corporal it looked to me as if thats exactly what youve been doing i rubbed the back of my neck and groaned to me and everyone else in this house orders are orders sir ploetz put his hand on my shoulder how are you feeling captain he sounded oddly solicitous as if he really did care really sir insisted the corporal if id known it was you sir its all right corporal ploetz said smoothly ill handle things from here sure doc sure i said you can pretend theres a perfectly innocent explanation for all that recording equipment and while youre at it ill pretend im a proper detective right now the only thing i am absolutely certain of is the quality of that brandy better pour me another kritzinger i pretend better when ive had a drink dont give him any ploetz told kritzinger and then your tongue is quite loose enough as it is gunther we wouldnt want you to say something to your own detriment especially not now youre in the generals good books i ignored this it didnt sound right clearly the blow on the back of my neck had affected my hearing thats right doc weve got to be careful what we say what is it that the sign says attention the enemy is listening well they are and theyre pretty good at it too arent you boys what were you listening to anyway and dont tell me it was the leader talking about the winter relief something in the meeting room something in the bedrooms maybe youve got a recording of kuttner getting shot that might come in useful for me anyway something in the morning room me perhaps only what would be the point in that i dont mind calling you all crooks and liars to your ugly faces just see if i dont ploetz moved his head in the direction of the door and the two ss men started to leave look gunther ploetz said i think it might be better if you returned to your room and had a liedown ill inform the general of whats happened under the circumstances hell want to know youre all right at this moment a liedown looked very appealing ploetz went outside while kritzinger helped me to my feet are you all right sir would you like me to help you back to your room thanks no ill manage im used to it its an occupational hazard for a policeman being hit it comes of sticking my nose in where its not wanted i should know better by now it used to be that a detective could turn up at a country house question everyone find some recognizable clues and then arrest the butler over chilled cocktails in the library but it hasnt worked out like that im afraid kritzinger im afraid you wont be getting your big moment when everyone realizes what a clever fellow youve been that is disappointing sir perhaps you would care for another brandy after all i shook my head no i expect doctor ploetz is right i do talk too much it comes of not having any answers i dont suppose you know who shot captain kuttner no sir he smiled a fleeting smile and then scratched the back of his head awkwardly pity you understand sir that there are lots of things in this house i prefer not to hear but if these things had included a shot or perhaps a snippet of conversation that might shed some light on his unfortunate death then i should certainly tell you commissar really i would however i am certain theres nothing i can tell you i nodded well thats very good of you to say so kritzinger i really think you mean that and i appreciate you saying it really the smile flickered on again for just a second i wonder no i do i flatter myself that perhaps i know your own independent cast of mind one cant help but hear things in a house like this so i noticed consequently i know you believe that i think in a certain way only for what its worth i dont i never have i am a good german like you perhaps i dont know what else to be but unlike you i am not a courageous man if you follow me that iron cross ribbon in your buttonhole says otherwise mister kritzinger thank you sir but that was then i think things were simpler in that war were they not courage was perhaps easier to recognize not only in oneself but in others as well well i was younger then i have a wife now and a child and long ago i concluded that the only practical course of action available to me was simply to do as im told me too i headed for the stairs a little unsteadily it had been a very german conversation as i passed the dining room i noticed that lunch was finishing seeing me heydrich made his excuses to the other cauliflower and smiling nodded toward the drawing room it wasnt every day that heydrich smiled at me i followed him and he led me to the french windows and out onto the terrace where he offered me one of his cigarettes and even condescended to light it for me he did not smoke one himself and he seemed oddly cheerful considering that vaclav moravek continued to elude the gestapo i had only ever seen him like this once before and that had been in june after the french capitulation major ploetz told me what happened to you below stairs he said almost apologetically i should have informed you about the sd listening station but really ive had so much on my plate as if i didnt have enough to do here in bohemia with the three kings and uvod and the traitor x reichsmarshal goring has tasked me to submit to him a comprehensive draft as to how we can sort out the way the jews are being handled in all new territories under german influence well im sure i dont have to tell you what things are like in the east its nothing short of chaos but thats hardly your concern but to come back to the traitor x as you know all of the guests in this house were under suspicion in that respect however by a simple process of elimination our intelligence analysts had narrowed down the search for the traitors identity to one of six or seven officers consequently everything these men said on the least of subjects was of interest to us which is why some of the rooms in the lower castle have concealed microphones just in case one of them should let something important slip you mean like the pension matzky heydrich nodded you know about the microphones do you he grinned yes like the pension matzky and do these rooms here include the morning room yes they do my stomach turned over for a moment not for my own sake as far as heydrich was concerned i was a hopeless case but for kurt kahlos and i started to rack my brains for anything he had said that might have been interpreted as evidence of his disloyalty so youve heard everything that was said in there no not me personally but ive read some of the transcripts kuttners room no my fourth adjutant was hardly important enough to have rated that level of surveillance heydrich made a face which is a pity because if he had been then of course we would now know who it was who pumped two bullets into his chest i let out a weary sigh and tried to put some sort of tolerant understanding face on what had just been revealed to me in my book a traitor is a traitor i can easily see why you should wish to employ every method at your disposal in order to catch him including secret microphones but i just hope youll excuse some of my criminal assistant kahlos looser talk in the morning room you can blame me for a lot of that hes a good man im afraid ive been a bad influence on him on the contrary gunther its thanks to you and your unconventional not to say insubordinate methods that the traitor has now been revealed in fact everything has worked out exactly as i had hoped it would you gunther have been the catalyst that changed everything i dont know who to congratulate more me for having the inspiration of bringing you here in the first place or you for your own stubbornly independent cast of mind i felt my face take on an expression of disbelief yes its quite true it seems that we owe you everything in this matter gunther which makes it all the more unfortunate that your immediate reward should have been to be knocked unconscious by one of our more robust colleagues in the sd for which once again i offer my sincere apologies you were after all merely doing your job a job well done for even as we speak the traitor is under close arrest and on his way to gestapo headquarters in prague but who was it the traitor it was major thummel paul thummel of the abwehr thummel hes a man with a gold party badge isnt he i did say it would turn out to be someone who was apparently above reasonable suspicion but hes also a friend of himmler heydrich smiled yes and that is something of a bonus the acute embarrassment that this particular association will cause the reichsfuhrer will be a great pleasure to behold i cant wait to see himmlers face when i tell the leader for that same reason however its by no means certain that well make any of this stick against thummel we shall of course do our best i nodded im beginning to understand it has something to do with that letter i received this morning from the netherlands doesnt it it does indeed you asked major thummel if he was the same captain thummel who was in the hague in he denied it of course now why why would that be of any interest to you but this was a lie it was a matter of only a few minutes to check through a record of his military service when thummel was a captain in he passed through the hague on his way to paris we know he was in the hague because he visited our military attache at the german embassy but while he was in the hague we also think he met secretly with his czech controller a man named major franck franck and thummel shared a dutch girlfriend named inge vranken i shall want to see your letter of course but it rather looks as if inge vranken was your friend geerts little sister we suspect thummel has been spying for the czechos since as early as february for a long time he was using a radio transmitter to send messages here to prague as you are aware we were intercepting some of that radio traffic what we called the ota intercepts the czechos called him a dont ask me why call sign probably the radio messages were forwarded by courier to the czech government in exile in london that went on for quite a while but then thummel began to get scared he stopped using the radio transmitter altogether and to all intents and purposes it looked as if he had closed up shop thus narrowing our chances of getting him we suspect that uvod despaired of having lost their best agent not least because his material had put the exiled benes government in london in very good odour with winston churchill no more intelligence meant no more operational scraps from the top table so the uvod people set out to reestablish contact with him in berlin in person and for a while that did the trick but with the net closing in he lost his nerve for that too frankly i think hes been expecting this for a while but why why would an old party comrade a man with the confidence of hitler why would such a man spy for the czechos why spy at all thats a good question and im afraid i dont yet know the answer hes still denying everything of course its likely to be several days before we have any idea of the reason behind his treason or even the full extent of his treachery was it possible that thummel had been gustav for a moment i pictured thummel in the hands of the local gestapo and wondered how long it might take them to beat the full extent of his treachery out of the man surely it wont take your people that long heydrich shook his head actually it will as i said thummel has vitamin b we shall have to question him quite carefully himmler would never forgive me if i had him tortured in the short term at least we can but hope that close interrogation will find holes in his story i understand heydrich nodded silently well he said good work gunther as my personal detective you are off to a flying start i think he was heading back through the french windows when i spoke again what i dont entirely understand general is why you murdered captain kuttner heydrich stopped and turned slowly on the heel of his shoe hmm it was you who killed your own adjutant that i am certain of i know how you did it i just dont know why you did it i mean why bother to murder him when you had ample opportunity to have him courtmartialled no i dont understand that not entirely and i certainly dont understand exactly why you had me go to all the trouble of investigating a murder that you yourself had committed heydrich didnt say anything it seemed he was waiting for me to do some more talking before he said anything so i did it felt like i was talking my own neck into a noose but it was hard to imagine it being any more painful than it was now of course i have a few ideas on that score but first if youll permit me sir let me deal with how you killed him heydrich nodded im listening i see you havent denied it to you heydrich laughed gunther there are about three people in the world to whom i ever need to justify myself and youre not one of them nevertheless i should like to hear your explanation of the solution to the crime as you see it on the night before he was murdered you gave kuttner a dose of veronal which unwittingly he drank in a glass of beer it was the only thing kuttner drank that night as he knew to avoid mixing the drug with alcohol but i bet you persuaded him to have just the one everyone else was celebrating after all and what an honour to be served by you i should have thought beer was perfect for your purposes it wasnt so alcoholic that he might refuse and of course beer is bitter so kuttner wouldnt ever have tasted the significant dose of the drug with which youd doctored it but doctor it you certainly did kritzinger reports seeing kuttner looking very tired at around two so the drug was already working its effect but kuttner didnt know that so when he got back to his room he took his regular dose of veronal and actually passed out with one of the pills still in his throat which accounts for how he only had one boot off my guess is that you wanted him to sleep extra soundly although why you didnt just do him in with an overdose im not sure possibly you wanted to make sure he was indeed dead and there is as you must know always something uncertain about an overdose its amazing just how much people can swallow without dying but a bullet is much more certain especially when its fired pointblank to the heart in the morning you let captain pomme and kritzinger try to rouse him before making sure that you were on the scene to authorize them to break down the door and being a general naturally you were first into the bedroom which meant you were also the one who was able to take charge and examine kuttners drugged body and pronounce him dead naturally they took your word for it general youre not an easy man to contradict sir judging by his appearance of course it hardly looked at all probable that he was still alive he was half dressed from the night before and there was an open bottle of veronal on the bedside table so everyone assumed that the obvious explanation was the correct one kuttner had taken an overdose possibly intentionally after all most of his fellow officers were aware hed had some sort of breakdown and was dead no one suspected that he had been shot because the fact is he hadnt been shot not at that moment at that moment he was only unconscious having ordered kritzinger to call an ambulance and captain pomme to fetch doctor jury you were now alone in the room with the captains unconscious body doctor jurys room is in the other wing of the house so you knew pomme would take several minutes to return with him apart from the telephone in your office the nearest telephone is on the ground floor so kritzinger was far away too all the same you probably waited a few minutes just to make sure that no one was around before closing the door as best you were able there was now plenty of time for you to produce a gun from inside your fencing jerkin pull aside his tunic and coolly fire two shots in rapid succession into kuttners body at close range killing him instantly because he was still wearing his tunic the gunshot wounds were not immediately obvious to anyone who had already seen the body moreover these wounds didnt bleed much either because kuttner was lying on his back not to mention the convenient effect that the extra veronal would have had on the dead mans blood pressure heydrich listened patiently still denying nothing folding his arms he placed a thoughtful finger across his thin lips he might have been considering some plan for the evacuation of pragues jews you put the gun back inside your jerkin then you opened the window just to help ventilate the room a little more just in case someone caught a whiff of the shots when you opened the window thats when you saw the footman fendler with the ladder you told him that the ladder was no longer required that poor kuttner was dead of an overdose because after all you were obliged to pay lip service to what at that moment everyone else believed then you did a quick search on the bed and the floor for the spent brass you wanted to pick this up so that you could help to muddy the waters and add to the mystery that was bound to attach to a murder in a room locked from inside that might have taken a while theyre elusive things when you need to find them in a hurry of course if someone had entered the room you would have given some excuse about looking for clues after all there were pills on the floor you were just picking them up you are a policeman after all maybe it was you who chucked them there for effect set dressing so to speak but to me it never seemed right that the veronal bottle remained upright on the table when there were pills on the floor having found the two spent brass cartridges you flung them along the corridor lit a cigarette to help conceal the smell of the two shots although as i discovered for myself a little while ago it isnt particularly noticeable and certainly no more noticeable than the noise of two shots i fired my own pistol in kuttners room while you were all eating lunch and of course no one noticed a thing most people assume a noise like that is something else something a little less dramatic a car backfiring a vase of flowers knocked over a door slammed by a careless footman of course you already know that ill bet you even conducted a similar experiment yourself when you were planning this whole thing it was about then that captain pomme and doctor jury arrived in the room doctor jury was a good choice for one thing jury was possibly still drunk and at the very least badly hungover and he probably didnt even notice that the dead man was still bleeding only that hed been shot again no one was about to suspect your own first version of events besides there was now an even bigger mystery in front of everyones eyes which is how a man could be found shot dead in a room locked on the inside with no murder weapon on the scene its a useful thing mystery any stage conjurer knows the value of misdirection you draw attention to what one hand is doing while the other hand does the dirty work people do love a good mystery dont they you included general perhaps you more than most on your bookshelves i found a wellread copy of a detective novel by that writer you mentioned to me when i arrived here agatha christie its a novel called the murder of roger ackroyd and i only had to flick through it for a few minutes to see that the book contains certain similarities with this case a body in a locked room only that person roger ackroyd isnt dead at all not in the beginning and its the person who supposedly finds the body doctor sheppard isnt it who turns out to be the murderer as indeed you are in fact i wouldnt mind betting thats where you got the idea in the first place but my neck and my head hurt and i just cant figure out why why would you murder your mothers favourite piano pupil it couldnt be that could it jealousy no not you that would be much too human of you general heydrich sir no there has to be some other reason something much more important than personal revenge i paused and lit another cigarette well dont stop there said heydrich youre doing so well and i have to confess im actually quite impressed this is more than i had expected of you gunther he nodded firmly keep going i insist for old times sake youd rescued albert kuttners career that was oddly sentimental of you and quite out of character if you dont mind me saying so sir or perhaps you did it at someone elses request kuttners father your mother perhaps youd best leave my mother out of this gunther if you dont mind gladly youd rescued albert kuttners career only to discover that as you told me yourself he was a disappointment more than just a disappointment hed become something of a nuisance even an embarrassment kuttner was insubordinate for example there was that scene at the officers training school with colonel jacobi and what was worse you had found out he was quite possibly homosexual too after what happened to ernst rohm and some of his warmer friends in the sa that was too much did you worry that you might be tainted with an association like that i wonder in germany its one thing to be suspected of being a jew as you are and quite another to be suspected of being soft on homosexuals even then however you could have sent kuttner quietly back to berlin to one of those nice private clinics in wannsee where top nazis go to dry out or be weaned off drugs some of them even claim they can cure you of homosexuality so you must have had an important reason to murder him in cold blood like that there must have been some sort of gain in it for you but what excellent youre almost there heydrich lit a cigarette and looked very amused as if i was telling him a very funny story it made me suspect that he had a better punchline than the one i had written myself but i was in too far now to stop everything you do has a reason doesnt it general whether its murdering jews or murdering your own adjutant heydrich shook his head dont get sidetracked he said keep to the point but why have me investigate the murder at first i assumed it was because you thought i wasnt up to the job that you wanted me to screw up but that was too obvious you could have picked anyone for the job willy abendschoen from the local kripo is a good man i hear clever efficient or you could have picked someone more pliable than either of us unless of course that was exactly what you wanted someone who doesnt care about his future in the sd someone who is just pigheaded enough to ask the difficult questions that the cauliflowers might not care to answer someone for whom advancement and promotion is not an issue me yes that must be it you picked me to handle the investigation of kuttners murder because you really wanted me to search for your spy you used the murder of kuttner as a pretext for a secret spy hunt now youre on to it said heydrich you couldnt risk some flatfooted idiot questioning all of your spy suspects about being the traitor x or a or whatever hes called not without putting them on their guard but if i questioned them all about something else something serious that necessitated their being detained here then all of them might relax more or less since each knew he was innocent of murder and of course my conversations with them were being recorded transcribed picked over by your own sd analysts for something small an inconsistency perhaps a clue real evidence you didnt know exactly what it was but you thought you would recognize it when you saw it and youre right thats all a clue really is i have to hand it you sir its clever utterly ruthless but clever heydrich clapped his hands three times to me it sounded almost ironic but there was it seemed some genuine appreciation in his congratulations well done i underestimated you gunther ive always assumed that as a policeman you were the more muscular type tough resourceful and irritatingly dogged but hardly intellectual it seems i was wrong about that you have a much better brain than i gave you credit for i had hoped you might uncover the spy its true but i did not expect you would also solve the murder that has been a real bonus but now i really am intrigued i want to know i must have made a mistake exactly how did you conclude that it was me who shot captain kuttner sorry to disappoint you it wasnt anything clever at all oh come on youre being unnecessarily modest actually you told me yourself just a few minutes ago only i and the doctor who carried out the autopsy knew that kuttner had been shot twice even jury didnt notice that and i kept it secret in the hope that eventually the real killer would mention two shots when everyone else believes that it was just the one shot that killed him heydrich frowned is that all to my delight he sounded disappointed what else is there im not one for crossword puzzles general or detective novels actually i really cant stand them me im just a plain oldfashioned cop and you described me rather well a moment ago when you said i was irritatingly dogged i dont have the better brain you gave me credit for these days i wouldnt know what to do with it you see sir most murders arent complicated people just think they are the same goes for the detection process there are no great scenes of revelation theres just the small stuff and thats where i come in really if detective work was as difficult as it seems in the books then they wouldnt let cops do it yes i take your point heydrich sighed but now i have another question and perhaps you should answer this one more carefully i nodded what do you think youre going to do about it i didnt answer i didnt know what could i do against a man of heydrichs standing and authority what i mean is are you intending to try to arrest me perhaps to make a scene you murdered someone general youre right of course and i did regret having rescued kuttners career i could have lived with his behaviour in and after latvia what happened to him there is by no means unusual which is of course why reichsmarshal goring has charged me with finding a better solution to this problem i could even have lived with his behaviour to colonel jacobi the two of them have some history it seems however jacobi is a prick and frankly anyone who gets the better of that man is to be admired rather than condemned but i was shocked when berlins gestapo informed me that my own adjutant was probably homosexual not that he was very obvious about it indeed i was so sceptical that i sent him along to pension matzky where im afraid to say he disgraced himself with a girl called grete when he failed to perform with her unfortunately she mocked his inadequacy and earned herself a beating he was very apologetic about it afterwards he even sent her some flowers by way of compensation most bizarrely he then seems to have adopted an entirely opposite opinion of the poor girl and decided that he felt some romantic attachment for her im sure there are medical explanations for his mental state but if there are i have no time for them that was when i decided to get rid of him i dislike men who are violent to women almost as much as i dislike men who are unreliable anyway if i had sent him back to berlin in disgrace it wouldnt have been long before he disgraced himself again and more importantly disgraced his family in halle i couldnt have that i am very fond of those people fond enough to want to spare them any further pain so i thought it was better for him to be quietly murdered by me in a way that can be easily hushed up rather than allow his family to endure the public disgrace that would follow his being sentenced to some ss punishment battalion indeed it already seems to me much more probable that at some stage in the hopefully not too distant future captain kuttner will become an unfortunate victim of vaclav moravek and heroically shot by him while trying to assist in the czech terrorists arrest we may even have to award him a posthumous decoration thats a story that should play well at home dont you think why not he is as good a nazi hero as any others i can think of heydrich smirked yes i thought you might approve you were wrong about one thing however i couldnt ever have risked wasting so much time searching for my spent brass on the floor of kuttners room so i had the gun inside a sock so that it could be fired without any of the spent brass being ejected onto the floor or the bed it all stayed safely inside the sock until as you say i threw it into the corridor anyway having decided to kill him it was as you say the murder of roger ackroyd that gave me the idea of how to do it i then wondered if i might put his death to some useful purpose if i could rely on you to be your usual awkward self and pose a lot of awkward questions to people like henlein frank von eberstein hildebrandt thummel and von neurath whom weve had our doubts about for some time and you came up trumps nothing youve said can spoil what im feeling now and youll no doubt be pleased to discover that you will have advanced my reputation even further the apprehension of the traitor x will put me in very good odour with the leader ever since the invasion of poland the traitor has been a thorn in our side no more and my triumph will be complete just as soon as the third of the three kings is in my hands you see now that i have thummel it cant be very long before everything is neatly wrapped up hardly i said im not about to let you get away with murder general were getting away with it every minute murmured heydrich i thought you knew that kuttner had it coming for all i know but even in the ss there are standards that have to be adhered to military discipline due process probably it will cost me my job even my life but i can at least try to bring you down youre a fool if you think you can bring me down but then i think you know that already dont you its certainly true you can cause a bit of trouble for me gunther himmler wont thank me for exposing paul thummel and naturally the investigation will have to be entirely above reproach very possibly that will involve you in which case i can hardly have you shot or sent to a concentration camp no i can see im going to have to provide you with a better more urgent reason than your loyalty to me one that will make sure you keep your mouth shut about all of this i shook my head i dont think thats going to happen sir not this time do try to be sporting about this gunther at least let me try if you like heydrich threw away his cigarette and glanced at his wristwatch well go straight to gestapo headquarters there if you wish you can make out your own report in as much detail as you like pecek palace is the proper place to bring charges against me that is if i cant provide you with a better reason than simple selfpreservation i dare say you have people there who can persuade anyone to do anything oh you misunderstand me gunther you werent listening perhaps i said i was going to give you a much better reason to keep your mouth shut than selfpreservation and i meant it youre quite safe from that sort of thing i can assure you im going to give you something much more compelling than violence against your person gunther shall we i nodded but something told me that i had already lost that this was one murderer who was almost certain to get away quite unscathed it was threethirty in the afternoon when heydrich and i got into the mercedes with klein and started out for the centre of prague no one said very much but it was obvious that heydrich was in a good humour humming a pleasantsounding melody that was the very opposite to the threnody playing inside my own thick skull nearing the railway line that led west to masaryk station we overtook a horsedrawn hearse headed south for the olsany cemetery the mourners walking behind looked at heydrich with baleful eyes as if somehow they held him responsible for the death of the person they were escorting to church for all i knew that was true and the sight of his distinctive ss car must have been like catching a glimpse of the grim reaper himself you could feel the hate following us like xrays and despite heydrichs overbearing confidence that he was invincible it was clear to me that the hatred directed at him could just as easily have been a hail of machinegun bullets an ambush was the best way to kill heydrich and once you were in that car anything might happen if it had happened right then and there i wouldnt have minded that much by the time we reached the outskirts of the city what little confidence i had of making something stick to heydrich had faded optimism has its limits i was an idealist and ahead of me lay an unpleasant possibly painful even fatal demonstration of just where idealism could get you a jail cell a beating a train ride to the concentration camp being built around the fortress of terezin a bullet in the back of the head heydrich might have assured me i was safe but i had little confidence in his assurances and thoughts of my own peril overpowered any other ideas of just what the man sitting in front of the car whose own mind seemed more preoccupied with schubert and his trout had in store to deflect me from any attempt to bring charges against him so we drove on to what promised to be some sort of final reckoning between us pecek palace formerly a czech bank was part of a government area that was home to several tall and rusticated grey buildings any one of which could have been gestapo headquarters but the real hq was easy to spot at the end of the street surrounded as it was with checkpoints and bedecked with two long nazi banners it was a grim granite edifice that was a nearcopy of the gestapos central hq in berlins prinz albrechtstrasse with huge castiron lamps that belonged on an ogres castle and a doriccolumned portico that might have seemed elegant but for several ss men who were grouped out front easily recognizable with their leather coats porkknuckle faces and pugilists manners none of them looked as though they would have turned a short hair to see a defenestrated czech crash onto the black cobbles in front of their cold eyes five storeys above the street the balustrade featured stone vases that resembled giant funeral urns certainly it wouldnt have surprised the czechs to have been told that this was what these were used for after three years of occupation the gestapo at pecek palace had the most fearsome reputation in all of europe klein stopped the car at the entrance and the guards came to attention i followed heydrich through the wroughtiron doors and up a short shiny limestone staircase that was lit by a large brass chandelier at the top of the stairs were some glass doubledoors lined with green curtains and in front of these were two ss guards a pair of nazi flags and between them a portrait of the leader the one by heinrich knirr that made him look like a queer hairdresser to the left was a reception area where i presented my identification and endured the awllike scrutiny of the uniformed nco on duty tell colonel bohme to come and fetch us heydrich told the nco and then to me im lost in here a common experience i imagine bohme is the one who thought he could solve kuttners murder said heydrich are you going to tell him or shall i oh i know you find it hard to credit but i take a lot of vicarious pleasure in your solving kuttners murder i mean i can admire it as a piece of reasoning and im very much looking forward to seeing the expression on his stupid saxon face id been kind of looking forward to that myself bohme was the other officer who straightened kuttners tie after your speech the other night when he rescued the maid rosa from henleins clumsy drunken pass i shall miss the opportunity of making him feel like he had something to hide youre a natural contrarian gunther observed heydrich i think your problem is not with the nazis its with all authority you just dont like being told what to do maybe i glanced around major thummels here i said yes is bohme questioning him abendschoen is leading the interrogation hes much more agile than bohme if anyone can trip thummel up without breaking skin its willy abendschoen a minute or two passed before we heard footsteps coming up the broad stairs bohme arrived at the top of the stairs and marched smartly across the hall and into the reception area he saluted in the usual nazi way and under the circumstances i didnt bother returning the compliment but heydrich did lets go and see the prisoner shall we said heydrich bohme led the way back across the hall and downstairs at the bottom of the stairs we walked on through a warren of unpleasant smelling and dimly lit corridors and cells i hear its down to you captain gunther that we found thummel was the traitor bohme told me congratulations thank you bohme paused outside a cell door here we are not only that but he has also solved the murder of captain kuttner said heydrich then youve really covered yourself in glory havent you said bohme so who did it i glanced at heydrich whats the game general i said if youve got a card to play here then youd better play it only dont treat me like an idiot in spite of all that an idiot is what you are said heydrich a very clever idiot only a clever man could have deduced who murdered captain kuttner how and why but only an idiot could have behaved as you did heydrich pushed open the door to a large interrogation room that was complete with stenographer several wooden chairs some chains hanging from the ceiling and an en suite bath besides the stenographer there were two largish men in the room and a naked woman only an idiot could have been so easily duped by the czechs said heydrich by her he pointed at the girl it was almost as well he identified her because she was nearly unrecognizable the naked girl was arianne tauber as soon as i saw arianne i moved to help her and found myself solidly restrained by bohme and another largish man whod been standing unseen by me behind the heavy wooden door of the interrogation room restrained and then on heydrichs order searched for a nonexistent weapon and quickly manacled on a length of chain to a castiron radiator as big as a mattress safely out of harms way i hauled at the chain attached to my wrists and swore loudly but no one was paying much attention to me i was like a dog that had been safely kennelled or worse heydrich laughed and that was the cue for the others to do the same even the stenographer a young hatchetfaced woman in ss uniform shook her head and smiled as if she was genuinely amused by my threats and bad language then she straightened the little forage cap she was wearing and adjusted the grip that kept it on her head she must have sensed me wishing i could have smacked it onto the floor i glanced around the windowless room it was as big as a chapel in a disused church the walls were tiled in peagreen dusty bare light bulbs hung from the heavily cobwebbed ceiling the floor was covered with pools of water there was a slight smell of excrement in the cold air i hauled some more upon my chain to no effect it seemed my situation was as helpless as ariannes seemed hopeless she did not move her battered purple eyes remained closed like sea anemones her wet hair was coiled around her face like dark yellow snakes on the head of a dead medusa there was blood in her nostrils and she appeared to have lost some fingernails but she was not dead the edges of her bare breasts shifted a little as breath entered and left her body she could not move because she was strapped onto a wooden bascule she was not however about to be guillotined although that was the point of the bascule to restrain the body and transport the head of a condemned person smoothly through a lunette so that he or she might be quickly decapitated by the falling axe arianne was strapped onto the bascule for an altogether different but almost as unpleasant reason the bascule was positioned precipitously over the end of a bath full of pinkishbrown water so that it worked very like a lever one of ariannes torturers had his foot on the end of the bascule just under her bare feet and all he had to do to allow the wooden board carrying her body to tip forward on the fulcrum that was the lip of the bath was to move his black boot a few centimetres then she would fall head first into the water and remain there until either she drowned or her torturers decided to lift the bascule up again it was ingeniously simple and although the bath was smeared with blood as if the bascule sometimes fell awkwardly and perhaps that explained the several contusions on her eyes cheeks and forehead it was obviously effective at the end of my chain i was at least a metre away from everyone and this seemed to suggest that others before me had stood where i was chained to the same radiator and obliged to watch friends being tortured i couldnt even kick the edge of the stenographers neat little cornertable with its typewriter pencil notebook magazine coffeecup and nailfile but i promised myself that if the bitch started filing her nails while arianne was being tortured i would take off my shoe and throw it at her looking at arianne it was impossible to believe she was the same woman i had left behind at the imperial hotel that morning somehow heydrich or the sd or the gestapo had discovered something about arianne that had persuaded them to arrest her but what only she and i knew about gustav and the envelope he had asked her to give to franz koci nobody else knew anything nobody but gustav and even if paul thummel was indeed gustav it seemed impossible that her arrest could be connected with his not yet they had to have picked her up at the station before i had identified paul thummel as traitor x has she talked heydrich asked bohme the other man pulled a face well of course sir what a question you think so what about masin and balaban you couldnt get them to talk could you you had those two czechos for five months before you managed to get anything out of them they were exceptionally strong and determined men sir well im not surprised now that ive been in here to me this hardly looks like torture somehow i imagined something much worse back at my gymnasium in halle we used to do this sort of thing to other boys just for sport with all due respect sir theres not much thats worse than the water bascule short of death itself which would hardly be to the purpose no other torture quite persuades as much that you are surely about to die i see so what has she told us bohme approached the stenographer who handed him a few sheets of typed paper these he passed to heydrich and while the reichsprotector glanced over what was written there one of ariannes tormentors slapped her bruised cheeks to bring her out of a faint with the sleeves of their striped civilian shirts rolled up above their substantial biceps and their collars removed ariannes tormentors looked ready for work the man with his foot on the bascule was examining his knuckles probably inspecting them for damage his blond hair was almost white and he seemed indifferent to ariannes suffering the other man was smoking a cigarette that stayed in his mouth while he was slapping her come on he said almost kindly like a father speaking to a child who was lagging behind on a sunday afternoon walk in the park thats it arianne wakeywake say hello to our important visitors arianne retched bath water and some vomit that was part blood and then coughed for almost a minute come on open your eyes she started to shiver probably from shock as much as the cold but still she didnt open her eyes at least not until her fatherly interrogator sucked at his cigarette for a second peeled it off his lower lip and then touched her breast with it arianne opened her eyes and screamed thats the girl said the man who had burned her it was odd how sorry he looked i thought almost as if he regretted hurting her as if he wouldnt have hurt anyone by choice right up until the moment he smiled a smile that was as thin as a razor and then burned her breast a second time for the pleasure of it i could see that now he enjoyed giving pain arianne screamed again and started to weep invisible tears please stop this i pleaded heydrich ignored me he finished reading the transcript of the interrogation and handed the pages back to bohme is this really all that she knows do you think he asked bohme shrugged thats a little hard to say sir weve only had her for a few hours at this stage theres no telling how much she knows about anything so it was true her arrest had preceded paul thummels in which case they couldnt be connected sergeant soppa isnt it heydrich was looking at the very blond man whose foot was on the water board sir i believe you are something of an expert in matters like this it was you who got balaban to talk wasnt it finally yes sir what is your opinion sergeant soppa shifted his feet a little but still managed to keep ariannes head aloft she looked like a human torpedo that at any moment he might launch into the water in my experience they always keep something back to the end sir he said ruefully theres always one important thing that theyll hold onto until the last for their own selfrespect you might say and they figure youll miss it because theyve already told you absolutely everything else its only when theyre begging to tell you something they think you dont know anything that you can be sure youve got everything there is to be had out of them which means that its always best to keep the interrogation going for longer than seems decent heydrich nodded yes he said i see what you mean so then i think we shall have to know if she knows something that we dont yet know heydrich nodded at sergeant soppa who immediately took a step back so that the bascule carrying ariannes naked body tipped forward and hit the water with a splash head first there was a horrible gurgling sound like a drain trying to clear itself arianne was swallowing water her hands and feet flailed helplessly under their restraints like the fins of a landed fish then soppa picked up a length of thick rubber cable that was lying on the wet floor and started to beat arianne hard the way no living creature not even a stubborn mule should ever be beaten each blow of the cable snapped loudly on her flesh and sounded like a dangerous electrical shortcircuit i watched her beautiful body endure this for several seconds i remembered the exquisite pleasure we had given each other just a few hours before in the hotel room back at the imperial that seemed a very long time ago now more than that it seemed like another life in another place where cruelty and pain did not exist worse than this the body i had known and kissed so tenderly already seemed like a different one from the one i was looking at now why had i agreed to bring her to prague i could easily have refused her request to accompany me surely this was all my fault i had perhaps foreseen something like this happening only not quickly enough her hair floated and twisted in the water like yellow seaweed there was only so much of this kind of treatment she could take that anyone could take i told myself i had to do something and i hauled on the chain with all my strength but i was helpless to help her at this realization i felt an unpleasant sensation and taste arrive in my mouth from my gut and i spat it out onto the wet floor if id thought i might have spat it at heydrich for christs sake youre killing her i yelled no said soppas smiling colleague not at all his tone was scoffing you might say that were the ones keeping her alive believe me you have to know what youre doing to take someone right to the edge like this to almost kill them and then not kill them thats the skill sir besides this little bitch is a lot tougher than she looks she might panic a bit if ever she was to go swimming again but no we wont kill her he glanced at heydrich not unless he tells us to do it ariannes head stayed under the water but sergeant soppa stopped beating her for a moment wiped his brow and nodded thats right weve been helping people to take the waters in prague like this for a while now just like marienbad it is this place or bad kissingen he grinned at his own attempt at humour then he started beating her again after a few seconds i turned my face to the wall and closing my eyes against the edge of my vision i pressed my forehead against the cold hard tiles these felt like heydrichs conscience i might have closed my eyes but i could hardly close my ears and the awful combination of sound that was arianne drowning while she took a dreadful beating continued for another fifteen long seconds before i heard the ghastly dripping creak of the bascule being lifted out of the bath and the banshee rasp of her trying painfully to drag air into lungs that were already bloated with water by now i was absolutely certain that colonel bohme was right there was not much that was worse than the water board just listening to it seemed bad enough and when i looked again i saw arianne was just a few centimetres above the surface of the water dripping wet trembling uncontrollably her body galvanized with the spasms that were her agonized attempts to breathe and covered with fresh livid welts sergeant soppa had thrown aside his cable and had the heel of his hand on the edge of the water board ready to do exactly the same thing again the very second that heydrich or bohme gave him the order soppas colleague tossed away his cigarette and turned on a tap to pour some more water into the bath had she swallowed that much or had it just spilled onto the floor it was hard to tell then he lifted ariannes head by the hair shook it like a handbell and spoke into her ear is there anything you want to tell us darling he asked something close to your heart next time well fucking drown you if we have to wont we sarge sure said soppa and ill fuck her while shes drowning he stroked ariannes bare behind with lascivious intent and then patted it fondly ask her ask her if she knows where vaclav moravek is hiding said heydrich soppas colleague repeated the question into ariannes ear she gulped loudly and whispered no ive told you everything i know ive never heard of vaclav moravek please you have to believe me she swallowed another painful breath belched and tried to say something else but her previous answer drew a sneer and then a nod from heydrich which was the cue for another ducking and this time her head banged against the side of the bath as she fell into the water her body struggled against the leather straps and the buckles which cut cruelly into her skin so that a thin trickle of blood ran down her shoulders and dripped into the turbulent bath water i held my own breath at the same time as she went under the water so that i could at least experience some small part of her ordeal but this time they kept her under for much longer than a minute and when with my lungs bursting i realized i could hold my own breath for no longer i let it out with a yell even as ariannes struggles appeared to have ended for good her hands and feet stopped moving the water calmed all was still including my heart pull her up you bastards is she dead asked heydrich no said soppa not by a long chalk not to worry sir weve brought people round who were under the water for much longer than that he and the other man lifted arianne out of the bath and proceeded to use a combination of smelling salts slaps brandy and massage to try to put some life back into her leave her alone i pleaded for gods sake she hasnt done anything you think so said heydrich im afraid that youre wrong about that gunther at least that was the impression i gained from colonel bohme on the telephone just before lunchtime he turned and faced the stenographer read the captain what shes already told us please yes sir just the salient points if you will yes sir the stenographer picked up her transcript and read entirely without emotion like someone announcing the arrival or departure of a train question what is your name and address answer my name is arianne tauber and i live in a room at flat uhland strasse berlin which is owned by frau marguerite lippert i have lived there for ten months i work at the jockey bar on luther strasse where i am employed to be the cloakroom attendant question you are a berliner answer no originally i am from dresden my mother still lives there she lives in johann georgen allee question so why are you here in prague answer i am on holiday i came here with a friend i was staying at the imperial hotel question what is the name of that friend answer kripo commissar bernhard gunther from the police praesidium at berlin alexanderplatz i am his mistress he will vouch for me he works for general heydrich clearly there has been some mistake here i spent the weekend with him and i was going home to berlin when i was arrested question do you know why you were arrested at the masaryk station this morning answer no clearly theres been some sort of mistake here ive never been in any trouble before i am a good german a lawabiding citizen commissar gunther will vouch for me so will my employers question but arent you also working for uvod answer i dont know what you mean by that what is uvod i do not understand question uvod is the home resistance network here in prague we know you are working for uvod why prisoner refused to answer the question prisoner refused to answer the question prisoner refused to answer the question answer yes i am working for uvod following the deaths of my husband and my father in february and may for which i held adolf hitler ultimately responsible i decided to work for a foreign government against the national socialist government of germany since i am from dresden and my mother is czech it seemed logical that this foreign government should be czech question how did you go about establishing contact with uvod prisoner refused to answer the question heydrich interrupted the stenographer perhaps i did not make myself entirely clear my dear young woman he said patiently i asked you to read out only the salient points what i meant was that it will save a great deal of time if you omit all mention of when the prisoner refused to answer a question the stenographer coloured a little im sorry sir now continue yes sir question how did you go about establishing contact with uvod answer i made contact with an old friend from university called friedrich rose in dresden a sudeten german communist who put me in contact with a czech terrorist organization that is part of the central leadership of home resistance uvod i am part czech myself and i speak a little czech and i was pleased when having investigated my background they accepted me into their organization they said a native german could be very useful to their cause which is all that i wanted after my husband died on a uboat all i wanted was for the war to be over for germany to be defeated question what did they ask you to do answer they asked me to leave dresden and to undertake a special mission on their behalf in berlin question what was this mission prisoner refused to sorry sir after a short pause while she tracked down the transcript with a wellmanicured fingernail the stenographer started reading again answer at the request of uvod i joined the berlin transport company in the autumn of and worked for the bvg director herr julius vahlen as his personal secretary and sometime mistress it was my job to monitor wehrmacht troop movements through berlins anhalter station and to report on these movements to my czech contact in berlin this i did for several months question who was your contact answer my contact was a former czech german army officer i knew only as detmar i didnt know his surname i would give him a list of the troop movements on a weekly basis the troop movements were passed on to london i think detmar would give me some more instructions and some money i was always short of money living in berlin is so much more expensive than dresden question what else did detmar tell you to do answer at first i had to do very little just give him the troop movement reports but then in december detmar asked me to help the three kings organization in berlin to plant a bomb in the station this was much more important work and much more dangerous too first of all i had to obtain a plan of the station building and then when the bomb was ready i had to prime it and put it in a place where it had been decided it would cause the most damage question who taught you how to prime a bomb answer i am a qualified chemist i studied chemistry at university i know all about handling difficult materials its not difficult to prime a bomb im better at that than i was as a stenographer question what was the purpose of that bomb answer the purpose of the bomb at anhalter station was to cause panic to demoralize the population of berlin and to disrupt troop movements in and out of the city question wasnt the real reason for planting that bomb altogether different wasnt the real reason that you had inside information about the train belonging to the reichsfuhrerss heinrich himmler that was due to be leaving the station and that the bomb was meant to kill him answer yes i admit that this bomb was really designed to assassinate the reichsfuhrerss heinrich himmler i planted the bomb in the left luggage office in february this is right by the platform where himmlers train was to leave from and even more importantly the office is also beside the place on the platform where himmlers personal carriage was usually located the assassination was unsuccessful because the bomb was not powerful enough it was meant to bring down a joist on top of the train and it didnt question then what happened after the failed assassination answer with the war in europe more or less won it was decided by my controller that troop movements in germany were of less importance to uvod and a few months afterwards i left the bvgs employment i was not unhappy about this as my boss herr vahlen was besotted with me and something of a nuisance thereafter i worked in a series of nightclubs especially the jockey club where i was supposed to befriend germans from the foreign ministry in order to sleep with them and get information useful to the czech cause i did this again i was short of money and sometimes i was obliged to sleep with some of these men in the foreign ministry for money so that i could keep myself i also worked for uvod as a courier then in the summer of my contact detmar was replaced by another czech called victor keil i do not know what happened to detmar and i dont know victors real name but we were very uncomfortable comrades victor was a very demanding man to work for and i did not like him at all he was not brave like detmar he was fearful and he did not inspire much confidence he didnt understand my situation at all how difficult it was for me in berlin and we often quarrelled usually about money question tell me what victor asked you to do for him answer he gave me a gun and asked me to shoot someone for uvod i dont know the mans name all i had to do was meet the man and shoot him i didnt want to do this i was worried the gun would attract too much attention and id get caught so victor gave me a knife and ordered me to use that instead again i refused i am not a murderer so victor murdered the man himself at a railway station in berlin where i had arranged to meet him he was a foreign worker dutch i think and all i had to do was ask him for a light and distract him and victor would commit the murder which he did but it was horrible and i said i couldnt ever do something like that again question what station was this answer the sbahn station at jannowitz bridge question what else did he ask you to do answer victor had come into possession of an important list of czechs who were working for the germans in prague i dont know where he got this list he was intending to return to prague with it leaving me on my own which greatly alarmed me as i suspected he wasnt planning to come back he was scared he was being followed and so temporarily he gave me the list to look after until he was sure he wasnt being shadowed by the gestapo then victor and i quarrelled again about money i was broke and i said that if i was going to stay on in berlin and do important jobs for uvod like help to kill people i wanted more money to cover my expenses wed arranged to meet at the station in nollendorfplatz in the blackout but as he went away there was an accident and victor was knocked down and killed by a taxi which was a disaster question so what did you do then answer i was in real shit here without a contact in berlin i had no way of getting the list of traitors to our people in prague and no way of getting more money so i resolved to try to go there myself and make contact with someone from uvod but it was dangerous and of course i was still very short of money not to mention a suitable cover story to get myself down to prague question so how did you do this answer after victors fatal accident i had become intimate with a police officer called bernhard gunther who was investigating victors death when i met him i didnt know he was a policeman but when he turned up at the bar one night i got a bit suspicious and searched his coat pockets in the cloakroom and found his kripo identification disc at first i thought he was suspicious of me so i decided that the best thing to do would be to seem to take him into my confidence and to throw myself on his mercy and persuade him that i was simply a joygirl who had made a bad mistake when i told him this he didnt know that i knew he was a cop anyway i told him that a man id met in the jockey bar who i knew only as gustav had hired me to give an envelope to a stranger on a railway station in return for a hundred marks i told gunther that i got greedy which is why the transaction went wrong and i also told him i had no idea what the envelope contained as id since lost it question which station was this answer the sbahn station at nollendorfplatz question tell us about gustav answer there never was a gustav in fact it was victor who had given me the envelope and i didnt mention anything about a list of czech agents who were working for the gestapo i just told him about the envelope and that id been looking to make an easy hundred marks subsequently gunther revealed he was a policeman and told me that he believed victor had been working for the czechs and that i was in danger i think it flattered him that he could help me and i allowed a relationship to develop an intimate relationship question tell me more about your relationship with bernhard gunther answer after victor was killed i had no one to help me in berlin i thought of returning to dresden but then the idea of developing gunther as an unwitting source of intelligence presented itself to me i knew he was a senior detective in kripo so i began a relationship with him i told him i loved him and he believed me i think it was dangerous but i felt the possible benefits were worth taking that kind of risk and when he told me he had been posted to prague i saw a way of travelling there in comparative safety and comfort as gunthers mistress this seemed a fantastic opportunity that was too good to ignore after all what better cover could i have for travelling to prague than as a kripo commissars bit on the side he even paid for my ticket and arranged my visa at the alex in all respects he was very kind to me question did commissar gunther know of your involvement with uvod answer no of course not he suspected nothing except perhaps that i had been a whore or very stupid or both either that or he didnt care to ask very much perhaps it was a bit of both he was in love with me and he liked sleeping with me and of course also he was too busy with his own work question did he talk about his work answer no it was very hard to get any information out of him he said it was safer for me that way it took me a while to find out that he was working for general heydrich and that he was coming to prague to work at heydrichs country house but he didnt say what he was doing there question what happened when you arrived in prague answer we arrived in prague and stayed at the imperial hotel we spent the first day together for most of the next day gunther was away on official business he turned up at night to sleep with me which suited me very well as i had the rest of the time to myself i had heard detmar talk about what to do if he and i ever lost contact the places to go for help there was a man in prague a uvod agent called radek i should go to these places myself and try to make contact with this man and i decided to go to these places and ask around for radek it was taking a risk but what choice did i have question what were these places you went to answer elektra its a cafe on hoovera ulice next to the national museum and ca doro a beer restaurant on narodni trida in the same building as the riunione adriatica di sicurta detmar had given me some instructions in how to go about this i should take a red rose wrapped in an old copy of pritomnost and leave it on the table while i ordered something pritomnost is presence the weekly review that masaryk helped to found i could buy a copy on the black market quite easily thats what happened and having made contact with radek in the elektra i do not know his last name i handed over the list of traitors question was it radek who came up with the plan to kill general heydrich this morning answer no it was someone else radek introduced me to id told them about gunther and how he was working at the lower castle in panenskebrezany how a car from gestapo hq with just a driver would come and pick him up and drive him there a plan was quickly conceived the opportunity appeared too good to miss two men from uvod would hijack gunthers ss car and sit on the floor behind the seats so that they might get into the grounds of the castle walk in and shoot everyone and anyone they could hopefully heydrich would be one of these casualties question by which time you would be safely on a train back to berlin answer yes that was the plan question and gunther answer he was also to be shot by the two uvod assassins but the plan went up in smoke when gunthers car from pecek palace was cancelled and the poor fool had to walk to the castle and requisition a car from there after that there seemed little or no choice but to get on the train as arranged id done all i could what will happen to me please thats a very good question said heydrich he turned to me and at the present moment in time as you can see for yourself things are not looking so good for your lady friend but i think it answers your earlier remark gunther that she hadnt done anything now you know she tried to murder himmler she planned to murder me and as many of my guests as possible and she planned to murder you thats quite an achievement it looks as if she played you for a fool wouldnt you say i didnt say anything its fortunate for you im still feeling grateful that you helped us catch paul thummel otherwise you yourself might now be facing what undoubtedly lies ahead of this deeply misguided young woman while the stenographer had been reading arianne had recovered consciousness and was at least alive but she had fainted again and while i could see no way of saving her from execution or at best a concentration camp i did think there was a way of preserving her from further suffering on the water bascule much of what id heard made sense to me but it was obvious that she was still concealing things from her torturers and it was equally obvious that i was now in a position to tell heydrich exactly what i knew and thus save arianne from herself even if that meant putting my own head in the gestapos lunette it was clear that it was me whod been betrayed by her and yet as i started speaking it somehow felt as if it was arianne who was being betrayed by me i guess it made it easier that i despised myself so much not for what was said now but for what hadnt been said before in the ukraine and immediately afterward i hardly counted the short lecture i had given heydrich on my first day at the lower castle i had tried to believe that in spite of all that i had seen and done in the east i was a person like her with a sense of moral purpose and values as a matter of fact i had no such qualities and i didnt blame her in the least for wanting to kill me in ariannes eyes i deserved to be shot like everyone wearing an ss or sd uniform and i couldnt argue with that whatever happened now or in the future i had it coming to me we all did but if my plan was going to work if i was to prevent her from further suffering i had to make certain heydrich understood what i said in the only way he could understand it not out of pity for arianne but out of loathing and contempt for her and a desire for revenge a sense of my true feelings for arianne would only have caused her more harm and for her sake i had to kill any love i had for her and kill it quickly too i had to harden my heart until it was made of iron like a true nazi i fished out my cigarettes and lit one to give myself some puff for what i was about to do it wasnt easy with my hands manacled to a chain nothing about what i was doing was easy i blew some smoke at the ceiling for nonchalant effect and leaned back against the wall how much arianne heard of what i said next i dont know none of it i hope it looks like ive been had all right i sighed well it wouldnt be the first time a fellow like me got given the slow trot around the tiergarten by a pretty girl only its been a while since i was dummied as well as she managed it christ at my age i should know better of course but since i stopped believing in santa claus i dont get many presents that are as nicely wrapped as this little halfsilk i shrugged im not making excuses general thats just how it is for a man who likes to think hes still in the game and i dont sleep so well on my own any more the same as captain kuttner she was my version of veronal a lot easier to swallow but probably just as lethal i allowed myself a wry smile so she tried to send me upstairs did she bitch and after all i tried to do for her that really sticks a hole in my sock go ahead and wash her hair again sergeant why dont you im all through pulling my chain about it hell now i can see why she was jumpy when she got out of bed this morning i thought she was sad because she had to go back to berlin because we were to be parted what a chump ive been shes quite a liar ill say that for her it strikes me that you fellows have got your work cut out there with or without the water board you could send her to the guillotine and the head on that little cunt would still talk its way out of the basket and by the way make sure you send me a ticket thats one party i wouldnt want to miss who knows maybe i can help to put her there myself because you know it strikes me that the ration is short on that story of hers and that maybe i can make up the weight in fact it would be my pleasure heydrich gave me a narroweyed look as if he was trying to estimate the distance between what i was saying and what he believed it was like facing a suspicious parent and moreover one who was such a practised liar himself that he knew precisely what to look for in establishing what was true and what was not an art expert with a picture of uncertain provenance could not have been more thorough in the way he studied the brushwork and checked the signature on the contrary picture i had painted for him such as he said coldly such as victor keils real name was franz koci i flicked my cigarette into the bathwater as if i hardly cared that ariannes head might yet be ducked in it i know that because i was the cop who investigated his death and at the special invitation of your friend colonel schellenberg he was found dead in berlins kleist park after the collision she mentioned with the taxi on nollendorfplatz he must have staggered down massen strasse we found him under a big red rhododendron bush with the knife hed used on the dutchman geert vranken still in his possession ive been thinking about the letter i received from vrankens father in the netherlands and how paul thummel was the character reference geert gave the police when he was a potential suspect in the sbahn murders well because thummel had had some sort of relationship with vrankens sister he must have found out from her i suppose that vranken was working on berlins railways that must have been the reason the abwehr asked to see the files on the sbahn murders which they did and in particular the interviews with all the foreign workers the official excuse was that they were on the lookout for spies but in reality thummel must have been on the lookout for geert vranken he was the only person in germany who could connect him with his czech controller in the hague and when he saw vrankens statement which mentions knowing a german officer who might vouch for him thummel must have panicked most likely vranken was killed by franz koci at paul thummels specific request heydrich was nodding now yes that makes sense i suppose either he radioed the request to uvod here in prague or as seems more likely he told arianne probably she was the cutout between thummel and franz koci who she knew better as victor keil heydrich continued nodding this was a good sign but an even better one was to come horst heydrich waved at colonel bohme release him a little reluctantly he still hadnt forgiven me for being a better detective than he was bohme produced a key from the pocket of his riding breeches and unlocked my manacles i rubbed my wrists and muttered a thank you i didnt say anything about arianne who remained strapped to the bascule balanced over the bath of water it was crucial that heydrich believe that his revelation about her part in the plot to kill me meant i was now indifferent to her immediate fate and it was equally crucial that my story was both plausible and authoritative even though a lot of it was based on sheer guesswork so that it would seem there was little real point in torturing arianne any more at least for the present to my enormous relief he now came to this conclusion take the woman back to her cell he told sergeant soppa yes sir soppa and the other man laid the bascule down on the wet floor and started to unstrap arianne she groaned slightly as the buckles were released but it was hard to tell if her heavily bruised eyes were open so i had no way of knowing if she saw me either way it was certainly the last time i ever saw her lets continue this conversation in your office upstairs horst said heydrich gunther now he was ushering me out of the interrogation cell ahead of him i walked toward the door my heart was on the floor alongside ariannes bedraggled halfdrowned body twisting over and over like a dying trout heydrich held my arm for a moment and then smiled a sarcastic smile what no fond goodbyes for your poor lover no last words i didnt turn around to look back at her if i had hed have seen the truth in my face instead i met heydrichs chilly wolfblue eyes turned a deep sigh into a wry laugh and shook my head silently to hell with her i said it was i thought the only place arianne and i were ever again likely to meet up with each other in a large office on an upper floor of the pecek palace heydrich told an orderly to bring us schnapps i think we all need one after that ordeal dont you gentlemen i couldnt argue with this i was desperate for a drink to put a little iron in my soul a bottle arrived a proper one containing real liver glue but none of the deer or elk blood that germans sometimes said it contained that was just a story like the one i was getting ready to tell heydrich and bohme i drank a glassful of the stuff it was icecold the way its supposed to be but i was colder nothings been invented thats as cold as how i felt at that moment i went and sat on the windowsill and looked out at the old medieval city of prague somewhere under one of those dark ancient roofs was a fatal creature of death and destruction that was exactly like my own twin brother indeed if the golem had looked in my eye at what was elusively called the soul he might well have concluded that i was a man to be shunned just as people in the street below avoided the pecek palace front door like it was a jaffa pesthouse given the wicked monstrous inhuman events that id just witnessed in the basement they werent so far wrong unbidden i fetched the bottle and poured another glass of the embalming fluid that helps make germans like me more german than before and i lit a cigarette halfhoping that it might set fire to my insides and turn me to ashes like everything else that was almost certain to be turned into ashes in due course i expect youre wondering how we got onto her said heydrich no but i would have got around to it before long the list of czechs working for the gestapo here in prague was hardly complete one of the people arianne tauber approached in that other cafe she mentioned i cant remember what it was called he was ours the ca doro said bohme it was the ca doro sir the head waiter is a french fascist whos been working for the gestapo since the spanish civil war as soon as he saw her sitting there with the flower inside the magazine he contacted us after that added heydrich it was only a question of having her followed around the clock she led us to radek about whom bohme already had his suspicions didnt you horst thats right sir bohme grinned and taking the bottle from my windowsill he refilled my glass again and helped the general and then himself thats why your car didnt turn up this morning gunther we arrested the two assassins around the corner from your hotel and the girl when she arrived at the railway station a little later on we had hoped there would be someone there from uvod to see her off but there wasnt so we picked her up and put her in the bag with the two killers he shrugged not that i think there was ever much danger of either one of you being killed it was a pretty desperate spurofthemoment sort of plan and the chances are theyd have been shot by the sentries at the lower castle before they got very far all in all said heydrich smugly its been an excellent days work we have the traitor we have some more terrorists it can only be a matter of time before we catch up with vaclav moravek yes congratulations sir said bohme toasting him tell me what are your orders regarding arianne tauber do you want her questioned again heydrich was still thinking this over when i said i expect i can fill in the rest of the gaps in her story for you yes why dont you tell us again how you met said heydrich in detail i gave him the whole story more or less from the circumstances in which i had first met her at nollendorfplatz station to my own middleaged infatuation there seemed little point in hiding anything other than my true motive for telling him paul thummel was obviously this fellow gustav she told me about back in berlin she might have denied he exists downstairs but there can be no doubt about that now i expect thats the one thing she was keeping back from sergeant soppa he was right about that i also expect that when thummel sees her again hell fold like a picnic table especially when he sees the state youve left her in i lit a cigarette and swung my leg carelessly as far as i can gather it was paul thummel who gave her the list of agents to pass on to franz koci as a major in the abwehr he was well placed to know exactly who they were but when she met up to hand them over to franz koci they quarrelled about money just as she said and he must have thought she was holding out on him maybe she was too i expect he demanded that she give him the list and when she wouldnt at least not until her complaints had been addressed he got rough with her and decided to search her underwear that was when i saw her for the first time i assumed wrongly that he was attempting to rape her or worse as you know theres been a lot of that in the blackout this summer women attacked and murdered in and around railway stations i guess it was still on my mind a lot so naturally i went to her assistance very gallant of you im sure said heydrich koci and i fought but he got away and ran into the blackout the next day i was looking at his dead body under a bush in kleist park at the request of walter schellenberg said heydrich thats right the berlin gestapo guessed he was a czech agent but they had no idea how hed met his death who killed him or why i agreed to help and soon enough i was able to connect franz koci with geert vranken but you decided to leave the girl out of it i nodded so you could take advantage of her i suppose it hadnt been like that but it was no good saying that i had honestly believed her to be more innocent than she turned out to be i needed to give heydrich the kind of cold and clinical reason he could understand the kind of reason he would have acted upon himself no doubt yes thats true i wanted to fuck her i had the idea she was just a dupe but that was always me of course as soon as i started sleeping with her i stopped seeing what was right under my nose that she was in it all the way up to her pretty neck but it was such a pretty neck the rest of her is not bad either said bohme about that neck gunther said heydrich i wont be able to save it you know that dont you the fact that she was involved in a plan to kill me well thats of no real consequence but an attempt to kill himmler is a different story the reichsfuhrer takes any assault on his personal safety rather more personally than i do i shrugged as if i cared nothing now for what happened to her and i shrugged because i knew heydrich was right nothing could save arianne now not even heydrich the real question here is what happens to you gunther in many ways youre a useful fellow to have around like a bent coat hanger in a toolbox youre not something that was ever designed for a specific job but you do manage to come in useful sometimes yes youre an excellent detective tenacious singleminded and in some ways youd have done a good job as a bodyguard but youre also independent and thats what makes you dangerous you have standards you try to live up to but theyre your standards which means that ultimately youre unreliable now that im where i am in the scheme of things i cant tolerate that i had hoped i might be able to bend you to my will and use you when i could like that coat hanger but i can see now i was wrong yes its difficult to turn a woman over to the gestapo especially a goodlooking woman like arianne tauber some can do it and some cant and youre just the type who cant so i have no further use for you youve become an unfortunate liability gunther this sounded like the best thing hed ever said to me but i was through opening my mouth like that for a long while perhaps permanently he hadnt yet finished telling me my own fate you will return to your desk in kripo and leave germanys destiny in the hands of men like me who truly understand what that means he smiled his paperknife smile and toasted me silently i toasted him back but only because perhaps for the last time i was hoping to point out a long hair in his chicken soup and the attempt on your life sir the poisoning at rastenburg i accept that you no longer wish to have me act as your bodyguard but am i to take it that you no longer wish me to investigate the recent attempt to kill you he stared at me for a moment and with a quiet surge of pleasure i realized he had forgotten all about this incident there never was such an attempt he said defiantly i made it up so that i might have a plausible reason to invite you to prague with the rest of them i nodded meekly a little surprised that hed admitted such a thing and i wondered where the actual truth was to be found if there really had been an attempt to poison heydrich at rastenburg after all besides as the most powerful man in bohemia and moravia i think im quite safe here wouldnt you agree horst so that clinched it for me he was lying bohme smiled an obsequious smile absolutely sir you have pragues ss and sd at your immediate disposal not to mention the gestapo and the german army you see crowed heydrich i have nothing to worry about especially not in prague the day the czechs try to kill me really try to kill me not that halfbaked attempt we had today although you mark my words that will have its own repercussions the day they try to kill me will be the very worst day in the history of this country and will make the defenestrations of prague look like a childish prank isnt that right horst yes sir in a long line of crazy czech ideas that would be the craziest idea of all i had my doubts about that i hadnt been in bohemia for very long but from what little i knew about the country it seemed only appropriate that the idea of the bohemian a type of fellow not easily classified and who never acted in a conventional or predictable way had got started in prague in prague throwing someone out of a window was just a childish prank a bit of harmless fun but i didnt expect a roman catholic german from halleandersaale to understand this and if i really had been as singleminded and independent as heydrich said i was i would probably have told him he was wrong murder even political assassination is rarely ever committed by people who are anything else but crazy and over the centuries one way or another a lot of crazy things had happened in prague so i nodded and told heydrich he was right when i knew he wasnt and that is what makes anyone dangerous i moved back to the imperial hotel and waited for my berlin rail warrant to arrive heydrich liked to keep most people waiting and i waited for several days so i saw the sights and tried not to think about what might be happening to arianne but of course that was impossible i preferred to believe that she hadnt actually condoned my murder but that she had felt obliged to go along with it as part of the general plan to kill heydrich and after all when youre shooting germans its hard to know who is a nazi and who isnt its a dilemma i understood very well finally my travel papers came through and on my last night in prague i remembered my ticket for the circus krone and decided to go along it was a cold autumn evening with a clear sky and a full moon and people were already wearing their warmest winter coats i sat well away from the rest of my ss colleagues but i had a good view of all of them in the front row of seats and i confess i paid more attention to mr and mrs heydrich and mr and mrs frank than i did to the clowns and the animals i hadnt seen lina heydrich before she was handsome rather than beautiful she wore black with a thick fur stole and a little black pillbox hat mrs frank wore a wool overcoat with wide lapels and a brown fedora the two wives sat beside each other and next to them sat their husbands who were wearing civilian clothes like everyone else in the sd and gestapo who was at the circus that night frank wore a plain gaberdine coat with a white shirt and a patterned silk tie heydrich wore a thick doublebreasted overcoat and held a black trilby on his lap and he also wore a pair of hornrimmed glasses that id never seen on him before like anyone else these four marvelled at the trapeze and laughed at the clowns and they appeared to enjoy themselves like anyone else that was what struck me most of all out of uniform heydrich and frank looked just like anyone else although even as they sat there a security crackdown was already under way in the city later on i learned that the mayor of prague otokar klapha had been executed and on the very same day that arianne was arrested hundreds of uvod collaborators were being rounded up and buildings right across the city were covered with posters listing the names of many others sentenced to death you wouldnt have known any of that if youd watched heydrich at the circus shaking with laughter as three clowns behaving like the sort of simpletons the nazis would probably have murdered for reasons of racial purity fell off chairs and soaked each other with buckets full of water two days later heydrich announced that the deportation of all the jews in the protectorate some ninety thousand of them was to begin at the end of the year to where he didnt say nobody did me i had a pretty good idea but by then i was back in berlin chapter it felt good to be in berlin again at least it felt good for an hour or two soon after arriving back at my apartment in fasanenstrasse i discovered to my disappointment that the two fridmann sisters from downstairs had been deported to some shithole in poland behnke the block warden who knew these things insisted that it was a nice town called lodz and that theyd be happier there living with their own instead of with decent germans i told him i had my doubts about this but behnke didnt want to hear them he was more interested in learning russian so that he would be able to speak to his peasants when eventually he met them he really thought he was going to get some of that living space in russia and the ukraine that goebbels was forever ranting about i had my doubts about that too it grew cold wind tore the leaves off the trees and hurried them east in their thousands the water on the spree looked like corrugated iron the cold felt like barbed wire there was one thing to be done before the snows arrived a sentimental gesture that meant nothing to anyone i had ever met but i suppose i wanted to feel better about myself i organized the release of geert vrankens remains from berlins charite hospital and paid for them to be buried in a zinclined wooden crate just in case after the war his family wanted to dig it up and take his remains home to the netherlands there was one other person at the funeral werner sachse from the gestapo with his black leather coat his black hat and black tie he looked like a proper mourner the short service was conducted by the pastor of st johns church in plotzensee and when it was over sachse told me he admired the thought if not the practice where would we be if policemen paid for every foreign worker who gets killed in an accident he asked it wasnt an accident i reminded him sachse shrugged as if the correction id offered hardly mattered the fact remained that the dead man wasnt german and therefore his death was of little or no account for a moment i wondered if telling him why i was doing it was a mistake and then i told him anyway im doing it so that somewhere someone who isnt german will have a better opinion of us than we deserve sachse pretended to be surprised about that but before we parted we shook hands so i knew he wasnt chapter commissioner friedrichwilhelm ludtke was known as stopgap ludtke on account of his name and because no one had expected him to survive in the job because he wasnt a party member but he did what he was told and when someone told him to put me on night duty thats what he did not that i minded very much being on nights kept me out of sight and out of mind at least it did until early on the morning of monday november i mention the murder i investigated that night only because it was heydrich himself who had me taken off the case i expect he was worried that i might actually solve it it was about five oclock in the morning when i got the telephone call from kriminal inspector heimenz at the police station in grunewald there had been a murder at one of those fancy modern villas in heerstrasse he wouldnt say who it was on the telephone all i knew was that it was someone famous one of the good things about being on nights was that i had access to a car so i was at the address in less than half an hour and it was easy to find there were several police cars parked outside not to mention a huge silver rollsroyce as soon as i stepped through the elegantly modern front door i guessed whose house it was but i hardly expected that he was also the victim general ernst udet was one of the most famous men in germany at the age of just twentytwo he had survived the great war as germanys highestscoring airace only manfred von richthofen had more victories than he did after the war hed made several movies with leni riefenstahl and was a stuntflier in hollywood the house was full of film posters flying cups and photographs of aeroplanes a polished wooden aircraft propeller hung on one wall and it was several minutes before i could tear myself from all of udets memorabilia to look at his dead body he wasnt very tall but then you dont need to be tall to fly aeroplanes especially when these are experimental udet was the directorgeneral of the luftwaffes developmental wing he was also a close friend of hermann goring or at least he had been a close friend until someone shot him the body was naked it lay in the middle of an enormous double bed and surrounded by empty brandy bottles most of them goodquality french brands there was a neat hole in his forehead and a hammerless sauer in his right hand for a small man he couldnt have been more than one sixty he had an enormous penis but it wasnt any of these details that drew the eyes not even the telephone line that was coiled around one of his muscular arms like a jews tefillin it was what was written on the headboard in red lipstick that tugged at my eyeballs and made me think i had walked in on a major scandal reichsmarshal why have you forsaken me i suppose the choice of words was meant to make you think of jesus christ nailed to the cross and abandoned by god the father but that wasnt what i thought of and it wasnt what inspector heimenz thought of either this is one homicide im happy to leave to you boys at the alex he said thanks let me tell you he looks how i feel cut and dried isnt it so you take the case not me i want to sleep at night youre in the wrong job for that the grunewald is not like the rest of berlin this is a quiet district so i see who found the body the girlfriend name of inge bleyle she claims they were on the telephone when she heard the shot so she drove straight over here in that modest little car you saw parked outside and found him dead that rolls is hers so it would seem apparently herr udet had been drinking heavily all week from the look of things martell and remy martin are going to be inconsolable it seems that he and the air ministry had had their differences concerning the success of the air war against the british you mean the lack of it dont you i know what i meant to say perhaps youd better speak to fraulein bleyle yourself sir perhaps i had where is she now in the drawing room i followed him downstairs hell of a place isnt it sir yes hard to imagine anyone who owned a place like this shooting himself is that what you think happened well yes the gun was in his hand i stopped on the stairs and pointed to one of the many photographs covering the wall ernst udet and the actor bela lugosi posing on a california tennis court looks to me as if ernst udet was a lefty i said so the gun was in his right hand i dont know about you but if i was going to shoot myself and believe me ive considered it seriously these past few months id probably hold the gun in my stronger hand but the words written on the headboard sir surely that was meant to be some sort of suicide message im only sure thats what its meant to look like whether it is or not well only know when a doctor gets him on the slab youd expect a powder burn on the skin if he really did press the gun to his forehead and i didnt see one thats all the inspector nodded he was a small man with small hands and a small way about him like i said this is one homicide im glad to leave to the alex inge bleyle had stopped crying she was about thirty years old tall much taller than ernst udet and goodlooking in an understated way she was wearing her fur coat and there was a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other neither of which looked like shed paid much attention to them since they came her way i found an ashtray held it under her cigarette and tapped the back of her hand she looked up smiled ruefully and then put out the cigarette in the ashtray while i continued holding it im commissar gunther from the alex feel like talking she shrugged i guess so i guess i have to right i mean i found him and i made the call so someone has to start the ball rolling i believe you told the other detective that you were on the telephone with herr udet when the shot was fired is that correct she nodded what had you been talking about when i first got to know him well before the war ernst udet was the life and soul of the party everyone liked him he was a real gentleman kind generous impeccably wellmannered but you couldnt imagine he was even related to the ernst udet of recent memory he drank he was shorttempered he was rude hed always drunk a lot half of those great war pilots drank just to go up in those planes but he always seemed like he could handle the drink but lately he started drinking even more than usual mostly he drank because he was unhappy very unhappy id left him because of his drinking you see and he wanted me back and i didnt want to come back because it was obvious that he was still drinking as you have no doubt seen for yourself it looks like a oneman house party in there why was he drinking any particular reason i mean before you left him yes i understand he was drinking because of what was happening at the air ministry that jew erhard milch was trying to undermine ernst all of the people in his department had been fired and ernst took that very personally why were they fired because that bastard goring didnt have the guts to fire ernst he figured that if he fired all of ernsts people then ernsts sense of honour would compel him to resign he blamed ernst for the failure of our air attacks on britain thats what he said to hitler to save his own skin of course it wasnt true not a damned word of it but hitler believed him anyway but that was just one reason he was depressed i groaned inside after prague i needed this case like i needed a pair of silk stockings of the kind inge bleyle was wearing on her lovely legs and another reason she shrugged suddenly she was looking evasive as if it had dawned on her that she was talking to a cop what with the war in russia well that was getting him down too yes he was depressed and drinking too much only well he wasnt long back from a clinic in buhlerhohe theyd dried him out he did that for me you know because he wanted me back and id made that a condition of our getting back together but i wanted to wait a little see just to see if it took the cure she sipped her whisky and grimaced i dont like whisky in this house thats not unusual i took the glass and put it on the table between us then a couple of days ago something happened to him i dont know what exactly ploch his chief of staff at the ministry until milch had him fired had just returned from kiev he went to see ernst and told him something something awful ernst wouldnt say what it was just that it was something happening in the east in russia and that no one would ever believe it i nodded you didnt have to be a detective to know what ploch had probably told him and it wasnt anything to do with aeroplanes because of that ernst had telephoned goring to ask him about it and theyd argued badly and ernst threatened to tell someone at the american embassy what ploch had told him he said that yes he had a lot of american friends you see ernst was very popular especially with the ladies the late ambassadors daughter i mean the american ambassadors daughter martha dodds she was a very close friend perhaps more than just a friend i dont know she paused and he told you all of this on the telephone yes we were talking ernst was crying some of the time begging me to come and see him one thing i do remember him saying it was that he could no longer believe in germany that germany was a wicked country and deserved to lose the war the more i heard about ernst udet the more i started to like him but inge bleyle felt obliged to disagree anyone would have felt the same i didnt like it that he was saying such things i mean that kind of talk is not good commissar even if you are a decorated hero like ernst i mean you hear stories about the gestapo people being arrested for unpatriotic talk i told ernst to be quiet and to keep his mouth shut in case he got us both into trouble him for saying such things and me for listening to them without ringing off thats what youre supposed to do when you hear those things you understand the only reason i stayed on the line was that i was concerned for his state of mind i nodded i understand then i heard the shot had he talked about killing himself well no not in so many words did you hear anything else voices perhaps footsteps a door closing no i put the telephone down and drove straight over here i live only a short distance away in the west end when i got here all the lights were on and i still had my key so i let myself in i shouted his name a couple of times and then went upstairs and found him dead as you saw i came back downstairs and used the telephone in the study its a different line to call the police i didnt want to touch the one in his hand that was an hour ago ive been here ever since do you think he killed himself she opened her mouth to say something checked herself the way you do and said it certainly looks that way doesnt it sensible girl no wonder she was driving a rollsroyce they dont hand those cars out to just anyone after that two fellows from the air ministry showed up colonel max pendele who was udets adjutant and another officer that was at eight am then someone from the ministry of the interior turned up as well that was at nine at about eleven oclock i drove back to the alex to type out my report after id done this ludtke asked me to come up to his office and when i got there he told me i was off the case i didnt ask why by then i hardly needed to it was plain that someone important didnt want me asking any awkward questions and there were plenty that could have been asked about the death of ernst udet and it was only after heydrichs death that i learned it had been he who told ludtke to take me off the case five days later they buried udet it was a state funeral they carried him out of the air ministry in a casket covered with a nazi flag placed him on a gun carriage and then processed up to invaliden cemetery where they buried him close to his old pal the baron von richthofen of course state funerals were for heroes not suicides or enemies of the state but that was okay because the story released by the authorities and this was the reason behind my removal since of course i knew different was that udet had been killed testing an experimental fighter plane hermann goring delivered a eulogy the ninecentimetre flak gun in the tiergarten fired a salute that had many berliners running for an airraid shelter thinking that the raf was back in our skies a few days later they were back although not to drop any bombs it was as well i was off the case being a detective has made me unreasonably suspicious i see connections and conspiracies where other people see only the need to look the other way and keep their suspicions to themselves another air ace werner molders was killed flying back to germany for udets funeral from the crimea and around the alex there were whispers that there was a lot more to his death the heinkel on which he was a passenger crashed as it tried to land in breslau than had been allowed to meet the eye certainly the british thought so for the raf dropped leaflets over germany alleging that like ernst udet werner molders had been opposed to the nazi regime and that he had been murdered six days later molders was also given a state funeral and he was buried alongside his great friend and confidant ernst udet in the invaliden cemetery in retrospect both of those two state funerals felt like dress rehearsals for what followed six months later in june it was six am i was on my way home after a night at the alex when i received a telephone call to go and see arthur nebe in his office at rsha headquarters in prinz albrechtstrasse it was a summons i had been dreading i knew of the attempt on heydrichs life on may a group of czech terrorists had thrown a grenade into his open car as it drove through the streets of prague heydrich had been seriously injured but as far as anyone knew he was making a strong recovery it was only what you might have expected of such a brave hero at least thats what the newspapers said nebe had already dispatched two senior detectives from the alex horst kopkow and dr bernhard wehner to prague to help with the investigation the assailants were still at large and throughout bohemia and moravia a huge security operation was under way to catch them everyone in kripo myself included believed they would soon be arrested nebe who was now back in berlin after murdering tens of thousands of jews in the ukraine looked wearier than usual but it looked as if these efforts had been appreciated there were even more decorations on his tunic than i remembered and in this respect at least he was beginning to resemble a south american generalissimo his long nose had turned a little purple no doubt a result of the heavy drinking that was required to complete our historic german tasks and there were bags under his eyes he was smoking almost continuously and there were patches of bad eczema on the backs of his hands the hair on his head was almost silver now but his eyebrows remained dark and overgrown like the forest of briars in the sleeping beauty shielding the enchanted castle that was his soul from the discovery of the outside world he came straight to the point heydrich died at fourthirty this morning he picked a nice day for it nebe permitted himself a wry smile is that all youve got to say yes i warned him to be more careful but he wasnt the careful type i guess im flying to prague in an hours time ill be part of an ss honour guard that will bring his body home to berlin i think youll find he was born in halle arthur while i am there i shall also be reviewing progress in the investigation as a matter of fact there isnt any progress its fucking chaos down there chaos of catastrophic proportions the local gestapo is arresting everyone thats one way of catching the murderers i suppose i need my own man someone whose abilities i respect thats why youre coming with me bernie to find some truth truth youre not asking for much are you we can argue about it in the car on the way to the airport anything you need while youre there you can buy we drove straight to tempelhof airport where a heinkel was already fuelled and waiting for us we climbed aboard and took off immediately from the air berlin still looked good flying over it was probably the best way to see the city which looked green and natural a decent place to live like the old berlin of my youth you couldnt see the corruption and the savagery from up there youll observe whats going on nothing more than that observe and report directly to me bernhard wehner wont like that as a commissioner he outranks me arthur from the way he behaves i think he outranks hermann goring wehners not a detective hes a bureaucrat not to mention a cunt is he in charge no frank thinks hes in overall charge and so does daluege the criminal inquiry is being handled by heinz pannwitz im beginning to understand the problem whats dummi doing there kurt dummi daluege was the chief of germanys uniformed regular police apparently he was in prague for medical treatment nebe grinned not a well man it seems whats wrong with him nothing trivial i hope heinz pannwitz i dont know him hes a berliner like you and me and capable up to a point but a bit of a thug really hes been with the sd in prague since so he has a fair bit of local knowledge i wonder why i never met him yes i heard you were down there last october i had hoped never to go back rough eh not for me not particularly but there was a girl arianne tauber it was very rough for her shes the one who tried to blow up himmler right yes the assassination attempt that no one talks about do you happen to know what happened to her no but i could probably find out in return for your help in prague i nodded fair enough there was another fellow the spy paul thummel what happened to him do you know difficult case said nebe you have two sides to that story the abwehr says that thummel only ever pretended to spy for the czechs so that he could obtain information about uvods london contacts the sd however insists he was the genuine esau and nobody wants to put him on trial so they can prove the case one way or the other that would be embarrassing for someone important either way so thummel stays in an isolation cell at the fortress in terezin under a false name the poor bastard when we arrived in prague we found things were even more chaotic than nebe had described the streets were empty of everyone except lots of ss troops who were reportedly triggerhappy while the cells at pecek palace and the prison at pankrac were full after the arrests of almost five hundred czechs nearly all of them innocent of course but the situation at hradschin castle was nothing short of laughable daluege was working on the assumption that the assassination was the beginning of an organized czech uprising he had called in police reinforcements from dresden and declared a nine pm curfew most of the czechs arrested had simply fallen foul of dalueges curfew pannwitz and frank were jointly of the opinion that the ambush was the work of a team of british parachutists and these two had set in train a painstaking search of every single house in prague in the hope of uncovering the assassins hiding place as soon as they saw arthur nebe kopkow and wehner complained that there was little hope of catching anyone so long as revenge appeared to be the only order of the day for as well as the five hundred czechs who had been arrested it seemed that the gestapo had already shot more than one hundred and fifty men and women who were suspected of working for uvod including two witnesses to the actual assassination which hardly helped their investigation nebe and i viewed the damaged car the scene of the crime and other evidence including a bicycle used by one of the assassins and the coat he had been wearing these were on display to the public in the window of a popular shoe store in the centre of prague then we went to bulovka hospital to view heydrichs dead body and found the autopsy was still in progress this was conducted by professor hamperl who had also handled captain kuttners autopsy eight months earlier and professor weygrich who was also from the german charles university in prague nebe who had no taste for hospitals left me there to speak to the two professors while he went to the pecek palace for a meeting with frank and pannwitz i did not enter the operating theatre although the whole floor was guarded by several ssmen to me this looked like covering the well after the child had already fallen in i could easily have entered the theatre itself nebe made that clear to the nco in charge of the guard detail but i didnt go in to the autopsy theatre perhaps i just didnt trust myself not to tell heydrich that if he had listened to me then he would have been alive perhaps but i think its more likely that i wanted to avoid finding the least bit of sympathy in myself for that truly wicked man so i sat on a wooden bench outside the doors and waited for good news like an expectant father when the autopsy finished hamperl was first out of the operating theatre and he greeted me like an old friend so hes really dead is he i asked oh yes i lit a cigarette i never much cared for big cigars we walked along the landing tell me asked hamperl did you ever catch that poor captains murderer the official record showed that kuttners murder remained unsolved hamperl probably knew that it was just his way of teasing me i was hardly about to tell him that hed just finished dissecting kuttners murderer somehow that didnt seem appropriate besides as well as the ss guards there were several gestapo men hanging around the floor no i said we never did we you were in charge of that case werent you commissar gunther i thought that too but it turned out i wasnt really who was i nodded back at the autopsy theatre he was heydrich i expect hes why youre here now yes its not because i like this place no indeed well it was good to see you again anyway no dont go away ive come all the way from berlin to talk to you professor ive got nothing to say come on professor help me out here itll be a day or two before professor weygrich and i have finished our report said hamperl you can read it then now if you dont mind commissar i have a lot of work to do in the lab i followed him downstairs all i want from you is your probable assessment and then ill leave you alone no i cant help you there my report is for the eyes of general frank only until he authorizes its release i cant discuss the case with anyone thats what he told me and i wouldnt care to disappoint that man hes in a mood to do harm to this city to the whole country perhaps i ran ahead a few steps and then stopped in front of hamperl i can appreciate that but i really must insist dont be ridiculous commissar youre in no position to insist on anything the report must remain private for now now get out of my way i stayed where i was would it make a difference if i said the word rothenburg sir hamperl did not reply im sure you know what im talking about professor hamperl the pension matzky i was visiting a patient he said in my capacity as a doctor you understand that is why i was there of course i understand perfectly what you dont know perhaps is that nothing that happens there is private nothing at all hamperls fixed jaw slackened a little what do you mean there were hidden microphones i see all im asking is that you give me a few minutes of your time professor in private do you have a car here sir yes why perhaps you could give me a lift back into the centre of prague sir we might talk a little during the journey yes i dont see why not we could certainly do that a good idea follow me that evening i met arthur nebe at the esplanade hotel where both of us were staying and over an excellent dinner i told him what i had learned that afternoon from professor hamperl it seems that heydrich was making a strong recovery until yesterday lunchtime hed just finished a meal cooked specially for him by his wife lina when he collapsed and lost consciousness i hope youre not going to tell me she poisoned him nebe grinned and poured himself a glass of wine he was doing his best to enjoy himself in spite of everything that had happened and some of the wariness that was almost always in his narrow eyes was gone probably it was just the wine nebe was especially fond of good wine and good restaurants he put his long nose into his wine glass and breathed deeply do drink up bernie this is a superb claret it wasnt her that poisoned him but he put down his glass and watched my face for some sign of humour youre not serious professor hamperl is scared arthur hed like the autopsy to report that heydrich died from anaemic shock the man lost his spleen didnt he anaemic shock would be a fair conclusion to that sort of injury however professor weygrich wishes to mention the presence of organ damage resulting from an infection a bacteria or poison i shrugged well again you might expect infection to result from bomb splinters certainly however ugh that word again hamperl would prefer not to mention this inflammation of the tissues at all mediastinitis he called it i fail to see the need for two ominous howevers infection is common in such situations after the patient was making a strong recovery i shook my head listen arthur on tuesday heydrich had a temperature of one hundred and two degrees fahrenheit but yesterday his temperature was down and his wound was draining freely that is until midday when the infection suddenly returned a complete reversal of his condition so what are you saying bernie im not saying anything hamperl is saying it and frankly hes not likely ever to say it again to anyone i had a hard enough job getting him to say it the first time and heres another thing arthur im never going to say any of this again either if you ever ask me about this ill just say i dont know what youre talking about all right nebe nodded so lets hear it hamperl believes the infection was introduced long after the wound was sustained that heydrich was infected by a bacterium introduced by an outside agency in other words he was poisoned good god you are serious nebe grabbed his glass and drained the contents who did it he wont say but i checked through the medical records myself and they show that heydrich was initially under the care of himmlers personal physician professor karl gebhardt thats right said nebe as soon as he heard heydrich had been injured himmler ordered gebhardt to come to prague and take charge of heydrichs treatment but later on hitlers own doctor dr karl brandt arrived on the scene and having examined heydrich himself he recommended that heydrich be treated with an antibacterial sulphonamide gebhardt refused however on the basis that the drug isnt particularly soluble and crystallizing in the kidneys sulphonamide can cause a certain amount of pain you wouldnt want to prescribe it to someone who wasnt eating or drinking but you said that heydrich was eating and drinking normally exactly i said and if he was taking liquids any pain from sulphonamides would have been considerably lessened so what are you saying that gebhardt poisoned heydrich im saying its a possibility when i was last in prague heydrich told me that ss doctors were experimenting with sulphonamide compounds as a way of treating wound infections doesnt it seem odd that heydrich of all people should have been prevented from taking advantage of a drug newly synthesized in ss laboratories yes it does admitted nebe at least until you remember that heydrich already suspected himmler of trying to kill him i shrugged who better than a doctor to finish the job started by the british parachutists and heres another thing that i found out at the bulovka hospital after her husband died lina heydrich had some sort of altercation with dr gebhardt and actually accused him of killing her husband it seems that she had to be restrained from hitting him jesus christ i never knew this apparently she told major ploetz heydrichs adjutant that she wont be accompanying your ss guard of honour back to berlin what you heard me it seems she herself believes that her husbands death is not exactly as advertised himmler will be furious hitler too there is that possibility nebe rubbed his jaw anxiously youre right bernie we never had this conversation he toasted me with his glass i might have known youd discover a very different culprit from the ones i was hoping to find i think wed best leave it there dont you i already did when i get back to berlin im going to deny i was ever here as i discovered last october being in prague can be damaging to your health even fatal nebe uttered a grimsounding sigh about your girl friend arianne tauber its not good news im afraid i wish i could give you some good news but i cant im sorry good news i wasnt expecting arthur i just want to know for sure what happened to her they sent her to a concentration camp near krakow i nodded well thats not so bad people have survived concentration camps before not this one this is a new kind of concentration camp only part of it is a true concentration camp of the kind that you and i know about you know like dachau or buchenwald mostly this is a special new sort of concentration camp much bigger than those others its called auschwitz that was the first time i ever heard the name auschwitz while i was eating a good dinner and enjoying a fine bottle of wine in an expensive restaurant it seems astonishing now that the name did not stay with me longer but within a few days i had more or less forgotten it years later i heard the name again and this time it stayed with me it stays with me always now and whenever i think of it i know i can put at least one face and name to the several millions of people who died there authors note the three kings were josef masin josef balaban and vaclav moravek balaban died in pragues ruznye prison on october vaclav moravek was killed in a shootout with the prague gestapo on march josef masin was executed in may as part of the nazi retaliation for the attack on reinhard heydrich on june a special train carrying one thousand jews left prague for auschwitz the train bore a sign which read attentat auf heydrich assassination of heydrich on the same day general karl hermann frank ordered horst bohme to destroy the czech village of lidice northwest of prague because it was vaguely suspected of having harboured some of heydrichs assassins one hundred and ninety men over the age of sixteen were executed summarily one hundred and eightyfour women were sent to ravensbruck eightyeight children were sent to lodz on july eichmann ordered the women and children to be sent to chelmno where they were all gassed in specially converted gas vans the village itself was razed to the ground on june karel curda walked into pecek palace and gave away the names and addresses of many prominent uvod resistance workers among them the moravec family no relation marie moravec poisoned herself rather than be taken alive by the gestapo her son ata was captured and tortured his interrogators showed him his mothers severed head before dropping it into a fish tank ata moravec broke down and revealed the hiding place of the heydrich assassins this was the church of st cyril and st methodius in resolva street the germans called this church karl borromaus hiding in the crypt of st cyrils a russian orthodox church not a roman catholic one as might have been supposed were jan kubis adolf opalka jaroslav svarc josef gabcik josef bublik josef valcik and jan hruby all members of an assassination team trained by the british special operations executive for a mission called operation anthropoid a pitched battle ensued during which all six men were killed or committed suicide the bodies were identified by the traitor curda the entire families of all these brave heroes were sent to mauthausen concentration camp where they were executed on october on september the officials of the resolva street church of st cyrils were tried in the conference hall of the pecek palace in prague the trial lasted three and a half hours on september bishop gorazd jan sonnevend vladimir petrek and vaclav cikl were hanged adolf hitler gave lina heydrich the lower castle at jungfernbreschan the czech name for this place is panenskebrezany in gratitude for her husbands heroic work heydrichs eldest son klaus was killed in a traffic accident outside the gates of the house in october the boy is buried in an unmarked grave in the grounds of the house in january the heydrichs left the house for good paul thummel was released and rearrested on several occasions in february he broke down under questioning and admitted he was a spy he was imprisoned in the fortress at terezin theresienstadt under the false name of dr paul tooman there he remained for three years in august he was divorced by his wife elsa which was the last time he saw her in april he committed suicide in terezin karl hermann frank was captured in tried by the czechs found guilty and executed outside pankrac prison on may the whole execution may be found on the internet for those who are inclined that way at httpwwwexecutedtodaycomkarlhermannfrank its only my opinion but he died rather bravely for what its worth ssstandartenfuhrer dr walter jacobi was arrested by the americans in september he was executed in prague on may ssobergruppenfuhrer richard hildebrandt was hanged for war crimes in poland on march ssobergruppenfuhrer karl von eberstein testified for the prosecution at the nuremberg trials he denied knowledge of and responsibility for dachau concentration camp which fell under his authority as the higher ss and police leader for munich he died in bavaria on february ssgruppenfuhrer konrad henlein was captured by the americans and committed suicide in may however he may actually have been a spy for the british ssgruppenfuhrer dr hugo jury committed suicide in may ssbrigadefuhrer bernard voss was hanged in prague on february ssstandartenfuhrer dr hans ulrich geschke was most probably killed during the battle of budapest in february he was declared dead in ssstandartenfuhrer horst bohme was killed at the battle of konigsberg in april declared dead sssturmbannfuhrer dr achim ploetz fate unknown to the author konstantin von neurath was tried at nuremberg and sentenced to fifteen years in prison released in he died aged eightythree in august general kurt daluege was hanged by the czechs in prague in october lina heydrich died on august she always defended her husbands name the portrait of adele blochbauer by gustav klimt remained in the possession of the austrian state gallery in vienna until when an austrian court determined that it and three other pictures were the rightful property of ferdinand blochbauers niece maria altmann to whom he had left them in his will following his impoverished death in zurich in november klimts portrait of adele blochbauer was one of four paintings sold at christies new york in november it fetched eightyeight million dollars and may be viewed today at the neue galerie in new york city the author visited the house at panenskebrezany in february it is closed to the public however and mostly derelict under the old communist government of czechoslovakia the house was a secret weapons research facility according to a prague newspaper in march heider heydrich aged seventysix heydrichs surviving son offered to find finances for the restoration of the house at panenskebrezany the story caused a furore in the czech republic it is however the authors opinion that the son is not the father and that this once beautiful house is worthy of restoration i imagine he would like to find the grave of his elder brother
