david morrell first blood introduction in the summer of i was a graduate student at penn state university specializing in american literature id finished my ma thesis on ernest hemingway and was starting my doctoral dissertation on john earth but in my heart what i wanted to be was a novelist i knew that few novelists made a living at it so id decided to become a literature professor an occupation in which id be surrounded by books and allowed time to write a penn state faculty member philip klass whose sciencefiction pseudonym is william tenn had given me generous instruction in the techniques of fiction writing still as klass had pointed out i can teach you how to write but not what to write about what would i write about by chance i watched a television program that changed my life the program was the cbs evening news and on that sultry august evening walter cronkite contrasted two stories whose friction flashed like lightning through my mind the first story showed a fire fight in vietnam sweaty american soldiers crouched in the jungle shooting bursts from ms to repel an enemy attack incoming bullets kicked up dirt and shredded leaves medics scrambled to assist the wounded an officer barked coordinates into a twoway radio demanding air support the fatigue determination and fear on the faces of the soldiers were dismayingly vivid the second story showed a different sort of battle that steamy summer the inner cities of america had erupted into violence in nightmarish images national guardsmen clutched ms and stalked along the rubble of burning streets dodging rocks wary of snipers among devastated vehicles and gutted buildings each news story distressing enough on its own became doubly so when paired with the other it occurred to me that if id turned down the sound if i hadnt heard each storys reporter explain what i was watching i might have thought that both film clips were two aspects of one horror a fire fight outside saigon a riot within it a riot within an american city a fire fight outside it vietnam and america what if i thought those magic words are the seed of all fiction what if i wrote a book in which the vietnam war literally came home to america there hadnt been a war on american soil since the end of the civil war in with america splitting apart because of vietnam maybe it was time to write a novel that dramatized the philosophical division in our society that shoved the brutality of war right under our noses i decided my catalytic character would be a vietnam veteran a green beret who after many harrowing missions had been captured by the enemy escaped and returned home to be given americas highest distinction the congressional medal of honor but he would bring something back with him from southeast asia what we now call posttrauma stress syndrome haunted by nightmares about what he had done in the war embittered by civilian indifference and sometimes hostility toward the sacrifice he had made for his country he would drop out of society to wander the backroads of the nation he loved he would let his hair grow long stop shaving carry his few possessions in a rolledup sleeping bag slung over his shoulder and look like what we then called a hippie in what i loosely thought of as an allegory he would represent the disaffected his name would be i am asked about his name more than anything else one of my graduate school languages was french and on an autumn afternoon as i read a course assignment i was struck by the difference between the look and the pronunciation of the name of the author i was reading rimbaud an hour later my wife came home from buying groceries she mentioned that shed bought some apples of a type shed never heard about before rambo a french authors name and the name of an apple collided and i recognized the sound of force while rambo represented the disaffected i needed someone to embody the establishment another news report this time in print aroused my indignation in a southwestern american town a group of hitchhiking hippies had been picked up by the local police stripped hosed and shaved not just their beards but their hair the hippies had then been given back their clothes and driven to a desert road where they were abandoned to walk to the next town thirty miles away i remembered the harassment that my own recently grown mustache and long hair had caused me why dont you get a haircut what the hell are you a man or a woman i wondered what rambos reaction would be if he were subjected to the insults those hippies had received in my novel the establishments representative became a police chief wilfred teasle wary of stereotypes i wanted him as complex as the action would allow i made teasle old enough to be rambos father that created a generation gap with the added dimension that teasle wishes he had a son next i decided that teasle would be a korean war hero his distinguished service cross second only to rambos congressional medal of honor there were many other facets to his character and in each case the intention was to make him as motivated and sympathetic as rambo because the viewpoints that divided america came from deep wellmeant convictions to empathize their polarity i structured the novel so that a scene from rambos perspective would be followed by one from teasles the subsequent scene from rambos the next scene again from teasles that tactic i hoped would make the reader identify with each character and at the same time feel ambivalent about them who was the hero who the villain or were both men heroes both men villains the final confrontation between rambo and teasle would show that in this microcosmic version of the vietnam war and american attitudes about it escalating force results in disaster nobody wins due to the rigors of graduate school i didnt complete first blood until after id graduated from penn state in and taught at the university of iowa for a year following the novels publication in it was translated into eighteen languages and eventually became the basis for a wellknown film if youre familiar only with the movie youll find a startling surprise at the end of the novel but the film company changed that conclusion and as a consequence was able to produce two rambo sequels i wasnt involved with those films however i did write a novelization for each of them in an effort to supply the characterization that the latter movies omitted not that i object to the movies theyre spectacular in terms of their action at the same time im aware of the controversy they caused and think its ironic that a novel about political polarization in america for and against the vietnam war resulted in films that generated similar polarization for and against ronald reagan a decade after the novel was written sometimes i compare the rambo books and movies to trains that are similar but headed in different directions sometimes i think of rambo as a son who grew up and out of his fathers control sometimes i read or hear rambos name in a newspaper a magazine on the radio on television in reference to politicians financiers athletes whomever used as a noun an adjective or a verb whatever and it takes me a moment before i remind myself that if not for the cbs evening news if not for rimbaud my wife and the name of an apple if not for philip klass and my determination to be a fiction writer the new edition of the oxford english dictionary wouldnt have cited this novel as the source for the creation of a word rambo complicated troubled indeed haunted too often misunderstood if youve heard about him but havent met him before hes about to surprise you david morrell part one his name was rambo and he was just some nothing kid for all anybody knew standing by the pump of a gas station at the outskirts of madison kentucky he had a long heavy beard and his hair was hanging down over his ears to his neck and he had his hand out trying to thumb a ride from a car that was stopped at the pump to see him there leaning on one hip a coke bottle in his hand and a rolledup sleeping bag near his boots on the tar pavement you could never have guessed that on tuesday a day later most of the police in basalt county would be hunting him down certainly you could not have guessed that by thursday he would be running from the kentucky national guard and the police of six counties and a good many private citizens who liked to shoot but then from just seeing him there ragged and dusty by the pump of the gas station you could never have figured the kind of kid rambo was or what was about to make it all begin rambo knew there was going to be trouble though big trouble if somebody didnt watch out the car he was trying to thumb a ride with nearly ran him over when it left the pump the station attendant crammed a charge slip and a book of trade stamps into his pocket and grinned at the tire marks on the hot tar close to rambos feet then the police car pulled out of traffic toward him and he recognized the start of the pattern again and stiffened no by god not this time this time i wont be pushed the cruiser was marked chief of police madison it stopped next to rambo its radio antenna swaying and the policeman inside leaned across the front seat opening the passenger door he stared at the mudcrusted boots the rumpled jeans ripped at the cuffs and patched on one thigh the blue sweat shirt speckled with what looked like dry blood the buckskin jacket he lingered over the beard and the long hair no thats not what was bothering him it was something else and he couldnt quite put his finger on it well then hop in he said but rambo did not move i said hop in the man repeated must be awful hot out there in that jacket but rambo just sipped his coke glanced up and down the street at the cars passing looked down at the policeman in the cruiser and stayed where he was something wrong with your hearing the policeman said get in here before you make me sore rambo studied him just as he himself had been studied short and chunky behind the wheel wrinkles around his eyes and shallow pockmarks in his cheeks that gave them a grain like weathered board dont stare at me the policeman said but rambo kept on studying him the gray uniform top button of his shirt open tie loose the front of his shirt soaked dark with sweat rambo looked but could not see what kind his handgun was the policeman had it holstered to the left away from the passenger side im telling you the policeman said i dont like being stared at who does rambo glanced around once more then picked up his sleeping bag as he got into the cruiser he set the bag between himself and the policeman been waiting long the policeman asked an hour since i came you could have waited a lot longer than that people around here dont generally stop for a hitchhiker especially if he looks like you its against the law looking like me dont be smart i mean hitchhikings against the law too many people stop for a kid on the road and next thing theyre robbed or maybe dead close your door rambo took a slow sip of coke before he did what he was told he looked over at the gas station attendant who was still at the pump grinning as the policeman pulled the cruiser into traffic and headed downtown no need to worry rambo told the policeman i wont try to rob you thats very funny in case you missed the sign on the door im the chief of police teasle wilfred teasle but then i dont guess theres much point in telling you my name he drove on through a main intersection where the light was turning orange far down both sides of the street were stores squeezed together a drug store a pool hall a gun and tackle shop dozens more over the top of them far back on the horizon mountains rose up tall and green touched here and there with red and yellow where the leaves had begun to die rambo watched a cloud shadow slip across the mountains where you headed he heard teasle ask does it matter no come to think of it i dont guess theres much point in knowing that either just the same where you headed maybe louisville and maybe not thats right where did you sleep in the woods thats right its safe enough now i suppose the nights are getting colder and the snakes like to hole up instead of going out to hunt still one of these times you might find yourself with a bed partner whos just crazy about your body heat they passed a car wash an ap a hamburger drivein with a big dr pepper sign in the window just look at that eyesore drivein teasle said they put that thing here on the main street and ever since all weve had is kids parked beeping their horns throwing crap on the sidewalk rambo sipped his coke somebody from town give you a ride in teasle asked i walked ive been walking since after dawn sure am sorry to hear that least this ride will help some wont it rambo did not answer he knew what was coming they drove over a bridge and a stream into the town square an old stone courthouse at the right end more shops squeezed together down both sides yeah the police station is right up there by the courthouse teasle said but he drove right on through the square and down the street until there were only houses first neat and prosperous then gray cracked wooden shacks with children playing in the dirt in front he went up a rise in the road between two cliffs to a level where there were no houses at all only fields of stunted corn turning brown in the sun and just after a sign that read you are now leaving madison drive safely he pulled off the pavement onto the gravel shoulder take care he said and keep out of trouble rambo answered isnt that how it goes thats good youve been this route before now i dont need to waste time explaining how guys who look like you have this habit of being a disturbance he lifted the sleeping bag from where rambo had put it between them set it on rambos lap and leaned across rambo to open the passenger door take good care now rambo got slowly out of the car ill be seeing you he said and flipped the door shut no teasle answered through the open passenger window i guess you wont he drove the cruiser up the road made a u turn and headed back toward town sounding his car horn as he passed rambo watched the cruiser disappear down the road between the two cliffs he sipped the last of his coke tossed the bottle in a ditch and with his sleeping bag slung by its rope around his shoulder he started back to town the air was sticky with frying grease rambo watched the old lady behind the counter peer out the bottom of her bifocal glasses at his clothes and hair and beard two hamburgers and a coke he told her make that to go he heard from behind he looked at the reflection in the mirror behind the counter and saw teasle braced in the front doorway holding the screen door open letting it slam shut with a whack and make that a rush job will you merle teasle said this kids in a powerful hurry only a few customers were in the place sitting at the counter and in some of the booths rambo watched their reflection in the mirror as they quit chewing and looked over at him but then teasle leaned against the juke box by the door and it seemed like nothing serious was going to happen so they went back to work on their food the old lady behind the counter had her white head cocked to one side puzzled oh yeah merle and while youre fixing that stuff how about a fast coffee teasle said whatever you like wilfred she said still puzzled and went to pour the coffee that left rambo looking at the mirror at teasle looking at him teasle had an american legion pin opposite the badge on his shirt i wonder which war rambo thought youre just a bit young for the second one he swung round on his stool and faced him korea he said pointing at the pin thats right teasle said flatly and they went on watching each other rambo shifted his eyes down to teasles left side and the handgun he wore it was a surprise not the standard police revolver but a semiautomatic pistol and from the big handle rambo decided it was a browning millimeter he had used a browning once himself the handle was big because it held a clip of thirteen bullets instead of the seven or eight that most pistols held you couldnt slam a man flat on his back with one shot from it but you could sure hurt him bad and two more would finish him and you still had ten more shots for anybody else around rambo had to admit that teasle carried it awfully well too teasle was five foot six maybe seven and for a smallish man that big pistol ought to have hung awkward but it didnt you have to be pretty large to get a grip on that big handle though rambo thought and then he looked at teasles hands amazed at the size of them i warned you about that staring teasle said leaning against the juke box he unstuck his wet shirt from his chest lefthanded he took a cigarette from a pack in his shirt pocket lit it snapping the wood match he had used in half then snickered shaking his head in amusement as he walked over to the counter and smiled strangely down at rambo on the stool well you sure put one over on me didnt you he said i wasnt trying to of course not of course you werent but you sure put one over on me just the same didnt you the old lady set teasles coffee down and faced rambo how do you want your burgers plain or dragged through the garden what plain or with fixings with lots of onion whatever you like she went off to fry the hamburgers yeah you really did teasle said to him and smiled strangely again you really put one over he frowned at the dirty cotton bulging from a rip in the stool next to rambo and sat reluctantly i mean you act like youre smart and you talk like youre smart so i naturally assumed you got the idea but then you come dragging back here and fool me and thats enough to make a man wonder if maybe youre not smart at all is there something wrong with you is that what it is im hungry well that just doesnt interest me at all teasle said drawing on his cigarette it had no filter and after he exhaled he picked off bits of tobacco that were stuck to his lips and tongue a fellow like you he ought to have brains to carry a lunch with him you know for when he has some emergency like you have now he lifted the cream pitcher to pour into his coffee but then he noticed the bottom of the pitcher and his mouth went sour at the yellow curds that were clinging there you need a job he asked quietly no then you already got a job no i dont have a job either i dont want a job thats called being a vagrant call it whatever the hell you want teasles hand slammed like a shot on the counter you watch your mouth everyone in the place jerked his head toward teasle he looked around at them and smiled as if he had said something funny and leaned close to the counter to sip his coffee thatll give them something to talk about he smiled and took another draw on his cigarette picking more specks of tobacco off his tongue the joke was over listen i dont get it that rig of yours the clothes and hair and all didnt you know when you came back down the main street out there youd stand out like some black man my crew radioed in about you five minutes after you got back what took them so long the mouth teasle said i warned you he looked like he was ready to say more but then the old lady brought rambo a halffull paper bag and said buck thirtyone for what for that little bit you said you wanted the fixings just pay her teasle said she held onto the bag until rambo gave her the money o k lets go teasle said where where i take you he emptied his cup in four quick swallows and put down a quarter thanks merle everybody looked at the two of them as they walked to the door almost forgot teasle said hey merle one more thing how about cleaning the bottom on that cream pitcher the cruiser was directly outside get in teasle said tugging at his sweaty shirt damn for the first of october it sure is hot i dont know how you tolerate wearing that hot jacket i dont sweat teasle looked at him sure you dont he dropped his cigarette down a manhole grate by the curb and they got into the cruiser rambo watched the traffic and the people going past in the bright sun after the dark lunch counter his eyes hurt one man walking by the cruiser waved to teasle and teasle waved back then pulled away from the curb into a break in traffic he was driving fast this time they went down past a hardware store and a used car lot and old men smoking cigars on benches and women pushing children in strollers look at those women teasle said a hot day like this and they dont have the sense to keep their kids indoors rambo did not bother looking he just closed his eyes and leaned back when he opened them the cruiser was speeding up the road between the two cliffs up onto the level where the stunted corn drooped in the fields past the you are now leaving madison sign teasle stopped the car abruptly on the gravel shoulder and turned to him now get it clear he said i dont want a kid who looks like you and doesnt have a job in my town first thing i know a bunch of your friends will show up mooching food maybe stealing maybe pushing drugs as it is ive half a notion to lock you up for the inconvenience youve caused me but the way i see it a kid like you hes entitled to a mistake its like your judgments not as developed as an older mans and i have to make allowances but you come back again and ill fix you so you wont know whether your assholes bored bunched or pecked out by crows is that plain enough for you to understand is that clear rambo grabbed hold of the lunch sack and his sleeping bag and got out of the car i asked you a question teasle said out the open passenger door i want to know if you heard me tell you not to come back i heard you rambo said flipping the door shut then dammit do what you hear youre told teasle stomped on the gas pedal and the cruiser lurched off the road shoulder gravel flying onto the smooth hot pavement he made a severe uturn tires squealing and sped back toward town this time he did not sound his car horn going past rambo watched the cruiser get smaller and disappear down the hill between the two cliffs and when he could no longer see it he glanced around at the fields of corn and the mountains in the distance and the white sun in missing page and then he was decided he grabbed the rope on his sleeping bag slung it around his shoulder and started hiking into madison again at the bottom of the hill into town trees lined the road halfgreen halfred the red leaves always on the branches that hung over the road from exhaust fumes he thought exhaust fumes kill them early dead animals lay here and there along the roadside likely hit by cars bloated and speckled with flies in the sun first a cat tigerstriped looked like it had been a nice cat too next a cocker spaniel then a rabbit then a squirrel that was another thing the war had given him he noticed dead things more not in horror just in curiosity of how they had come to end he walked past them down the right side of the road thumb out for a ride his clothes were filmed yellow with dust his long hair and beard were matted dirty and all the people driving by took a look at him and nobody stopped so why dont you clean up your act he thought shave and get a haircut fix up your clothes youll get your rides that way because a razors just one more thing to slow you down and haircuts waste money you can spend on food and where would you shave anyhow you cant sleep in the woods and come out looking like some kind of prince then why walk around like this sleeping in the woods and with that his mind moved in a circle and he was back to the war think about something else he told himself why not turn around and go why come back to this town its nothing special because i have a right to decide for myself whether ill stay in it or not i wont have somebody decide that for me but this cop is friendlier than the rest were more reasonable why bug him do what he says just because somebody smiles when he hands me a bag of shit that doesnt mean i have to take it i dont give a damn how friendly he is its what he does that matters but you do look a little rough as if you might cause trouble he has a point so do i in fifteen goddamn towns this has happened to me this is the last i wont be fucking shoved anymore why not explain that to him clean yourself up a bit or do you want this trouble thats coming youre hungry for some action is that it so you can show him your stuff i dont have to explain myself to him or anybody else after what ive been through i have a right without explanation at least tell him about your medal what it cost you too late to stop his mind from completing the circle once again he returned to the war teasle was waiting for him as soon as he drove past the kid he had glanced up at his rearview mirror and there the kid had been reflected small and clear but the kid was not moving he was just standing there at the side of the road where he had last been watching the cruiser just standing there getting smaller watching the cruiser well whats the holdup kid teasle had thought go on clear out but the kid had not he had just kept standing there getting smaller in the mirror looking toward the cruiser and then the road into town had sloped sharply down between the cliffs and teasle could not see him reflected anymore my god youre planning to come back again he had suddenly realized shaking his head and laughing once youre honestly planning to come back he turned right onto a side street and drove a quarterway up a row of gray clapboard houses he swung into a gravel driveway and backed out and parked so the cruiser was aimed toward the main road he had just left then he slumped behind the steering wheel lighting a cigarette the look on the kids face he was honesttogod planning to come back teasle could not get over it from where he was parked he could see everything that passed on the main road the traffic wasnt much it never was on monday afternoons the kid couldnt walk along the far sidewalk and be hidden by the passing cars so teasle watched the street he was on met the main road in a t there were cars and trucks going both ways on the main road a sidewalk on the far side beyond that the stream which ran along the road and beyond that the old madison dance palace it had been condemned last month teasle remembered when he was in high school how he had worked there friday and saturday nights parking cars hoagy carmichael had almost played there once but the owners hadnt been able to promise him enough money wheres the kid maybe he isnt coming maybe he really left i saw that look on his face hes coming all right teasle took a deep drag on his cigarette and glanced up at the greenbrown mountains lumped close on the horizon there was a sudden cool wind that smelled of crisp leaves and then it was gone teasle to station he said into the microphone of his car radio has the mail come in yet as always shingleton the day radioman was quick to answer his voice crackling from static sure has chief i already checked it for you nothing from your wife im afraid what about from a lawyer or maybe something from california that she didnt put her name on the outside i already checked that too chief sorry nothing anything important i ought to know about just a set of traffic lights that shorted out but i got the works department over there fixing it if thats all then ill be a few minutes yet coming back this kid was a nuisance waiting for him he wanted to get back to the station and phone her she was gone three weeks now and she had promised to write at the most by today and here she had not he did not care anymore about keeping his own promise to her not to call he was going to phone anyway maybe she had thought it over and changed her mind but he doubted that he lit another cigarette and glanced to the side there were neighbor women out on porches looking to see what he was up to that was the end he decided he flipped the cigarette out the cruiser window switched the ignition and drove down to the main road to find out where the hell the kid was nowhere in sight sure hes gone and left and that look was just to make me think he was coming back so he headed toward the station to phone and three blocks later when all at once he saw the kid up on the left sidewalk leaning against a wire fence over the stream he slammed on his brakes so hard in surprise that the car following crashed into the rear end of the cruiser the guy who had hit him was sitting shocked behind the wheel his hand over his mouth teasle opened the cruiser door and stared at the guy a second before he walked over to where the kid was leaning against the wire fence how did you get into town without me seeing you magic get in the car i dont think so you think a little more there were cars lined up behind the car that had struck the cruiser the driver was now standing in the middle of the road peering at the smashed taillight shaking his head teasles open door angled into the opposite lane slowing traffic drivers blared their horns customers and clerks came sticking their heads out of shops across the street you listen teasle said im going to clear that mess of traffic the time im through you be in that cruiser they eyed each other the next thing teasle was over to the guy who had hit the cruiser the guy was still shaking his head at the damage drivers license insurance card ownership papers teasle told him please he went and shut the cruiser door but i didnt have a chance to stop you were following too close but you slammed on your brakes too fast it doesnt matter the law says the car in back is always wrong you were following too close for an emergency but im not about to argue with you teasle told him please give me your drivers license insurance card and ownership papers he looked over at the kid and of course the kid was gone rambo stayed out walking in the open to make it clear that he was not trying to hide teasle could give up the game at this point and leave him alone if he did not well then it was teasle who wanted the trouble not himself he walked along the lefthand sidewalk looking down at the stream wide and fast in the sun across the stream was the bright yellow freshly sandblasted wall of a building with balconies over the water and a sign high on top madison historic hotel rambo tried to figure what was historic about a building that looked as if it had just been put up last year in the center of town he turned left onto a big orange bridge sliding a hand along the smooth warm paint on the metal rail until he was half across he stopped to peer down at the water the afternoon was glaring hot the water fast and coollooking next to him welded to the rail was a machine with a glass top full of gumballs he took a penny from his jeans and reached to put it in the slot and held it back in time he had been wrong the machine was not full of gumballs it was full of grainy balls of fish food there was a small metal plate stamped onto the machine feed the fish it read cents proceeds benefit basalt county youth corps busy youth make happy youth sure they do rambo thought and the early bird gets the shaft he peered down at the water again it was not long before he heard somebody walk up behind him he did not bother to see who it was get in the car rambo concentrated on the water will you look at all the fish down there he said must be a couple of thousand whats the name of that big gold one it cant be a real goldfish not that big palomino trout he heard behind him get in the car rambo peered further down at the water must be a new strain i never heard of it hey boy im talking to you look at me but rambo did not i used to go fishing quite a bit he said peering down when i was young but now most streams are fished out or polluted does the town stock this one is that why theres so many fish down there that was why all right the town had stocked the stream for as long as teasle could remember his father often used to bring him down and watch the workmen from the state fish hatchery stock it the workmen would carry pails from a truck down the slope to the stream set them in the water and the ease the pails over to let the fish slide out the length of a mans hand and sleek and sometimes rainbow colored jesus look at me teasle said rambo felt a hand grab on his sleeve he tugged loose hands off he said peering down at the water then he felt the hand grabbing at him again and this time he swung around im telling you he said hands off teasle shrugged all right play it tough if you want that doesnt bother me none he unhooked the handcuffs from his gun belt lets have your wrists rambo kept them at his sides i mean it let me be teasle laughed you mean it he said and laughed you mean it you dont seem to understand i mean it too sooner or later youre getting in that cruiser only question is how much force i have to use before you do it he rested his left hand on his pistol and smiled its such a little thing getting in the cruiser is what do you say we dont lose our perspective people walking by looked curiously at them you would draw that thing rambo said watching teasles hand on the pistol at first i thought you were different but now i see ive met crazy ones like you before then youre one up on me teasle said because ive never met anything quite like you before he stopped smiling and closed his big hand around the grip of his gun move and that was it rambo decided one of them was going to have to back down or else teasle was going to get hurt bad he watched teasles hand on the bolstered pistol and he thought you bloody stupid cop before you pull that gun i could snap off both your arms and legs at the joints i could smash your adams apple to sauce and heave you over the rail then the fish would really have something to feed on but not for this he suddenly told himself not for this just thinking about what he could do to teasle he managed to satisfy his anger and control himself it was a control he had not been capable of before and thinking about his control made him feel better too six months ago when he finished convalescing in the hospital he had been unable to keep hold of himself in a bar in philadelphia some guy had kept pushing ahead of him to see the gogo girl take off her pants and he had broken the guys nose for him a month later in pittsburgh he had slit the throat of a big negro who pulled a knife on him when he was sleeping one night by a lake in a park the negro had brought a friend who tried to run and rambo had hunted him all through the park until he finally caught him trying to start his convertible no not for this he told himself youre all right now it was his turn to smile o k lets have another ride he said to teasle but i dont know what the point is im only going to walk back into town again the police station was in an old schoolhouse and red yet rambo thought as teasle drove into the parking lot at the side he almost asked teasle if painting the schoolhouse red was somebodys idea of a joke but he knew that none of this was a joke and he wondered if he should try talking himself out of it all you dont even like this place it doesnt even interest you if teasle hadnt picked you up you would have gone straight through on your own that doesnt make a difference the cement steps leading up to the front door of the station looked new to him the shiny aluminum door was certainly new and inside there was a bright white room that took up the width of the building and half the length and smelled of turpentine the room was checkered with desks only two of which had anybody at them a policeman typing and another policeman talking into the twoway radio that was along the right back wall they both stopped when they saw him and he waited for it to come now thats a sorry sight the man by the typewriter said it never failed to come sure rambo told him and now youre supposed to say what am i a girl or a boy and after that youre supposed to say if im too poor to get a bath and a haircut youll take up a collection for me its not his looks i mind teasle said its his mouth shingleton have you anything new i ought to know about he asked the man by the radio the man sat tall and solid he had an almost perfectly rectangular face neat sideburns down to slightly below his ears stolen car he said whos handling it ward thatll be fine teasle said and turned to rambo come on then lets get this over they went across the room and down a corridor to the rear of the building footsteps and voices were coming out open doors on both sides office workers in most of the rooms policemen in the rest the corridor was glossy white and the turpentine smelled worse and down at the end there was a scaffold under a dirty green part of the ceiling that had been left unpainted rambo read the sign that was taped to the scaffold out of white paint but we got more coming in tomorrow and we got the blue paint you want to cover the red outside then teasle opened the door into an office at the very end of the hall and rambo held back a moment are you absolutely sure you want to go through with this he asked himself its still not too late to try and talk your way out out of what i havent done anything wrong well come on get in there teasle said this is what youve been working for it had been a mistake not to go in there right away holding back at the door looked like he was afraid and he did not want that but now if he went inside after teasle had ordered him it would look like he was obeying and he did not want that either he went in before teasle had another chance to order him the office ceiling came down close to his head and he felt so closed in that he wanted to stoop but he did not allow himself the floor had a rug that was green and worn like grass that had been trimmed too close to the earth on the left behind a desk there was a case of handguns he centered on a magnum and remembered it from special forces training camp the most powerful handgun made able to shoot through five inches of steel or bring down an elephant but with a kick so great that he himself had always disliked using it sit down on the bench boy teasle said lets have your name just call me boy rambo said the bench was along the right wall he leaned his sleeping bag against it and sat down extremely straight and rigid its none of it funny anymore kid lets have your name im known as kid too you can call me that too if you want youre right i will teasle said im at the point where im ready to call you any damn thing i feel like the kid was more damn nuisance than he could tolerate all he wanted was to have him out of the office so he could phone it was fourthirty now and figuring the time shift it was what threethirty twothirty onethirty in california maybe she would not be in at her sisters now maybe she was out having lunch with somebody who he wondered where that was why he was spending so much time with the kid because he was impatient to call you did not let your troubles interfere with your job you kept your life at home where it belonged if your problems made you start to rush through something then you forced yourself to slow and do it extra well in this case maybe the rule was paying off the kid did not want to give his name and the only reason people did not give a name was that they had something to hide and were afraid of being checked out in the fugitive files maybe this was more than just a kid who would not listen well he would take it slow and find out he sat on the corner of his desk opposite the kid on the bench and calmly lit a cigarette would you like a smoke he asked the kid i dont smoke teasle nodded and leisurely drew on the cigarette how be we try this again whats your name none of your business dear god teasle thought in spite of himself he pushed away from the desk and took a few steps toward the kid slowly though he told himself make it calm you didnt say that i cant believe i actually heard that you heard me all right my name is my business you havent given me a reason to make it yours im the chief of police youre talking to thats not a good enough reason its the best damn reason in the world he said then waited for the heat to drain from his face quietly let me have your wallet i dont carry one let me have your i d cards i dont carry them either no drivers license no social security card no draft card no birth certificate no thats right the kid cut him off dont pull that with me get out your i d cards now the kid was not even bothering to look at him he was turned toward the guncase pointing at the medal above the line of shooting trophies the distinguished service cross really gave them hell in korea did you o k teasle said on your feet it was the second highest medal he could get ranking above the bronze star silver star purple heart distinguished flying medal and distinguished service medal only the congressional medal of honor ranked above it to marine corps master sergeant wilfred logon teasle for conspicuous and valiant leadership in the face of overwhelming enemy fire his citation read the choisin reservoir campaign december that was when he was twenty and he was not about to let any kid who didnt look much older mock it get on your feet im sick of telling you everything twice get on your feet and pull out your pockets the kid shrugged and took his time standing he went from one pocket of his jeans to the other pulling them out and there was nothing you didnt pull out the pockets in your jacket teasle said by god youre right when he pulled them he came out with two dollars and twentythree cents plus a book of matches why the matches teasle said you told me you dont smoke i need to start fires to cook on but you dont have any job or money where do you get the food to cook what do you expect me to say that i steal it teasle looked at the kids sleeping bag against the side of the bench guessing where the i d cards were he untied it and threw it out unrolled on the floor there was a clean shirt and a toothbrush when he started feeling through the shirt the kid said hey i spent a lot of time ironing that shirt be careful not to wrinkle it and teasle was suddenly very tired of him he pressed the intercom on his desk shingleton you had a look at this kid when he came through i want you to radio his description to the state police say id like him identified the quickest they can while youre at it check if he matches any description we have in the files he has no job and no money but he sure looks well fed i want to know why so youre determined to push this thing the kid said thats wrong im not the one whos pushing the justice of the peace had an air conditioner it hummed a bit and rattled every so often and made the office so cold that rambo had to shiver the man behind the desk was bundled in an oversized blue sweater his name was dobzyn the sign on the door said he was chewing tobacco and as soon as he took a look at rambo coming in he stopped chewing well ill be he said and rolled his swivel chair squeaking back from the desk when you phoned will you should have told me that the circus was in town always it came some remark always this whole business was getting out of hand and he knew that he had better give in soon that they could make a lot of trouble for him if he did not but here the crap was coming his way again they would not let up and jesus he was just not going to take it listen son dobzyn was saying i really have to ask you a question his face was very round when he spoke he slipped his chewing tobacco against one cheek and that side of his face bulged out i see kids on the tv demonstrating and rioting and all and im no demonstrator what i have to know doesnt that hair get itchy down the back of your neck always they asked the same it did at first dobzyn scratched his eyebrow and thought about that answer yeah i suppose you can get used to just about anything if you put your mind to it but what about the beard doesnt that get itchy in this heat sometimes then what possessed you to let it grow i have a rash on my face and im not supposed to shave like i have a pain in my rearend and im not supposed to wipe it teasle said by the door now wait a second will it may be hes telling the truth rambo could not resist im not then what did you say all that for i get tired of people asking me why i grew the beard why did you grow the beard i have a rash on my face and im not supposed to shave dobzyn looked like he had been slapped in the face the air conditioner whirred and rattled well well he said quietly extending the words i guess i walked into that one didnt i will the laughs on me he tried a brief chuckle i walked right into it i surely did my yes he chewed on his tobacco just whats the charge will theres two of them vagrancy and resisting arrest but those are just to hold him while i find out if hes wanted anywhere my guess is theft someplace well take up the vagrancy first you guilty son rambo said he wasnt do you have a job do you have more than ten dollars rambo said he didnt then theres no way around it son youre a vagrant thatll cost you five days in jail or fifty dollars fine which will it be i just told you i dont have ten so where the hell would i get fifty this is a court of law dobzyn said leaning suddenly forward in his chair i will not tolerate abusive language in my court one more outburst and ill charge you with contempt he was a moment before he settled back in his chair and started to chew again thinking even as it is i dont see how i can keep your attitude out of mind when im sentencing you like this matter of resisting arrest not guilty i havent asked you yet wait until i ask you whats the story on this resisting arrest will i picked him up for hitchhiking and did him a favor and gave him a lift to outside town figured it would be best for everybody if he kept right on moving teasle leaned one hip on the creaky rail that separated the office from the waitingspace near the door but he came back i had a right so i drove him out of town again and he came back again and when i told him to get in the cruiser he refused i finally had to threaten force before hed listen you think i got in the car because i was afraid of you he wont tell me his name why should i claims he has no i d cards why the hell do i need any listen i cant sit here all night while you two have it out with each other dobzyn said my wife is sick and i was supposed to be home to cook dinner for the kids at five im late already thirty days in jail or two hundred dollars fine whatll it be son two hundred christ i just told you i dont have more than ten then its thirtyfive days in jail dobzyn said and rose out of his chair unbuttoning his sweater i was about to cancel the five days for vagrancy but your attitude is intolerable i have to go im late the air conditioner began to rattle more than it was humming and rambo could not tell if he was shivering from cold or rage hey dobzyn he said catching him as he went by im still waiting for you to ask me if im guilty of resisting arrest the doors on both sides of the corridor were closed now he passed the painters scaffold near the end of the hall heading for teasles office no this time you go this way teasle said he pointed to the last door on the right a door with bars in a little window at the top and reached with a key to unlock it before he saw that the door was already open a quarterinch shaking his head disgustedly at that he pushed the door the rest of the way open and motioned rambo through to a stairwell with an iron banister and cement steps going down and fluorescent lights in the ceiling as soon as rambo was in teasle came through behind him locking the door and they walked down their footsteps scraping on the cement stairs echoing rambo heard the spray before he reached the basement the cement floor was wet and reflected the fluorescent lights and down at the far end a thin policeman was hosing the floor of a cell water running out between the bars and down a drain when he saw teasle and rambo he screwed the nozzle tight the water flared out in a wide arc and abruptly stopped teasles voice echoed galt why is that upstairs door unlocked again did i we dont have anymore prisoners the last one just woke up and i let him go it doesnt matter if we have prisoners or not if you get in the habit of leaving it open when were empty then you might start forgetting to lock it when theres somebody down here so i want the door locked regardless i dont like to say this it may be tough getting used to a new job and a new routine but if you dont learn to be careful i might have to look for somebody else rambo was as cold as he had been in dobzyns office shivering the lights in the ceiling were too close to his head even so the place seemed dark iron and cement christ he should never have let teasle bring him down walking across from the courthouse he should have broken teasle and escaped anything even being on the run was better than thirtyfive days down here what the hell else did you expect he told himself you asked for this didnt you you wouldnt back off damn right i wouldnt and i still wont just because ill be locked up doesnt mean im finished ill fight this as far as it goes by the time hes ready to let me out hell be fucking glad to be rid of me sure youll fight sure what a laugh take a look at yourself already youre shaking already you know what this place reminds you of two days in that cramped cell and youll be pissing down your pantlegs youve got to understand i cant stay in there he could not stop himself the wet i cant stand being closed in where its wet the hole he was thinking his scalp alive the bamboo grate over the top water seeping through the dirt the walls crumbling the inches of slimy muck he had to try sleeping on tell him for gods sake screw you mean beg him sure now when it was too late now the kid was coming around and trying to talk himself out of this teasle could not get over the needlessness of it all how the kid had actually tried his damndest to work himself down here just be thankful it is wet he told the kid that we hose everything down we get weekend drunks in here and come mondays when we kick them out theyve been sick up the walls and all over the place he glanced at the cells and the water on the floor made them look clean sparkling you may be careless with that door upstairs galt he told him but you sure did a job on those cells do me a favor will you go up and get some bedding and an outfit for this kid you he told the kid i guess the middle cell is fine go in take off your boots your pants your jacket leave on your socks your underwear your sweat shirt take off any jewelry any chain around your neck any watch galt what are you looking at nothing what about the gear i sent you for i was just looking ill get it he hurried up the stairs arent you going to tell him again to lock the door the kid said no need teasle listened to the rattle of the door being unlocked he waited then heard galt lock the door after him start with the boots he told the kid so what else did he expect the kid took off his jacket there you go again i told you start with the boots the floor is wet and i told you get in there im not going in there any sooner than i have to he folded his jacket squinted at the water on the floor and set the jacket on the stairs he put his boots beside it took off his jeans folded them and put them on top of the jacket whats that big scar above your left knee teasle said what happened the kid did not answer it looks like a bullet scar teasle said where did you get it my socks are wet on this floor take them off then teasle had to step back to keep from being hit by them now take off your sweat shirt he said what for dont tell me youre still looking for my i d cards lets just say i like a thorough search that i want to see if youve anything hidden under your arms like what dope grass who knows its happened well not me i gave up that stuff a long time ago hell its against the law very funny just take off your sweat shirt for once the kid did what he was told as slow as he could of course his stomach muscles showed tight and there were three straight scars across his chest where did they come from teasle said surprised knife scars what the hell have you been up to anyway the kid squinted at the light and did not answer he had a large triangular patch of black hair on his chest two of the scars cut through it hold up your arms and turn around teasle said that isnt necessary if there was a quicker way to search you i would sure have found it turn around there were dozens of small jagged scars across the kids back jesus whats going on here teasle said those are lash marks whos been lashing you the kid still did not answer thats going to be some interesting report the state police sends back on you he hesitated now came the part he hated all right pull down your shorts the kid looked at him and looked at him dont give me any bashful looks he said disliking this everybody has to go through this and everybody is still a virgin when im finished just pull the shorts down thats enough stop right there at your knees i dont want to see anymore of you than i have to hold yourself up down there i want to see if theres anything hidden not two hands one just your fingertips keeping a distance teasle stooped and peered at the kids groin from several angles the testes were bunched up close under now came the worst part of all he would have told somebody like galt to do it but he did not like passing on dirty jobs turn around and bend over the kid really looked at him get your jollies off somebody else i wont put up with anymore of this yes you will aside from what you might have hid up it im not interested in your rear end whatsoever just do what youre told now reach back and spread your cheeks come on its not a sight i enjoy there you know when i worked in louisville i once had a prisoner with a threeinch knife in a leather case shoved up himself it always beat me how he could sit down upstairs galt was unlocking the door and opening it o k youre clean teasle said to the kid you can pull up your shorts teasle listened for galt to close and lock the upstairs door and then galt came scraping his shoes down the cement steps he was carrying a pair of faded denim coveralls a thin mattress a rubberized sheet a gray blanket he looked at the kid standing there in his shorts and he said to teasle ward just called in about that stolen car he found it in the stone quarry north of here tell him to stay put and tell shingleton to call the state police for a fingerprint crew shingleton already called them galt went into the cell and the kid started to follow his bare feet making a slapping noise in the water on the floor not yet teasle told him well make up your mind first you want me in there now you dont want me in there i wish you knew what you wanted what i want is for you to go down to that shower at the end and i want you to take off your shorts and wash yourself good before you put on the clean uniform be sure to wash that hair of yours i want it clean before i have to touch it what do you mean touch it i have to cut it what are you talking about youre not cutting my hair youre not going anywhere near my head with any scissors i told you everybody has to go through this everybody from car thieves to drunks gets searched like you and takes a shower and gets any long hair cut the mattress were giving you is clean and we want it back clean without any ticks or fleas from where youve been sleeping in sheds and fields and god knows where youre not cutting it with a little encouragement i could arrange for you to spend another thirtyfive days here you wanted in damn bad enough now youre going through with the rest of it why dont you just give in and make things easy for the two of us galt why dont you go up and get the scissors shaving cream and razor ill only agree to the shower the kid said thatll be fine for now one thing at a time as the kid walked slowly down to the shower stall teasle looked again at the lash marks on his back it was almost six oclock the state police would be reporting soon thinking about the time he counted back to three oclock in california unsure now whether to call if she had changed her mind she would already have been in touch with him so if he did phone he would only be putting pressure on and driving her farther away all the same he had to try maybe later when he was done with the kid he would call and just talk without mentioning the divorce who are you fooling the first thing youll ask her is whether shes changed her mind inside the stall the kid turned on the spray the hole was ten feet deep barely wide enough for him to sit with his legs outstretched in the evenings they sometimes came with flashlights to peer down at him through the bamboo grate shortly after each dawn they removed the grate and hoisted him up to do their chores it was the same jungle camp they had tortured him in the same thatched huts and rich green mountains for a reason he did not at first understand they had treated his wounds while he was unconscious the slashes in his chest where the officer had repeatedly punctured him with a slender knife and drawn the blade across grating against his ribs the lacerations in his back where the officer had crept up behind suddenly lashing lashing his leg was badly infected but when they had opened fire on his unit and captured him no bone had been hit only thigh muscle and eventually he was able to limp around now they did not question him anymore did not threaten him did not even talk to him they always made gestures to show him his work dumping slops digging latrines building cookfires he guessed their silence toward him was punishment for pretending not to understand their language still at night in his hole he heard their conversations dimly and from the scraps of words he was satisfied that even while unconscious he had not told them what they wanted to know after the ambush and his capture the rest of his unit must have gone on to its objective because now he heard about the exploded factories and how this camp was one of many in the mountains watching for other american guerrillas soon they had him doing more chores heavier ones feeding him less making him work longer sleep less he came to understand too much time had gone by for him to know where his team would be since he could not give them information they had fixed his wounds so they could play with him some more and find out how much work he could take before it killed him well he would show them a long wait for that there was not much they could do to him that his instructors had not already put him through special forces school and the five mile runs they made him run before breakfast the ten miles of running after breakfast heaving up the meal as he ran but careful not to break ranks because the penalty was ten extra miles for anyone who broke ranks to be sick climbing high towers shouting his roster number to the jumpmaster leaping legs together feet braced elbows tucked in yelling one thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand as he dropped stomach rising to his throat springharness jerking him up just before the ground thirty pushups for every lapse in the routine plus a pushup shouted for the airborne another thirty pushups if the shout was weak plus another one for the airborne in the mess hall on the toilet everywhere the officers waited abruptly yelling hit it and he would have to snap down in a jumping pose shouting one thousand two thousand three thousand four thousand snapping to attention till dismissed then shouting clear sir running off shouting airborne airborne airborne dayjumps into forests nightjumps into swamps to live there for a week his only equipment a knife classes in weapons explosives surveillance interrogation handtohand combat a field of cattle he and the other students holding knives bowels and stomachs strewn across the field animals still alive and screeching hollowed carcasses and the order to crawl in to wrap the carcass around him to wash himself in blood that was the point of becoming a green beret he could take anything but each day in the jungle camp he grew weaker and at last he was afraid that his body could not keep on more work more heavy work less food less sleep what he saw went gray and blurred he stumbled moaning talking to himself after three days without food they tossed a snake flopping into his hole to squirm in the dirt and they watched as he twisted off its head and ate the body raw he only managed to keep a little of it down not until later a few minutes a few days the time was all the same did he wonder if the snake was poisonous or not that and the bugs he found in his hole and the chunks of garbage they occasionally threw down at him that was all that gave him life the next few days or weeks he could not tell hauling a dead tree through the jungle back to camp he was permitted to pick fruit and eat it and by nightfall he had dysentery he lay in a stupor in his hole mired in his excrement hearing them talk about his foolishness but he had not been foolish in his delirium his mind seemed better than it had been since capture and the dysentery was intentional he had eaten just enough to catch it mildly so the next day when they hauled him up be could pretend his cramps were more severe than they were actually so he could collapse while dragging the dead trees back to camp maybe they would not make him work for a while then maybe his guard would leave him in the jungle and go for help to carry him to camp and by the time the guard returned he would have been able to escape but then he realized that his mind was not better at all he had eaten too much fruit and the cramps were worse than he expected and once he could no longer work the guard would likely shoot him and even if he did escape how long could he last how far could he get starved and halfdead and diarrheic he could not remember if he realized all this before or after everything became confused and suddenly he was on his own crashing through the jungle collapsing into a stream the next thing he knew he was crawling through ferns up a slope standing at the top falling onto level grass standing again and straining to get across the level then crawling up another slope at the top no longer able to stand only to crawl the mountain tribes he was thinking get to a tribe was all he could think somebody was making him drink the soldiers had caught him he was sure and he fought to break away but somebody was holding him down and making him swallow it wasnt soldiers it couldnt be they let him break away stumbling through the jungle sometimes he thought he was back in his hole only dreaming he was loose other times he thought he was still dropping from the plane with the rest of his team his chute not opening in two weeks the rain started coming down forever mud wood rot showers streaming down so thick that he could hardly breathe he kept on dazed by the pelt of the rain infuriated by the suck of the mud by the wet bushes clinging to him he could not tell which way was south anymore the night clouds would break and he would take a bearing from a star but then the clouds would close up and hed have to travel blind and when the clouds once more opened hed discover he had lost direction one morning he found he had wandered in a circle and after that he travelled only in the day he had to go slower more carefully to keep from being spotted when clouds obscured the sun he aimed toward faroff landmarks a mountain peak or a towering tree and each day every day the rains came he fell out of the forest staggering across a field and somebody shot at him he stumbled to the ground crawling back to the trees another shot people running through the grass i told you to identify yourself a man was saying if it werent i saw you didnt have a weapon id have killed you stand the hell up and identify yourself americans he started laughing he could not stop laughing they held him in the hospital for a month before his hysteria left him his drop into the north had been at the start of december and it was now the start of may they told him how long he had been a prisoner he didnt know how long he had been on the run he didnt know but between then and now he had covered the distance between his drop area and this american base in the south three hundred and ninety miles and what had started him laughing was that he must have been in american territory for days some of the soldiers he had heard in the night and hid from must have been americans he put off going back out there as long as he could he knew he would not be able to stand it when teasle came touching the scissors to his head and cutting the spray of water on him he glanced out the shower and galt was suddenly at the bottom of the stairs holding the scissors and a can of shaving cream and a straight razor his stomach tightened he watched frantically as teasle pointed at a desk and chair by the bottom of the stairs saying something to galt that came muffled through the noise of the spray galt brought the chair around in front of the desk took some newspapers from inside the desk and spread them under the chair he was not long doing it at all directly teasle came toward him in the stall close enough for him to hear turn off the water teasle said rambo pretended not to hear teasle came farther down turn off the water he repeated rambo went on washing his arms and chest the soap was a big yellow cake that smelled strongly of disinfectant he switched to soaping his legs it was the third time he had soaped them teasle nodded and walked out of sight to the left of the stall where there must have been a shutoff valve because in a second the water quit spraying rambos legs and shoulders tightened water dripping from him onto the hollow metal bottom of the stall and then teasle was in sight again holding a towel theres no sense in putting this off teasle said youll just catch cold rambo had no choice he stepped out slowly he knew that if he didnt teasle would reach in for him and he didnt want teasle touching him he dried himself repeatedly with the towel in the cold the towel made prickle marks on his arms his testicles felt exposed dry yourself anymore and youll wear out the towel teasle said he went on drying himself teasle reached to guide him toward the chair and rambo sidestepped keeping teasle and galt in front of him as he backed over to the chair without a pause everything built up in quick sequence first teasle touched the scissors to the side of his head snipping and rambo tried but could not stop himself from flinching hold still teasle said youll jerk against the scissors and maybe hurt yourself next teasle snipped off a large clump of hair and rambos left ear was cool and unprotected in the damp basement air youve got more up here than i guessed teasle said and dropped the clump onto the newspaper spread out on the floor your heads going to weigh a lot less in a minute the newspaper was turning gray soaking up water then teasle snipped off more and rambo had to flinch again teasle stepped back of him and rambo tensed from not being able to see what was going on behind he swung his head to see and teasle pressed him forward rambo slipped his head from under the hand but teasle snipped the scissors to his head again and rambo flinched again and hair caught in the swivel of the scissors yanking sharply at his scalp he could not bear it anymore he surged from the chair and spun around to teasle get away sit down in that chair youre not cutting anymore you want my hair cut you get a barber down here its after six there arent any barbers working now youre not putting on that uniform until your hair is cut then ill stay like this youll sit on the chair galt go up and bring shingleton ive made as many allowances as i can well cut his hair so fast itll be like we used sheep shears galt looked happy to get away rambo listened to him unlock the door at the top of the stairs the rattle echoing down it was all happening even faster now he did not want to hurt anyone but he knew that was coming he could feel his anger spreading out of control instantly a man was rushing down the stairs galt half a flight behind it was the man who had been sitting by the radio in the front office shingleton he seemed huge now that he was standing his head up near the bright lights in the ceiling the bones above his eyes and around the bottom of his face stuck out in the glare he looked at rambo and rambo felt twice as naked trouble shingleton said to teasle i hear you have trouble no but he does teasle said you and galt sit him on the chair shingleton came right over galt hesitated then he came over too i dont know what this is all about shingleton said to rambo but im reasonable ill give you a choice do you walk or do i carry you i think youd better not touch me he was determined to keep control there would be just the next five minutes and the continual touch of the scissors and then it would be over he would be all right he started toward the chair his feet slick in the water and behind him shingleton said good god where did you get all the scars on your back in the war that was a weakness he should not have answered oh sure sure you did in which army rambo almost killed him right then but teasle took another snip at his hair and startled him there were clumps of long hair scattered across the gray wet newspaper some of them tangled around rambos bare feet he expected teasle to go on snipping at his head he braced himself for it but then teasle brought the scissors too close to his right eye cutting his beard and rambo instinctively dipped his head to the left hold still teasle said shingleton you and galt hold him steady shingleton pulled his head up straight and rambo slammed his arm away teasle snipped again at his beard catching it in the scissors pinching his cheek christ he squirmed they were too close they were crowding him so he wanted to scream this could go on all night teasle said galt go get the shaving cream and the razor off the desk rambo squirmed youre not shaving me youre not coming near me with that razor then galt was there handing it to teasle and rambo watched the long blade flash in the lights and remembered the enemy officer slicing his chest and that was the end he broke grabbing the razor and standing pushing them away he fought the impulse to attack not here not in the goddamned police station all he wanted was the razor away from them but galt was whitefaced eyes on the razor and he was fumbling for his gun no galt teasle shouted no guns but galt continued fumbling for his gun and awkwardly he had it out he must really have been new on the job he looked as though he could not believe he was actually raising the gun his hand shaking squeezing on the trigger and rambo slashed the razor straight across his stomach galt peered stupidly down at the neat deep slash across his belly blood soaking his shirt and pouring down his pants organs bulging out like a pumpedup inner tube through a slit in a tire he took a finger and tried poking the organs back in but they kept bulging out blood soaking his pants and running out his cuffs onto the floor as he made a funny little noise in his throat and toppled across the chair upsetting it rambo was already charging up the stairs he had looked at teasle and shingleton and the one was over by the cells the other by the wall and he knew they were too far apart for him to slash both of them before at least one had time to pull his handgun and fire even as he rounded the landing halfway up the stairs the first shot came from behind him whacking into the landings concrete wall the top half of the stairs was at an angle the reverse of the lower half so he was out of their sight now over their heads pounding up toward the door to the main hall he heard shouts below him and then running on the first half of the stairs the door he had forgotten about the door teasle had warned galt about making sure to lock it he rushed up praying that galt had been in too big a hurry when he came back with shingleton hearing stop down behind him and a gun being cocked as he wrenched the handle and pulled at the door and sweet jesus it came open he was just ducking around the corner when two shots cracked into the bright white wall across from him he heaved on the painters scaffold and the thing came crashing down in front of the door planks and paint cans and steel poles piling together barring the way whats going on somebody said in the hall behind him and he turned to a policeman standing surprised staring at rambo naked reaching for his gun four quick steps and rambo chopped the flat edge of his hand across the bridge of the guys nose and caught the gun dropping from the guys hand as he fell somebody from downstairs was pushing at the wreck of the scaffold rambo fired twice hearing teasle cry out hoping the shots would hold back teasle long enough for him to reach the front door he made it there firing once again at the scaffold before he burst outside naked into the hot glare of the evening sun an old woman on the sidewalk screamed a man slowed his car and stared rambo leapt down the front steps onto the sidewalk past the old woman screaming toward a man in work clothes going by on a motorcycle the man made the mistake of slowing down to look because by the time he decided to speed up rambo had got to him and lunged him off the cycle the man hit the street headfirst his yellow crash helmet scraping across the pavement rambo swung onto the cycle his bare hips on the hot black seat and the cycle roared off with him firing his last three bullets at teasle who had just rushed out the front door of the station and then ducked back in when he saw rambo aiming rambo raced the cycle down past the courthouse weaving zigzagging to throw off teasles aim ahead people were standing on a corner looking and he hoped the risk of hitting them would keep teasle from shooting he heard shouts behind him shouts ahead of him from the people on the corner one man came running off the corner to stop him but rambo kicked him away and then he was whipping left around the corner and for now he was safe and he really got the cycle going six bullets teasle counted the kids gun was empty he charged outside squinting in the sun just in time to see the kid disappearing round the corner shingleton had his gun aimed teasle yanked it down christ dont you see all those people i couldve had him you couldve had more than him he ran back in the station swinging open the front door three bullet holes in the aluminum screen get in here check galt and preston phone a doctor he was running across the room to the twoway radio astonished that shingleton had tried firing the guy was so efficient in the office always secondguessing now with no routine for this kind of trouble he was stupidly acting on impulse the screen door whacked shut as shingleton rushed in and down the hall teasle jabbed at a switch on the radio talking fast into the microphone his hands were shaking his bowels felt full of loose hot waste ward where the hell are you ward he called into the radio but ward wasnt answering and then at last teasle had him telling him what happened figuring his tactics he knows center road will take him out of town hes headed west in that direction cut him off shingleton came rushing around the hall corner into the front room over to teasle galt hes dead god his guts are hanging out he blurted as he came he swallowed trying to catch his breath prestons alive i dont know for how long hes got blood coming out his eyes snap up phone an ambulance a doctor teasle jabbed another switch on the radio his hands wouldnt stop shaking his bowels felt warmer looser state police he called quickly into the microphone madison to state police emergency they didnt answer he called louder im not deaf madison a mans voice crackled whats your trouble jailbreak one officer dead he told him hurriedly hating to waste time repeating what had happened requesting roadblocks the voice was instantly alert shingleton put down the phone teasle hadnt even heard him dial the ambulance is on its way phone me orval kellerman teasle jabbed another switch calling another cruiser ordering it after the kid shingleton had already dialed again thank god he was all right now kellermans outside ive got his wife she wont let me talk to him teasle took the phone mrs

a partner killed he wanted to smash the kids face against cement what did he have to do it for he said to shingleton its fucking crazy he comes around looking for trouble and in one afternoon he goes from vagrancy to murder hey are you all right sit down and put your head between your knees ive never seen a man slashed before galt i had lunch with him for crissake doesnt matter how many times you see it i must have watched fifty guys bayonetted in korea and i never kept from feeling sick one man i knew in louisville twenty years on the force he went to check out a knifing in a bar one night and there was so much blood mixed in with the beer on the floor he had a heart attack and died trying to make it back to the cruiser he heard somebody picking up the phone on the other end please let it be orval so what is it will this better be as important as you say it was him orval had been his fathers best friend and the three of them used to go out hunting together every saturday of the season then after teasles father had been killed orval had become a second father to him he was retired now but he was in better shape than men half as young and he had the best trained pack of hounds in the county orval we just had a jailbreak here i dont have time to explain but its a kid were after and hes killed one of my men and i dont think hell stay on the roads with the state police after him im positive hell head for the mountains and im hoping like hell that youre in the mood to give those dogs of yours the run of their lives rambo roared the bike down center road wind was stinging his face and chest his eyes were watering in the wind and he was afraid he would have to slow to see what was ahead cars were stopping abruptly drivers staring out their windows at him naked on the cycle people all along the street were turning at him pointing a siren started far behind him he revved the cycle up to sixty racing through a red light barely able to swerve in time to miss a big oil truck lumbering across the intersection another siren started far to his left there was no way a cycle could outrun police cars but a cycle could go where police cars couldnt the mountains the street dipped sharply and then rose long uphill and rambo sped up it hearing the sirens the one on his left had swung over to join the one behind him he hit the top of the hill so fast that the cycle left the pavement jolting back down forcing him to slow and catch his balance then he was racing again he passed the you are now leaving madison sign passed the ditch where he had eaten his hamburgers that afternoon the fields of brown corn swept off on both sides and the sirens were closer and the mountains were off to the right he swerved that way onto a dirt road almost spilling when he turned sharply to miss a dairy truck the driver leaned out his window shouting at him now he was throwing up dust behind him holding his speed at fifty to keep from skidding on the loose gravel the sirens were behind him to the right then directly behind him they were coming too fast if he stayed on this dirt road he would never lose them in time to get to the mountains he had to leave this road for someplace they could not go he dodged to the left through an open gate down a narrow wagon road its ruts deep and yellow in the ground the corn remained on both sides the mountains were still off to the right and he was searching for a way to get over to them the sirens louder he reached the end of the cornfields turning right onto a field of wilted grass the cycle heaving on the uneven ground dipping and rising whipping through the grass but the police cars would still be able to chase him this way and then he heard their sirens louder yet directly behind him again a stout wooden fence ahead he sped closer frantic from the sirens seeing cattle what must have been a hundred they were in this field but they were moving out ahead of him ambling through an open gate in the fence and up a slope toward trees the roar of his cycle started them galloping before he got to them jersey brown bellowing heaving three abreast through the open gate and up the slope their milk sacks swinging full they loomed larger the closer he came behind them scattering hooves thundering as he pushed through the gate with the last of them and raced up the slope it was steep and he had to lean forward to keep the front wheel from tipping up past one tree then another the mountains close and then he was off the slope speeding onto level ground he leapt the bike over a narrow stream almost upsetting on the other bank but the mountains were wonderfully close now and he steadied the bike and revved the throttle to its limit ahead a line of trees then thick forest rocks underbrush at last he saw what he was looking for a draw between two slopes up into the rocky hills and he steered that way as the sirens began dying close behind him that meant the cruisers had stopped the police would be jumping out now aiming at him he concentrated on the draw a crack of a gun bullet zipping past his head whunking into a tree he bore fast into scattered trees zigzagging toward the draw another crack of a gun but the bullet nowhere close and then he was into thick forest out of sight up into the draw thirty feet ahead a tangle of rocks and upturned trees blocked his path and he slid off the cycle letting it roll crashing into the rocks he scrambled up the dense slope sharp branches digging everywhere into him there would be more police after him a lot more soon at least he would have a little time to climb high into the mountains before they came he would head for mexico he would hole up in mexico in a little coast town and swim every day in the sea but he had better not ever see that sonofabitch teasle again he had promised himself that he was through hurting people and now that sonofabitch had made him kill once more and if teasle kept pushing rambo was determined to give back a fight teasle would wish to god he had never started part two teasle did not have much time he needed to get his men organized and into the woods before the state police he swerved the cruiser off the wagon road onto the grassland racing over the tracks the two police cars and the kids motorcycle had made in the grass toward the wood fence at the end of the field toward the open gate next to him shingleton had his hands braced against the dashboard the cruiser heaving and lurching across the field potholes so deep that the cars heavy frame was crashing down past its springs onto the axles the gates too narrow shingleton warned him youll never get through the others did he braked suddenly slowing through the gate an inch to spare on his side then speeding up the steep slope toward the two police cars that were parked a quarterway from the top they must have stalled there when he reached them the slope angled so high that his motor started missing he wrenched the gearshift into first and floored the accelerator feeling the rear wheels dig into the grass the cruiser rocketing toward the summit the deputy ward was up on the level waiting tinted red from the swollen sun that was already glaring halfway down the mountains to the left his shoulders sloped forward and he walked with his stomach a little forward his gun belt high on his waist he was over to the car before teasle had it stopped this way he said pointing toward the draw inside the line of trees be careful of the stream lester already fell in crickets were sounding by the stream teasle was just out of the car when he heard a motor down near the wagon road he looked quickly hoping it wasnt the state police orval an old volkswagen van it too flooded with red from the sun was rumbling across the grassland at the bottom it stopped at the base not built to make the climb his own car had and orval got out tall and thin a policeman with him teasle became afraid the dogs were not in the van he could not hear them yelping he knew orval had them trained so well that they only barked when they were supposed to but he could not help worrying that they were silent now because orval had not brought them orval and the policeman were hurrying up the slope the policeman was twentysix the youngest on teasles staff his gunbelt the reverse of wards slung low like an oldtime gunfighters orval passed him running up his long legs stretching the top of his head was shiny bald white hair on both sides he had on his glasses and a green nylon jacket green denim pants highlaced field boots the state police teasle thought again and glanced down at the wagon road making sure they were not on their way he glanced back at orval closer now before he had only been able to see the thin dark weathered face but now he saw the deep rivers and furrows in it and the flabby skin down the front of his neck and he was shocked by how much older the man looked since he had last seen him three months ago orval wasnt acting any older though he was still managing to get up that slope hardly winded well before the young deputy the dogs teasle called did you bring the dogs sure but i dont see the use of sending that deputy to help rush them into the van orval answered at the top slowing look at that sun itll be dark in an hour dont you think i know it i believe you do orval said i didnt mean to try and tell you anything teasle wished he had kept quiet he could not afford to let it start again this was too important orval was always treating him like he was still thirteen telling him everything to do and how to do it just as he had when teasle lived with him as a boy teasle would be cleaning a gun or preparing a special cartridge load and right away orval would step in giving his advice taking over and teasle hated it told him to butt out that he could do things himself often argued with him he understood why he did not like advice there were teachers he sometimes met who could not stop lecturing once they were out of class and he was a little like them so used to giving orders that he could not accept someone telling him what to do he did not always refuse advice if it was good he often took it but he could not let that be a habit to do his job properly he had to rely on himself alone if orval had only on occasion tried to tell him what to do he would not have minded but not everytime they were together and now they had almost started at each other again and teasle was going to have to keep himself quiet orval was the one man he needed right now and orval was just stubborn enough to take his dogs back home if they got into another argument teasle did his best to smile hey orval thats just me sounding miserable again dont pay attention im glad to see you he reached to shake hands with him it had been orval who taught him how to shake hands when he was a boy long and firm orval had said make your handshake as good as your word long and firm now as their hands met teasle felt his throat constrict in spite of everything he loved this old man and he could not adjust to the new wrinkles in his face the white hair at the sides of his head that had become thinner and wispy like spider strands their handshake was awkward teasle had deliberately not seen orval in three months ever since he had walked yelling out of orvals house because a simple remark he had made had turned into a long argument over which way to strap on a holster pointed forward or back soon after he had been embarrassed about leaving the house like that and he was embarrassed now trying to act natural and look orval straight in the face doing a poor job of it orval about last time im sorry i mean it thanks for coming so quick when i need you orval just grinned he was beautiful didnt i tell you never to talk to a man when youre shaking hands with him look him straight in the eyes dont jabber at him i still think a holster should be pointed backward he winked at the other men his voice was low and resonant what about this kid wheres he gone to over here ward said he directed them across two loose rocks in the stream over to the line of trees and up into the draw it was gray and cool under the trees as they hiked up to where the cycle lay on its side over the fallen branches of a dead tree the crickets were not sounding anymore then teasle and the rest stopped walking through the grass and the crickets started again orval nodded at the blockade of rocks and upturned trees across the draw at the underbrush on both sides yeah you can see where he scrambled up through the bushes on the right side as if his voice were a signal something big up there rustled in the brush and guessing there was a chance it was the kid teasle stepped back instinctively drawing his pistol nobody around a man said up there pebbles and loose dirt sliding and it was lester coming down off balance through the bushes he was soaking wet from when he had fallen in the stream his eyes usually bulged somewhat and when he saw teasles gun they enlarged even more hey now its only me i was only checking if the kid might be close by orval scratched his chin i wish you hadnt done that youve maybe confused the scent will do you have something from the kid to give my dogs a smell of in the trunk of the car underwear pants boots all we need then are food and a nights sleep we get this organized right and we can start by sunup no tonight hows that were starting now didnt you just hear me say itll be dark in an hour therell be no moon tonight this big a gang well separate and lose each other in the dark teasle had been expecting this he had been certain that orval would want to hold off until morning that was the practical way there was just one thing wrong with the practical way he could not wait that long moon or not we still have to go after him now he told orval weve chased him out of our jurisdiction and the only way to keep after him is if we stay in pursuit once i wait till morning i have to turn the job over to the state police then give it to them its a dirty job anyhow no what difference does it make the state police will be out here in no time anyway just as soon as the guy who owns this land calls them about all these cars driving across his fields youll have to turn this over to them no matter what not if im in these woods before they get here it would have been better for him to try convincing orval without his men next to him listening if he did not press orval then he would come off less to his men but if he pressed too much orval would just throw up his hands and go home what orval said next did not help any no will im sorry to have to disappoint you ill do a lot of things for you but those hills are tough to get through even in the day and i wont take my dogs up there at night to run them blind just because you want this show all to yourself im not asking you to run them blind all im asking is that you bring your dogs in with me and the minute you think its gone too dark well stop and camp thats all it takes for me to stay in pursuit come on weve camped out before you and i itll be like when dad was around orval let out a deep breath and looked around at the forest it was darker cooler dont you see how crazy this is we dont have equipment to hunt him we dont have rifles or food or shingleton can stay behind to get whatever we need well give him one of your dogs so in the morning he can track us to where we camped i have enough deputies to keep charge of town so four of them can come in with shingleton tomorrow i have a friend at the county airport who says hell lend his helicopter and fly us anything more we need and fly ahead to see if he can spot the kid the only thing that can hold us up now is you im asking you will you help orval was looking down at his feet scuffling one boot back and forth in the dirt i dont have much time orval if we get up in there soon enough the state police will have to let me stay in control theyll back me up and have cruisers watching the main roads down out of the hills and leave us to chase him across the high ground but im telling you i might just as well forget about catching him if you dont chip in your dogs orval glanced up and slowly reached into his jacket for a tobacco pouch and cigarette paper he was mulling it over as he carefully rolled a cigarette and teasle knew not to rush him finally just before orval struck a match could be if i understood what did this kid do to you will he sliced one deputy nearly in half and beat another maybe blind yeah will orval said and struck the match cupping it to light his cigarette but you didnt answer me what did this kid do to you the country was high and wild thickly wooded slashed by ravines and draws and pocked with hollows just like the north carolina hills in which he had been trained much like the hills he had escaped through in the war his kind of land and his kind of fight and nobody had better push too close or he would push back hard fighting to beat the fading light he ran as far and as fast as he could always up his naked body was filmed with blood from the branches jabbing into him his bare feet were gashed and bloody from the sharp sticks lying across his trail from the rocky slopes and cliff walls he came up a rise where the skeleton of a hydro pylon straddled the top and a swath had been cut down through the trees to stop the electric tension wires from tangling in the treetops the clear section was gravel and boulders and scrub brush and he scrambled painfully up high tension wires overhead he needed to reach the tallest vantage point he could before it got dark he needed to see what was on the other side of the rise and figure which way to go at the top beneath the pylon the air was bright and clear and hurrying up into it he was touched by the last of the setting sun far to the left he paused letting the faint warm light soak into him luxuriating in the soft feel of the ground here beneath his feet the next peak across from him was bright in the sun as well but its slope was gray and the hollow at its base was already dark that was where he headed away from the soft ground at the top down more gravel and boulders toward the hollow if he did not find what he wanted there he would have to angle up to the left toward a stream he had sighted and then he would have to follow the stream it would be easier going that way along the bank and what he was looking for would almost surely be near a stream he came charging down the gravel toward the hollow slipping falling sweat burning salty into his cuts the hollow was no good when he got there a swamp straight across bog and murky water but at least the earth was soft again and he rounded the swamp to the left until he reached the stream that fed it then started up along the stream no longer running just walking fast now he had travelled almost five miles he could tell and the distance had tired him he still was not as fit as he had been before he was captured in the war he still had not got over his weeks in the hospital all the same he remembered every trick of getting along and if he could not run much farther without trouble he had done five miles very well the stream twisted and turned and he followed it soon there would be dogs after him he knew but he did not bother wading in the stream to try to throw them off his scent that would only slow him down and since he would have to come out of the water sometime on one bank or the other the man working the dogs would merely split the pack along both banks until they picked up the scent again and he himself would just have wasted time it went dark faster than he expected climbing uphill he was catching the last gray light and then the forest and underbrush merged into shadow soon only the biggest of trees and boulders were distinguishable in outline and then it was black there was the sound of the stream trickling over bedrocks and the sound of crickets and night birds and animals at home in the dark and he started calling for sure nobody he was looking for would let him know they were around if all he did was keep following the stream and holler for somebody he had to make himself sound interesting he had to make them want to see just who the hell this was he called out in vietnamese in the little french he had learned in high school he mocked a southern accent a western one a negro one he strung out long lists of the vilest obscenities he could conjure the stream dipped into a brief hollow on the side of the slope nobody there the stream climbed and dipped into another hollow and climbed and dipped and still nobody and still he called if he did not soon find someone he would be so far up the hillside that the stream would maybe reach its source and he would have no bearing to follow which happened his sweat chilling in the night air he came to where the stream turned into a little marsh and a spring that he could hear bubbling up so much for that he called once more letting his obscene words echo up and down the darkened hill waited then set off upward if he kept going straight up slopes and down he figured eventually to reach another stream and follow it he was thirty feet past the spring when the two flashlights opened bright on him from left and right and he stopped absolutely still under any other circumstance he would have leapt free from the glare of the flashlights and crawled off into the darkness it was worth a mans life to wander around these hills at night poking where he had no business how many men had been shot in the head for what he was about dumped in a shallow grave to let the night animals dig them up the flashlights blazed directly on him one on his face the other on his naked body he still did not move just stood there head up staring calmly ahead between the lights as if he belonged there and did this every night of his life insects were flying aglitter in and out of the flashlight beams a bird took off fluttering out of a tree yeah best you drop that gun and razor an old man said on the right his throat raspy rambo breathed easier they werent going to kill him at least not right away he had made them curious enough just the same keeping the handgun and the razor had been a gamble once these people had seen them they might have felt threatened and shot him but he could not let himself walk these woods at night without something to fight with if he had to yes sir rambo said evenly and let the gun and razor plop onto the ground no need to worry the guns not loaded course it isnt with an old man on the right the one on the left would be young rambo thought father and son maybe or uncle and nephew that was how these outfits were run always in the family an old man to give the orders and one or more juniors to do the work rambo could feel these two behind their flashlights sizing him up the old man was keeping quiet now and rambo was not about to say anything more until he was asked to an intruder he had just better keep his mouth shut yeah all that filth and crud you been hollering the old man said you been calling us or who you been calling cocksuckers pa ask him what hes walking around bucknaked with his doings dangling for the one on the left said he sounded much younger than rambo had expected you shut up the old man ordered the boy i told you not a peep from you rambo heard a gun being cocked where the old man was wait a minute he said fast im alone i need help dont shoot till you hear me out the old man did not answer i mean im not here for trouble it doesnt make any difference if i know that youre not two men that one of you is just a boy i wont be hurting anybody just because i know that it was a wild guess sure the old man might only have lost his curiosity and decided to shoot but rambo was guessing that naked and bloody he looked dangerous to the old man that the old man was not taking any chances now that rambo knew they were just one man and a boy im on the run from the police they took my clothes i killed one of them ive been calling to get someone to help me yeah you need help the old man said question is from who theyll bring dogs after me theyll find the still if we dont work to stop them now was the touchy part if they were going to kill him now was the time still the old man said who told you theres a still up here you think i got a still up here were pitch dark in a hollow near a spring what else would bring you here you must have it damn wellcovered even knowing its here i cant make out the flames from your furnace you expect if i knew a still was around id he wasting time with you instead of hustling over to it hell im a coon hunter with no dogs we dont have time for this we have to fix things before those real dogs get here tomorrow the old man was swearing to himself youre in a mess all right rambo said im sorry about getting you into it but i dont have any choice i need food and clothes and a rifle and im not letting you out of this until i get them lets just shoot him pa the boy said on the left hes going to pull some trick the old man did not answer and rambo kept quiet too he had to give the old man time to think if he tried to rush this business the old man might feel cornered and shoot on his left rambo heard the boy cocking a gun you lower that shotgun matthew the old man said but hes pulling some trick dont you see it dont you see hes some government man likely ill see that shotgun wrapped around your ears if you dont lower it like i said the old man chuckled then government man bushwah look at him where the hell would he hide his badge better listen to your dad rambo said he understands the bind if you kill me those police who find me in the morning will want to know who did it theyll set the dogs on your trail next it wont matter where you bury me or how you try to hide the scent theyll quicklime the boy said smartly sure quicklime will help to cover my scent but the smell of it will be all over you and theyll set the dogs tracking that he paused peering at each flashlight giving them time to think the trouble is if you dont give me food and clothes and a rifle then im not leaving here until i find that still of yours and in the morning the police will follow my track through there it wont matter if you take the thing apart tonight and hide it ill come after you to where the parts are hid wed wait for dawn to take it apart the old man said you cant afford to stay here that long with bare feet i cant go much farther anyway no believe me the way i am they have a good chance of bringing me down and i might just as well take the two of you down with me after a moment the old man was swearing again but if you help me if you give me what i need then ill swing around away from here and the police wont come anywhere close to your still that was the simplest rambo could make it the idea sounded convincing to him if they wanted to protect their outfit they would have to help of course they might get angry at how he was forcing them and take a chance on killing him or they might be an inbred family not intelligent enough to see the logic he was using it was colder and rambo couldnt stop himself from shivering now that everybody was silent the crickets seemed extra loud finally the old man spoke matthew i suppose you better run up to the house and bring back what he says his voice was not very happy and bring a can of kerosene rambo said since youre helping lets make sure you dont get hurt for it ill douse the clothes with the kerosene and let them dry before i put them on the kerosene wont stop the dogs from trailing me but it will keep them from picking up your scent on the clothes and following it to see who helped me the boys flashlight beam glared steady on rambo ill do what my pa says not you go on do what he wants the old man said i dont like him either but he sure knows what the hell hes got us into the boys flashlight beam remained steady on rambo a moment longer as though the boy were deciding if he would go or maybe saving face then the beam swung off rambo into the bushes and the light clicked off and rambo heard him set out brushing through the undergrowth he had probably come and gone from home to this spring and back again so many times that he could do it with his eyes shut let alone without a light thanks rambo told the old man whose light remained shining on his face then the light went out thanks for that too rambo said the image of the light remaining on his eyes a few seconds slowly fading just helping the batteries rambo heard him start to come forward through the underbrush better not come closer he said to the old man we dont want to mix your scent with mine i wasnt about to theres a log here i wanted to sit on is all the old man lit a match and touched it to the bowl of a pipe the match did not stay lit very long but as the old man puffed on his pipe and the flame from the match got high and low rambo saw a tousled head of hair and a gristled face and the top half of a redcheckered shirt with suspenders over the shoulders do you have any of your stuff with you rambo asked maybe its cold like this i wouldnt mind a swallow the old man waited then switched on his flashlight and heaved over a jug so that rambo could see in the light to catch it the jug weighed like a bowling ball and in his surprise rambo almost dropped it the old man chuckled rambo pried out the cork wet and squeaking and in spite of the jugs weight he drank with one hand the way he knew the old man would respect shoving a forefinger through the hook at the top balancing the jug on the crook of his elbow it tasted like two hundred proof goldenstrong and burning his tongue and throat flooding hot every inch down to his stomach he almost choked when he lowered the jug his eyes were watering a little strong the old man asked a little rambo said having trouble getting his voice to work what is it corn mash but its a little strong though aint it yeah id say its a little strong rambo repeated his voice giving him more trouble the old man laughed yeah its a little strong all right rambo lifted the jug and drank again gagging on the hot thick liquor and the old man laughed one more quick burst the first songs of the morning birds wakened teasle in the dark and he lay there on the ground by the fire huddled in the blanket he had brought from the cruiser peering up at the late stars beyond the treetops it had been years since he slept out in the woods over twenty years he realized counting back to not the end of sleeping in frozen foxholes in korea hardly qualified hell no the last time he had really camped out was that spring when he got his draft notice and decided to enlist in the marines and he and orval hiked into the hills for the first weekend it was warm enough now he was stiff from sleeping on the rough ground his clothes were damp from where the dew had soaked through the blanket and even near the fire he was bonecold but he had not felt this alive in years excited to be in action again eager to chase after the kid there was no point though in rousing everybody until shingleton came back with the supplies and the rest of the men and for now the only one awake he loved being alone this way so different from the nights he had been spending alone since anna had left he wrapped himself tighter in the blanket then the smell reached him and he looked and orval was sitting at the end of the fire dragging on a thin selfrolled cigarette the smoke drifting toward teasle in the cool early breeze i didnt know you were awake teasle whispered not to disturb the others how long before you but ive been awake over an hour i know it i dont sleep much anymore not because i cant i just begrudge the time spent clutching his blanket teasle shifted close to orval and lit a cigarette off the glow of a stick from the fire the flames were flicking low and when teasle churned the stick back into them they rose warm crackling he had been right when he told orval this would be like old times although he had not believed it then needing orval to come along and disliking himself for using that kind of emotional argument on the man but the feel of gathering firewood tossing away stones and twigs to make the ground less rough spreading his blanket he had forgotten how solid and good that all was so she left orval said teasle did not want to talk about it she was the one who had left not the other way around and that made it look as though he was in the wrong maybe he was but she was too still he could not bring himself to put blame on her just so orval might not think poorly of him he tried to explain it neutrally she might come back shes thinking about that i havent let on much but for a while there we were arguing quite a bit youre not an easy man to get along with well christ neither are you but ive lived with the same woman forty years and as far as i can guess bea hasnt thought much about leaving i know people must be asking you this a lot now but considering what you and i are i believe i have a right what were the arguments about he almost did not answer talking about very personal things always embarrassed him especially this which he had not yet reasoned out who was right whether he was justified kids he said and then since he had begun he went on i asked her for at least one i dont care boy or girl its just that id like someone to be to me like i was to you i i dont know how to explain it i even feel stupid talking about it dont you tell me thats stupid buddy not when i tried so long to have a kid of my own teasle looked at him oh youre like my own orval said like my own but i cant help wondering what sort of kid bea and i would have made if we had been able it hurt as if all these years he had been no more to orval than the once needy child of a dead best friend he could not accept that it was more selfdoubt from anna leaving and now that he was talking about her he had to get it in the open finished last christmas he said before we came to dinner at your place we went over to shingletons for a drink and watching his two kids the look on their faces with their presents i thought maybe it would be good to have one it certainly surprised me that at my age i wanted one and it sure as hell surprised her we talked about it and she kept saying no and after a while i suppose i made too big a thing of it what happened its like she weighed me against the trouble she thought a baby would be and left the crazy thing is as much as i cant sleep for wishing her to come back in a way im glad she went im on my own again no more arguments free to do what i want when i want come home late without calling to explain im sorry to miss dinner go out if i feel like it screw around sometimes i even think the worst part about her leaving is how much the divorce will cost me and at the same time i cant tell you how much i need her back with me his breath came out in frost the birds were gathered loudly he watched orval drag on the last of his cigarette close to his fingers their joints gnarled and yellow from nicotine and what about who were after orval said are you taking it all out on him no you sure you know i am i dont act tougher than i have to you know as well as i do that a town stays safe because of the little things kept in control you cant do anything to prevent something big like a holdup or a murder if somebody wants to do them bad enough he will but its the little things that make a town what it is that you can watch to make it safe if i had just grinned and took what the kid was handing me fairly soon i might have got used to the idea and let other kids hand it to me and in a little while i would have been letting other things go by its me i was concerned about as much as the kid i cant allow myself to loosen up i cant keep order one time and not another youre still awfully eager to chase after him even though your part of the job is ended this is state police business now but its my man he killed and its my responsibility to bring him in i want all my force to know ill stop at nothing to get at anybody who hurts them orval looked at the pinched butt of the cigarette he was holding and nodded flicking it into the fire the shadows were lifting trees and bushes distinct it was the false dawn and before long the light would appear to dim again and then the sun would show and everything would be clear they could have been up and starting now teasle thought where was shingleton with the men and supplies he should have been back a half hour ago maybe something had gone wrong in town maybe the state police were stopping him from coming in teasle churned a stick in the low fire raising flames where was he then he heard the first bark from the dog far off in the woods and it stirred the dogs that were leashed to the tree nearest orval there were five of them here and they had been awake stomachs flat out on the ground eyes intent on orval now they were up excited barking in answer shush orval said and they looked at him and went quiet their withers were trembling ward lester and the young deputy fidgeted in their sleep they were down close to the other side of the fire hugging their blankets uh ward said in a minute lester said asleep the dog barked far off again though sounding a little closer and the dogs by orval cocked their ears barking excitedly in return shush orval said stronger get down instead they jerked their heads toward another bark far off their nostrils quivering get down orval demanded and slowly one by one they obeyed ward squirmed on his side in the blanket knees up near his chest whats wrong whats happening just time to get up teasle said what lester said and squirmed god its cold time to get up in a minute thats about how long theyll take to get here people were crashing through the underbrush out there breaking closer teasle lit another cigarette his mouth and throat dry and felt the energy building in him it might be the state police he all of a sudden realized and stood hurriedly drawing on his cigarette straining to see into the forest in the direction of the cracking underbrush god its cold lester said i hope shingletons bringing hot food teasle hoped it was just shingleton and the deputies out there and not the state police abruptly five men were in sight rushing between the trees and through the bushes in the pale cold light but teasle could not make out what color their uniforms were they were talking to each other one man tripped and swore but teasle could not identify the voices if they were state police he was trying to figure some way of keeping in charge then they were close hurrying out of the trees up this brief rise and teasle saw shingleton stumbling after the dog that was straining on its leash and he saw it was his own men behind never so glad to see them before they were carrying bulgedout burlap sacks and rifles and rope and shingleton had a field radio slung over his shoulder the dog lurching him into camp hot food lester was up asking him did you bring hot food shingleton apparently did not hear he was out of breath handing the dog over to orval lester turned in a rush to the deputies did you bring hot food ham and egg sandwiches a deputy said chest heaving thermos of coffee lester reached for the sack the deputy carried not in there the deputy told him mitch behind me mitch was grinning opening his sack handing out waxpaperwrapped sandwiches and everybody grabbed eating you covered one hell of a distance last night in the dark shingleton told teasle catching his breath leaning against a tree i figured to find you in less than half an hour and here it took me twice that we couldnt move as fast as them last night remember mitch said we had more to carry they covered one hell of a distance just the same teasle could not decide whether shingleton was making excuses for being late or whether he was really admiring teasle bit into a sandwich greasy and barely warm but christ it was good he took a paper cup that mitch had poured full of steaming coffee he blew on it and sipped burning his upper lip and the roof of his mouth and his tongue feeling the cold mulch of the egg and ham hot in his mouth whats going on back there shingleton laughed the state police had a fit over what you pulled he stopped to chew into a sandwich like you said i waited in that field last night and they showed up ten minutes after you climbed into the woods they were sweet jesus mad over you taking advantage of the little daylight you had left so you could chase after the kid and stay in the game it surprised me they figured it out so fast what you were up to but whats happened back there shingleton grinned proudly and bit another mouthful off the sandwich i spent half the night at the station with them and finally they agreed to play along with you theyre going to block the roads down out of the hills and stay out of here it took some amount of convincing to get them not to come in ill tell you thanks he knew shingleton was waiting for that shingleton nodded chewing what finally clinched things was i said you knew the kid better than they did and youd know best what he might do any word from them who he is or what else he might be wanted for theyre working on it they said keep reporting on this radio the first sign of trouble they say theyre coming in with everything theyve got there wont be trouble somebody kick balford there awake he said pointing to the young deputy snuggled in his blanket by the fire that guy will sleep through anything orval patted the dog shingleton had given him he brought it over to lick balfords face and the young deputy whipped up angrily wiping saliva from his mouth what the hells going on the men laughed and in the middle stopped surprised there was the drone of a motor it was too far off for teasle to guess what kind it was but it was roaring more distinct all the time and then deep and thunderous the helicopter loomed into view over the treetops circling huge sunlight glinting what the lester started howd it know where we were the dogs got barking above the din of the motor the lades shrieked through the air something new the state police gave me shingleton aid bringing out what looked like a dull gray cigarette case it gives off a radio signal they said they want to know where you are at all times and made me carry it and gave the other half to the guy you asked to lend his helicopter teasle bolted down the last of his sandwich whos our deputy up there with him lang does your radio connect up there you bet it does the radio was where shingleton had set it in the low crook of a tree teasle flipped a switch on the control panel and peering up at where the helicopter circled close sunlight glinting off the shrieking blades he said loud into the microphone lang portis all set up there whenever you are chief the voice was flat and scratchy it sounded like it came from miles away teasle could barely hear it in the roar from the motor he glanced around at his men orval was hurriedly gathering the paper cups and wax paper from the sandwiches tossing them on the fire the others were strapping on equipment slinging on rifles the cups and paper in ashes orval was kicking dirt on the flames all right then teasle said lets move it he had trouble hooking the microphone back onto the radio he was so excited all the morning as he ran and walked and ran and walked he heard a motor droning miles off and occasional muffled gunshots and a deep male voice murmuring through a loudspeaker then the motor was a few peaks over and he recognized the sound of the helicopters in the war and he started moving faster he had been dressed now for almost twelve hours but after his climb naked into the hills in the cold night air he was still enjoying the warm rough feel of clothes he wore heavy old shoes that the son had brought around midnight to the hollow by the spring at first the shoes had been too large but he had stuffed leaves into the toes and that had made the shoes tight so his feet would not slide up and down inside and give him blisters even then the leather was sharp and stiff against his bare feet and he wished the son had remembered to bring socks maybe the son had forgotten them on purpose the pants though were too tight and guessing the son had brought them on purpose also he had to laugh shoes too large pants too tight it was a good joke on him these looked like they were onetime dress pants that had been ripped in the seat and patched and now were work pants lightcolored with dark oil and grease stains the shin was white cotton frayed at the cuffs and buttonholes and collar and to go over top and keep him warm in the nights the old man had even handed over his thick redsquared wool shirt that had surprised him the old man turning so friendly and generous toward the last maybe the whiskey had been what did it after he and the old man had eaten the carrots and cold fried chicken the son had brought they had heaved the jug of whiskey back and forth repeatedly the son included and finally the old man had gone as far as giving up his rifle plus a handkerchief tied full of cartridges had to hole up once in the hills a couple days myself the old man had said long time ago when i wasnt much older than my boy he had not said why and rambo had been careful not to ask wasnt even a chance to go home and grab my rifle sure couldve used it on them you get out of this you send me money for that rifle i want your word not that its the money i care about the stuff i make god knows i can afford another but you get through this id like to know how you made it and i figure on the rifle reminding you to let me know shes a good one and she was a lever action the power to whack a bullet through a man a halfmile away as if close through a block of cheese the old man had a thick pad of leather on the end of the stock to ease the recoil he had a speck of luminous paint on the sight at the tip of the barrel to help aiming at night then rambo had done what he promised backtracking down the stream away from where the old man might have his boiler and coils and jugs soon he had pushed west still planning eventually to turn south for mexico he did not fool himself that reaching there would be easy since he was not about to risk giving himself away by stealing a car he would have to travel for months on foot through the back country living off the land all the same he could not think of any place closer where he would be safe and far as the border was at least for the time being it gave him some direction when he had gone a few miles forced to move slow because of the dark he slept in a tree wakened with the sun and breakfasted on more carrots and chicken that he had saved from the old man to take with him now the sun high and glaring he was miles off rushing through trees up a long wide draw the shots were louder the voice from the loudspeaker more defined and he knew before long the helicopter would be checking this draw along with the rest he broke from the woods to run across an open reach of grass and fern and one quarter across he heard the flapping roar almost onto him and swung in panicked search of cover alone in the grass its trunk shattered by what must have been lightning the fallen pine tree was all there was no time to charge back to the woods he ran and dove beneath its thick smothering branches scraping his back as he sprawled under and then staring through the pine needles he saw the thing appear down the draw it grew magnified its landing props were close to skimming the topmost branches of the forest this is the police the mans voice boomed from the copters loudspeaker you dont have a chance give up anyone in these woods a dangerous fugitive may be near you show yourselves wave if youve seen one young man alone the voice stopped then started awkwardly as if the words were being read from a card this is the police you dont have a chance give up anyone in these woods a dangerous fugitive may be near you and on it went and then it stopped and started again and rambo lay beneath the branches perfectly still knowing the maze of needles hid him from the land not sure he was covered from the air watching the copter sweep over the trees toward the grass it was near enough for him to see up into the glassfronted cockpit there were two men staring out the open windows on each side a civilian pilot and a policeman his uniform the gray of teasles men and out his window he was aiming a highpowered rifle with a telescopic sight carack the shot echoed aimed at a tangle of rock and bush at the edge of the forest the copter had just flown over god teasle really wanted him bad telling his man to shoot at likely hiding places unafraid of hitting anyone innocent because most people would obey the announcement and come out to show themselves from teasles point of view why not as far as teasle was concerned he was a copkiller and could not be allowed to get away had to be made an example so nobody else would think to kill a cop even so teasle was too good a policeman to condone gunning him down without first giving him a chance to give up that was why the announcement and the idea of shooting at spots where he might hide was probably to scare him out more than to hit him but the odds were too great that he might be hit anyhow so it did not matter if the shots were to scare him or not carack at another clump of brush at the edge of the trees and now they were flying over the grass and they would be on top of him in seconds almost certain to fire he aimed his rifle through the branches centering on the gunmans face as he flew nearer ready to blast him to hell the instant he lowered his eyes to the gunsight he did not want to kill anymore but he had no alternative worse if he did shoot this man then the pilot would duck down to the floor of the copter out of his aim and fly away damn fast to radio for help and everybody would know where he was unless he stopped the pilot by exploding the helicopter gas tanks which he knew was foolish to think about for sure he could hit them but explode them it was only in dreams that a man without phosphorustipped ammunition ever managed that trick he lay rigid waiting his heartbeat sickening as the helicopter roared onto him immediately the gunman dipped his face to the telescope on his rifle and he himself was just squeezing on the trigger when he saw what the gunman was after and thanking christ he had seen in time eased off fifty yards to the left there was a wall of boulders and brush near a pool of water he had almost hidden there when he first heard the copter coming up the draw but it had been too far to reach now the copter was swooping toward it carack and he could not believe it he thought his eyes were playing on him the bushes were moving he blinked and the bushes heaved and then he knew it was not his eyes as the bushes burst wide apart and a great hugeantlered massiveshouldered deer stumbled up clambering over the boulders it fell it rose up leaping across the grassland toward the woods on the other side the helicopter after it there was a stream of deep rich blood glistening down the deers one hip but that did not seem to matter not the way it was charging in those magnificent long bounding strides toward the trees the helicopter after it his heart pounded wildly it would not stop pounding they would be back the deer was just a toy as soon as it leapt into the trees out of sight they would be back since there had been something hidden in those bushes by the pool then there might be something underneath this fallen tree he had to get out fast but he had to wait until the copters tail was pointed toward him the men watching straight ahead at the deer they were chasing he strained waiting and finally he could wait no more rolling out from under the branches racing where the grass was shortest and would not leave a trail he was nearing the bushes and rocks too soon the noise of the copter changed roaring higher the deer had made it to the woods the copter was circling back frantic he ran stooped toward the cover of the boulders tumbling under the bushes bracing himself to shoot if they had seen him make his run carack carack the first shot as the copter came upon the fallen pine tree the second as it hovered over lingering slowly pivoting to continue up the draw leaving him this is the police the voice was booming again you dont have a chance give up anyone in these woods a dangerous fugitive may be near you show yourselves wave if youve seen one young man alone a mouthful of undigested carrots and chicken bolted sourly up from his stomach and he spat it on the grass the bitterness soaking into his tongue this was the narrow end of the draw cliffs on both sides closed in farther up and weak from having vomited be watched through the bushes as the copter swept over the trees that way and then rose up skirted the top of a cliff and settled into the next draw its roar slowly dying away the voice from the loudspeaker going muffled he could not stand his legs were trembling too much because he was trembling he trembled even more the helicopter should not have frightened him so in the war he had been through action far worse than this and had come out of it badly shaken but never so extreme that he could not make his body work his skin was clammy and he needed to drink but the pool among the bushes was green and stagnant and it would make him sicker than he was youve been away from fighting too long thats all he told himself youre out of condition is all youll get used to it in a while sure he thought that has to be the answer gripping a boulder he forced himself to stand slowly and head above the bushes he turned to see if anyone was near satisfied he leaned against the boulder his legs yet unsteady and brushed pine needles from the firing mechanism of his rifle regardless of anything he had to keep his weapon in repair the smell of the kerosene he had doused on his clothes was gone in its place the faint acrid smell of turpentine that the pine tree had left on him it mixed with the bitterness in his mouth and he thought he might be sick again at first he was not sure he heard correctly a wind blew up and dispersed the sound then the air was still and he definitely heard them the first dim echoes of dogs barking behind him down at the wide end of the draw a new tremor swept through his legs he swung to his right where the grass sloped up to rocks and scattered trees and after that a cliff and bracing his leg muscles he ran the kid did not have much headstart teasle was figuring as he and his men pressed forward through the trees and underbrush after the dogs the kid had broken out of jail at sixthirty it had got dark at eightthirty and he could not have gone far in these hills at night an hour possibly two all told he would have started with the sun the same as themselves so that made him altogether just four hours ahead but other things considered he was probably only two and maybe even less he was naked and that would slow him down he didnt know this country so he would now and then head up steep gullies and into hollows that did not have an exit and that would lose him more time coming out to find another way plus he had no food and that would tire him slow him more narrow the distance less than two hours ahead of us for certain orval said running he cant be more than one look at these dogs his scent is so fresh they dont even have to nose the ground orval was in front of teasle and the others racing with the dogs his arm taut like an extension of their master leash he held and teasle was climbing scrambling through bushes trying to keep up with him in a way it was funny a seventytwoyearold man setting the pace running them all into the ground but then orval jogged five miles each morning smoked only four cigarettes a day and never drank while he himself smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes drank beer by the sixpack and had not exercised in years it was something just to be able to keep pace with orval as much as he was he was breathing so deeply and rapidly that his lungs were burning he had the stab of shinsplints in his legs but at least he was not running as awkwardly as at the start he had been a boxer in the marines and they had taught him how to run to train his body was long out of practice though and he was having to learn over again a smooth quick comfortable stride leaning a little forward letting the pull of his body force his legs to push him on so he would not fall gradually he was getting it running faster easier his pain diminishing a pleasure of exertion swelling up inside him he had last felt like this five years ago when he came back from louisville as madisons new police chief the town had not changed much yet it had all looked different the old brick house he had grown up in the tree in his backyard where his father had rigged a swing the gravestones of his parents in the years he had been away his memory of them had gone flat and colorless as in black and white photographs but now they had length and depth and they were green and brown and red and the tombstones purple marble he had not believed seeing the graves again would depress his return that greatly the baby girl a fetus really in a plastic bag by his mothers feet in her coffin both bodies long since corrupted into dust all because she was a catholic the fetus had been poisoning her the church had refused an abortion so of course she had obeyed and died and the baby with her that had been when he was ten and he had not understood why his father had stopped going to church after that his father trying to be a mother as well then showing him about guns and fish how to darn his own socks and cook for himself how to clean house and wash clothes making him independent almost as if the man had foreseen his gunshot death in the woods three years later then orval to raise him then korea and louisville and then at age thirtyfive he was home again except that it was no more home just the place where he had grown up and that first day back touring the once familiar places only made him realize that he had already lived close to half his life he was sorry he had come almost phoned louisville to see if he could return to work there finally just before it closed he went to a real estate office and that night he and an agent set out to look at places for sale or rent but all the houses and apartments he saw were still being lived in and he could not see himself alone in any of them the agent gave him a book of listings with photographs to study before he slept and flipping through it in his small hotel room he came upon the place he needed a summer camphouse in the hills near town with a stream in front a wooden bridge and a thick slope of trees in back the windows were smashed the roof sagged and the front porch was collapsed the paint was chipped and peeling the shutters were split and dangling the next morning it was his and in the days and nights and weeks to come he was never busier from eight to five he organized his force interviewing the men already on the job firing those who did not want to go nights to the shooting range or the state police night school hiring men who did not mind extra duty throwing out obsolete equipment and buying new streamlining the cluttered operation that his predecessor had left when he died on the front steps of a heart attack then from five until he dropped to sleep he worked on the house roofing it putting new glass in the windows and caulking them building a new porch painting it all rust color to blend with the green of the trees the bad wood that he stripped from the roof and the porch he used for a fire in the yard every night and he sat by it cooking eating chili con carne steak and baked potatoes or hamburgers food had never tasted better nor had he slept sounder or his body felt greater the calluses on his hands making him proud the stiffness in his legs and arms turning to strength and smoothmoving ease for three months he was like that and then the job on the house was done and for a time he found small things to fix but then there were nights with nothing to do and he went out for a beer or else he stayed longer at the shooting range or else he went home to watch television and drink beer then he got married and now that was ended and racing through the trees out into the grass breath rasping sweat stinging he felt so good that he wondered why he had ever stopped taking care of himself the dogs were yelping ahead and orvals long legs were stretching to stay with them the deputies were trying to keep up with teasle and he was straining to keep up with orval and there was a moment as he raced across the grass the sun bright and hot on him his arms and legs in swift steady rhythm when he felt he could go on forever abruptly orval surged farther ahead and teasle could not match his speed anymore his legs grew heavy the good feeling drained from him slow down orval but orval stayed right on going with the dogs when he reached the line of trees and rocks he had to slow placing his shoes carefully so he would not slip on the rocks and maybe break a leg at the base of the cliff he hurried along seeking an easy way to the top and found a crack in the cliff that went in three feet and rose straight to the top and climbed near the top the jutting stones that he used for handholds were wide apart and he had to claw and boost himself but then the climbing got better again until shortly he was out of the crack onto level stone the yapping from the dogs echoed loudly on top he crouched to see if the helicopter was nearby it was not he could not even hear it and there was no sign of anybody watching him from a neighboring height or from below he slipped into bushes and trees near the cliff edge and crept swiftly to his right toward an outcrop with a long view of the draw and there he lay watching the alternate strips of grass and woods a mile down the draw he saw that men were racing from trees across a wide clear space toward more trees in the distance the men were small and hard to distinguish he counted what he thought were ten he could not make out the dogs at all but they sounded like quite a lot it wasnt their number that bothered him though what did was that they had obviously found his scent and were tracking him fast fifteen minutes and they would be where he was now teasle should not have been able to catch up to him this fast teasle should have been hours behind there had to be somebody maybe teasle maybe one of his men who knew the country and knew from his general direction the shortcuts to head him off he ran back to the niche up through the cliff there was no way teasle was going to have the easy climb he himself had he set his rifle on a grassy mound where no dirt would get into it and began pushing at a boulder that was near the cliff the boulder was large and heavy but once he had it rolling somewhat the shift of its weight helped him to push soon he had it where he wanted completely blocking off the top of the crack one side extending over the cliff edge a man coming at the boulder from below would not be able to get around or over it he would have to shove it out of the way before he could get on top but braced from below he would not have the leverage to move it he would need several men helping him but the crack was too narrow for several men to fit at once teasle would be a while figuring out how to clear the boulder away and by then he himself would be long gone he hoped glancing down at the draw he was amazed that while he positioned the boulder the posse had been travelling so fast they were already at the pool and bushes where he had hidden the men in miniature down there stopped looking at the bushes to watch the dogs sniffing the ground barking in circles something must have confused the scent the wounded deer he realized when he had dove into the bushes some of the deers blood had smeared onto him and now the dogs were trying to decide which track to follow his or the deers they chose damn fast the second they sprang yelping on his path toward the cliff he turned and grabbed his rifle and ran through more bushes and trees inland where the undergrowth was very thick he swung and pushed through backward and then ran forward again until once more he had to push through backward his effort shoving the boulder over to the niche in the cliff had lathered his face and chest with sweat that stung and bit and now more sweat poured out as he struggled through a wall of nettles scraping his knuckles raw filming them with blood then in a second he was free he came breaking out of the dark wood into the bright sunlight on a slope of rock and shale and paused quickly to catch his breath and slid cautiously down to the edge there was a cliff and a wide forest at the bottom leaves red and orange and brown the cliff was too sheer for him to climb down so now there was a cliff before him and behind him which meant he could go only two other routes if he went to the east he would be moving back toward the wide end of the draw but teasle likely had groups searching the highlands on both sides of the draw in case he doubled back that gave him just one other course to the west in the direction the helicopter had taken and he ran that way until he came upon another drop and found that he had trapped himself christ the dogs were barking louder and he clenched his rifle cursing himself for having ignored one of the most basic rules he had ever learned always choose a route that wont trap you never run where you might cut yourself off christ had his mind gone soft along with his body from lying in all those hospital beds he should never have climbed up that cliff back there he deserved to be caught he deserved the shit that teasle would do to him if he let himself be caught the dogs were barking even closer sweat smarting his face he touched a hand to it and felt the sharp rough stubble of his beard and brought down the hand sticky with blood from where the bushes and nettles had slashed and ripped him the blood made him furious with himself he had thought that running away from teasle would be fairly simple and routine that after what he had been through in the war he could handle anything now he was telling himself to think again the way he had been shaking from the helicopter should have warned him he knew but still he had been so confident he could outrun teasle that he had gone and cornered himself and now he would be damn lucky to get out of this with just the blood that was already on him there was only one thing yet that he could do he rushed along the top of the new cliff staring down checking the height stopping where the cliff seemed lowest two hundred feet all right he told himself its your goddamn mistake you pay for it lets see just how tight your assend really is he slipped the rifle snugly between his belt and his pants shifting it around so it went straight down his side the butt near his armpit the barrel by his knee certain that it would not work loose and fall to smash on the rocks far below he lay flat on his stomach eased himself over the edge and hung by his hands his feet dangling toe holds he could not find any toe holds the dogs began yelping hysterically as if they had reached the blockedoff niche in the cliff to use its pulley and winch for clearing the boulder to check the bluff in case he was still up there for whatever reason teasle must have radioed for it almost immediately rambo was ten bodylengths down the cliff when he heard it again droning far off gathering volume he had taken what he judged was nearly a minute for every bodylength down this far each fissure and outcrop he grabbed onto hard to find each toe hold having to be tested settling down resting his weight on it little by little breathing with relief when it stayed firm often he had dangled as he had at the top shoes flailing against the rockface scrabbling for support his holds had been so far apart that climbing back up to avoid being seen by the helicopter would be as difficult as climbing down had been even then he would probably not get up before the helicopter passed over him so there was no point in trying he might just as well keep climbing down hoping the copter would not spot him the rocks below distorted huge attracting him as though he were leaning closer and closer into their image in a magnifying glass and he tried to pretend this was merely like an exercise at jump school it was not though merely like an exercise at jump school it was not though and as he listened to the dogs the helicopter droning near he quickened his descent hanging to the limit of his reach taking less care to test his foot holds sweat dribbling itchy down his cheeks accumulating tremulously on his lips and chin before when he had heard the copter as he ran across the field of grass toward the cover of the fallen pine tree the sound of its approach had been like a solid force that was pushing him but here now restricted slow in spite of his haste he felt its growing roar as a slippery thing that was inching up from the small of his back heavier the higher it came when the thing leeched up to the base of his skull he glanced over toward the sky behind him and clung motionless to the wall the helicopter enlarging rapidly over the trees bearing toward this cliff his outside wool shirt was red against the gray of stone he prayed the gunman would somehow fail to see it but he knew that the gunman would have to see it his fingers were dug bleeding into a slit in the cliff the toes of his shoes were pressed hard onto an inchwide ledge his throat shuddered involuntarily as one shoe slipped off the ledge the close whack of the bullet into the cliff by his right shoulder dazed him and so startled that he almost lost his grip shaking his head to clear it he began groping frantically down he managed only three more toe holds and then there were no more carang the second bullet ricocheted off the rock striking higher nearer to his head startling him as much as the first one and he knew he was as good as dead the jiggle of the copter was all that had saved him from being hit so far it was throwing off the gunmans aim and the pilot was bringing on the copter fast which made the jiggle worse but it would not be long before the pilot understood and held the copter steady his arms and legs trembling from the strain he grasped down for a handhold and then another and then let down his feet taking a chance dangling again scraping the cliff with his shoes for something anything to step onto but there wasnt anything he hung by his bleeding fingers and the helicopter swooped toward him like some grotesque dragonfly and sweet jesus keep that damn thing moving dont let it hang still so he can get a decent shot carang chips of stone and molten bullet ripped burning into the side of his face he peered at the rocks a hundred feet below sweat stinging his eyes he barely made out a lush fir tree that rose up toward him its top branches maybe ten feet under him or fifteen or twenty he had no chance to figure the helicopter looming huge wind from the rotors rushing over him he aimed his body at the top of the tree and let loose his pulpy fingers and dropped his stomach gushed up his throat expanded in the sudden emptiness and it was so long so endless before he slammed past the first branches plummeted through the clutching boughs cracked to a stop against a stout limb absolutely numb he could not breathe he gasped and pain flooded his body his chest throbbed sharply and his back and he was certain he had been shot but he hadnt and the din of the copter above the tree and the slash of a bullet through the branches got him moving he was high in the tree his rifle was still between his belt and his pants but the impact when he hit had rammed it violently against his side halfparalyzing him in agony forcing his arm to bend he clutched the gun and tugged but it would not come above the helicopter was circling returning for another shot and he was tugging at the gun wrenching it free the release so strong that the branch he was on started swaying he slipped off balance scraping his thigh along sharp bark desperately hooking his arm around the branch above him it made a crack he quit breathing if it broke it would send him falling outward past the ends of the boughs down onto the rocks deep below the branch made one more crack before it held firm and he breathed again but the sound from the copter was different now constant steady the pilot was getting the idea keeping it still rambo didnt know if they could see him in the tree or not but that didnt matter much the area at the top of the tree was so small that if the gunman sprayed it with bullets he was sure to be hit he didnt have time to switch to a stronger branch the next bullet might finish him hurried desperate he pushed away needles and light boughs and sought where the helicopter hung there whipping in the air across from him a house distance high and craning his head out the open cockpit window was the gunman rambo saw his round bignosed face quite clearly as the man prepared to fire once more a glance was all rambo needed in one smooth instinctive motion he raised his gun barrel to the branch above him steadied it there and aimed out along it at the center of the round face at the tip of the big nose a gentle squeeze on the trigger bullseye inside the cockpit the gunman clutched his sunken face he was dead before he had a chance to open his mouth and scream there was a moment when the pilot went on holding the helicopter steady like nothing had happened and then at once rambo saw through the glass front of the cockpit how it registered on the man that there were bits of bone and hair and brain everywhere that the top of his partners head was gone rambo saw him gape down in horror at the blood that was spattered across his shirt and pants the mans eyes went wide his mouth convulsed the next thing he was fumbling with his seat belt clutching his throttle stick crazily as he dove to the cockpit floor rambo was trying to get a shot at him from the tree he could not see the pilot but he had a fair idea where the man would be huddled on the floor and he was just aiming at that part of the floor when the helicopter veered sharply up the cliff its top section cleared the ridge nicely but the angle of the copter was so steep that the rear section caught on the edge of the cliff in the roar of the motor he thought he heard a metallic crack when the rear section struck he could not be certain the copter seemed interminably suspended there and then with an abrupt flip over backward it plunged down directly against the cliff wall screeching cracking blades bending and breaking as the explosion came a deafening ball of fire and zing of metal that flashed up past the tree and died the outer branches of the tree burst into flame a stench rose up of gasoline and burning flesh straightoff rambo was on the move scrambling down the tree the branches were too thick he had to circle the trunk to find where he could squeeze down the dogs were barking louder fiercer now as if they were past the barricade up onto the ridge that boulder should have taken longer to clear away he couldnt understand how teasle and the posse had climbed up so fast he held tightly to his rifle scraping down past the branches through the pointed needles pricking at his hands and face his chest was throbbing from his drop into the tree it hurt like some ribs were cracked or broken but he couldnt let that bother him the dogs were yelping closer he had to climb down faster twisting sliding his outside wool shirt caught on a branch and he ripped it loose faster those sonofabitch dogs he had to go faster near the bottom he reached thick black smoke that choked his lungs and saw indistinctly through it the twisted wreck of the helicopter burning and crackling twenty feet from the bottom he could not climb down any farther there were no more branches he couldnt spread his arms around the trunk and shinny down it was too wide jump no other way the dogs yelping up on top he checked the rocks and boulders underneath him and chose a spot where dirt and silt and dry brown needles were gathered in a pocket between the rocks and without realizing smiled this sort of thing was what he had been trained to do the weeks of leaping from towers at parachute school holding his rifle he grabbed the last bough with his free hand and eased down hanging and dropped and struck the ground perfectly his knees buckled just right and he slumped and rolled just right and came to his feet as properly as he had done a thousand times before it wasnt until he left the choking smoke around the shelter of the tree and scurried over the rocks that the pain in his chest got worse much worse and the smile disappeared christ im going to lose he charged over the rocks down a slope toward the forest legs pounding chest heaving painfully there was grass ahead and then he was out of the rocks and into the grass racing toward the trees and then he heard the dogs insanely loud on top behind him they had to be where he tried climbing down the cliff the posse would be shooting at him anytime now out in the open like this he didnt have a chance he needed to get to the trees dodging ducking his head using every trick he knew to make himself an awkward target tensing himself to take the first bullet that would blow his back and chest apart as he burst through the bushes and scrub into the woods pushing farther on stumbling over vines and roots until he tripped and fell and stayed flat gasping on the damp sweetsmelling forest floor they hadnt shot he couldnt understand it he lay there gasping filling his lungs to capacity and exhaling and breathing deeply again ignoring the pain in his chest each time he swelled it why hadnt they shot and then he knew because they had never been on top of the cliff in the first place they were still getting there they had only sounded like they were on top his stomach retched but this time nothing came up and he flopped onto his back staring past the autumncolored leaves toward the deep sky what was the matter with him he had never misjudged like that before mexico the image of a warm wavelapped beach flashed inside his mind get moving have to start moving he struggled to his feet and was just trudging farther into the forest when he heard men shouting behind him dogs barking and the posse was undoubtedly on top of the cliff now he stopped and listened and still gasping for breath he turned back the way he had come not the exact same path the grass into the forest had been long and he knew he had left a track through it that would be quite plain from on top of the cliff the posse would be studying that part of the forest where he had entered and as he came back he might make some sign that would show them where he was so he headed to the left approaching a part of the forests edge where they would have no reason to expect him when the trees began to thin out he sank low and crawled to the edge and crouching behind some brush he saw something beautiful a hundred yards off clear as could be on top of the cliff were the men and the dogs they were all running toward where he had climbed down the dogs barking one man behind the dogs hanging onto a master leash the rest of the men rushing up behind all stopping now and staring down at the smoke and fire of the helicopter they were the closest rambo had seen them since the hunt began the sun stark on them making them seem very close strangely magnified six dogs he counted and ten men nine in the gray police uniform of teasles men and one in a green jacket and pants that one holding the dogs master leash the dogs were sniffing at where he had climbed over the edge circling to check if the scent went anywhere else returning to the edge and barking in frustration the man in green was older than the rest and taller he was soothing the dogs patting them talking to them gently in words that came across to him muffled some of the policemen were sitting others standing to look down at the blazing helicopter or else point toward the forest where he had entered but he wasnt interested in those only in the one pacing back and forth slapping his hand against his thigh teasle there was no missing that short chunk of a body that puffedout chest that low head that darted side to side like a fighting rooster sure like a cock thats what you are teasle a cock the joke made him smile it was shadowed where he lay under the bush and resting was luxurious he lined up teasle in his rifle sights just as teasle spoke to the man in green wouldnt teasle be surprised to find that in the middle of a word a bullet had gone in and out of his throat what a joke that would be he became so fascinated he almost pulled the trigger it would have been a mistake he wanted to kill him all right after his scare being caught between the helicopter and the posse he didnt care what he had to do to get away and now that he thought about the two men he had killed in the helicopter he realized he wasnt bothered as he had been after he had killed galt he was getting used to death again but there was a question of priorities the cliff wouldnt stop teasle it would just put him behind an hour or so and killing teasle wouldnt necessarily stop the posse they would still have the hounds to keep them tracking fast the hounds they werent vicious like the german shepherds he had seen in the war but just the same they were natural hunters and if they ever caught him they might even attack instead of merely cornering him as hounds were schooled to do so he had to shoot them first after that he would shoot teasle or the man in green if he showed before teasle the way the man handled the dogs rambo was sure he knew a lot about tracking and with both him and teasle dead the others likely wouldnt know what to do theyd have to drift back home for sure they didnt seem to know much about this kind of fighting they were standing or sitting in plain view up there and he sniffed in disgust evidently they had not even considered that he might still be around the man in green was having trouble getting the dogs quiet they were bunched together tangled in each others way the man separated the master leash and handed over three dogs to a deputy rambo lay beneath the cool underbrush and aimed at the three that the man in green had kept and shot two of them just like that he would have hit the third dog with his next shot if the man in green had not yanked it back from the edge the policemen were shouting jumping low out of sight the other set of dogs was acting wild howling straining to get away from the deputy who held them rambo quickly shot one another shied and slipped off the cliff and the deputy holding the leash tried to pull it back instead of letting go lost his balance and dragging the last of his dogs with him he went over the side too he wailed once just before he thumped on the rocks far below there was an instant when they lay flat paralyzed the sun glaring on them no wind nothing the instant stretched on and on then in a scramble shingleton aimed down at the forest shooting along its edge he had four shots off when another man joined him and then another and then except for teasle and orval everyone was laying down a heavy line of fire the gun reports rattling off together as if a bandoleer of ammunition had been thrown into a furnace and the heated cartridges were exploding in a steady roll thats enough teasle ordered but nobody obeyed they were spread flat along the ridge behind rocks and mounds of earth shooting as fast as their rifles would allow crack crack crack their trigger hands in constant motion ejecting old shells chambering fresh ones not really aiming as they yanked off their bullets the recoils jolting them crack crack crack and teasle was sprawled in a furrow of rock shouting thats enough i told you stop i said but they kept right on strafing the line of trees and scrub homing in where anothers bullet had churned the leaves and made it seem that someone was there moving a few were reloading and starting again most had already done so rifles of different make winchester springfield remington martin savage different calibers bolts and levers and differentsized magazines holding six rounds or seven or nine empty cartridges strewn around and more coming all the time orval was holding steady his one last dog shouting stop it and teasle was rising from the furrow crouching as if to pounce the veins in his neck bulging as he yelled dammit stop i said the next man pulls a trigger loses two days pay that struck them some had not yet reloaded the second time the rest somehow checked themselves tense rifles at their shoulders fingers poised over triggers eager to resume then a cloud shut out the sun and they were all right they sucked in air and swallowed and lowered their rifles sluggishly a breeze came up gently brushing the dry leaves in the forest up behind them christ shingleton said his cheeks were pale and taut like the skin on a drum ward relaxed off his elbows onto his stomach and licked at the corners of his mouth christ is right he said never so scared somebody was mumbling over and over teasle looked and it was the young deputy whats that smell lester said never so scared him its coming from him my pants i leave him alone teasle said the cloud that had shut out the sun passed smoothly on and the bright glare retouched him and glancing over at where the sun was low in the valley teasle watched another cloud approaching a bigger one and behind it not far off the sky was rumpled with them black and puffy he unstuck his sweaty shirt from his chest and then leaving it alone because it stuck right back to his skin he hoped it might rain at least that would cool things off next to him he heard lester talking about the young deputy i know he cant help it but christ what a smell never so scared leave him alone teasle said looking at the clouds any bets we hit that kid just now mitch said anybody hurt everybody o k ward said yeah sure lester said everybodys fine teasle looked sharply at him guess again theres only nine of us jeremy went over the side and three of my dogs went over with him and two others are shot orval said his voice was all in one tone like from a machine and the strangeness of it made everybody turn to him five five of them gone his face was the gray of powdered cement orval im sorry teasle said you damn well should be this was your damn foolish idea in the first place you just couldnt wait and let the state police take over the last dog was trembling on its haunches whining there now there now orval told it gently stroking its back as he squinted through his glasses at the two dead dogs along the edge of the cliff well get even dont you worry if hes still alive down there well get even he shifted his squint toward teasle and his voice went louder you just couldnt wait for the goddamn state police to take over could you the men looked at teasle for an answer he moved his mouth but no words came out whats that orval said jesus if youve got something to say then say it clear like a man i said nobody forced you to come youve had a hell of a good time showing us what a tough old shit you are running ahead of everybody quick climbing up that break in the cliff to move the boulder and prove how smart you are its your own fault the dogs were hit you know so much you should have kept them back from the edge orval shook with anger and teasle wished he had not said that he stared down at the ground it was not right of him to mock orvals need to outdo everyone he had been grateful enough when orval realized how to free the boulder climbing up to tie one end of a rope around it telling the others to haul on the other end of the rope while he used a thick bough to lever at the boulder it had come hurtling over the top in a rumble and crash and splintering of rock that they had all just managed to stumble back from all right listen orval he said calm now im sorry they were fine dogs believe me im sorry there was a sudden movement next to him shingleton was sighting his rifle firing down at a clump of brush shingleton i told you to stop i saw something move two days pay that cost you shingleton your wifes going to be mad like hell but i saw something move i tell you dont tell me what you think you saw youre shooting excited like you wanted to back at the station when the kid broke out just listen that goes for all of you listen you hit nowhere close to that kid the time you took returning his fire he could have crapped and buried it and still got away come on will two days pay shingleton said you cant mean that im not finished all of you look at all the shells you wasted half your ammunitions gone they scanned the empty cartridges lying all around them in the dirt looking surprised at how many there were whatll you do when you run into him again use up the rest of your shells and then throw rocks at him the state police can fly us more lester said and wont you feel great when they come in here laughing at how you wasted all your shells he pointed once more at the empty cartridges and for the first time he noticed that one group of shells was very different from the rest the men had to lower their eyes in embarrassment as he scooped up the shells these arent even fired one of you dummies pumped out all his bullets without even pulling the trigger it was obvious to him what had happened buck fever the first day of hunting season a man could get so excited when he saw his target that he stupidly pumped out all his shells without first pulling the trigger completely mystified why he wasnt hitting what he was aiming at teasle couldnt let it pass he had to make an issue of it come on who did it whos the baby give me your gun ill give you one that shoots caps the number on the cartridges was he was about to check whose rifle was that caliber when he saw orval point toward the edge of the cliff and then he heard the whimper not all the dogs the kid had shot were dead one had been shocked unconscious by the force of the bullet was now coming to kicking whimpering gutshot orval said disgustedly he spat and stroked the dog he had been holding and gave its leash to lester next to him hang on tight he said you see how shes quivering she smells that other dogs blood and shes liable to go crazy he spat again and stood dust and sweat mixed on the green of his clothes wait now lester said you mean this one might get vicious maybe i doubt it most likely shell try to break free and run off just hold tight i dont like this one bit nobody asked you to like it he left lester holding the leash and walked over to the wounded dog it was on its side kicking its legs trying to roll over and stand always sinking back on its side whining miserably sure orval said gut shot that bastard gutshot her he wiped his sleeve across his mouth and squinted over at the dog that was untouched it was tugging on its leash to get away from lester mind you hang on tight to that one orval told him i have something to do thatll make her jump he bent down to inspect the wound in the dogs stomach came up shaking his head disgustedly at the glistening rolls of intestine and without a pause he shot the dog behind the ear a god damn terrible shame he muttered watching the body contort spastically and then settle his face had changed from gray to red wrinkled worse than ever so whats to wait for he said quietly to teasle lets go butcher that kid he took one step away from the dog and staggered violently off balance dropping his rifle clutching queerly at his spine the report from the gun in the woods below echoing as he whipped forward and hit the ground hard with his face and chest the shock of landing split his glasses apart on his nose and this time nobody returned fire down teasle was shouting everybody down they dove flat on the ground the last dog broke free from lester and bounded over to where orval lay and it flipped around shot too and pressed low in the furrow fists clenched teasle was vowing to track the kid forever grab him mutilate him he would never let up no more because of galt because he could not let somebody who had killed one of his men get away personal now for himself father foster father both shot the insane anger of when his real father had been killed wanting to strangle the kid until his throat was crushed his eyes popping you bastard you fucking sonofabitch it was only as he went through in his mind how to climb off this cliff and get his hands on the kid that he suddenly understood how big a mistake he had made he had not been chasing the kid it was the other way around he had been letting the kid lead them into an ambush and jesus what an ambush with the nearest town thirty miles over hard country with the helicopter crashed and the dogs dead the kid could pick everybody off whenever he felt like it because the land didnt go straight back behind them because eight feet back from the edge of the cliff the land sloped up to pull back they would have to run uphill in open sight while the kid blasted away at them from the woods below and where in hell did he get his rifle and how in hell did he know enough to work an ambush like this that moment where the clouds were looming black in the sky it thundered loud orval teasle couldnt stop looking at him the old man was spread out quietly on his face by the edge of the cliff and teasle could hardly breathe because of me just this once in his life he got careless and i didnt warn him to stay down he began crawling toward him to cradle him the kidll swing around lester said hoarsely too hoarsely teasle thought reluctant he turned worried about his men they were only seven now tightfaced fingering their rifles looking next to useless all except shingleton im telling you the kid will swing around lester said the knee was ripped out of his pants hell swing up there behind us the men jerked to stare up the rise behind them as if they expected the kid to be there already hes going to come all right the young deputy said there was a brown liquid stain seeping through the seat of his gray pants and the men had shifted away from him dear god i want out of here get me out of here go on then teasle said run up the slope see how far you get before he shoots you the deputy swallowed what are you waiting for teasle said go on run up the slope no the deputy said i wont then stop it but we have to get up there lester said before he beats us to it if we wait too long hell make it up there and well never get off this ledge the dark clouds hulking closer lit up with lightning it thundered again long and loud whats that i heard something lester said his knee was scraped red where it showed through the rip in his pants the thunder shingleton said its playing tricks no i heard it too mitch said listen the kid it was like weak vomiting like a man choking orval he was starting to move hunched up knees and head keeping his stomach off the ground while he clutched his chest holding himself together he looked like a caterpillar raising its back for traction to inch forward but he wasnt going anywhere back arched high he stiffened and collapsed there was blood dripping from his arms and he was drooling coughing blood teasle was stopped in disbelief he had been sure orval was dead orval he said and then he was hurrying before he knew it stay down he had to remind himself pressing low to the rocks trying not to make himself the target orval had but orval was too close to the edge teasle was sure he would be seen from the woods below he took hold of orvals shoulder and struggled to drag him back to the furrow but orval was too heavy it was taking too long any second the kid might shoot he tugged at orval and pulled and dragged and slowly orval moved but not quick enough the stones were too jagged orvals clothes were catching on the sharp rocks near the edge of the cliff help me teasle shouted to the men behind him orval coughed more blood somebody help me give me a hand and then in a rush somebody was beside him helping him both dragging orval back from the edge and all at once they were safe teasle let out his breath in a gasp he wiped sweat from his eyes and didnt need to look to see whod helped him shingleton and shingleton was grinning laughing not loud not hilarious but laughing just the same it was mostly all inside him his chest was heaving and he was laughing we made it he didnt shoot we made it and sure it was funny and teasle started laughing too then orval coughed more blood and teasle saw the pain on orvals face and nothing seemed funny after that he reached to unbutton orvals bloody shirt take it easy orval well have a look and fix you up he tried to open the shirt gently but the blood had stuck the cloth to the flesh and finally he had to tug at the shirt to free it and orval groaned the wound was not something teasle wanted to look at very long there was a rank gas coming out the open chest how bad orval said wincing dont you worry about it teasle said well fix you up he was unbuttoning his own shirt as he spoke slipping it off his shoulders i asked you how bad each word was a distinct pained whisper youve seen enough things wounded orval you know how bad it is as much as i do he was rolling his sweaty shirt into a ball setting it on the hole in orvals chest immediately the shirt was soaking blood i want to hear you tell me i asked you all right orval save your strength dont talk his hands were sticky with blood as he buttoned orvals shirt over the bundle he had put on the wound i wont lie to you and i know you dont want me to lie theres a lot of blood and hard to see for sure but its my guess he hit a lung oh my jesus now i want you to stop talking and save your strength please you cant leave me dont leave me thats the last thing you have to worry about were taking you back and were going to do everything we can for you but you have to do something for me too you hear you have to concentrate on holding your chest i have my shirt inside yours and i want you to hold it close to where youre hit we have to stop the bleeding can you hear me do you understand orval licked his lips and nodded weakly and teasles mouth tasted full of dry dust there wasnt a hope that a rolledup shirt would stop the bleeding from a wound that size his mouth stayed dusty and he felt streaks of sweat trickle down his bare back the sun was long gone behind the clouds but the heat was continuing to press on him and he thought of water realizing how thirsty orval must be he knew he shouldnt give him any he knew that from korea a man shot in the chest or stomach would vomit water he drank and the wound would rip larger and the pain would get worse but orval was licking at his lips licking at his lips and teasle couldnt bear to watch his pain ill give him a little a little wont hurt there was a canteen snapped to orvals belt he worked it loose the canvas cover rough and unscrewed the cap pouring a little into orvals mouth orval coughed and the water bubbled out mixed with blood dear god teasle said for a moment his mind was blank he didnt know what to do next then he thought of the radio and swung over to it teasle calling state police state police emergency he raised his voice emergency the radio crackled with static from the clouds teasle calling state police emergency he had been determined not to radio for help no matter what happened even when he saw the crashed and burning helicopter he had not called but orval orval was going to die state police come in the radio shrieked with lightning and in the ebb a voice came through indistinct and raspy state here ble teasle couldnt waste time asking him to say it again i cant hear you he said hurriedly our helicopter has crashed i have a wounded man here i need another helicopter for him done i cant hear you i need another helicopter impossible an electric storm moving in every grounded but dammit hes going to die the voice answered something but teasle couldnt make it out and then the voice dissolved in static and when it came back it was in the middle of a sentence i cant hear you teasle shouted sure picked guy to try and hunt green beret medal of honor what say that again green beret lester said the voice was starting to repeat broke up never came back again it started to rain light drops speckling the dust and dirt spotting teasles pants and soaking in pelting cool on his bare back the black clouds shadowed over lightning crackled and lit up the cliff like a spotlight and as fast as the spotlight came on it went off and the shadows returned bringing with them shockwaves of exploding thunder medal of honor lester said to teasle is that what you brought us after a war hero a fucking green beret he didnt shoot mitch said teasle looked sharply at him afraid he was out of control but mitch wasnt he was excited trying to tell them something and teasle knew what it was he had already thought of it and decided it was no good when you dragged orval back mitch was saying he didnt shoot he isnt down there anymore hes swinging around behind us and nows our chance to move no teasle told him rain pelting his face but weve got a chance to no he might be swinging around but what if he isnt what if he doesnt want just one target and hes waiting down there for the whole lot of us to get careless and show ourselves their faces went ashen the clouds unloaded and the rain came down for real it came and it came lashing at them solidly teasle had never been in anything like it the wind was whipping the rain at his eyes driving it into his mouth storm my ass its a goddamn cloudburst he was lying in the water he didnt think it could get worse and then the rain increased and he was almost buried in the water lightning cracked bright like the sun darkness instantly was everywhere darkness that got blacker and blacker until it was like night only the time was late afternoon and rain lashing blind at his eyes teasle couldnt even see to the edge of the cliff thunder shook him what is this he shielded his eyes orval was lying face up mouth open in the rain hell drown teasle thought his mouthll fill up with water and hell breathe it in and drown he squinted at his men stretched out in the water on the ledge and realized that orval wasnt the only one who might drown where they all lay was now the bed of a raging stream there was swift water rushing down the rise behind them surging over them sweeping toward the edge of the cliff and though he couldnt see the ledge he knew what it looked like it was the top of a waterfall if the storm got any worse theyd all be washed over the side and orval would be the first to go he grabbed orvals legs shingleton help me he called rain driving into his mouth through his words it thundered loud grab his arms shingleton were clearing out the temperature had gone down rapidly the rain was now shocking cold on his bare back as he remembered stories about men caught in flash floods in the mountains about men washed down draws and thrown over cliffs and crushed and broken on the rocks below we have to clear out but the kid somebody yelled he cant see us now he cant see anything but the kid might be waiting for us up there we dont have time to worry about him we have to get off this ledge before the storm gets worse itll sweep us over lightning flashed brilliantly he shook his head at what he saw the men their faces in the lightning and rain their faces changed to white skulls as suddenly as they came the skulls were gone and he was blinking in darkness and the thunder hit him like a string of mortar explosions im here shingleton yelled grabbing orvals arms ive got him lets go they heaved him out of the water bearing toward the rise the rain doubled heavier faster it was streaking at them almost sideways drenching them pouring off them in a constant rush teasle slipped he fell hard on his shoulder and dropped orval into the swirling current he struggled splashing to grab orval to keep orvals head above water then slipped again so his own head went under water and he breathed he breathed the water he sucked up his nose choked his nasal passages and spewed out the two small holes at the back of the roof of his mouth wrenching them wide he was wild frantic coughing now up out of the water somebody had him shingleton was pulling him no orval grab orval they couldnt find him hell go over the side here somebody yelled teasle blinked rain out of his eyes trying to see who it was yelling orval ive got him the water rose to teasles knees he waded legs churning to where the man held orvals head out of the water the current had him the man said it was ward and he was tugging at orval working to drag him toward the rise he was drifting toward the cliff he bumped me going past then shingleton was there and they all lifted orval from the water and staggered with him toward the slope when they reached it teasle understood why the water was rising so fast there was a trough in the hillside and the streams on top were draining into it flooding down upon them we have to move farther along teasle said we have to find an easier way up the wind shifted and the rain lanced at their faces from the left as one they stumbled toward the right the wind helping them along but where were the rest of the men teasle wanted to know were they already climbing the slope were they still on the ledge why in hell werent they pitching in to move orval the water rose above his knees he hoisted orval higher and they staggered on and then the wind shifted again it was no longer pushing them the way they wanted to go it was shoving them back the way they had come and they were straining into the full force of the wind and the rain shingleton had his arms around orvals shoulders teasle had the legs ward was cradling the back and they slipped and stumbled through the rain until they came at last to where the rise seemed easiest there was a flood gushing down this part of the slope too but not as strong as back at the trough and there were big rocks jutting up for handholds if only he could see to the top teasle thought if only he could be sure the rocks were like that right up to the top they started climbing shingleton was first he went up backward stooping to hold orval up by the shoulders he wedged a foot behind a rock and backed up onto it and then squinted to see another rock behind him and wedged a foot behind that one and backed up onto it as well teasle and ward followed bent over taking most of orvals weight letting shingleton worry about where to put his feet so he could back up higher the stream rushed harder down the slope swashing against their legs but where were the others teasle wanted to know why in christ werent they helping the rain was biting cold on his back he was lifting orval blindly and he felt shingleton ahead backing up the slope pulling orval with him and teasles arms were aching in their sockets muscles twisting with orvals weight it was taking too long they wouldnt be able to keep carrying him much longer he knew they had to get to the top and then ward slipped and fell and teasle almost lost his grip on orval they tumbled flat on the slope and slid down a few feet sucked by the current as they all scrambled to hang on to orval they had him they started working farther up the slope and that was as far as they got with him shingleton all at once yelled and came falling past orval slamming into teasles chest they reeled backward falling and teasle lost hold of orval and the next thing he knew he was flat on his back at the bottom of the slope water swelling over him rocks tumbling painfully against him i couldnt help it shingleton cried the rock slipped out from under me orval the currents got him teasle splashed toward the cliff edge he wiped his arm across his eyes blinking to see in the rain he couldnt let himself go too near the edge the current was too strong there but god he had to stop orval he slowed groping closer wiping his eyes lightning flashed and there distinct bright was orvals body flipping over the side then it was black again and teasles stomach heaved hot tears mixed with the cold rain on his face and he screamed until his throat seized shut god damn those bastards ill kill them for not helping shingleton loomed beside him orval can you see him teasle shouldered past he made it to the rise ill kill them he grabbed for a rock and drew himself up and thrust a foot against a rock and shoved himself up and clawed and dug for handholds through the water sucking past him all at once he reached the top bolting into the forest the din up there was deafening wind was bending trees and rain was shrieking through branches and closeby lightning cracked bright through a trunk with the sharp sound of an ax splitting a solid piece of timber the tree crashed down in front of him he vaulted over it chief somebody called over here chief he couldnt see the face he only saw the body huddled by a tree over here chief the man was waving his arm in wide gestures teasle charged over to him grabbing his shirt front it was mitch what are you doing mitch said whats the matter with you he went over the side teasle said drawing back his fist he punched mitch hard in the teeth jolting him against a tree and into the mud christ mitch said he shook his head shook it again he moaned and held his bloody mouth christ whats the matter with you he was crying lester and the others ran i stayed behind to stick with you teasle must have made it into the forest by now rambo was certain of it the storm had been going on too long and heavy teasle and his men could not have held out on that open ledge with the rain giving them cover so he could not see to shoot they must have taken their chance to get up that slope and into the trees that was all right they would not be far he had done a lot of this kind of work in the rain and he knew exactly how to hunt men down in it he came out of the bushes and trees bearing through the rain toward the base of the cliff in the confusion of the storm he knew he could escape the other way deep into the forest if he wanted judging from the wide dense cloud cover he could be hours and miles away before the storm cleared enough for teasle to track him so far away that teasle would never be able to catch up to him again it was possible that after the ambush and the rain teasle might not even have the heart to chase after him but that did not matter for the moment he was determined not to run anymore whether he was being chased or not he had been lying sheltered under the bushes watching the top of the cliff for another target thinking about how teasle had made him into a killer once more and had got him wanted for murder growing angrier as he thought about all the months two months at least that he would have to run and hide run and hide before he reached mexico and for now by god he was going to turn the game and make teasle run from him show him what the hell it felt like that bastard was going to pay for this but you asked for some of it yourself it wasnt only teasle you could have backed off for the sixteenth time for crissake no way even if it was for the hundredth time so what backing off would have been better than this leave it alone end it get away and let him do this to somebody else screw he has to be stopped what thats not why youre doing this admit you wanted all this to happen you asked for it so you could show him what you knew surprise him when he found you were the wrong guy to try and handle you like this i didnt ask for anything but damn right i like it that bastard is going to pay the land was dark his clothes clung icy to his skin ahead long slick grass was bent over in the driving rain and he waded through the grass slippery on his smooth wet pants he came to the stones and rocks that led up toward the base of the cliff and he stepped cautiously onto them there were streams of water swirling between them and over them and in the wind it would be easy to slip and fall and hurt his ribs some more they were throbbing from when he had leapt off the cliff and crashed against the tree limb and each time he breathed he felt something pressing sharply inside his right chest it was like a big fishhook in there or a jagged chunk of broken bottle he would have to fix it soon very soon there was a roar he had heard it back in the trees and had guessed it was from the sound of the wind and rain but now it was getting louder as he climbed up over the rocks toward the cliff and he knew it wasnt the rain the cliff came into gray view and he saw a cataract the cliff had become a waterfall and a flood was cascading down roaring onto the rocks spraying mist high up into the rain it wasnt safe to go any closer he began working to the right about a hundred yards along he knew would be the tree he had leapt into and very near would be the body of the policeman who had fallen off the cliff with his dogs he didnt find the body anywhere around the tree he was about to look in the wreckage of the helicopter when he realized that the waterfall would have swept the body down over the rocks to the long grass he went down and the guy was right at the border face down in the water the top of his head was struck flat and his arms and legs were sticking off at queer angles rambo wondered about the dogs but he couldnt find them the carcasses must have been washed farther into the long grass he knelt quickly to search the body the guys equipment belt he needed it he held his rifle so it wouldnt drop in the water and with one hand he pulled the body over the face wasnt too bad he had seen worse in the war he stopped looking at it and concentrated on unbuckling the belt and yanking it free the effort set him wincing his ribs cut inside his chest finally he had the belt loose and he checked what was on it a canteen that was dented but not split open he unscrewed the cap and drank and the canteen sloshed halffull the water from it had a stale metallic taste a revolver snug in a holster there was a leather flap snapped over the handle not much water would have got in he unholstered the gun impressed by how well teasle equipped his men it was a colt python a thick fourinch barrel with a big sighting pin at the end the plastic handle it was always sold with had been replaced by a stout wooden grip designed not to be slippery if it got wet the sights near the hammer had also been changed usually they were stationary but these had been made adjustable for long distance shooting he had not hoped for this fine a gun it was chambered for a magnum cartridge the second most powerful handgun load a man could kill a deer with it a man could shoot clean through a deer with it he pushed the lever at the side and swung out the bullet cylinder there were five shells in it the chamber underneath the firing pin was empty quickly he slipped the gun back into the holster out of the rain and checked the cartridge pouch and counted fifteen more shells then he buckled the gunbelt around his waist and stooped his ribs biting to search the guys pockets but there wasnt anything to take especially no food he had thought the guy at least might have some chocolate stooped his chest was hurting worse than ever he had to fix it now he unbuckled the guys trouser belt and straightened painfully with it unbuttoning his outer wool shirt and the white cotton shirt under that the rain slapped at his chest he wound the belt around his ribs and cinched it like a roll of strong tape holding him tight and the pain stopped cutting it switched to a swelling aching pressure against the belt hard to breathe tight but at least the pain had stopped cutting he buttoned up and felt the cotton shirt soggy cold against him teasle time to go after him for a second he hesitated and almost went away in the forest chasing teasle would cost him time getting away and if there was another posse in these hills he might run into them but two hours wasnt much that was only as long as he would take to catch him and after that under cover of the night he would still have time to get away it was worth two hours to teach that bastard all right then which way after him the niche in the cliff he decided if teasle wanted to get down off the bluff in a hurry he would likely go back there with any luck he would be able to head teasle off and meet him as he came down he hurried to the right following the border of grass very soon he stumbled across the second body it was the old man in green but how had he tumbled off the cliff so that he ended up all the way over here his equipment belt didnt have a handgun it did have a hunting knife and it had a pouch and inside rambo touched something food sticks of meat a handful he bit barely chewing swallowing biting off more sausage sticks of smoked sausage wet and crushed a little from the old man slamming onto the rocks but it was food and he was biting into it chewing swallowing quickly forcing himself to slow and mulch it around to all parts of his mouth then it was almost gone and he was tucking the last bits into his mouth and sucking his fingers and then all that was left was the smoke taste and his tongue slightly burning from the hot peppers that had been in with the meat sudden lightning and then thunder as if the earth had shuddered he had better watch himself he was getting too lucky first the gun the bullets the canteen and now the knife and the sausage they had been so easy to get that he better watch himself he knew how these things worked and how they evened out one minute you got lucky and the next well he would make damn sure he watched himself so all the luck stayed with him teasle kneaded his fist opening closing it the knuckles had gashed on mitchs teeth swelling now but mitchs lips were swelling twice as bad in the thunder mitch tried to stand one knee gave out and he fell weeping against a tree you shouldnt have hit him so hard shingleton said dont i know it teasle said youre a trained boxer you didnt need to hit him so hard i said i know it i shouldnt have hit him at all lets leave it but look at him he cant even stand hows he going to travel never mind that ward said weve got worse troubles the rifles the radio theyve washed over the cliff weve still got our handguns but they dont have any range teasle said not against a rifle as soon as its light the kid can pick us off a mile away unless he takes advantage of the storm to clear out ward said no we have to assume hell come for us weve been too careless already and we have to start acting as if the worst will happen even if he doesnt come were still finished no food or equipment no organization dead tired well be lucky if we can crawl by the time we get back to town he looked at where mitch was sitting in the rain and mud holding his mouth groaning help me with him he said lifting mitch to his feet mitch shoved him away im all right he murmured through his missing teeth youve done enough dont come near me let me try ward said but mitch pushed him away too im all right i tell you his lips were swollen purple his head drooped and he covered his face with his hands dammit im all right sure you are ward said and caught him as he sagged to his knees i jesus my teeth i know teasle said and together he and ward braced mitch up shingleton looked at teasle shaking his head what a mess look at how dull his eyes are and look at you how are you going to make it through the night without a shirt youll freeze dont worry about it just watch out for lester and them by now theyre long gone not in this storm they wont be able to see to walk in a straight line theyll be wandering around this bluff somewhere and if we stumble into them look out lester and that young deputy are so scared about the kid coming theyre liable to think were him and start shooting ive seen it happen like that before snowstorms in korea where a sentry shot his own man by mistake he was thinking no time to explain rainy nights in louisville where two policemen got confused and shot each other his father something like that had happened to his father too but he could not let himself think about it remember it lets go he said abruptly weve got a lot of miles to cover and were not getting any stronger the rain pushing at their backs they guided mitch through the trees at first his legs dragged in the mud then clumsily sluggishly he managed walking a war hero teasle thought his back numb from the cold rain streaming down it the kid had said he was in the war but who would have thought to believe him why hadnt the kid explained more would that have made a difference would you have handled him different from anybody else no i couldnt fine then you just worry about what he knows to do to you when he comes if he comes maybe youre wrong maybe he wont come he came back to town all those times didnt he and hell come this time too oh hell come all right hey youre trembling shingleton said just look out for lester and them he could not keep from thinking about it legs stiff and hard to move holding mitch up as he and the others trudged wearily through the trees in the rain he could not help remembering what had happened to his father that saturday the six other men who had gone on the deer hunt his father had wanted him along but three had said he was too young and his father had not liked the way they said it but gave in that saturday was the first day of the season an argument would spoil it so the story had come back how they took up positions along a driedup streambed that was marked with fresh deer tracks and droppings how his father swung around to the top where he made a racket to frighten a deer down the streambed where the men would see it going by and shoot the rule everybody was to stay in position so that nobody would be confused about where anybody else was but one of them on his first hunt tired of waiting all day for a deer to go by wandered off to see what he could find on his own heard a noise saw movement in the brush fired and split teasles fathers head very nearly in half the body almost didnt lie in open state the head was even more shattered than it first seemed but the undertaker used a wig and everyone said the body looked perfectly alive orval had been on that hunt and now orval was shot too and as teasle guided mitch through the storm across the bluff he was more and more afraid that he himself was going to die as well he strained to see if lester and the others were in the dark trees ahead if they did lose direction and shoot scared he knew it would be nobodys fault but his own what were his men anyhow fiftysevenhundreddollarayear traffic police smalltown deputies trained to handle smalltown crime always hoping nothing serious would happen always near help if they needed it and here they were in the wildest mountains in kentucky with no help around up against an experienced killer and god only knew how they had managed to bear up this long he should never have brought them in here he realized he should have waited for the state police for five years he had just been fooling himself that his department was as tough and disciplined as louisvilles understanding now that over those years little by little his men had got used to their routine and had lost their edge and so had he thinking about how he had argued with orval instead of concentrating on the kid about how he had got them all ambushed and how their equipment was lost and how the posse was split up gone to hell and orval dead he was coming to realize the idea cropping up and him pushing it away and it cropping up again stronger how really soft and careless he had turned like punching mitch like not warning orval to stay low the first noise confused with the thunder and he could not be certain that he had actually heard it he stopped and looked at the others did you hear i dont know exactly shingleton said up ahead i think off to the right then three more came and they were unmistakable shots from a rifle its lester ward said but hes not shooting this way i dont think he saved his rifle anymore than we did teasle said thats the kid shooting there was one more shot still from a rifle and he listened for yet another but it never came he ran around and caught them at the break in the cliff teasle said four shots four men the fifth was to finish somebody now hell be after us he hurried to lead mitch in the opposite direction from the shots ward balked hold it arent we going to try and help we cant just leave them depend on it theyre dead and now hell be coming for us shingleton said you bet on it teasle said ward looked anxiously toward the direction of the shots he closed his eyes sickened those poor dumb bastards reluctantly he bolstered mitch and they moved off to the left gaining speed the rain eased off then got heavier the kid will probably wait for us at the cliff in case we didnt hear teasle said that will give us a lead as soon as hes sure were not coming hell set off across the bluff to find our trail but this rain will wipe it out and he wont find anything were in the clear then ward said clear then mitch repeated stupidly no when he doesnt find our trail what hell do is run toward the far end of the bluff and try to get ahead of us hell find a spot where he thinks were most likely to climb down and hell lie waiting for us well then ward said well just have to get there first wont we first wont we mitch repeated staggering and ward made it sound so easy mitchs echo sounded so funny that teasle laughed nervously hell yes well just have to get there first he said looking at shingleton and ward impressed by their control and he suddenly thought that things might work out after all at six the rain changed to big cracking chunks of hail and shingleton was hit so hard in the face by some that they had to grope close under the shelter of a tree the leaves had already fallen from the tree but there were enough bare branches for most of the hail to glance off of and the rest of it came down striking sharply against teasles bare back and chest and the arms he had raised protectively over his head he was desperate to start moving again but he knew it would be crazy to try a few wallops from chunks of hail this size could lay a man flat but the longer he stayed huddled by this tree the more time the kid had to catch up and his only hope was that the hail had forced the kid to stop and take cover also he waited glancing around braced for an attack and then at last the hail stopped and no more rain came and with the light clearing and the wind dying they worked fast across the bluff but without the distraction of the wind and rain the noises they made hurrying through the underbrush were loud a signal to the kid they tried going slower but the noises were almost as loud so they hurried on again crashing doesnt this top have an end shingleton said weve been going for miles for miles mitch echoed four miles five six he was dragging his feet again next he sagged ward heaved him up and then ward himself heaved up careening backward the report from the rifle was rolling through the trees and ward was now on his back arms and legs stuck out in a death frenzy and from where teasle lay on the ground he saw that ward had taken the bullet directly in the chest he was surprised to be lying on the ground he didnt remember diving there he was surprised that he had his pistol out christ ward dead now too he wanted to crawl to him but what was the use what about mitch not him too he was fallen into the mud lying still as if he had been shot as well no he was all right eyes opening blinking at a tree did you see the kid teasle said fast to shingleton did you see where he shot from no answer shingleton was flat on the ground staring blankly ahead his face drawn tight around his massive cheekbones teasle shook him did you see i asked you snap out of it shaking him was like pressing a release valve shingleton broke into motion fist up close to teasles face keep your fucking hands off me did you see him i asked you no i said you didnt say anything anything mitch echoed dumbly they looked at him quick give me a hand teasle said and they dragged him forward into a slight hollow ringed with bushes a rotting tree fallen across the forward rim the hollow was full of rain water and teasle sank slowly into it cold against his chest and stomach his hands were shaking as he checked his pistol to be sure no water plugged the barrel he knew what had to be done now and it frightened him but he did not see any other way and if he thought about it too much he might not be able to make himself go through with it stay here with mitch he said mouthdry to shingleton his tongue had not been moist in hours if somebody comes back through these bushes and doesnt first say its me shoot him what do you mean stay here where out ahead if we try running back the way we came hell only follow us we might as well save ourselves the trouble of running and try to end this right here but hes trained to fight like this and i was trained for night patrol in korea that was twenty years ago but i havent forgotten all of it i might be slow and out of practice but i dont hear any better ideas stay here and wait for him let him come to us we know hell come were ready for him and what happens when it gets to be night and he sneaks right onto us before we hear him well move out when its night sure and make so much noise he wont even need to see us to shoot us hell just have to aim toward where he hears us you just said it hes trained to do this and im betting thats our edge with any luck he wont expect me to go out there and play it his way hell expect me to run not attack then im going with you no mitch needs you to stay with him two of us crawling around out there might make enough noise to warn the kid he had another reason for doing it alone but he didnt wait to explain anymore he had waited too long as it was immediately he crawled up out of the hollow to the left around the fallen tree the mud was so chill against his stomach that he had to force himself down along it he squirmed forward several feet and paused to listen and squirmed forward again and each time he dug his shoes into the mud to push ahead the mud gave a sucking noise and he tensed the suck increased until finally he stopped using his feet to push and switched to wriggling forward on his elbows and knees always careful to keep his pistol free of the mud drops of water spilled icy onto his spine as he wormed under bushes he stopped and listened and crawled on shingleton wouldnt understand his other reason for doing this anyhow he thought it wasnt shingleton who had been in charge and made the mistakes that killed orval and lester and the young deputy and ward and galt and the two men in the helicopter and all the rest so how could shingleton understand why he couldnt bring himself to let anybody else die for him this time it would be just himself and the kid and nobody else just the way this thing started and if there were going to be anymore mistakes this time it would be just himself who would pay his watch hands had been at sixthirty when he set out he was so busy concentrating on the movements and sounds around him that it was seven when he next looked at his watch a squirrel scrambling up a tree startled him into guessing it was the kid and he came close to shooting at it the light was dimming again not from the clouds now but from the start of evening and the air was colder and he was shivering as he crawled even so there were rivulets of sweat trickling down his face and back and under his arms it was fear the hot pressure of his anus the adrenalin squirting into his stomach he wanted desperately to turn and go back and because of that he urged himself to go farther on god in heaven if he missed this chance at the kid it wasnt going to be because he was afraid to die jesus no he owed that to orval he owed it to the rest of them sevenfifteen he had crawled far out now and he had worked back and forth across the forest pausing peering deeply into groves and thickets to see if the kid was hiding there small noises made him jumpy noises he could not account for the snap of a branch that could be the kid adjusting his position to aim the brush of leaves that could be the kid circling behind him he crawled slowly fighting his panic to speed up and get this over fighting to concentrate on everything around him the slightest piece of cover was all the kid needed all he himself had to do was get careless once and not check one bush or one stump or one dip in the ground and that might be the end it would be so abrupt that he would never hear the burst of the shot that killed him then it was seventhirty and the shadows had merged deep enough to trick him what looked like the kid was only the dark trunk of a crooked tree set far back in the gloom a fallen log in back of a bush deceived him the same way and he knew he had done the best he could it was time to head back that was the worst part his eyes were tired and the shadows were touching him and he just wanted to hurry back to shingleton and relax a minute and let shingleton keep watch for the kid but he could not dare give up searching to speed up back there even as he returned he still had to take his time and check every bush and tree before he made a move he had to look behind afraid the kid was sneaking toward him his back felt so naked so white in the gloom that he kept expecting to glance around and see the kid aiming with a smile at the cleft between his shoulder blades the bullet would blast apart his backbone and rupture his insides and instantly he would be dead in spite of himself he hurried to return he almost forgot to let shingleton know it was himself coming wouldnt that be a laugh to risk searching for the kid and then be shot by his own man its me he whispered its teasle but nobody answered i whispered too low and he didnt hear me teasle thought its me he repeated louder its teasle but again nobody answered and teasle knew something had to be wrong he circled the hollow and crept up from behind and something was more than wrong shingleton wasnt there and mitch was flat on his back in the water his throat neatly slit from ear to ear his blood steaming in the cold shingleton where was shingleton worried and tired of waiting he must have gone after the kid too and left mitch and the kid came up and slit his throat to kill him quietly the kid teasle realized the kid must be very close he crouched and spun and the sight of mitch the frenzy of trying to protect himself from all angles made him want to cry out shingleton get back here shingleton two men facing in opposite directions would maybe see the kid before he rushed them shingleton he wanted to call instead shingleton called to him from some place on the right look out will hes got me his cry was punctuated by a rifle shot and that was all teasle could stand he finally had his breakdown running before he knew it screaming racing away charging through the shadows through the trees and bushes aaaeeiii he was screaming the niche in the cliff was all he could think the cliff the cliff he shot at teasle but the light was bad and the trees were too thick and anyway shingleton grabbed the rifle so that the bullet jerked low shingleton ought to have been dead he had been shot in the skull he should not have been able to get back off the ground and grab the rifle to throw off its aim rambo really had to admire him as he shot him again through one eye now and this time shingleton was dead for sure without a pause he set off running after teasle it was obvious that teasles direction was back toward the niche in the cliff and he planned on beating him there he did not follow exactly on teasles path teasle might get control of himself and lie somewhere waiting so he ran in a line parallel to teasle racing to beat him to the cliff he just missed him he came hurrying through the woods able to see the cliff edge now and the top of the niche and he dropped to his knees hiding for teasle but then he heard chips of stone rattling down the cliff and the sound of heavy breathing down there and he rushed over just in time to see teasle jump the last few feet down the niche ducking around the side of the cliff wall he saw too the bodies of the four deputies where he had shot them at the bottom of the cliff and he didnt like the position he was in now teasle had the advantage to climb down the niche after him he would be as easy a target for teasle as the four deputies had been for himself he knew damn well that teasle was not going to stand down there all night waiting for him shortly teasle was going to take his chance and clear out and he would be left up on top suspecting that teasle was gone but not willing to risk that he was still there to be safe he had to find another way down off this bluff and that way had to be in the direction teasle would take for home he raced back toward where he had killed shingleton and passed his body and continued racing toward where he hoped the bluff would slope down into the draw and it did slope down and in half an hour he was into the draw running through the woods toward a stretch of grass he had dimly spotted from above the light was fading worse and he was hurrying to get to the grass before the dark could blot out teasles trail he reached the grass and ran through the line of trees that bordered it not wanting to show himself as a target while he searched for tracks that led out of the trees into the open space he looked and ran to look farther along but still no tracks in the wet earth and he thought that maybe teasle had been slow to leave the cliff began to worry that teasle was behind him coming watching just as it started to rain again and made everything even darker he found the grass pushed down there but he had to take a handicap give teasle a headstart because in spite of his temptation to rush across the open grass after him he had to wait until the night was fully black teasle might not be running ahead at all he might be lying in the bushes on the other side aiming then he supposed it dark enough so he could run across without showing himself as a target but his caution was needless because when he got over there teasle was not around the rain was falling lightly through the trees it muffled sounds very little and there up ahead something was working to break through the thick underbrush he set out after it stopped and listened corrected his direction toward the noise then set on again he expected that fairly soon teasle would give up running and try to ambush him but as long as he could hear teasle running it was safe to keep after him and make all the noise he had to then one time he stopped and listened and the running up ahead was stopped as well so he sank to the ground and began crawling quietly forward in a minute the running up ahead continued again and he leapt to his feet charging after it that was the pattern for an hour running stopping listening crawling running the rain kept on in a cold faint drizzle and the belt that was cinched around his ribs loosened and he had to tighten it to ease the pain he was certain now that his ribs were broken and that sharp bones were lancing his insides he would have given up but he knew he would have teasle soon he doubled over in agony but teasle was still running up there so he straightened pushing himself on the chase went up a slope of trees over a spine of rock and down a patch of shale to a stream then along the bank of the stream across the stream into more woods across a ravine the pain in his chest cut sharply as he jumped across and he almost slipped down into the ravine but he pulled himself up listened for teasle heard him and chased after him each time his right foot hit the ground the jolt went all the way up his right side grating his ribs twice he was sick up and down the pattern of the country repeated itself stumbling up a slope of rocks and brush teasle felt like he was back on the ledge trying to get up the rise to the woods in the dark he couldnt see the top he wished he knew how far it was he couldnt keep on climbing much longer the rain was making the rocks slippery and he was losing his balance falling hard he took to crawling up and the rocks tore at his pants cut into his knees while behind him down in the trees at the bottom he heard the kid breaking through the undergrowth he scrambled faster if he could just see the top and know how far he had to go the kid must be out of the woods now and starting up the slope and teasle thought of shooting blindly down to hold him back he couldnt the flashes from his pistol would give the kid a target but christ he had to do something in one desperate lunge he reached the top but didnt know it was the top until he tripped and barely grabbed a rock in time to stop from rolling down the other side now now he could shoot he stretched out and listened to where the kid was rushing up the slope and he fired six times in a line across the noises then he hugged the ground in case he had missed and a shot came from below zinging over him he heard the kid climbing off to the left and he fired once more at the noise before he started racing down the other side of the slope again he tripped and now he struck his shoulder solidly against a rock and couldnt keep from rolling as he grabbed his shoulder and tumbled to the bottom he lay there dazed the wind was knocked out of him and he fought to breathe but he couldnt he gasped and pushed his stomach muscles in but they wanted to push out and then he managed to suck in a little air and a little more and he was almost breathing normally again when he heard the kid clambering on the rocks above he groped to his knees then to his feet and discovered that in his fall he had lost hold of his pistol it was somewhere up on the slope no time to go back for it no light to find it he staggered through woods circling he guessed going nowhere winding around and around until hed be brought to bay already his knees were buckling his direction was wobbly he was bumping against trees a crazy vision in his head of him in his office bare feet on the desk head tilted sipping hot soup tomato soup no bean with bacon the rich expensive kind where the label said dont add water it was only minutes now before hed have him the noises ahead were slowing more erratic clumsy he could hear teasle breathing hoarsely he was that close to him teasle had given him a good race that was sure he had figured to tag him several miles ago and here they were still at it but not for long a few minutes now that was all the pain in his ribs he had to slow but it was still a fair pace and since teasle had slowed too he wasnt bothered much his hand was over his ribs helping the belt to press all his right side was swollen in the rain the belt was even looser than before and he had to keep his hand pressing then he stumbled and fell he hadnt done that before no he was wrong about that he had stumbled at the ravine then he stumbled again and rising to his feet working on he decided it might take slightly more than a few minutes before he caught up to teasle it would be soon though no question about it just a little more than a few minutes that was all had he said that out loud the brambles caught him full in the face as he came up to them in the dark they were spikes lashing into him and he recoiled clutching his ripped cheeks he knew it wasnt rain wetting his cheeks and hands but it did not matter because off in there in the brambles was the sound of teasle crawling this was it he had him he bore to the left along the edge of the brambles waiting for it to curve down and lead him to the bottom of the patch where he could rest and wait for teasle to crawl out in the dark he would not be able to see the surprised look on teasles face when he shot him but the longer he hurried along the edge of the brambles the farther it stretched on and he began to wonder if the brambles covered all this section of the slope he hurried farther and still the brambles did not curve down and then he was sure they stretched all along this rise he wanted to stop and double back but he had the thought that if he kept on just a little more the brambles would at last curve down five minutes became what he judged was fifteen and then twenty and he was wasting his time he should have gone right in after teasle but now he could not in the dark he had no idea where teasle had entered double back maybe the brambles did not go far along the other end of this ridge maybe they curved down over there he rushed back holding his side moaning he hurried a long while until he no longer believed they would ever curve down and when next he stumbled and fell he remained face down in the muddy grass hed lost him he had given up so much time and strength to come so close and lose him his face stung from the gashes of the brambles his ribs were on fire his hands pulpy his clothes ripped his body slashed and he had lost him the rain coming down in a gently cooling drizzle as he lay there splayed out breathing deeplyholding it letting it out slowly breathing deeply again letting the dead weight of his arms and legs relax with every slow exhale for the first time he could remember crying softly crying any moment the kid would be breaking through the brambles after him he crawled hysterically then the brambles got lower and thicker until he had to press himself flat and wriggle even so the lowest branches scraped across his back and snagged in the seat of his pants and when he twisted to unsnag them other branches gouged his arms and shoulders hes coming he thought and squirmed desperately forward letting the barbs dig into him his belt buckle scooped into the mud funneling it into his pants but where was he going how did he know he wasnt completing a circle returning to the kid he stopped frightened the land sloped down he must be on the side of a hill if he kept wriggling downward hed be headed straight away or would he hard to think suffocated in the dense black tangle and the constant rain you bastard kid im going to get away and kill you for this kill you for this he lifted his head off the mud and couldnt recall having moved for a while and gradually understood he had passed out he stiffened and glanced all around the kid could have crept up to him his stupor and slit his throat just like he did to mitch christ he said out loud and his voice was a croak that startled him christ he said again to free his voice but the word broke like a crust of ice no im wrong he thought his brain slowly unclouding the kid wouldnt have crept up in my sleep to kill me he would have wakened me first hed want me to know what was happening so where is he watching close finding my trail coming he listened for noises in the brush and didnt hear anything and had to keep moving had to keep distance between them but when he tried crawling fast he only managed a sluggish strain to pull forward he must have been unconscious a long time back there the light wasnt black now it was gray and he could see the brambles everywhere thick and ugly spines an inch long he fingered his back and he was like a porcupine dozens of barbs hooked in his skin he stared at his hand all bloody and struggled worming on maybe the kid was very close watching him enjoying him suffer then it all confused and then the sun was up and through the tops of the brambles he saw the sky bright and stark blue he laughed what are you laughing at laughing at i dont even remember the rain stopping and now the sky is clear and its daylight for crissake he laughed again and realized he was turning giddy and that was funny and he laughed at that he had crawled ten feet out of the brambles into an autumnplowed field before he understood that he was out it was quite a joke he squinted and tried to see the end of the field and couldnt and tried standing and couldnt and the inside of his head was spinning so much that he had to laugh again then he suddenly quit the kid would be around here somewhere aiming hed enjoy watching me come out sliced to pieces before he shot the sonofabitch ill bean with bacon soup his stomach heaved up and that was a joke too because what on earth did he have in his stomach to heave up nothing thats right nothing so what was this stuff on the ground in front of him raspberry pie he joked and that made him sick again so he crawled through it over a couple of furrows and collapsed and then he crawled over a few more there was a pool of black water between two furrows he had been twisting his face toward the sky all night to drink the rain but his tongue was still choking him his throat was still swollen dry and he drank from the muddy water poking his face down close and lapping and almost passing out with his face in the water there was sweet gritty dirt in his mouth a few more feet just try to do a few more feet i get away ill kill that bastard kid tear him because im a but then the idea fell apart on him im a but he couldnt remember and then he had to stop and rest chin on the top of a mulchy furrow the sun warming his back cant stop pass out die move but he couldnt move he couldnt raise himself to crawl on his hands and knees he tried clawing at the dirt ahead of him to pull himself forward but he couldnt force himself to move that way either got to cant pass out die he braced his shoes against a furrow and pushed and pushed harder and this time he budged a little his heart swelling he pushed his shoes against the furrow even harder and inched forward through the mud and he didnt dare let himself stop he knew he would never be able to raise the strength to go again shoes against furrow push worm the kid thats it he remembered now he was going to fix the kid im not as good a fighter oh yes the kids a better fighter oh yes but im and then the idea fell apart again as he lapsed into the mechanical rhythm of shoes against furrow push one more time and push one more time he didnt know when his arms had started back to work hands clawing the dirt dragging him along organize that was the word hed been searching for and then he clawed forward and he touched something it took a while to register a wire he looked up and there were other wires a fence and sweet god through the fence was something so beautiful that he didnt believe he was really seeing it a ditch a gravel road his heart was pounding wildly and he was laughing sticking his head through the wires shimmying through the fence barbed wire ripping his back some more but he didnt care he was laughing rolling into the ditch it was full of water and he tumbled on his back the water trickling into his ears and then he was struggling up the rise toward the road sliding down groping up sliding flopping himself over the top one arm touching the gravel of the road he could not feel the gravel he could see it sure he was squinting directly at it but he could not feel organize that was it now he remembered it all i know how to organize the kids a better fighter but i know how to organize for orval for shingleton and ward and mitch and lester and the young deputy and all of them for me ill cream that fucking bastard he lay there at the side of the road repeating that over and over to himself closing his eyes to the glare of the sun snickering at how his pants were in shreds at how bloody he was the blood seeping through the mud on him while he grinned repeating his idea telling it to the state trooper who said my god and gave up trying to lift him into the cruiser and ran for the car radio part three it was night and the back of the truck smelled of oil and grease a sheet of stiff canvas had been pulled across the top to form a roof and in under it teasle sat on a bench staring at the big map that hung on one wall the only light was from an unshielded bulb dangling over the map next to the map was a bulky twoway radio on a table the radioman wore earphones national guard truck twentyeight in position he was saying to a deputy three miles down from the bend in the stream the deputy nodded shoving one more red pin into the map next to the others along the south side to the east yellow pins showed the deployment of state police black pins in the west were police from nearby towns and counties white pins to the north were police from louisville frankfort lexington bowling green and covington youre not going to stay here all night are you someone said to teasle from outside the back of the truck teasle looked and it was kern the captain of the state police he was out far enough that the glare from the bulb lit just part of his face his eyes and forehead in shadow go home and get some sleep why dont you kern said the doctor told you to rest and nothing serious will happen here for a while cant oh reporters are looking for me at my place and the office the best way i know to rest is not go through everything again for them theyll be coming around here looking for you soon anyhow no i told your men at the roadblocks not to let them pass kern shrugged and stepped toward the truck into the full light it was stark and accented the lines in his forehead the pinched skin around his eyes making him look older than he was it did not reflect off his red hair making even that seem lustreless and dull hes the same age i am teasle thought if he looks like that then after these last few days how must i look that doctor came close to making a career out of bandaging your face and hands kern said whats that dark stain soaking through your shirt dont tell me youre bleeding again some kind of ointment he spread on too thick i have bandages under my clothes too the ones around my legs and knees are so tight i can hardly walk he made himself smile as if the tight bandages were a practical joke from the doctor he did not want kern to realize how very bad he felt sick dizzy any pain kern said i hurt less before he put these bandages on so tight he gave me some pills to take every hour any help enough that sounded right he had to be careful how he talked about it to kern minimizing his pain but not so much that kern would stop believing him and insist that he go back to the hospital before at the hospital kern had shown up damn mad at him for rushing into the forest after the kid without waiting for the state police its my jurisdiction and you took advantage and now you can just stay the hell out of this kern had said teasle had taken it all letting kern get rid of his anger and then slowly he had done his best to convince kern that more than one person was needed to organize this wide a search there was another argument that he did not use but he was sure that kern was thinking it as many men could die this time as at the start and somebody ought to be around to share the responsibility kern was that son of weak leader teasle had seen him rely on others too often so now teasle was here helping but not necessarily for long despite kerns faults he did worry about his men and how much work they could stand and if he once thought that teasle was in too great pain he could easily decide to send him away outside trucks were rumbling by in the night big lorry trucks that teasle knew would have soldiers in them a siren started coming up the road fast shrieking by toward town and he was glad to talk about something besides how he felt whats the ambulance for another civilian who just got himself shot teasle shook his head how theyre dying to help dying is about the word for it what happened stupidity a bunch of them were up camping in the woods figuring to be right with us when we start in the morning they heard a noise out in the dark and guessed it might be the kid trying to sneak down and across the road so they grabbed their rifles and went out to see first thing they mixed up in the dark one guy heard another guy and thought it was the kid started shooting the other guy shot back everybody else started shooting gods mercy nobody was killed just hit bad i never saw anything like it i did for a time earlier when he had been staring at the map his head had felt like it was stuffed with satin and now without warning it was like that again his ears felt stuffed too and the words i did seemed to have come in an echo from outside him off balance faintly nauseous he wanted to stop and lie down on the bench but he could not let kern know what was happening to him when i worked in louisville he said and almost could not continue about eight years ago there was a little town near us where a sixyearold girl had been kidnapped the local police thought she might have been assaulted and left somewhere so they organized a search and some of us offduty that weekend drove over to help trouble was that the people who were organizing the search put out a call for help over the radio stations and in the newspapers and any guy who wanted a free meal and some excitement decided to come he was determined not to lie down but the light was going gray on him the bench he sat on seemed to be tilting he finally had to compromise and lean back against the wall of the truck hoping he looked at ease four thousand he said concentrating to keep the words straight no place for them all to sleep to eat no way to coordinate that many the town just grew overnight and split at the seams most of them drank half the time and then showed up hungover on the buses going out to the search area one guy nearly drowned in a swamp one group got lost and the search had to be stopped so everybody else could go find them snake bites broken legs sunstroke it finally got so confused that all civilians had to be ordered home and just the police kept on the search he lit a cigarette and dragged deeply on it trying to numb his dizziness he looked and the radioman and the deputy were turned to him listening how long had he been talking ten minutes it seemed although it could not have been his mind was skimming up and down in a smooth undulating pattern well dont stop kern said what about the girl did you find her teasle nodded slowly six months later in a shallow grave off a side road about a mile from where the search originally ended some old guy drinking in a bar in louisville made a few jokes about feeling little girls and we heard about it a long chance there was a connection but we followed up anyhow since i had been on the search and knew the case they had me question him and forty minutes after i started on him he came out with the whole story how hed been driving by this farm and saw this little girl splashing in a plastic pool in the front yard it was her yellow swimsuit attracted him he said grabbed her right out of the front yard and into the car without anybody seeing he took us directly to the grave it was the second grave the first grave had been in the middle of the search area and while the civilians had been wandering around screwing things up he had come back one night and moved her he took another deep drag on his cigarette feeling the smoke fill his throat his bandaged fingers thick and numb holding the cigarette those civilians will screw things up here too word about this should never have been let out its my fault theres a reporter who comes around my office who heard my men talking before i could keep them quiet ive got some of them herding all outsiders back to town right now sure and that bunch in the woods might get jumpy again and take a shot at your men anyway youll never round every one up tomorrow morning therell be civilians all through those hills you saw the way theyve taken over town theres just too many of them to control the worst hasnt come yet wait until the professionals show up i dont know what you mean professionals who in hell are they amateurs really but they call themselves pros guys with nothing better to do than chase around the country to every place that has a search i met a few of them when we were looking for that little girl one guy had just come from the everglades where they were tracking down some lost campers before that hed been to california helping search for a family out hiking caught in a brush fire that winter hed been to wyoming after skiers hit by an avalanche between times he went where the mississippi was flooding or where miners were sealed off by a cavein the trouble is types like him never work with the people in charge they want the power of organizing their own groups and going off on their own and before long they confuse the search pattern interfere with official groups run ahead to places that look exciting like old farms leaving whole fields unsearched teasles heart suddenly fluttered missed a beat sped up and he held his chest gasping whats the matter kern said youre fine im fine i just need another pill the doctor warned me this would happen it wasnt true the doctor had not warned him at all but this was the second time his heart had done that and the first time a pill had brought it back to normal so now he quickly swallowed another he certainly could not let kern know there was anything the matter with his heart kern did not look satisfied with his answer but then the radioman adjusted his earphones as if he were listening to a report and told the deputy national guard truck thirtytwo in position he traced his finger down a list on a page thats at the start of branch road and the deputy shoved one more red pin into the map the chalk taste of the pill remained in teasles mouth he breathed and the tightness around his heart began to relax i never could understand why that old guy moved the little girls body to a different grave he said to kern his heart relaxing even more i remember when we dug her up and how she looked from six months in the ground and what he had done to her i remember thinking god it must have been a lonely way to die what just happened to you nothing fatigue the doctor said your face matched the gray of your shirt more trucks rolled by outside and in their noise teasle did not have to answer then a patrol car pulled up behind kern its headlights flooding him and teasle knew he would not have to answer at all i guess i have to go kern said reluctantly these are the walkietalkies to hand out he stepped toward the cruiser hesitated then turned back why dont you at least lie down on that bench and catch a little sleep while im gone staring at the map wont tell you where the kid is and youll want to be fresh when we start tomorrow if i get tired i want to make double sure that everybody is where he should be im in no shape to go into those hills with you so i might as well be good for something here listen what i said at the hospital about the poor way you went after him its done forget it but listen i know what youre trying youre thinking about all your men shot and youre straining your body to punish yourself now maybe its true what i said that orval might still be alive if you had worked with me from the beginning but the kid is the one who pulled the trigger on him and the rest not you remember that teasle did not need to be reminded the radioman was saying state police unit nineteen in position and teasle was dragging on his cigarette watching intently as the deputy shoved another yellow pin into the eastern side of the map the map had almost no interior details nobody ever wanted a breakdown of these hills before the county surveyor had explained when he brought it maybe if a road goes through there someday well have to chart it but surveying costs a lot of money especially in that kind of rough country and it just never seemed practical to use up our budget on something nobody would ever likely need at least the surrounding roads were accurate to the north they formed the top part of a square but the road to the south curved like the bottom part of a circle joining with the roads that went straight up on either side teasles communication truck was parked on the lowest part of the south roads arc that was where he had been found by the state trooper and since the kid was last near there it was the point from which the search was being directed the radioman looked at teasle a helicopters coming in theyre talking but its not clear enough to understand our two just left none of them should be coming back this soon motor trouble maybe or its not one of ours at all it might be another news crew flying by taking pictures if it is i dont want them to land the radioman called it asking for identification no reply then teasle heard the roar of the approaching rotor blades and he rose stiffly from the bench walking with difficulty to the open back of the truck next to the truck was the plowed field that he had crawled across that morning it was dark and then he saw the furrows a harsh white as the searchlight on the bottom of the copter swooped down and across the field it was the kind of searchlight the camera crew had used to take pictures earlier theyre hovering he told the radioman try them again make sure they dont land but already the copter was setting down motor quieting blades whipping through the air in a recurrent whistle that came less and less often there was a light in the cockpit and teasle saw a man climb out and from the bearing of this man as he walked across the field toward the truck steady and lithe and straight teasle knew even without being able to make out his clothes that this was no reporter nor any state policeman coming back with motor trouble this was the man he had sent for he climbed down slowly and in pain from the back of the truck and limped to the edge of the road the man had just reached the barbed wire fence where the field ended excuse me ive been up and down the line to find someone the man said i wonder if hes here they said he might be wilfred teasle im teasle well im sam trautman he said ive come about my boy three more lorry trucks drove by national guardsmen standing in back holding rifles faces pale under their helmets in the dark and as the headlights flashed teasle could see trautmans uniform his captains insignia his green beret tucked neatly under his belt your boy not exactly i suppose i didnt train him myself my men did but i trained the men who trained him so in a sense hes my boy has he done anything more the last i heard he killed thirteen men he said it clearly directly without emphasis but all the same teasle recognized the things subdued in his voice he had listened to them too often before too many fathers at night in the station shocked disappointed embarrassed over what their children had done but this was not the same not that simple there was something else hidden in trautmans voice something so unfamiliar in this kind of situation that teasle was having trouble identifying it and when he did he was bewildered you sound almost proud of him teasle said do i im sorry i dont mean to its just that hes the best student we ever turned out and things would certainly be wrong with the school if he hadnt put up a good fight he pointed to the barbed wire fence and began climbing over it the same smooth economy of movement as when he had got out of the helicopter and walked across the field coming down into the ditch on teasles side of the fence he was close enough for teasle to see how his uniform molded perfectly to his body not a fold or a wrinkle in the dark his skin seemed the color of lead he had short black hair combed straight back a thin face a sharp chin the chin pointed forward a little and teasle was reminded of how orval sometimes used to think of people in terms of animals not trautman orval would have said now not trout but feist or ferret or weasel some type of slick fleshhunter he remembered career officers he had come up against in korea professional killers men totally at home with death and they always made him want to stand back i dont know if i really want you here after all he thought maybe asking you to come was a mistake but orval had taught him to judge a man by his grip as well and when trautman came in three steps out of the ditch his handshake was not what teasle expected instead of rough and overbearing it was strangely gentle and firm at the same time it made him very comfortable maybe trautman would be all right you came sooner than i expected teasle told him thank you we need all the help we can get because he had just been thinking of orval he was suddenly struck that he had gone through this another time two nights ago when he had thanked orval for coming in almost the same words that he had just used to thank trautman but now orval was dead you do need all the help trautman said to be honest i was planning to come even before you called hes not in the service anymore this is strictly a civilian matter all the same i cant help feeling partly responsible one thing though im not about to involve myself in any butcher job ill only help if i see that this thing is done properly to capture him not to kill him without a chance he might get killed yet but i wouldnt like to think that was the point are we together on that yes and he was telling the truth there was no way he wanted the kid shot to pieces out of his sight up in the hills he wanted him brought back wanted to see every damn thing that happened to him all right then trautman said although im not sure my help will do you any good its my guess that none of your people will get close enough to even see him let alone catch him hes much smarter and tougher than you can imagine how is it he didnt kill you too i dont see how you ever managed to get away from him there it was again that faintly mixed tone of pride and disappointment now you sound like youre sorry i did well in one sense i am but theres no need to take that personally strictly speaking he shouldnt have slipped up not with his skill and training if you had been an enemy he let get away it could have been very serious and i would like to find out why it happened in case theres a lesson i can pass on to my men tell me how youve planned this so far how did you get the national guard mobilized this fast they had war games scheduled for the weekend their equipment was ready so all they had to do was activate their men a few days early but this is a civilian command post where are headquarters for the military down the road in another truck but the officers are letting us give the orders they want to learn how their men do alone so theyre only monitoring just as they would have in the war games games trautman said christ everybody loves a game what makes you sure hes still around because every road around these hills has been watched since he went up there he cant have gotten down without being seen even if he had i would have felt it what its nothing i can explain a kind of extra sense ive been having after what he put me through it doesnt matter hes up there all right and tomorrow morning ill be pouring men after him until theres one for every tree which isnt possible of course so he still has the advantage hes an expert in guerrilla fighting he knows how to live off the land so he doesnt have the problem that you do of bringing up food and supplies for your men hes learned patience so he can hide somewhere and wait out this fight all year if he has to hes just one man so hes hard to spot hes on his own doesnt have to follow orders doesnt have to synchronize himself with other units so he can move fast shoot and get out and hide some place else then do the same all over again just like my men taught him thats fine teasle said now you teach me rambo woke in the dark on cold flat stone he woke because of his chest it was swollen so painfully that he had to ease the belt he had cinched around it and each time he breathed his ribs lanced him and he had to wince he didnt know where he was he guessed it must be night but he couldnt understand why the dark was so complete why there were no grays mixed in with the black no stars flickering no faint radiance from cloud cover he blinked the dark remained the same and fearing some damage had been done to his eyes he quickly spread his hands over the stone he lay on groped frantically around touched walls of damp rock a cave he thought puzzled im in a cave but how and still dazed he began to stagger out he had to stop and go back to where he had wakened because he didnt have his rifle in his hand but then his stupor cleared a little and he realized that his rifle had been with him all along wedged between his equipment belt and his pants so he started out again the floor of the cave sloped gradually down though and he knew that the cave mouth would likely be somewhere up not down so once again he had to turn around and start out the direction of the breeze coming down the tunnel from outside should have told him which way to go but he didnt figure that until he had stumbled around a bend and reached the mouth outside it was a crystal night brilliant stars a quarter moon the outlines of trees and rocks distinct below he didnt know how long he had been passed out nor how he had come to be in the cave the last things he recalled were struggling up at sunrise from where he lay near the ridge of brambles wandering through the forest and collapsing by a stream to drink he had deliberately rolled into the stream he remembered and had let the cool water flow over him reviving him and now he was at the mouth of this cave and it was night and there was an entire day plus a passage of territory that he could not account for at least he guessed it was only one day he suddenly thought could it have been longer far down and away there were lights what looked like hundreds of bright speckles except that these were off and on coming and going yellow and red mostly traffic on a road he thought a highway maybe but there was too much of it to be ordinary and something else it did not seem to be going anywhere the lights were slowing then they stopped a sweeping string of them from his left to his right about two miles off he could have been wrong calculating the distance but he was positive now that the lights had to do with coming after him that much activity down there he thought teasle must want me worse than anything he ever wanted before the night was very cold and there were no insects sounding nor any animals moving around in the brush just a slight wind that was rustling fallen leaves and scraping bare branches together he hugged his outside wool shirt and shivered and then he heard the helicopter chugging up from his left building to a roar dimming as it flew off far behind him there was another one behind it and another to his right and to his right as well he heard the faint echoes of dogs barking the wind shifted then coming toward him from the direction of the lights down there bringing with it the yelp of more dogs and the accumulated faroff murmur of heavy truck engines since the lights had been left on the engines would need to be kept idling he thought he tried counting the lights but in the distance they confused him and he multiplied their countless number by the amount of men each truck could carry twentyfive perhaps thirty teasle certainly wanted him and this time he was not taking any chance of failure he was going to come with every man every piece of equipment he could muster but rambo did not want to fight him anymore he was sick and in pain and sometime between losing teasle in the brambles and waking in this cave his anger had gone it had started to go even as the chase for teasle had drawn on him exhausted wanting desperately to catch the man not anymore for the pleasure of teaching him but just so he could do it and get it over and be free and after killing all those men after sacrificing so much time and strength that he needed for escape he had not even won the stupid useless waste he thought it made him feel empty and disgusted what had it all been for he should have taken his chance in the storm and run away well this time he was going hed had his fight with teasle and it had been fair and teasle had survived that was the end of it what kind of crapscreen is that youre throwing up now he told himself who are you fooling you were hungry to be in action again and you were damn sure you could beat him but you lost and now its dues time he wont be looking for you just yet not in the dark but by sunrise hell be coming after you with a small army that you dont have a chance against youre not going because he won fairly and its over you just want to get out while you damn well still can even if hes leading them all right at the head in plain sight you had just better clear out and stay alive then he knew it would not be that easy because as he stood there shivering wiping the sweat from his forehead his eyebrows there was a flash of heat from the root of his spine to the base of his skull then a sudden chill the sequence repeated itself and he understood now that he was not shivering from the breeze and the cold it was fever and extremely high to make him sweat this much if he tried moving off maybe to see if he could sneak through that line of lights down there he would end up collapsed he was having trouble standing as it was heat thats what he needed and shelter someplace to sweat out the fever and rest his ribs and food he had not eaten since he had found the dried meat on the body of the old man who had been washed off the cliff however long ago that was he shook and swayed and had to put out a hand to steady himself against the cave entrance this was it then the cave would have to do he didnt have the strength to find anyplace better he was going weak so fast that he wasnt even sure he would have the strength to get the cave ready well then dont stand here telling yourself how weak you are do it he picked his way down a strip of shale to the trees he had seen in outline the first trees he came to had sharp branches from where the leaves had fallen and that was no good so he shuffled through the leaves until at last they changed to soft springy fir needles underfoot and then he searched among these trees feeling for lush branches that might easily be broken off always careful to take only one from each tree so that it would not be obvious he had gone through here gathering them when he had five the motion of raising his arms to break off the boughs became too great a strain on his ribs he would have liked more but five would have to do he lifted them painfully onto the shoulder away from his damaged ribs and worked back toward the cave the weight of the boughs making him stagger even worse than he already had been the climb up the slope of shale was the really bad time he kept teetering off to one side instead of straight up once he lost his footing and slipped face forward wincing even when he made it to the top setting the boughs at the cave entrance he still had to go back down the slope this time gathering dead leaves and bits of wood that were scattered on the ground he stuffed what he could inside his wool shirt and filled his arms with large dead branches and carried them back to the cave where he made two trips inside first with the dead branches he already had in his arms then with the fir boughs he was thinking better doing what he should have done when he had first moved around in the cave as soon as he was deep in past where he had wakened he tested the floor ahead with his feet to be careful of sudden drops the farther in he went the lower the roof came and when he had to crouch bunching his ribs he quit the pain was too much this part of the cave was clammy and he hurried to pile the dead leaves on the floor and spread chips of wood on them and lit the leaves with the matches the old man with the still had given him nights before the matches had been soaked in the rain and the stream but there had been time enough for them to dry and while the first two wouldnt strike the third did going out and the fourth stayed lit setting flame to the leaves the flame spread and he patiently added more leaves more chips of wood nursing each lick of fire until they all came together in a blaze that was big enough to add larger chunks of wood and then the dead branches the wood was so old that it did not smoke much and the little smoke that did come off was tugged at by the breeze from the entrance and wafted down the tunnel he stared at the fire hands out warming them shivering and directly he looked around at the shadows on the cave walls he had been wrong it wasnt a cave he saw now years ago somebody had worked this place as a mine that much was obvious from the symmetry of the walls and the roof and the flatness of the floor there were no tools left around no rusty wheelbarrows or broken picks or rotting buckets whoever gave up this place had respected it all right and left it neat he should have closed the entrance though that was strangely careless of him by now the timber pilings and support beams were old and sagging and if children ever came in to explore they might knock against a beam or make too much noise and bring down a part of the roof on them but what would children be doing out here anyhow this was miles from where anybody lived still he had found it others could too sure and they would find it tomorrow so he had better watch his time and leave before then the quarter moon outside had been up to what he imagined was eleven oclock a few hours of rest that was all he needed he told himself sure then he could be gone the fire was warm and soothing he brought the fir boughs next to it and spread them on top of each other in imitation of a mattress stretching out on them his bad side towards the fire here and there the points of the needles stuck through his clothes and pricked him but there was nothing he could do about that he needed the boughs to keep him off the dampness of the floor in his exhaustion the boughs became soft and restful beneath him and he closed his eyes and listened to the low crackle of the burning wood down the tunnel water was dripping echoing on first sight of the mine walls he had almost expected to see drawings paintings animals with horns men clutching spears stalking them he had seen photographs of something like that but he could not remember when in high school maybe pictures of hunting had always fascinated him when he was a young boy at home in colorado he had often gone hiking by himself into the mountains and once when he had stepped cautiously into a cave rounding a corner flashing his light there had been a drawing of a buffalo just one in yellow perfectly centered on the wall it had looked so real as if it would bolt at the sight of him and run and he had watched it all afternoon until his flashlight dimmed he had gone back to that cave at least once a week after that to sit there and watch his secret his father had one night beaten him repeatedly in the face for not saying where he had been remembering rambo nodded his head at not having told it was a long time now since he had been in that cave and this place made him feel secret like in the other one buffalo highhumped squathorned staring at him so high up in the mountains away from its native plains and how long had it been there and who had drawn it and who had worked this mine and how long ago was that the cave had always reminded him of a church and this place did too but now the association embarrassed him well he had not been embarrassed when he was a child first communion confession he remembered what it had been like to push away the heavy black cloth and slip into the dark confessional his knees on the padded board the voice of the priest muffled giving absolution to the penitent in the other side of the box then the wood slide snicking back and him confessing confessing what the men he had just killed it was in selfdefense father but did you enjoy it my son was it an occasion of sin that embarrassed him more he did not believe in sin and he did not like to entertain ideas about it but the question repeated itself was it an occasion of sin and his mind drowsing with comfort from the fire he wondered what he would have said as a child probably yes the sequence of killings was very complicated he could justify to the priest that it was selfdefense to kill the dogs and the old man in green but after that when he had his opportunity to escape when instead he went after teasle and shot his deputies while they were in rout that was sin and now teasle would be coming for good he thought as he had before and now it was time for his penance down the tunnel the water was dripping hollowly down the tunnel he should have checked it at the first a mine was a natural place for a bear or snakes what was the matter that he had not checked it already he took a flaming brand from the fire and used it for a torch down the tunnel the roof came lower and lower and he hated stooping torturing his side but this needed to be done he came around a curve where the water he had heard was dripping from the roof gathering in a pool and draining through a crack in the floor and that was the end his torch sputtering to go out he came to a final wall a two foot gap in it that angled down and he decided he was safe by the time his torch did go out he was well on his way back to the fire so near he could see the shimmering reflection of the flames but now he remembered there were other things to do check outside to be certain the light from the fire could not be seen get food what else resting in this mine had seemed so simple an idea at the start but it was getting more bothersome as he went along and he was tempted to forget the whole thing and make a try at sneaking through that line of lights down there he managed as far as the entrance before he swayed so dizzily that he had to sit down this had to be it he didnt have a choice he was going to have to stay for a while just for a while the first rifle shot echoed up from somewhere down on his right three more came immediately after it was too dark and they were too far off for him to be the target another three shots echoed up and then the faint wail of a siren what the hell what was going on food thats all you need to worry about food and he knew exactly what kind a big owl he had seen take off from a tree down there when he had come out of the cave the first time it had swung off and in a couple of minutes had drifted back he had seen that happen in silhouette twice now the bird was already gone again and he was waiting for it to complete its round there was more shooting far off to the right but what for he stood and shivered and waited puzzling at least his shot would only blend with all the other shots down there it would not tell his position aiming at night was always difficult but with the luminous paint the old man with the still had put on the sights of this rifle he had a chance he waited and waited and just as the sweat on his face the chill in his spine became too much he heard the single flap of wings and looked to see the quick silhouette swoop and settle in the tree one two and he had the rifle up to his shoulder aiming at the black spot of the owl three four and he was shivering clenching his muscles to control them carack the recoil jarred his ribs and he staggered in pain against the cave entrance he was thinking that he might have missed fearing that the owl might take off and not fly back when he saw it move just a little and then it plummetted gracefully from the tree hit a branch toppled off disappeared in the dark he heard it strike rustling into fallen leaves and he slipped hurriedly down the shale toward the tree not daring to take his eyes off where he thought the bird had landed he lost his bearings couldnt find the bird only after a long search did he happen upon it at last returned to his fire in the cave he collapsed head spinning onto the boughs shivering violently he struggled to ignore his pain by concentrating on the closed talons of the owl by smoothing its ruffled feathers it was an old owl he decided and he rather liked the wizened face of it but he could not keep his hands steady enough to smooth its feathers well he still could not understand what all the shooting outside was for either the ambulance wailed past the communications truck speeding back toward town three lorries rumbling up behind it loaded with civilians some complaining loudly shouting indistinctly at the national guardsmen along the road directly after the lorries two state cruisers swept by keeping watch on them all teasle stood at the side of the road the headlights flashing by him in the dark shook his head and walked slowly over to the truck no word yet how many more were shot he asked the radioman in the back the radioman was haloed by the glare of the lightbulb dangling farther inside just now im afraid he said slowly quietly one of them one of us the civilian was hit in the kneecap but our man got it in the head oh he closed his eyes a moment the ambulance attendant says he might not live to reach the hospital might nothing he thought the way things have been going the last three days he wont make it theres no doubt he just wont make it do i know who he was no wait youd better not tell me i already have enough men dead that i knew are those drunks at least all gathered up now so they cant shoot anybody else was that the last of them in the lorries kern says he thinks so but he cant be positive which means there could still be as much as another hundred camped up there christ dont you wish there was another way to do this that it was just you and the kid again how many others are going to die before this is over he had been walking around too much he was going dizzy once more leaning against the back of the truck to hold himself up legs becoming limp his eyes felt like they would roll up into their sockets like dolls eyes he thought maybe you ought to climb back inside and rest the radioman said even when youre almost out of the light i can see you sweating your face through the bandages he nodded weakly just dont say that when kerns here hand me your coffee will you his hands were shaking as he took the coffee and swallowed it with two more pills his tongue and throat balking from the bitter taste and just then trautman returned from where he had been speaking with the shadowed forms of national guardsmen down the road he took one look at teasle and told him you ought to be in bed not until this is over well thats likely going to take a while longer than you expect this isnt korea and the choisin reservoir all over again a masstroop tactic would be fine provided you had two groups against each other if one flank got confused your enemy would be so large that you could see it coming in time to reinforce that flank but you cant do that here not against one man especially him the slightest bit of confusion along one line and hes so hard to spot he can slip through your men without a signal youve pointed out enough faults cant you offer something positive he said it stronger than he intended so that when trautman answered yes there was something new resentment hidden in that even voice i have a few details to settle on yet i dont know how you run your police department but i like to be sure before i go ahead on something teasle needed his cooperation and immediately tried to ease off sorry i guess its me who sounds wrong now dont pay attention im just not happy unless i get miserable every once in a while again it came that strange intense doubling of past and present two nights ago when orval had said itll be dark in an hour and he himself had snapped dont you think i know it and then had apologized to orval in almost the same words he had just said to trautman maybe it was the pills he didnt know what was in them but they certainly worked his dizziness leaving now his brain slowly revolving to a stop it bothered him that the periods of dizziness were coming more and more often and lasting longer though at least his heart was not speeding and missing anymore he gripped the back of the truck to climb up but he did not have the strength to raise himself here take my hand the radioman said with help then he managed to get up but too fast and he had to wait a moment before he was steady enough to go and sit on the bench shoulders at last relaxing against the wall of the truck there done nothing to do but sit rest the pleasure of fatigue and relief he sometimes had after vomiting trautman climbed up with apparently unconscious ease and stood at the back watching him and there was something that trautman had said a while ago that puzzled teasle he could not decide what it was something about then he had it how did you know i was at the choisin reservoir trautman looked in question just now teasle said you mentioned yes before i left fort bragg i called washington and had your file read to me teasle did not like that at all i had to trautman said theres no need to take that personally either as if i was interfering in your privacy i had to understand what kind of man you were in case this trouble with rambo was your fault in case you were after blood now so i could anticipate any trouble you might give me that was one of your mistakes with him you went after a man you didnt know anything about not even his name theres a rule we teach never engage with an enemy until you know him as well as yourself all right what does the choisin reservoir tell you about me for one thing now that youve told me a little of what happened up there it explains part of why you managed to get away from him theres no mystery i ran faster the memory of how he had bolted in panic leaving shingleton made him disgusted bitter thats the point trautman said you shouldnt have been able to run faster hes younger than you in better condition better trained the radioman had been sitting by the table listening to them now he turned from one to the other and said i wish i knew what you guys were talking about whats this reservoir you werent in the service trautman said sure i was in the navy two years thats why you never heard of it if you had been a marine youd know the details by heart and youd brag about them the choisin reservoir is one of the most famous marine battles of the korean war it was actually a retreat but it was as fierce as any attack and it cost the enemy thirtyseven thousand men teasle was right in the center of it enough to earn a distinguished service cross the way trautman referred to him by name made teasle feel strange as if he were not in the same place with them as if he were outside the truck listening while trautman unaware he was being overheard talked about him what i want to know trautman asked teasle was rambo aware that you were in that retreat he shrugged the citation and the medal are on my office wall he saw it if it meant anything to him oh it meant something to him all right thats what saved your life i dont see how i just lost my head when shingleton was shot and ran like a goddamn scared rat saying it made him feel better publicly confessing it out in the open nobody criticizing him for it when he wasnt near of course you lost your head and ran trautman said youve been out of that kind of action for years in your place who wouldnt have run but you see he didnt expect you to hes a professional and he naturally would think that somebody with that medal is a professional too oh a little out of practice and certainly not as good as him but still he would think of you as a professional and its my guess he went after you on that basis did you ever watch a chess match between an amateur and a pro the amateur wins more pieces because the pro is used to playing with people who have a reason and pattern for every move and here the amateur is shifting pieces all over the board not really knowing what hes up to just trying to do the best he can with the little he understands well the professional becomes so confused trying to see a nonexistent pattern and allow for it that in no time hes behind in your case you were in blind flight and rambo was behind you trying to anticipate what somebody like himself would do for protection he would have expected you to lie in wait for him to try to ambush him and that would have slowed him down until he understood but then it would have been too late the radioman had just slipped on his earphones to listen to a report that was coming through now teasle saw him staring blankly at the floor whats wrong whats happened teasle said our man who was shot in the head he just died sure teasle thought dammit sure so what are you letting it bother you for like it was something you didnt expect you were already certain he was going to die thats the trouble i was certain him and how many others before this is through god help him teasle said i cant think of another way to go after that kid except with all these men but if i could have anything in the world id want it to be just me and him again the radioman took off his earphones and stood soberly from the table we were on different shifts but i sometimes used to talk to the guy if you dont mind id like to go walk around for a while he climbed distracted down the open end of the truck to the road and paused a moment before he spoke again maybe that supply van is still parked down the road maybe ill get some doughnuts and more coffee or something he paused a moment longer then walked off disappearing into the darkness if it was just you and the kid again trautman said hed know how to come after you this time on a straight run hed kill you for sure no because i wouldnt run now up there i was afraid of him im not anymore you should be no because im learning from you dont go after a man until you understand him thats what you said well i know enough about him now that i could take him thats just stupid i hardly told you anything about him maybe some partygame psychiatrist could build up a theory about his mother dying of cancer when he was young his father being an alcoholic about when his father tried to kill him with a knife and how he ran from the house that night with a bow and arrow that he shot at the old man nearly killing him some theory about frustration and repression and all that how there wasnt enough money to eat and he had to quit high school to work in a garage it would sound logical but it wouldnt mean anything because we dont accept crazies we put him through tests and hes as wellbalanced as you or i i dont kill for a living of course not you tolerate a system that lets others do it for you and when they come back from the war you cant stand the smell of death on them at the start i didnt know he was in the war but you saw he wasnt acting normally and you didnt try very hard to find out why he was a vagrant you said what the hell else could he have been he gave up three years to enlist in a war that was supposed to help his country and the only trade he came out with is how to kill where was he supposed to get a job that needed experience like that he didnt need to enlist and he could have gone back to work in the garage he enlisted because he figured he was going to be drafted anyhow and he knew the best trained cadres that gave a man the best chance to stay alive didnt take draftees only enlisted men you say he could have gone back to the garage thats some cold comfort isnt it three years and he gets a medal of honor a nervous breakdown and a job greasing cars now you talk about fighting him onetoone yet you imply theres something diseased about a man who kills for a living christ you havent fooled me youre as military as he is and thats how this mess got started i hope you do get a onetoone fight with him itll be the last surprise of your life because hes something special these days hes an expert at his business we forced him into it over there and now hes bringing it all back home to secondguess him even once youd have to study him for years youd have to go through every course he took every fight he was in for a captain the way youre talking you dont seem to like the military very much of course i dont who in his right mind would then what are you staying in it for especially doing that job of yours teaching men to kill i dont i teach them to stay alive as long as we send men anywhere to fight the most important thing i can do is make damn sure at least some of them come back my business is saving lives not taking them you say i havent fooled you that im as military as he is i think youre wrong i do my job as fair as i know how but lets leave that for a second because you havent fooled me either you talk about coming here to help but so far thats all youve done talk about it you claim youre out to save lives but you havent done one thing yet to help prevent him from killing more people suppose something trautman said he slowly lit a cigarette from a package that was on the radio table youre right i have been holding back but suppose i did help now think about this would you really want me to help hes the best student my school ever turned out fighting against him would be like fighting against myself because i suspect he was pushed into this nobody pushed him into killing a policeman with a razor lets get that straight ill put it differently i have a conflict of interests here you have what dammit hes let me finish rambo is a lot like myself and i wouldnt be honest if i didnt admit that i sympathize with the position hes in enough so that id like to see him get away on the other hand christ hes gone wild he didnt have to chase after you once you were in retreat most of those men didnt have to die not when he had a chance to escape that was inexcusable but no matter how i feel about that i still sympathize what if without knowing it i work out a plan against him that allows him to escape you wont even if he escapes here we still have to keep hunting him and someone else is bound to be shot youve already agreed thats your responsibility as much as mine so if hes your best then dammit prove it put every obstacle against him that you can dream of then if he still breaks free youll have done everything you could and youll have double reason to be proud of him in a couple of ways you cant afford not to help trautman looked at his cigarette drew deeply on it then flipped it out of the truck sparks showering in the dark i dont see why i lit that in the first place i gave up smoking three months ago dont avoid the question teasle said are you going to help now or arent you trautman looked at the map i suppose none of what im saying matters in a few years a search like this wont even be necessary we have instruments now that can be mounted on the underside of an airplane to find a man all you have to do is fly over the spot where you think he is and the machine will register his body heat right now there arent enough of those machines to go around most of them are in the war but when we come home from there well a man on the run wont have a hope and a man like me he wont be needed this is the last of something its too bad as much as i hate war i fear the day when machines take the place of men at least now a man can still get along on his talents but youre avoiding the question yes im going to help he does have to be stopped and id rather the person who manages it be someone like myself who understands him and goes through his pain with him rambo held the owls soft pliant back clutched a fistful of feathers on the belly and pulled they made a dull tearing sound as they came away he liked the feel of the feathers in his hand he plucked the carcass bare cut off the head and the wings and the claws then pressed the point of his knife in at the bottom of the rib cage drawing the sharp edge of the blade down to between its legs he spread the flaps of the carcass reached inside for the warm wet offal and smoothly steadily drew it out getting most of the entrails in a bunch on his first try and scraping the inside with his knife to get the rest he would have gone to rinse the carcass where the water was dripping from the roof of the mine but he could not tell if the water had poisons in it and anyway rinsing the bird would just be another complication when all he wanted was to get this over eat and get out he had already wasted too much energy as it was he took a long branch that was not in the fire sharpened it and spitted the point into the owl extending it over the fire the bits of feathers and hair that were still on it sparked in the flames salt and pepper he thought since the owl was old it would be solid and tough the smell of its blood burning was acrid and the meat would probably taste like that and he wished he at least had salt and pepper so this is what he had fucking come to he thought from camping in his sleeping bag in the forest and eating hamburgers washed with coke in the dusty grass at the side of a road to this a bed of fir boughs in a mine and the carcass of an owl and not even goddamn salt and pepper not all that different from camping in the forest but living then on a minimum had been a kind of luxury because he wanted to do it now though he might be forced to live like this for a long while and it really did seem like a minimum soon he might not even have this much and he would look back on this good night when he slept for a few hours in a mine and cooked this tough old owl mexico was not even on his mind anymore only his next meal and what tree he would sleep in a day at a time a night at a time chest throbbing he raised his two shirts and looked at his ribs fascinated by how swollen and inflamed they were it was like he had a tumor in there or something growing in him he thought a few more hours sleep werent going to cure that at least he wasnt dizzy anymore time to move he built up the fire to make the bird cook faster the heat from the fire touched his forehead and the stretch of his nose or maybe it was the fever he thought he lay back flat on the fir boughs face turned sweating toward the fire the mucus in his mouth was dry and sticky and he wanted to drink from his canteen but he had already drank too much from it he needed to save some for later but whenever he parted his lips a thin web of sticky mucus clung between them finally he sipped and swirled the warm metallic water around in his mouth collecting the mucus debating whether he could afford the waste of spitting it out deciding not and swallowing thickly the voice startled him it echoed indistinctly down the tunnel sounding as if a man were outside with a loudspeaker talking to him how could they have known where he was he hurriedly checked that his pistol and knife and canteen were attached to his equipment belt grabbed his rifle and the stick in the owl and rushed toward the mouth the breeze coming down the shaft was fresh and cool just before the opening he slowed taking care that men were not out there in the night waiting for him but he could not see anyone and then he heard the voice again it was definitely from a loudspeaker from a helicopter in the dark the motor was roaring over the rise and throughout a mans voice was booming groups twelve to thirtyone assemble toward the eastern slope groups thirtytwo complete to forty spread out north far down and away the line of lights was still there waiting teasle wanted him all right he must have a small army down there but what was the loudspeaker for werent there enough field radios to coordinate the groups or is this just noise to get on my nerves he thought or to scare me to let me know how many are coming for me maybe its a trick and he doesnt have any men at all north and east maybe he just has enough for south and west rambo had heard a loudspeaker used like this by special forces in the war it generally confused the enemy and tempted them to secondguess what special forces was about to do there was a counterrule when somebody wants you to secondguess them thats when you dont try the best reaction is to go on as if you never heard it now the voice was repeating itself dimming with the helicopter over the rise but rambo didnt care about anything it said for all he cared teasle could bring men into these hills from every side it wouldnt matter where he was going they would pass right by him he glanced east the sky was gray now over there sunup in a while he eased down on the cold rocks at the entrance to the mine and tested the bird with his finger in case it was too hot to eat then he carved off a strip and chewed and it was just awful worse than he had expected stiff and dry and sour he had to force himself to bite into another piece and he had to chew and chew before he could swallow teasle did not sleep at all an hour before dawn trautman lay down on the floor and closed his eyes but teasle kept sitting on the bench his back against the wall told the radioman to switch the sound from the earphones to the speakers then listened to the position reports coming in his eyes seldom leaving the map the reports soon came in less frequently and the radioman leaned forward onto the table head on his arms and teasle was alone again every unit was where it should be in his mind he saw policemen and national guardsmen strung along the edges of fields and woodlots stamping out cigarettes loading their rifles they were in sections of fifty and each section had a man with a field radio and at six oclock the order would go down the line over the radios to move out still spread in a wide line they would sweep across fields and through woods moving in from the main points of the compass it would take days to cover this much territory and converge in the middle but eventually they would have him if one group came into tangled country that slowed them its man with the field radio would broadcast to the other groups to ease their pace and wait that would prevent one group from slowing so much that it fell behind the main line imperceptively shifting its direction until it was far to one side searching an area that had already been covered by the others there could be no gaps in the line except those which had been planned as traps a band of men lying to catch the kid in case he tried to take advantage of that open space the kid even now that teasle knew his name he couldnt get used to calling him by it the air seemed to dampen toward sunup and he pulled an army blanket over trautman on the floor then wrapped one around himself there was always something left to do some flaw in any plan he remembered that from his training in korea and trautman had said it too and he was going over the search from every angle for something he might have forgotten trautman had wanted helicopters to drop patrols on the highest peaks from where they could spot the kid if he ran ahead of the search line it had been dangerous lowering the patrols on pulleys in the dark but they had been lucky and there had been no accidents trautman had wanted the helicopters to fly back and forth out there broadcasting fake directions to confuse the kid and that was being taken care of trautman had suspected the kid would make a break south that was the direction he had used escaping in the war and there was a good chance he would try that way again so the southern line was reinforced except for the intentional weak spots that were traps teasles eyes were burning from lack of sleep but he couldnt sleep and then when he could not find any part of the plan that he had forgotten to check he began to think about other things that he did want to forget he had been putting them out of his mind but now his head starting to ache the ghosts came of their own accord orval and shingleton the friday dinners week after week at orvals place a good way to start the weekend mrs kellerman said always phoning him at the police station on thursday to find out what he wanted to eat the next day in the old days she would have been phoning today and tomorrow they would have been eating eating what no the idea of food filling his mouth was intolerable never beatrice always mrs kellerman that was what they had decided when his father had been killed and he had gone to live with them he couldnt bring himself to call her mother and aunt beatrice never sounded right so it was always mrs kellerman and orval liked that having been raised to call his own parents sir and maam with orvals name it was different orval had been around his fathers house so often that teasle had got to calling him orval and the habit was hard to break friday dinners shed be cooking and he and orval would be outside with the dogs and then theyd come in for a drink before dinner but orval had given up drinking by then so it would be just mrs kellerman and himself and orval would have tomato juice with salt and tabasco sauce thinking about it now teasles mouth salivated bitterly and he tried not to think of food thought instead of how the arguments had started and how the friday dinners had then stopped why hadnt he given in to orval was it really so important which way to holster a gun or train a dog that they had to argue about it was it that orval was afraid of getting old and had to show that he was still as able as ever maybe they were just so close that every disagreement was a betrayal and they had to argue or maybe i was so proud that i had to show him i wasnt a kid anymore teasle thought and orval couldnt bear a stepson talking to him the way he himself had never dared talk to his own father mrs kellerman was sixtyeight she had been married to orval for forty years what was she supposed to do now without him all her life was linked with his who would she cook for now who would she have to clean for and wash clothes for now me i guess teasle thought and what about shingleton and the shooting tournaments they had been in together representing the department shingleton had a wife too and three young children and what was she supposed to do get a job sell the house pay for babysitters while she worked and how am i supposed to explain to both of them about the way their husbands died he thought he should have phoned them hours ago but he couldnt bring himself to do it his paper cup had soggy cigarette butts in the coffee he lit his last one crumpling the package throat dry thinking about his panic on the bluff shingleton crying look out will hes got me and then the shot and then his bolting maybe if he had stayed he might have been able to get a shot at the kid maybe if he had somehow reached shingleton he might have found him still alive and been able to save him reliving his hysterical race from the bluff he shook with disgust youre some tough guy he told himself oh yes a lot of mouth and if you had it to do over youd do the same no he thought no id die before i ran again the bodies up on the bluff the state police had tried going after them with a helicopter but from the air all the bluffs looked alike and the police had not found the right one and finally they had been called back to help with the search had the rain halfcovered the bodies with dirt and leaves were there animals nosing around them insects crawling across their cheeks what would orval be like after his drop from the cliff galts funeral had been yesterday morning while he himself had been struggling across the field he was glad that he had not been to it he wished that he would not have to go to the funeral for all the others when at last they were found and brought back what was left of them after several days in the forest a mass funeral all the coffins in a row before the altar lids closed the whole town there looking at him and then at the coffins and then at him once more how was he supposed to explain to those people why it had to happen why he had thought it best to keep the kid moving away from town and why the kid in his bitterness had needed to defy him both of them unable to stop pushing at each other once the thing had started he looked at trautman asleep under the army blanket on the floor and realized that he was coming to see the kid from trautmans view not totally but enough to understand why the kid had done it all and even to sympathize a little sure but you didnt kill anyone when you came back from korea and you had been through almost as much as him but thinking that the kid should have been able to control himself was not going to revive orval and shingleton and the rest and his anger at the kid for shooting orval was too great to sustain for the last hours his fatigue had been overpowering it he no longer had the strength of emotion to rouse great brutal images of what he would enjoy doing to the kid he thought about it and in his daze from lack of sleep it seemed to him in a crazy way that everything had been out of control even before he and the kid had met himself and anna the kid and the war anna he was surprised that he had not remembered her in two days not since the killing had started now she seemed farther off in his mind than california and the pain of losing her was dwarfed by all that had happened since monday still though small it was pain and he did not want any more his stomach cramped he had to swallow two more pills the bitter chalk taste worse now because he was anticipating it through the open back of the truck he saw the sun barely above the horizon pale and cold troops ready along the road frost coming from their mouths the radioman was calling each group to be certain they were prepared teasle leaned over and nudged trautman on the floor to wake him its starting but trautman was already awake i know kern drove up and climbed hurriedly into the back of the truck ive been checking up and down the lines everything looks good what about national guard headquarters theyre all set to monitor whenever were ready the radioman said thats it then why are you looking at me teasle said since you started things i thought you might want to give the order to go sprawled on the spine of a high ridge rambo looked down and saw them coming first small bands roaming through the woods far off then a wellorganized methodical sweep of the land by more men than he could count they were about a mile and a half from him tiny points that were growing fast there were helicopters flying over broadcasting orders which he dismissed unable to decide if they were real or fake he guessed that teasle expected him to retreat from the line of men and pull back farther inland instead he scurried down the ridge toward the men staying low using every clump of cover at the bottom he raced toward the left one hand holding his side he would be able to stop running soon he couldnt let his pain slow him the men were only fifty minutes off maybe less but if he could get to where he was going before they did then he would have all the chance he needed to relax he labored up a wooded rise slowing in spite of himself gasping reached the top and there it was the stream he had been searching for it since he left the mine the stream where he had lain after teasle escaped into the brambles he had judged that it would be close to the mine and as soon as he had set out he had climbed to the highest place near to try and see it no luck the stream had been too low and too sheltered by trees for him to make out a glint of water or a zigzag depression in the land he had almost given up when he realized that the sign he was looking for had been there all along mist early morning fog off water so he had hurried for it and now in pain he was stumbling down through trees toward it he reached it where the water was a trickle over stones a gentle bank of grass on either side he hunted along it coming to a deep pool and here at last the banks were steep but they were stitched with grass like the ones before he moved farther on until there was another pool and steep banks these of mud a tree on his side of the pool had bare roots their soil eroded by the waters flow he could not step in the mud without leaving tracks he had to grope longlegged from the grass and leaves on the top of the bank to the roots of the tree and then he lowered himself cautiously into the stream not daring to dislodge silt from the bottom that might linger in the pool and give him away he slipped between the tree roots and the bank in where there was a hollow of sodden earth above him and then slowly meticulously he commenced burying himself spreading mud over his feet and legs scooping mud over his chest drawing the tree roots closer to him squirming burrowing deep into the muck like a crab wiping his face in it pulling it onto him until he felt the cold wet heavy weight of it all over breathing with difficulty just a twig space to take air from it was the best that he could do nothing more to try an old expression came to him as a joke you made your bed now lie in it so he did and waited they were a long while coming as much as he could tell they had been two rises away when he reached the stream and he estimated they would be fifteen minutes perhaps a little longer before they came to him but fifteen minutes seemed to go and there was no sound of them he decided that his sense of time was off that lying buried in the mud nothing to do but wait he was fooled into thinking a few minutes were a great deal more than that oppressed by the mud he had much trouble breathing now his air space wasnt enough but he couldnt afford to make it wider someone outside might see the hole and be curious moisture was beginning to condense in his nose stuffing it like phlegm his eyes were closed the mud settling firmly onto his lids still no sound of the searchers he needed something to do something to help him keep quiet and still the pressure of the mud unnerving him so he started counting off the seconds at the end of each minute expecting to hear the men sliding into another round of sixty when no sound came expecting at the end of this minute to hear them but still no sound when he had gone through to sixty for the fifteenth time he was positive that things had gone wrong the mud maybe that was it maybe the mud cut off the sound of people going by and the hunt had gone past him long ago sure and maybe not if he had not heard them they might still be coming he couldnt take the chance of digging out to look they might be just now approaching the stream held up before this by thick underbrush on one of the rises he waited moisture filling his nose as if to drown him frantic to breathe the mud was pressing harder on his face and chest and he wanted desperately to push out of it he remembered playing by a sand cliff when he was a boy digging into the sand to build a cave crawling inside then having the sudden urge to crawl out just as the whole cliff plunged down on him burying his head him crazy with fear clawing frenzied at the sand worming out from under just as more sand spilled down on him he had barely come out soon enough and that night as he tried to sleep he had been certain that in the sand cave a premonition of death occurred to him that the premonition had been what spurred him to crawl out in time now buried in the ooze and mud he was thinking that if someone walked over and stood on the ground above him a part of the bank might be dislodged plopping down and cutting off his air space he had the same instant premonition as in the sand cave he was going to be buried alive die in here already the moisture in his nose was completely clogging his breath he had to get out dear god couldnt bear the suffocation pushed at the mud and petrified hearing them the faint dull plod of footsteps a lot of them all together on top and muffled voices splashings in the stream people walking up the stream the footsteps came closer one set of them stopping then thundering close directly on top weighing on the mud on his chest his broken ribs the pain he couldnt move hadnt been breathing how long without air three minutes if he had several deep breaths first two minutes then try holding two minutes but time for him was so distorted and one minute seemed like two and he might need to breathe so much that he would squirm and shove and push out before he had to four five six seven he was counting to twenty to forty and as the sequence drew on the numbers in his head linked up with his heartbeats that were coming louder and faster and his chest was contracting crushing there the mud above him budged the pressure eased the man on top of him moved but hurry not fast enough the voices the churning in the stream mercifully diminished but too slow he couldnt dig out yet there might be stragglers there might be someone who by chance glanced back this way oh christ hurry midway through the second minute thirtyfive thirtysix thirtyseven throat contorting fortyeight fortynine he never got to sixty couldnt endure it anymore suddenly thought he was so weakheaded from the lack of air that he didnt have the strength to dig out push push dammit but the mud would not part and he struggled to raise himself to heave away the mud and then in a gathering rush sweet jesus cool air was upon him and light and he was gasping half in the stream gray turned to white in his head his chest ballooned in an ecstasy of breath then bit sharply in his ribs drawing in huge gasps of breath expelling them sucking them in violently too much noise theyll hear he quickly looked to see them none around voices and rustling in the underbrush but they were out of sight now gone now at last he was in the clear only one more hard part to go crossing the nearby roads he slumped against the bank on his own free not yet youre not theres a hell of a lot more to do before you go near those roads dammit you think i dont know that he told himself theres always something more to do always it never fucking ends then get busy in a second no now youll have all the time to rest if they catch you he breathed and nodded and grudgingly propped himself up from the side of the stream wading through the water to the exposed tree roots he slipped mud into the hole where he had been behind the roots arranging it so if another group came through here they could not tell that the first group had missed his hiding place they had to think that he was deep in the hills not close to the road next his rifle on top of the bank he eased into the deepest section of the pool and rinsed the mud off him it did not matter now that he was stirring up silt and dirt from the bottom that might linger the men who had just gone through here had completely clouded the water and if they came back or if another group came they would have no reason to think of him he dunked his head to clean away the dirt in his hair and wash his face taking a scummy mouthful and spitting it out with the grit that was in his mouth blowing his nose underwater to get rid of the mud he had sucked up it just because he was living like an animal he thought didnt mean he had to feel like one that was from training school be clean whenever you can it makes you go longer and fight better he climbed dripping out of the stream chose a thin branch off the ground and used it to clean the mud from inside the barrel of his rifle to pick dirt from the firing mechanism then he worked the lever on the rifle several times to insure that it was smooth reload the shells he had ejected and he was finally off moving cautiously through the bushes and trees toward the direction of the road he was glad that he had washed the mud off in the stream he felt better more energetic able to escape the feeling disappeared when he heard the dogs two packs of them one baying straight ahead coming his way the other to his left moving fast those forward had to be trailing the scent from where he had lost teasle on the slope of brambles wandered to this stream and headed semiconscious into the highlands eventually ending at the mine those to the left then were following the route he had taken when he chased teasle into the brambles that chase was over a day old and unless one of the men with the dogs was an expert tracker they would have no idea which scent was him running toward the brambles and which scent was him wandering away so they werent taking any chances they were setting dogs on both trails figuring that out didnt help him much he still had to get away from this pack of dogs rushing toward the stream and he certainly couldnt outrun them not with his side bursting with pain he could ambush them and shoot them all as he had done with teasles group but the sound of gunfire would reveal his position and with this many searchers in the woods they would have no trouble cutting him off so he needed a trick to fool the dogs off his trail at least he had some time to do it they would not be coming directly to this part of the stream first they would follow his scent away from the water up the hills to the mine only then down here he could try going for the road but the dogs would eventually lead in that direction and the men would radio ahead to set a trap for him he had one idea it wasnt very good but it was the best that he could come up with in a rush he backtracked through the trees to where he had buried himself at the side of the stream he quickly slid into the water wading waisthigh downstream toward the road imagining what the dogs would do they would trail him down from the mine find the path he had taken away from his hiding place into the woods follow it and sniff in confusion when his scent stopped abruptly in the undergrowth it would take everybody a long while to guess that he had doubledback along his trail returned to the stream and waded into it and when at last they did guess what he had done he would be far off maybe driving a car or truck that he would manage to steal but the police would radio their cruisers to look out for a stolen car then he would dump it after he had gone a few miles what then steal another car and dump that one leave it and run into the country only to have dogs start trailing him again as he waded down the stream thinking desperately how to escape he gradually came to understand how difficult it was going to be almost impossible teasle would keep after him teasle would never allow him to get free never allow him even to rest worried about the dogs baying nearby head down looking to avoid stones and logs submerged in the water that he might stumble over clutching his ribs he did not see the man until he was directly upon him he came around a bend in the stream and there the man was shoes and socks off sitting on the bank feet in the water the man had blue eyes he held his rifle looking suspicious he must have heard rambo coming and readied himself just in case but he evidently had not believed this would actually be rambo because when it registered on the man who rambo was his mouth opened and he sat there paralyzed as rambo lunged for him no noise there cant be any noise no shooting rambo had his knife out wrenching the mans rifle away the man scrambling to get up off the bank rambo stabbing him hard in the stomach tugging the blade up to the rib cage jesus the man said in surprise the last syllable gliding into a high whine and he was dead what somebody asked rambo jerked involuntarily he had no chance to hide didnt i tell you quit complaining about your feet the voice was saying no no come on get your shoes on before we it was a man coming up from a hollow buckling his pants and when he saw he was quicker than his friend he leapt for a rifle that was leaning against a tree and rambo tried to race there first but the guy managed to reach the gun and no no his hand was on the trigger pulling it cracking off a wild shot that ended rambos hopes the guy was fingering the trigger for another shot as rambo blew his head in you had to shoot and warn them didnt you you bastard you had to fix me dear god what am i going to do men were calling to each other off in the forest now the underbrush was alive with the sound of branches snapping men rushing the pack of dogs that was near began barking toward him there was nowhere to go nothing to do the men would be everywhere im through he was almost grateful that he had lost no more running no more pain in his chest they would take him to a doctor feed him give him a bed clean clothes sleep if they didnt shoot him here thinking he still wanted to fight then he would throw down his rifle and hold up his hands and yell that he was surrendering the idea revolted him he couldnt let himself merely stand and wait for them hed never done it before it was disgusting there had to be something more to do and then he thought again of the mine and the final rule if he was going to lose if they were going to capture him at least he could pick the place where it would happen and the place that gave him the best advantage was the mine who knew what might change maybe as he went to the mine he would see another way to escape the men were crashing closer through the underbrush not in sight yet very soon all right the mine then no time to think about it anymore and suddenly the thrill of going into action flashed through his body and he was no longer tired and he took off away from the stream deep into the woods ahead he heard them charging through the thick bushes he darted to the left staying low far to his right he saw them now running loudly toward the stream national guardsmen he saw uniformed helmeted in the night watching the chain of lights miles off he had joked badly about teasle having a small army after him but jesus christ this really was the army the guardsmen had been reporting descriptions of the country as they moved inland cliffs and swamps and hollows that the deputy sketched onto the barren map and now teasle sank tired and empty onto the bench watching him mark an x where the bodies of the two civilians had been found by the stream he felt as if he were watching from far away at last numbed by all the pills he had been swallowing he had not let on to trautman or kern but shortly after the report came in about the bodies stabbed and shot he had experienced a sharp constriction near his heart so severe that it had scared him two more killed how many did that make now fifteen eighteen he jumbled the numbers in his mind wanting to avoid a new total he must have been heading for the road when he was discovered by those two civilians trautman said he knows that we expect him near the road so hell have to turn around and go back into the hills when he thinks its safe hell try a different route to another part of the road maybe east this time then thats it kern said we have him trapped the line is between him and the high ground so he cant go that way the only direction open to him is toward the road and we have another line there waiting for him teasle had continued looking at the map now he turned no didnt you listen he said to kern the kid is probably in the high ground already the whole story is right there on the map but that doesnt make sense to me how is he going to make it up through the line easily trautman said when those guardsmen heard the shots behind them a group broke from the main line to go back and investigate when they did they left a hole more than big enough for him to slip through and up into the hills like you they all expect him to keep moving away from the line anyhow so they wouldnt have been alert to sight him when he came near and slipped through you had better tell them to continue into the hills before he gains more distance teasle had been a long while expecting this from kern now it came i dont know kern said its getting too complicated i dont know what i had better do suppose he didnt think like that suppose he didnt realize there was a break in the line and just stayed where he was between the line and the road then if i order those men farther inland ill ruin the trap trautman lifted his hands suppose whatever the hell you want its no matter to me i dont like helping in the first place all the same i am but that doesnt mean i have to explain over and over what i think should be done and then goddamn beg you to do it wait dont misunderstand im not questioning your judgment its only that in his position he might not do whats logical he might feel closed in and run in a circle the way a flushed rabbit does for the first time the pride in trautmans voice was completely open he wont but if he does if he just possibly does youre not the one who answers for sending the men in the wrong direction i do i have to look at this thing from every angle after all were just talking theory here we have no evidence to go on then let me give the order teasle said and the truck seemed to drop three feet jolting as a new more serious constriction seized his chest he struggled to go on talking braced his body if the orders wrong ill gladly answer for it he stiffened holding his breath christ are you all right trautman said youd better lie down quick he gestured to keep trautman away abruptly the radioman said a report is coming through and teasle fought to ignore the racking misbeats of his heart and listen lie down trautman told him or ill have to make you leave me alone listen this is national guard leader thirtyfive i dont figure this there must be so many of us that the dogs have lost their sense of smell they want us to go up into the hills instead of toward the road no they havent lost their sense of smell teasle said clutching himself voice strung out with pain to kern but weve lost a hell of a lot of distance on him while you tried to make up your mind do you think now you can bring yourself to give that order as rambo started up the slope of shale toward the mine a bullet whacked into the rocks a few yards to his left the rifle report echoing through the forest back there staring at the mine entrance he hurried stumbling up the slope into the tunnel shielding his face from chips of stone that two more bullets blasted off the right side of the opening far down the tunnel out of reach of more bullets he stopped exhausted slumping against a wall gasping he had not been able to maintain his distance from them his ribs now the guardsmen were barely a half mile behind him coming fast so taken up in the hunt that they were shooting before they had a clear target weekend soldiers trained for this but not experienced so they did not have the discipline and in the excitement might do anything rush in stupidly spray bullets down the shaft he was right to have come here if he had tried giving up at the stream they would have been too quick would have shot him he needed a buffer between himself and them so they would not shoot before he explained he returned up the dark tunnel toward the light at the mouth studying the roof when he found where it was dangerously cracked he pushed away the support beams lurching back before the ceiling could cave in on him he was not worried by the risk if the collapse was so great that it buried the entrance and blocked off his air he knew that they would dig him out before he died but when he pushed away the beams nothing happened and he had to try the next beams ten feet farther down and this time when he pushed the roof did collapse barely missing him with a crash and rumble of falling rock that made his ears ring the passage was filled with dust and he was choking standing back coughing waiting for the dust to settle so he could see how much rock had fallen a faint beam of light was radiating through the dust and then the dust was clouding to the floor and there was a foot of space between the barrier of rocks and the nearly demolished roof more rocks dislodged and the space dwindled to six inches the reduced breeze that was coming through wafted some of the dust down the tunnel it became colder he slid down the wall to the damp floor listening to the roof crack and settle and very soon he heard the dim voices out there do you think it killed him how would you like to crawl in and find out me some of them laughed then and rambo smiled a cave or a mine another man said his voice was loud and deliberate and rambo guessed that he was talking into a field radio we saw him run inside and then the place dumped in on him you should have seen the dust we have him for sure wait a minute hold it a second and then as if to someone outside get your dumb ass away from the entrance if hes still alive he might be able to see to shoot at you rambo inched up the rockfall his knees pressing hard on the blunt tips of stone to peer through the space at the top there were the sides of the entrance which framed the shale slope and the bare trees and the sky outside and then a soldier ran into view from the left to the right his canteen thumping on and off his hip as he ran hey didnt you just hear me say to keep clear of the entrance the one man said outofview on the right over there i cant hear what youre saying on the radio well christ he might as well get this finished i want teasle he called through the small opening i want to give myself up what did you guys hear that bring teasle i want to give myself up his words rumbled in the tunnel he listened carefully to the ceiling in case it might crack and drop onto him in there its him hold on hes alive in there the man said into the radio hes talking to us there was a pause and then the man spoke much closer to the entrance though still out of sight what do you want in there im tired of saying it i want teasle out here and i want to give myself up they were whispering now then the man was talking into the radio repeating the message and rambo wished they would hurry and get this over he had not believed that surrendering would make him feel this empty now that the fight was over he was positive that he had exaggerated his fatigue and the pain in his ribs surely he could have gone on longer he had in the war then he shifted position and his ribs bit and he had not exaggerated hey in there the man called outofsight can you hear me teasle says he cant come up dammit this is what hes been waiting for isnt it you tell him to get the hell up here i dont know anything about it all they said was he cant come you just told me it was teasle now its they have you been talking with teasle or havent you i want him up here i want his guarantee that nobody shoots me by mistake dont you worry if one of us shoots you it wont be by mistake you come out of there careful and we wont have any mistakes he thought about it all right but i need help pushing away these rocks i cant do that all by myself he heard them whispering again and then the man said your rifle and knife throw them out ill even throw out my handgun i have a revolver that you dont know about now im being honest with you im not stupid enough to try fighting my way past all of you so tell your men to keep their hands free of their triggers when i hear you throw that stuff out coming he hated to shove them through he hated the feeling of helplessness he would have without them peering through the space at the top of the rockfall looking at the bare forest and sky out there he liked the cool breeze on his face as it came in and down the tunnel i dont hear that stuff yet the man said out of view we have tear gas so and that sonofabitch wouldnt bother himself to come up he was pushing the rifle through he was just ready to let go of it when he understood the breeze the breeze down the tunnel this strong it had to be going somewhere it was blowing down to the fissure at the end and from there it was being sucked away sucked out another passage in the hill another way out that was the only explanation otherwise the breeze couldnt move and circulate adrenalin scalded into his stomach he had not lost yet wheres the guns i said the man outside told him up your ass rambo thought he slipped the rifle back in and heart pounding excitedly he hurried down the darkness of the tunnel the coals of his fire were dead and shortly he had to grope to find where he had camped he grabbed the fir boughs and the unburned sticks of wood and carried them down the remainder of the tunnel until head stooped against the low ceiling he heard the water dripping and bumped into the final wall a new fire to guide him as far as it could smoke from the fir boughs to help him spot the direction of the breeze after that christ maybe the pain came again and teasle bent forward on the bench squinting at a dark oil stain in the wood floor he knew he could not keep going much longer he needed sleep oh how he needed it something from a doctor there was no telling how much he had strained and damaged himself thank god this was almost over a little while he told himself thats all just hold on a little while more and hell be caught he waited until trautman and kern were looking somewhere else and then fumbled to swallow two more pills that box of them was full last night trautman said and surprised him you shouldnt be taking so many no i upset it and lost some when was that i didnt see when you were asleep before dawn you couldnt have lost that many you shouldnt be taking them so much not with all the coffee im fine its a cramp will you go to a doctor no not yet then im calling a doctor out here not until hes caught now kern was walking over why wouldnt they leave him be but he is caught kern said no hes just cornered its not the same he might as well be caught its a question of time is all whats so damn important about sitting there in needless pain until they actually put their hands on him i cant say it right you wouldnt understand then call a doctor trautman told the radioman get a car to take him back to town i wont go i said i promised who what do you mean i promised id see this to the last who them you mean your posse this man orval and the rest who died he didnt want to talk about it yes trautman looked at kern and shook his head i told you that you wouldnt understand teasle said he turned to the open back of the truck and the sun coming in was sharp on his eyes then he was afraid and it was dark and he was flat on his back on the floor he remembered the boards rumbling when he hit im warning you dont call a doctor he said slowly unable to move im just down here resting the blaze lit the fissure smoke wafting down it from the breeze for a moment rambo hesitated then slid his rifle between his belt and his pants handled a torch and squeezed between the two walls the strip of rock under his shoes wet and slippery tilting down he pressed his back against one wall so that his ribs would not scrape much against the other wall and the farther in and down he went the lower the top of the fissure came and then the orange reflection of his torch glistening on the wet rock showed him where the roof and the walls tapered into a hole directly down he held his torch over the hole but the flames radiated only part of the way and all he could see was a widening funnel down in the rock he took out a rifle cartridge and dropped it counting to three before it struck bottom the echo of a faint metallic ring three seconds wasnt deep so he eased one leg into the hole and then the other leg and slowly squirmed himself down when he was in as far as his chest his ribs wedged and he could not go down more without great pain he stared at the fire up at the entrance to the fissure smoke enshrouding it irritating his nostrils and there were noises off in the mine another rockfall he thought no voices shouts that merged and rumbled down to him already they were coming he drew in his chest sweating forcing his ribs into the hole closed his eyes pushed and then he was through the spasm in his chest nearly made him drop he could not let himself he had no idea what was below him his head still above the hole he persisted in supporting himself by his arms and elbows on the rim while he shifted his feet down there to find a ledge or a crack the funnel was slippery and smooth and he let himself down a little more but still there was no place to rest his feet the weight of his body stretched his chest ribs cutting he heard the men shouting indistinctly in the mine and eyes watering from the smoke of his fire he was about to release his grip and drop the rest of the way anyhow hoping there were no rocks down there to break him when his feet touched something slender and round that felt like wood the upper rung of a ladder from the mine he thought it must be the guy who worked the mine must have explored here he lowered himself gingerly onto the rung it bent but held he stepped gently onto the second rung it split and he snapped through two more rungs before he stopped the sound of his fall drummed through the chamber startling him when it faded he listened for the shouts of the men but he could not hear them now his head below the rim of the hole then as he relaxed the rung that held him bent and fearing that he would crash through to the bottom he quickly waved his torch to see what was below four other rungs and then a rounded floor when it rains he thought water from outside must drain down here thats why the smooth worn rock he touched bottom trembling looked followed the one exit a wider fissure that sloped down as well an old pick was leaning against one wall its iron rusty its wood dirty and warped from the damp in the flickering torchlight the handle of the pick cast a shadow onto the wall he could not understand why the miner had left tools here but not in the upper tunnel he came around a curve water plunking somewhere and found him what was left of him in the shimmer of the orange light the skeleton was as repulsive as the first mutilated soldier he had ever seen his mouth tasted of copper coins as he stood away from the skeleton for a moment and then took a few steps toward it the bones were tinted orange by his light but he was certain that their real color was gray like the silt that had gathered around them and they were perfectly arranged not a bone was out of place or broken no sign at all of why he had died it was as if he had lain down to sleep and never wakened perhaps a heart attack or poison gas rambo sniffed apprehensively but he smelled nothing except dank water his head was not off balance or his stomach queasy or any of the other symptoms of gas poisoning so what in hell could have killed this man he shivered again and hated the sight of this perfect set of bones and hurriedly stepped over them eager to get away he went farther down and the fissure became two which direction the smoke had been a bad idea by now it had dispersed so he could not see which way it was drifting and it had dulled his sense of smell so he could not even detect its path with that his torch was burning low in the damp air flickering sporadically in no particular direction what was left to him was a kids game moistening his finger in his mouth holding it at one opening then the other he felt the breeze slightly cool on the wet of his finger going to the right and uncertainly he followed down sometimes forced to squeeze through occasionally stooping his torch was burning lower in the damp air all the time he came to another set of openings and wished that he had rope or string to lay out behind him so that if he became lost he would be able to find his direction back sure and wouldnt you like a flashlight too and a compass why dont you go on over to the hardware store and buy them why dont you forget the jokes the breeze seemed to the right again and as he moved along the passage grew more complicated more twists and turns more offshoots soon he could not remember how he had come to where he was the skeleton seemed a long confusing distance behind him it was strangely funny to him that the moment he considered turning around and retracing his steps he realized he was lost and could not do that he did not actually want to return yet he was just considering it but all the same he would have preferred the option of being able to go back if the breeze suddenly ended it was extremely faint even so and he wondered if he had missed some crack in the rock where it seeped out of the hill god he could wander here until he died end up like those bones the murmur saved him from panic and he thought it was them coming but how could they find him in this maze and then he recognized the distant sound of water rushing before he knew he had increased speed toward it at last a perceptible goal in mind shouldering against walls staring into the darkness beyond his light then the sound was gone and he was alone again he slowed and stopped leaning against a wall hopeless there had been no sound of rushing water he had imagined it but it had seemed so real he could not believe that his imagination could trick him so completely then what had happened to the sound if it was so real where was it a hidden turn he realized in his haste to reach the sound he had failed to check for other entrances in the rock go back look and as he did he heard it once more and found the opening on the blind side of a curve and slipped into it the sound louder as he went it was deafening now the flames of his torch diminishing to go out he arrived where the fissure came onto a ledge and below him far down a stream was swirling through a hole in the rock roaring down into a channel and away under a shelf here this had to be where the breeze was going but it wasnt the water foamed up over the shelf and there was no space for air to be sucked through but still he felt the breeze strong here there had to be another exit close by his torch hissed and he glanced around frantic to memorize the shape of the ledge and then he was in darkness a darkness that was more complete and solid than any he had ever stood in made overpowering by the cascade of water below into which he might easily fall if he did not grope his way with care he tensed waiting to get used to the dark he never did get used to it he began to lose his balance swaying and at last he went down on his hands and knees crawling toward a low passage at the end of the ledge that he had seen just before his light sputtered out to go through the hole he had to slip flat on his belly the rock there was jagged it tore his clothes and scraped his skin and twisted his ribs until he repeatedly groaned then he screamed as well from something more than his ribs because as he came blind through the hole into a chamber where he had room to lift his head he reached out his hand to claw himself forward and fingered mush a drop of wet muck plopped onto his neck and something bit his thumb and something tiny darted up his arm he was lying in thick scum that was soaking through his two ripped shirts streaking his belly he heard squeaking above him and the cardboard ruffle of wings and jesus christ it was bats he was lying in their shit and what were by now a halfdozen tickly things scurrying over his hands nibbling they were beetles the scavengers that feasted off bat dung and sick bats fallen to the floor they could strip a carcass clean and they were piercing the flesh of his arms as he wriggled insanely backward through the hole jesus christ swatting them off his hands and arms bumping his head wrenching his side jesus rabies a third of any bat colony was rabid if they woke and sensed him they might attack and cover him biting while he screamed stop it he told himself youll bring them to you stop screaming already wings were flapping christ he couldnt help it screaming wriggling back and then he was out on the ledge sweeping his hands and arms rubbing making sure and doublesure they all were off still feeling their manylegged tickles on his skin they might follow he suddenly thought scurrying back from the low entrance to the hole disoriented in the dark one leg toppling off the ledge dangling the fright of his near fall jolted him he lurched in the opposite direction and bumped against a wall of rock and shook hysterically wiping the mushy dung off his hands onto the rock pawing at the slime on his shirt to get the stuff off his shirt something was in there scratching on his skin he shoved in a hand grabbing it snapping its brittle back so he felt its soft wet insides on his fingers as he threw it violently toward the sound of the cascade bats a pest hole disease the putrid smell of the dung stinging his nose and throat thats how the guy who worked the mine had died rabies he had been bitten unknowingly and days later the disease came driving him out of his mind he wandered crazily through the forest into the tunnel out of the tunnel in once more and down into the fissure in and around until he crumpled and died the poor bastard he must have thought it was the loneliness that was getting to him at the start anyhow and when he became delirious he was too far gone to help himself or maybe toward the end he knew he couldnt be helped and went down into the fissure where he could die without being a danger to anyone maybe nothing what in hell do you know about it if he had rabies then he would have hated water even the smell of it the idea of it so he would never have gone down into the dampness of the fissure youre just imagining that itll be you who dies that way if they dont eat you first what are you talking about the bats cant eat you not the kind around here no but the beetles he was still shaking struggling to calm himself the breeze had been strong in the chamber but he could not go that way and he did not know how to return to the upper tunnel he had to face it this was it he was stuck except that he could not let himself believe that he was stuck he had to fight panic and pretend there was a way out he had to sit against the wall of rock and try to relax and maybe if he thought long enough he might actually discover an escape but there was only one escape and he knew it toward the breeze into the bats den he licked his lips and took a sip of ironpipe tasting water from his canteen you know you have to go in there with the bats dont you he told himself its either that or sit here and starve and get sick from the damp and die or kill yourself you were trained to do that too if things became too much but you know you wont even if youre passing out and youre positive youre going to die theres always the chance theyll search these fissures until they stumble into here and find you unconscious but they wont you know you have to follow the breeze into there with the bats dont you you know that then go on get started get it over with he told himself but instead he sat in the dark on the ledge listening to the roar of the water below him he knew what the sound was doing to him its monotonous rush dulling his ears little by little pressing him to sleep he shook his head to keep awake and decided to go in with the bats while he still had the energy but he could not move the water rushed on dinning and when he woke he was by the side of the ledge again one arm dangling but he was groggy from the sleep and this time the danger of falling off did not disturb him as much he was too tired to care it was so luxurious resting stretched out arm over the edge emptily lulled by the sleep his body had no sensation his ribs did not even bother him anymore numb youll die here he thought if you dont soon move the darkness and the noise will leave you too weak and stupid for anything i cant move ive come too far i need to rest you went farther longer in the war yes and thats what finished me for this all right then die i dont want to die i just dont have the strength god damn it go on he said out loud and in the waters roar his words were flat and echoless do it quick just get in there quick and charge right through where they are and the worst will be done goddamn right he said waited then repeated himself but if theres anything worse beyond this i wont be able to stand it he thought no this is the worst there cant be anything beyond this i believe it slowly reluctantly he crawled in the black toward the entrance to the chamber he paused gathered strength and squeezed his body in pretend its tapioca pudding that youll touch he told himself mustering a smile at the joke but when his hand reached out and grasped the muck grasped something scabby in the muck the hand shot back reflexively he breathed in the sulfurous stench of dung and decay the gas would be poisonous once he was fully in he would have to hurry well heres batshit in your eye he told himself pretending another joke hung back a moment then charged into the slime scrambling to his feet already he was dizzy and nauseous from the gas the muck rose up to his knees and things rattled against his pantlegs as he wallowed through the breeze went straight ahead no he was wrong again the breeze came from straight ahead this was a different air current the one he had been following must have blown out a different way he was wrong about something else too no matter how much he wanted to hurry he remembered that he should not there might be drops in the floor he had to test each part of the floor ahead of him with his feet and with each shuffle forward he expected not to touch more muck and crud but open space the sound in the chamber was changed before there had been squeaks and the ruffle of wings but now he heard nothing except the liquid slush of his legs through the deep mire and the dim cascade of water droning on the other side of the entrance the bats must have gone he must have slept longer than he knew until it was night and the bats had gone to hunt and feed he slogged forward toward the breeze sick from the stench but at least they were gone and he relaxed a little a drop of rotten goo pelted his nose he whipped it off and the hair on his neck prickled as the cavern exploded in a thousand bursts of wind and wings from being on the ledge so long the roar of water must have partially deafened him the bats were here all the time squeaking and settling as before but his ears had been too dulled to hear them and now the bats were everywhere swishing past him his hands covering his head while he shrieked they bumped against him leathery wings flapping on his face their highpitched screeches at his ears he hit them away flailed his arms in the air then covered his head then flailed again he wallowed forward desperate to get out stumbled slid to his knees cold slime up to his hips now soaking onto his genitals the bats came and came an endless swarm of them tumbling churning he reeled to his feet hands up swatting sightless the air was infested with them he could not breathe he hit out crouched shielding himself they were swirling at him from the right tapping him flipping through his hair he turned his back crouched lower his skin creeping jesus jesus he shifted to the left slipped again and fell cheekbone cracking against a wall his mind was white inside from the pain of striking and he barely had the will to straighten swayed clutched his swollen cheek as the bats continued swarming at him past him forcing him along the wall desperate beaten and halfsenseless he felt something inside expand and strain and at last rupture nothing to do with his body just the center of whatever it was that had kept him going this far but it was everything he ceased his fight with them gave himself up to them let them push him along staggered with them arms slowly sinking to his side and in that wonderful release from fear and desperation utterly hopeless and passive never before so free from caring what happened to him he came to understand what they were about they were not attacking him they were flying to get out he could not control his laughter trembling with relief it had to be night outside they had sensed it the leader had given his signal and as one they had flushed off the cave roof toward the exit while he was in here with them terrified that they were coming after him you wanted a string so you could find your way he told himself you blind stupid asshole youve got it youve been fighting them and here every second theyve been showing you the way he climbed sharp ridges with them felt for drops pawed before him soon their squeaks and brush of wings became expected and familiar as if he and they had been meant to live in company until they outdistanced him a few stragglers fluttering past and then he was alone the only sounds the echoing scrabble of his hands and shoes on rock the sweet cool breeze was blowing strongly on his face and leaning his face toward it thinking of how the bats had helped him to this direction out he began to feel a strange affection for them missing them now that they were gone as if a bond had been broken between himself and them he enjoyed breathing clearing his nostrils and throat and lungs erasing the taste of dung in his mouth the touch of his hands on the rough rock was a clear unfiltered sensation for the first time consciously real and his heart beat fast when he climbed and touched dirt fingering it wonderfully pebbled and gritty he was not outside yet this was silt that rain had washed into a crack in the hill but he was close he sensed and he climbed steadily upward in no hurry loving the grainy feel of the silt crawling up a beautiful hillside of it when he sprawled at the top he smelled the outside savoring it crisp leaves wind through long grass woodsmoke in the air just a few more feet he reached carefully forward his hand stopped by a barrier of rock he fingered around and the barrier was on all three sides before him a basin how high it might rise up forever him so close to being free outside yet trapped as much as he was easy and content within himself he did not think he had the corresponding strength to climb high then forget about the climb he told himself dont worry about it either youll make it or you wont nothing you can do if the basin is high forget about it all right he thought stayed seated in the comfortable soft dirt and rested accustoming himself to the change in him he had never been so aware of things before so with them it was true that in the past in moments of action he had felt a little like this he would be performing each gesture smoothly and properly running pivoting to aim a gentle squeeze on the trigger the recoil filling his body solidly his life depending on his grace and he would be absorbed in himself his mind gone just his body there in that instant totally in tune with its operation the native allies in the war had called it the way of zen the journey to arrive at the pure and frozen moment achieved only after long arduous training and concentration and determination to be perfect a part of movement when movement itself ceased their words had no exact english translation and they said that even if there were the moment could not be explained the emotion was timeless could not be described in time could be compared to orgasm but not so defined because it had no physical center was bodily everywhere but this what he felt now was different there was no movement involved and the emotion was not isolated in one eternal second it was every second sitting there in the soft dirt back conforming restfully with the rock he sorted through words in his mind and finally decided on good he had never felt so good he wondered if he had gone crazy the fumes must have affected him more than he knew and this was just quiet giddiness or maybe having given himself up for dead he was just overwhelmingly glad to be alive having gone through that hell maybe he had to find everything else full of pleasure but you wont feel it much more if you let them come across you here he told himself and he stood in the dark testing the emptiness above him so as not to bump his head against a shelf even then he spiked his head jerked down and realized that what he had struck was the end of a branch it was a bush up there and when he put out his hands he touched the rim of the basin waist high out he had been out all this while the night sky clouded fooling him that he was yet underground careful of his ribs he drew himself up under the bush and gulped air tasting its freshness smelling the woody bark of the bush down from him quite a distance there was a small fire in the trees after the total darkness of the caves the fire was bright and rich and alive he tensed someone had spoken muffled down near the fire someone else moved in the rocks nearby and there was a vivid scratching sound that he saw now was a match being struck on its folders abrasive paper then the flare of the match went out and he saw the gentle glow of a cigarette so they were out here waiting for him teasle had guessed why he went down into the fissures and caves teasle had deployed men around the hill in case he found an exit well they could not see much in the dark and after being underground he was at home in the dark and as soon as he had rested more he would slip down past them it would be easy now they would be thinking he was still in the caves and he would be miles off on his road no one had better get in his way christ no he would do anything what he had come to feel he would do anything to anyone to keep it was dark again and teasle did not understand how he had come to be in the murk of the forest trautman kern the truck where were they all what had happened to the day why was he stumbling so urgently through the solid shadows of the trees he leaned breathless against the black trunk of a tree the pain in his chest rousing from its numbness he was so disoriented that he was afraid not directionless he knew he had to keep moving straight ahead he had to go somewhere ahead but he did not understand why how trautman he remembered this trautman had wanted to take him to a doctor he remembered lying on his back on the wood floor of the truck he grasped for an explanation of how he had come from there to here had he struggled with trautman not to go to the doctor maybe he had broken loose had grappled from the truck across the field into the woods anything not to give up his vigil before it was time to get closer to the kid help catch him but that was not right he knew it was not right in his condition he could not have fought off trautman he could not think he had to hurry forward in spite of his chest and the terrible sense that someone was after him or would soon be after him the kid was it the kid who was after him the cloud cover melted the quartermoon shone through lighting the trees and all around him were the hulks of relic cars piled atop each other stacked against the trees hundreds of them broken amputated and decayed it was like a graveyard grotesque moonlight on the oval outlines reflecting and soundless even when he moved through leaves and crumpled fenders and broken glass he made no noise he was gliding and somehow he knew it was not the kid who was after him but someone else but why was he afraid at the sight of the road through the ghostly carcasses why was he afraid of the row of guardsmen trucks parked along the road christ what was happening to him had he lost his mind no people there nobody near the trucks fear draining a police car empty the last in the line nearest town ecstatic now creeping from the derelicts doorless seats ripped hoods raised into the field silent close to the earth toward the car a sudden noise disturbed him fracturing glass that split finely in his eardrums and he blinked he was on his back once more had somebody shot him in the field he felt his body for the wound felt a blanket no earth beneath him soft cushions a coffin he started in a panic understood a couch but christ where what was going on he fumbled for a light knocked a lamp and switching it blinked discovering his office but what about the forest the wrecks of cars the road christ they had been real he knew he looked at his watch but it was gone glanced at the clock on his desk quarter to twelve dark outside through the venetian blinds the twelve must be midnight but the last he remembered was noon what about the kid whats happened he faltered to sit up clutching his head to keep it from throbbing apart but something had raised the floor of his office tilting it high away from him he cursed but no words came from his mouth he wavered uphill to the door grabbed the knob with both hands and swung it but the door was stuck and he had to tug with all his might the door jolting open almost reeling him downhill to the couch he threw out his arms steadying himself like a tightrope walker his bare feet off the soft rug of his office onto the cold tile of the corridor it was in gloom but the front office was lit halfway there he had to put a hand against a wall awake chief a voice said down the corridor you o k it was too complicated to answer he was still catching up to himself on his back on the bright floor of the truck blearing up at the greasy tarpaulin that was the roof the voice from the radio my god he isnt answering hes run deep into the mine the fight with trautman to keep from being carried to the cruiser but what about the forest the dark i said are you o k chief the voice said louder footsteps coming down the hall there was an echo enveloping the kid he managed to say the kids in the forest what the voice was directly next to him and he looked you shouldnt be walking around relax you and the kid arent in the forest anymore hes not after you it was a deputy and teasle was sure he ought to know him but he could not recall he tried a word came to him harris yes that was it harris harris he said proudly youd better come up front sit and have some coffee i just was making fresh broke a jug carrying water from the washroom hope that didnt wake you the washroom yes harris was echoing and the imagined taste of coffee squirted sourly into teasles mouth gagging him the washroom he staggered through the swinging door sick in the urinal harris holding him telling him sit down here on the floor but it was all right the echoing had stopped now no my face water and as he splashed his cheeks and eyes coldly the image flashed in him again no longer a dream real the kid he said the kids in the forest by the road in that junkyard of cars youd better take it easy try and remember the kid was trapped in a mine and he ran deep into a maze of tunnels here let me have your arm he waved him off arms down supporting himself on the sink face dripping im telling you the kid isnt in there now but you cant know that how did i get here wheres trautman back at the truck he sent men with you to the hospital that sonofabitch i warned him not to how did i get here instead of the hospital you dont remember that either christ you gave them a hell of a time you yelled and fought in the cruiser and kept grabbing the wheel to stop them from turning toward the hospital you were shouting that if they were going to take you anyplace they were going to take you here nobody was going to strap you into any bed if you could help it so finally they got afraid they would hurt you if they fought with you anymore and did what you said tell you the truth i think they were just as glad to be rid of you the racket you were making and all once when you grabbed the wheel you almost hit a transport truck they had you in bed here and as soon as they left you went out and got in a patrol car to drive yourself back and i tried to stop you but it was no problem you passed out behind the wheel before you could find the ignition switch you really dont remember any of it there was a doctor came over right away and he checked you over said you were in halfdecent shape except you were exhausted and youd been taking too many pills theyre some kind of stimulant and sedative all in one and youd swallowed so many you were flying doctor said he was surprised you didnt crash even harder and sooner than you did teasle had the sink full of cold water dunking his face in it swabbing himself with a paper towel wheres my shoes and socks where did you put them what for never mind what for just where did you put them youre not planning to try and go back there again are you why dont you sit down and relax theres all sorts of men swarming through those caves nothing more you can do they said not to worry theyd call here the minute they found a sign of him i just told you hes not where the hell are my shoes and socks i asked you far off in the front room the phone started ringing faintly harris looked relieved to get away and answer it he swung out through the door of the washroom and the phone rang again then again then abruptly stopped teasle rinsed his mouth with cold water and spat it out milky he did not dare swallow it in case it would make him sick again he peered at the dirty checkered tiles on the washroom floor thought incongruously that the janitors werent doing their job and swung through the door out into the corridor harris was standing up at the end of the hall his body blocking off part of the light uncomfortable about speaking well teasle said i dont know if i should tell you this its for you about the kid teasle said and brightened about that junkyard of cars no well what is it then whats the matter its long distance your wife he did not know if it was fatigue or shock but he had to lean against the wall like hearing from somebody buried with everything that had happened because of the kid he had gradually so managed to keep her out of his mind that now he could not remember her face he tried but he could not dear god why did he want to remember did he still want the pain if shes going to upset you more harris said maybe you shouldnt talk to her i can say youre not around anna no plug it through to my office phone youre sure now i can easily tell her that youre out go on plug it through he sat in the swivel chair behind his desk and lit a cigarette either the cigarette would clear his head or else it would cloud his head and spin him but it was worth a try because he could not talk to her as unsteady as he was he waited and felt better and picked up the phone hello he said quietly anna will yes her voice was thicker than he recalled throaty a little broken in some of the words will are you hurt ive been worried no its true believe it or not i have been worried he drew slowly on his cigarette there they went again misunderstanding what i meant is no im not hurt thank god she paused then exhaled steadily as if she had a cigarette too i havent been watching tv or reading newspapers or anything and then suddenly tonight i learned what was happening to you and i got scared are you sure youre all right yes he thought about describing it all but it would only sound like he wanted sympathy honestly i would have called earlier if id only found out i didnt want you to think i dont care what happens to you i know he looked at the rumpled blanket on the couch there were so many important things to say but he could not bring himself to do it they did not matter to him anymore the pause was too long he had to say something do you have a cold you sound like you have a cold im getting over one orvals dead he heard her stop breathing oh i liked him i know it turns out i liked him even more than i knew and shingletons dead and so is that new man galt and please dont tell me anymore i cant let myself know anymore he thought about it longer and there really was not much to say after all the quality of her voice did not make him long for her the way he feared it might have and at last he felt free at the end of it are you still in california she did not answer i guess thats none of my business he said its o k i dont mind yes im still in california any troubles do you need any money will what dont i didnt call for that yes but do you need any money i cant take your money you dont understand i i think its going to be all right now i mean i feel a lot better about everything now im glad ive been worrying about that too its not as if i want to hurt you but what i mean is i feel a lot better and you can take some money if you need it without the idea that im trying to make you beholden and have you come back no well at least let me pay for this call let me accept the charges i cant then let me put it on the office bill it wont be me paying itll be the town for christ sake let me do something for you i cant please stop it dont make me regret calling i was afraid this would happen and i almost didnt he felt the telephone sweaty in his palm youre not coming back are you this is all wrong i didnt want to go into this its not why i called but you wont be coming back yes im not coming back im sorry all he wanted was to hold her not do anything but hold her slowly he crushed out his cigarette lit another one what time is it there nine im still confused about the time zone shift i slept fourteen hours when i got here getting used to the different time for them it was eleven oclock and for me it was already two hours after midnight what is it midnight now where you are yes i have to go will so soon why then he caught himself no never mind thats none of my business either are you positive youre not hurt theyve bandaged me up but its mostly scratches are you still living with your sister can you at least tell me that much i moved out into an apartment why i really have to go im sorry keep me in touch with what youre doing if itll help you i didnt know it would be this hard i dont know how to say this she sounded like she was sobbing goodbye goodbye he waited trying to be with her as long as possible then she broke the connection and the dial tone was buzzing and he sat there they had slept together four years how could she make herself a stranger not easily her sobbing she was right this was hard for her too and he was sorry its over do something move get your mind on the kid where it belongs the kid behind the wheel of a car driving fast he saw his shoes and socks by the file cabinet and hurriedly put them on he took a browning pistol from his gun case slipped a full bullet clip into the handle and strapped on a holster slanting it backward he noticed the way orval always had told him to as he came down the hall through the front room toward the door harris looked at him dont say it he told harris dont say i shouldnt go back out there fine then i wont outside the street lights were on and he breathed the fresh night air a cruiser was parked at the side he was just getting in when he glanced to the left and saw the side of town light up flames reflecting in waves across the night clouds harris was shouting on the front steps the kid he got out of the caves they just called that he stole a police car i know that but how the force of the explosions rattled the windows in the police station whump whump whump a string of them from the direction of the main road into town whump whump christ almighty whats that harris said but teasle already knew and he was ramming the car into gear racing it out of the parking lot to get there in time roaring deeper into town swerving to pass a motorcyclist who was stopped looking back astonished rambo saw in his rearview mirror the street behind him flooded with fire leaping high into the trees that bordered it the fierce red flames radiated into the cruiser he pressed the accelerator to the floor whipping down the main street explosions flaring in the night behind him bursting the pattern of the fire now they would have to waste time going around just in case he needed to do it again the more diversions the more they would be confused they would have to put off chasing him and stop to control the fire one of the street lights ahead was burned out under it the brakelights of a car flashed on its driver opening his door to stare back at the flames rambo sheered into the left lane bearing down fast on the low headlights of a sports car it swung into the right lane to avoid him just as he swung into his own lane too and he continued sweeping toward it until it leapt up onto the sidewalk snapped off a parking meter and crashed through the front display window of a furniture store sofas and chairs rambo thought heres to a soft landing foot solidly on the throttle he was surprised there were not more cars on the street what kind of town was this anyhow a few minutes after midnight and everybody was asleep store lights off nobody coming out of bars singing well there was a little life in town now there sure as hell was the rush of the cruiser the hefty surge of the engine he was reminded of saturday nights years ago racing stock cars and he loved it all again himself and the car and the road everything was going to be fine he was going to make it working unnoticed down through the hills to the highway had been easy creeping through the forest of junked cars into the field and up to the cruiser had been easy the policemen from the car must have been in the hills with the rest or else down the road to see the drivers of the lorry trucks there had been no key in the switch but tripping the ignition wires had been no problem and now streaking through the red light of an intersection the power of the motor seeming to rise up through the accelerator flooding his body he knew it would be only a matter of hours before he was free he felt too good not to make it the police would radio ahead to try and stop him of course but most of their units were probably behind him with the searchers so there could not be much resistance ahead he would make it through town and take to the side roads and hide the car then run overland maybe hitch onto a freight train maybe sneak into a transport maybe even steal a plane christ there were any number of possibilities rambo the voice startled him coming from the radio rambo listen to me i know you can hear me the voice was familiar years off he could not place it listen to me each word smooth sonorous my name is sam trautman i was director of the school that trained you yes of course never in sight the persistent voice over the camps loudspeaker any hour day after day more running fewer meals less sleep the voice that never failed to signal hardship so that was it teasle had brought in trautman to help that explained some of the tactics the searchers had been using the bastard turning on his own kind rambo i want you to stop and surrender before they kill you sure you bastard listen to me i know this is hard to understand but im helping them because i dont want you killed theyve already begun to mobilize another force ahead of you and therell be another force after that and theyll wear you down until theres nothing left of you if i thought there was the slightest chance of your beating them id gladly tell you to keep on the move but i know you cant get away believe me i know it please while you still can give up and get out of this alive theres nothing you can do watch me another chain of explosions rumbling behind him he veered the cruiser tire squealing into the empty lot of a gas station lights off for the night he ran from the car kicked through the glass of the stations door stepped inside and switched on the electricity for the pumps then he grabbed a crowbar and hurried outside to wrench the locks off the pumps there were four two hoses on each and he squeezed them on spewing gasoline into the street setting their latches in place so they would not shut off when he let go by the time he drove the car up the street and stopped the pavement back there was flowing with gasoline a struck match and whoosh the night flared into day a huge lake of fire from sidewalk to sidewalk twenty feet high storefronts crackling windows shattering heat streaking over him singeing he raced the cruiser away the blaze of gasoline spreading behind him streaming to parked cars whump whump they exploded rocketing whump their own fault the sign on the light pole had said no parking after midnight he thought about what would happen when the pressure in the underground gasoline tanks went low the fire would back up into the hoses and down into the tanks and half the block would explode that would hold them from following it certainly would rambo trautman said from the radio please im asking you to stop its no use theres no sense to it watch me he thought again and shut off the radio he was almost through the heart of town a few minutes and he would be out the other side teasle waited he had the patrol car blocked across the main road through the town square and he was leaning over the front fender onto the hood pistol in hand there were specks of headlights coming from the flames and the explosions the kid might have been quicker than himself might already have sped past and out of town but he did not believe it he saw as if from two angles at once through the kids eyes as the front of the stolen car hurtled toward the town square from his own point of view as the headlights loomed into bright discs the dome on the roof of the car distinct now a siren dome a police car and he pulled back the injection slide on top of his gun releasing it aiming steadily he had to do this just right there would be no other chance he had to make absolutely certain this was the kid and not a stray patrolman the engine was revving louder the headlights were glaring onto him he squinted at the outline of the driver it had been three days since he had seen the kid but there was no misjudging the shape of his head hair cut short in clumps it was him now at last one against one not in the forest but in town where he knew best and on his terms the headlights blinding him he shot one out then the other selfejected cartridges clinging across the pavement how do you like it now he aimed and as the kid dove below the dashboard he fired and shattered the windshield and immediately shot out the front tires the triple jolt from his pistol drumming his hand on the hood the cruiser came rushing out of control spinning teasle jumping out of the way as the car hit his in a crash of metal and glass that flung his car in a circle and rebounded the kids toward the far sidewalk a hub cap rattled down the street a spray of gasoline spattered the pavement and teasle was crouched running toward the kids car firing repeatedly at the door up to it leaning inside shooting below the dashboard but the kid was not there just the front seat dark with blood and teasle dove to the road elbows scraping glancing furtively around seeing underneath the car the kids shoes running across the sidewalk into an alley he started after him reached the brick wall next to the alley and braced himself to go in firing he did not understand the spots of blood across the concrete he did not think any of his bullets had connected maybe the kid had been hurt in the crash it was a lot of blood good slow him down from in the alley he heard something heavy smashing against wood as if the kid were breaking in a door how many shots left two at the headlights one at the windshield two at the tires five at the door that left three not enough hurriedly he slipped out the clip from the handle snapped in a full one held his breath trembling and then in a rush went down the alley firing one two three empty shells winging through the air as he sprawled behind a row of garbage cans and saw the door to ogdens hardware open the garbage cans were too thin to protect him from a bullet but at least they hid him while he decided if the kid was actually in the store or if the open door was a trick and the kid was in ambush farther down the alley he scanned the alley and did not see the kid he was heading for the door when the thing came flipping out in sparkles what the dynamite the fuse too short for him to snub it out in time too short for him to grab the stick and throw it far enough in time like recoiling from a snake he was back out of the alley hugged against the brick wall hands over ears the explosion stunning him strips of wood and metal and fiery cardboard bursting out of the alley onto the street he stopped himself from running again to the broken door think it through think it through the kid has to run before other people get here he cant stay and fight the dynamite is just to hold you back forget the alley check the front door he darted around the corner of the street and the kid was long out of the store well up the block charging across the road into the shadows of the courthouse the range was difficult to aim with a pistol he tried it anyhow dropping to one knee as if in genuflection leaving the other knee raised supporting an elbow on it steadying the gun with both hands while he sighted and fired and missed his bullet smacked loudly into the stone wall of the courthouse there was a pinpoint flash the crack of a rifle by the courthouse and a bullet rang through a mailbox next to teasle he thought he saw the dark form of the kid ducking around to the back of the courthouse and he was running after him when three explosions in a row lit the courthouse into flames debris slashing out the windows brilliantly christ hes gone out of his mind teasle thought running faster this isnt just to try holding me back he wants to blow up the whole town the wood inside the courthouse was old and dry the blaze ate into the upper rooms running teasle grabbed at a muscle cramp in his side determined not to let it slow him pressing to go as far as he could before the little energy he had mustered gave out and collapsed his body the fire in the courthouse was breaking snapping its smoke filling the street up there so that he could not see where the kid was to the right across the street from the courthouse there was somebody moving on the front steps of the police station and he guessed it was the kid but it was harris out looking at the fire harris he shouted urgent to get it all out at once the kid get back get away but his words were swallowed in the thunder of the biggest explosion yet that heaved the station and disintegrated it outward obliterating harris in a sweep of flame and rubble the shock wave of the blast struck teasle motionless harris the station it was all he had left and now it was gone the office his guns the trophies the distinguished service cross and then he thought of harris again and cursed the kid and screamed his new anger suddenly charging him farther up the sidewalk toward the flames you sonofabitch he was thinking you didnt have to you didnt have to ahead to the right of the sidewalk there were two more storefronts and then the lawn of the police station littered with burning wood as he ran up cursing a shot cracked into the concrete by his feet and ricocheted off he sprawled into the gutter the street was bright but the rear of the station was still in shadow and he returned the kids shot aiming at where he had seen the flash of the rifle back there he shot twice more and now when he rose his knee gave out and he toppled across the sidewalk his strength was finally gone the beating he had taken in the last few days had finally caught up to him he lay on the sidewalk and thought of the kid the kid was bleeding and hed be weak too that wasnt stopping the kid any though if the kid could keep on then so could he but so tired so hard to move then all that about fighting the kid oneto one nobody else in the way to get hurt that was all a lie was it and orval and shingleton and the rest the promise you made that was all a lie too was it you cant promise dead men a promise like that doesnt count no but you promised yourself and that does count if you dont move your ass you wont be worth a poor goddamn to yourself or anyone else youre not tired youre afraid he sobbed crawled staggered up the kid was to the right behind the station but he could not escape that way because the backyard of the station ended with a high barbedwire fence and on the other side of the fence was a long sheer drop to the foundation of the new supermarket the kid would not have the time or strength to climb safely over and down he would run farther up the street and that way there were two houses then a playground then a field the town owned that was thick with tall grass and wild raspberry bushes and a listing shed some children had built he stalked forward using the slope of lawn in front of the police station for cover peering through the smoke to catch sight of the kid not wanting a second glance at what was left of harris spread apart on the street now he was between the courthouse and the station their flames lighting him smoke burning his eyes heat stinging his face and skin he stooped closer to the slope of lawn to hide himself in the light the smoke cleared a moment and he saw that people who lived in the two houses up from the station were out on their porches talking pointing christ the kid might blow up their houses too kill them just like harris he struggled to hurry toward them watching for the kid get the hell away he shouted get back what someone up there called hes near you run get away what i cant hear you right he huddled next to the porch on the far side of the last house and aimed at teasle the man and the two women on the porch were so distracted calling to teasle that they did not see he was hiding down next to them but when he pulled back the hammer on his rifle they must have heard the click because there was an abrupt sound of movement on the wood up there and a woman leaned over the rail at him saying my god jesus god that was enough warning teasle scurried off the sidewalk up the lawn to the first house and the shelter of its porch rambo fired anyhow not counting on a hit but sure at least of frightening him the woman up there screamed he levered out his empty cartridge and aimed at the corner of the porch down there teasles shoe was sticking out lit by the flames he pulled the trigger but nothing happened his rifle empty no time to reload he dropped it and drew the police revolver but teasles shoe was gone now the woman was still screaming oh for crissake shut up lady he told her and ran to the rear corner of the house studying the shadows of the back yard teasle would not risk coming around the front where the flames made him a bright easy target he would slip into the dark at the back of the first house and then work his way to the back of this house rambo drew close to the corner staring past a bicycle and a tool shed waiting his forehead was cracked open from when his car had struck teasles slamming his face against the police radio and his sleeve was sticky from wiping away the blood that streamed down into his eyes the collision had also wakened the pain in his ribs so that he did not know which hurt him worse he waited longer went drowsy briefly then alerted himself there was no sound but a black figure seemed to be gliding along the rear fence in among evergreen shrubs he wiped blood from his eyes aimed but could not let himself fire not until he was certain it was teasle if the gliding figure was just a trick of the eyes then shooting at it would reveal his place it would also be wasting a bullet he only had five in his handgun the chamber beneath the firing pin was bare teasles browning held thirteen let him waste shots he could afford to there was another reason he did not fire immediately at the figure when last he had wiped blood from his eyes they had not focused properly seeing double as if the blood remained he could not distinguish now between the dark shape and the shape of the evergreens all blurred together and he was enduring a headache so sharp that it seemed ready to split his skull why wasnt the shadow moving or was it moving and he could not see it teasle ought to have made some sound though come on make a sound why didnt he it was getting too late already sirens were wailing close fire sirens maybe but maybe police come on teasle he heard the people from the porch in the house now talking frightened he sensed something and looked behind to see if anyone was still on the porch with a gun or something that might hurt him and christ there was teasle coming up the front lawn in his surprise rambo fired before he knew it teasle crying out careening backward down the lawn in an arc that landed him on the sidewalk but rambo could not puzzle out what was happening to himself the way he was jerking back weightless whipping to one side striking face down in the grass his hands were warm and wet on his chest then directly sticky oh jesus he was hit teasle had managed a shot and hit him his chest was stunned nerves paralyzed got to move have to get away sirens he could not stand he squirmed a wire fence to the side of the house beyond it vague hulking objects in the night the flames from the station and the courthouse surged high illuminating them orange but still he could not see them distinctly he strained his eyes his vision cleared and he saw seesaws the word a hollow jingle in his head swings slides a playground he inched toward them on his belly the sound of the flames down behind him like the roar of a windstorm snapping through trees ill get my gun wheres my gun the man shouted inside the house no please a woman said dont go out there stay out of it wheres my gun where did you put my gun i told you to quit moving it he dug his elbows into the lawn squirming faster reached the fence a gate opened it kneed himself through behind him there were hollow footsteps on the wood of the backstairs where is he the man was saying his voice clear outside whered he go there the second woman said hysterically the voice of the one who had seen him from the front porch over there the gate well you bastards rambo thought and looked the blazes were flaring high and the man was standing by the tool shed aiming a rifle the man was too awkward aiming but he went instantly graceful when rambo shot him smoothly clutching his right shoulder spinning easily toppling perfectly over the bicycle next to the tool shed and then he was awkward again as the bicycle gave way under him and the two jumbled to the ground in a tinny jangle of chain and spokes christ im hit the man was groaning he hit me im hit but the man did not know how lucky he was rambo had aimed at his chest not his shoulder no longer able to see to shoot straight no longer able to hold his gun steady his chest rapidly draining blood he had no hope of getting away no means of efficiently protecting himself nothing except perhaps the stick of dynamite still in his pocket the dynamite he thought screw the dynamite with the little strength remaining in him he would not be able to lob the stick five feet he hit me the man was groaning he hit me im hit well so am i buddy but you dont hear me whining about it he thought and since he could not accept merely waiting for the men in the siren cars to come for him he began crawling again into a dry wading pool at the center of the playground into the center of the wading pool and there his nerves tingled stretched to life and gradually registered his pain teasles bullet had torn through his cracked ribs and it was like lancing a giant fester poison spewing forth the pain grew to overwhelm him he was scratching at his chest clawing ripping he shook his head clenched his body so convulsed with pain that he raged to his feet up out of the wading pool head stooped shoulders hunched tottering toward the fence at the edge of the playground it was low and he leaned over it gasping kicked his feet in the air in a grotesque somersault came down on the other side expecting his back to hit ground instead snagged thorns and leafless branches a field of brambles wild raspberries he had been here before he did not remember when but he had been here before no no he was wrong it was teasle who had been here before up in the mountains when he had escaped into that whole slope of brambles yes that was it teasle had gone in now it was the other way around now it was his own turn the barbs dug him they felt so good helping him to rip at his pain teasle had escaped this way through brambles like these why couldnt he teasle lay on his back on the concrete of the sidewalk ignoring the flames staring up fascinated at a yellow streetlight if this were summer he thought there would be moths and mosquitoes flying around the bulb then he wondered why he had thought that he was losing his stare blinking now holding both hands over the hole in his stomach it amazed him that except for a compulsive itch in his intestines he had no sensation there was also a big hole in his back he knew but that too was just an itch so much damage and so little pain he thought almost as if his body no longer belonged to him he was listening to the sirens first a few then a cluster of them wailing somewhere beyond the fire sometimes they sounded far off sometimes just down the street just down the street he said to hear himself and his voice was so distant that his mind had to be separate from his body he moved one leg then the other raised his head arched his back well then at least when the bullet had gone through it had not shattered his spine to break his back the thing is though he told himself youre dying that big a hole and this little pain youre dying all right and that too amazed him that he could think about it so calmly he glanced away from the streetlight toward the burning courthouse even its roof on fire toward the police station flames seething out every window and i just had those inside walls painted he thought someone was beside him kneeling a woman an old woman is there anything i can do she gently asked youre some old woman he thought all this blood and still you made yourself come to me no no thank you he said his voice very distant i dont believe theres anything you can do unless did i hit him do you know is he dead he fell i think she said im from the next house down by the station im not sure exactly about it all well he said my house is catching fire the people in this house someone was shot i think can i get you a blanket some water your lips are dry are they no no thank you it was certainly fascinating his voice far off but hers close unfiltered against his eardrum and the sirens oh the sirens wailing louder deep inside his head it was all reversed him outside of himself but everything out there within him fascinating he had to tell her about it she deserved to know but when he looked she was gone and it was like a ghost had been with him what kind of sign was it that he didnt know when she had gone the sirens too loud shrieking like knives through his brain he raised his head and looked between the fires down toward the bottom of the town square police cars veering around the corner down there speeding this way up the street flashers whipping six he counted he had never seen anything with such distinct clarity each detail in pure focus especially each color of the light flashers quick intermittent red frontbeams constant glaring yellow men behind the windshields orange in the shimmering radiance of the flames the vision was too powerful it set the street spinning and he had to close his eyes or be sick that would be all he needed to retch and tear his stomach more and maybe die right there before he could discover how this would end it was a grace that he had not already been sick he was long overdue hold together that was all he could do if he was going to die and he was sure that he was he could not let it come over him just yet not until the end he heard their tires squealing and when he looked again they were braking with a lurch below the station policemen jumping out before the cars were at full stop sirens ebbing one policeman pointed up the street toward him and they all came running between the fires shielding their faces from the heat shoes scuffling on the pavement and in among them he saw trautman they had their guns drawn trautman had a pump shotgun that he must have taken from one of the cruisers now he saw kern among them too kern was telling a man running as he spoke go back to the car radio for an ambulance kern was pointing up and down the street telling others get these people out of here push them back what people he did not understand he looked and dozens of people had materialized their abrupt appearance startled him they were watching the fires something about their faces they were crowding toward him eyes aglow bodies stiff and he raised his hands to keep them away irrationally afraid about to cry not yet as the policemen reached him blocking them off encircling him the kid he said dont talk kern told him i think i hit him he said it calmly he concentrated trying to imagine he was the kid yes i hit him you need your strength dont talk a doctors coming we would have been here sooner but had to go around the fires on the listen relax youve done everything you could let us handle it now but ive got to tell you where he is here a woman screamed from the front lawn of the house back here get a doctor you eight come with me kern said spread out half on that side of the house half on this side be careful the rest of you help scatter this crowd but hes not back there too late kern and his men were gone not back there he repeated to himself kern whats the matter with him that he cant listen it was just as well he had not waited for kern to help that evening at the start of the chase he decided with kern along the posse would have been twice as confused and the men kern brought would have died with the others trautman had not yet spoken the few policemen who remained were trying to avoid the sight of all the blood not him though no not you trautman you dont mind the blood at all youre used to it trautman did not answer just kept staring one policeman said maybe kern is right maybe you should try not to talk sure and thats what i told orval when he was shot but he didnt want to die quiet anymore than i do hey trautman i did it i said i would didnt i and i did whats he talking about the one policeman said i dont get it look at him his eyes another said hes gone crazy still staring trautman gestured for them to be quiet i told you id outguess him didnt i his voice was a victorious childs he did not like the sound of it but he could not stop himself something inside him was rushing it on getting it all out the secret he was up there by the side of that porch and i was the next house down beside that porch and i could feel he was waiting for me to come your school trained him well trautman he did exactly what he was trained to do and thats how i outguessed him his wound was itchy he scratched it his blood pooling out and it was more fascinating to him with every moment how he could go on talking this way he should be gasping squeezing out each word he knew and here they were coming on and on in a fluent rush like an unspooling ribbon i pretended i was him do you see ive been thinking about him so much its like i know what hes doing and just then the two of us beside the porches i was imagining what he would do and suddenly i could tell what he was figuring that i wouldnt come for him on the street side where there was light from the fires that id come around the back through the yard and the trees through the trees trautman do you see it your school trained him for guerrilla fighting in the hills so he instinctively turned to the trees and the lawn and the bushes back there and me after what he did to me in the hills i was god damned if id ever fight him again on his own terms on my terms remember thats what i told you my town and if i was going to get it i was going to be on my street near my houses with the light from my office burning and i did it i outguessed him trautman he took my bullet in the chest still trautman did not speak he looked so long at it before he pointed to the gore of the stomach wound this you mean this youre pointing at i told you your school trained him well my christ what reflexes off in the night beyond the roar of the fires there was a full roaring cawhump that illuminated all that part of the sky the echo from it rumbled in return over the town too soon it went too soon the one deputy said in disgust too soon for what kern was coming from behind the house scrambling down the slope of lawn to the sidewalk he isnt back there i know i tried to tell you he shot some guy in the shoulder thats what the woman was yelling about my men are looking for a trace of him theres blood theyre following he was distracted glancing at the waves of light in the sky at the side of town what is it what was that explosion teasle said god i doubt they had enough time time for what the gas stations he set two of them burning we heard on the radio about the fire department over there the pumps and main buildings are so deep in the flames that they couldnt get in to shut off the gasoline they were going to disconnect the electricity to that whole part of town when they realized if they stopped the pumps the pressure would reverse the fire down into the main tanks and the entire block would go up i called a squad of my men over to help evacuate one of the fires was in a section of houses god i hope they were in time before it went and theres another one yet to go and how many will be dead when this is over a shout from the side of the house he went across a playground over here well dont yell so loud that he knows were onto him dont worry teasle said hes not in the playground you cant be sure of that youve been lying here too long he might have gone anywhere no you have to be in his place you have to pretend that youre him he crawled through the playground and pushed himself over the fence there and hes in the wild raspberries the brambles i got away from him through brush like that and now hes trying it but hes wounded too bad you cant believe the pain in his chest theres a shed there some children built and hes crawling toward it kern frowned in question at trautman and the two policemen whats been going on with him while i was back there whats happened the one policeman shook his head queerly he thinks hes the kid what hes gone crazy the other said you two watch him i want him quiet kern said he knelt beside him hang on for the doctor he wont be long i promise you it doesnt matter try please there were bells clanging and more sirens as two big fire engines lumbered up the square slowing heavily to a stop beside the police cars firemen were jumping off rubbercoated running for tools to open the water hydrants reeling out hoses another shout from the side of the house he went clean through the playground theres blood all through it theres some kind of field and bushes dont shout i told you then down to him on the sidewalk o k lets find out for you lets see if youre right about where he is wait hell get away i have to go no wait you have to promise me i did the doctor is coming i promise it no something else you have to promise me when you find him you have to let me be there for the end i have a right ive been through too much not to see the end you hate him that much i dont hate him you dont understand he wants it he wants me to be there jesus kern looked astounded at trautman and the others jesus i shot him and all at once i didnt hate him anymore i just was sorry well of course no not because he shot me too it wouldnt have made a difference if he shot me or not i still would have been sorry you have to promise to let me be there at the end i owe it to him i have to be with him at the end jesus promise me all right dont lie i know youre thinking im so badly hurt that i cant be moved up to that field im not lying kern said i have to go he stood motioned to his men at the side of the house and they joined him spread out starting nervously up the street toward the playground and the field beyond except for trautman no not you trautman teasle said you want to stay out of it yet dont you but dont you think you ought to see dont you think you ought to be there and see how he finally maneuvers himself when trautman now spoke at last his voice was as dry as the wood in the courthouse must have been when it caught tinder for the fire how bad are you i dont feel a thing no im wrong again the concrete is very soft oh another full billowing cawhump lit up the sky over there trautman watched it blankly the second gas station score another point for your boy teasle said my yes your school really trained him well theres no question trautman looked at the firemen hosing the flames of the courthouse and the police station at the jagged hole in teasles stomach and his eyes flickered he pumped his shotgun injecting a shell into the firing chamber before he started up the lawn toward the back of the house what did you do that for teasle said but he already knew wait no answer trautmans back was receding through the reflection of the flames toward the few shadows that were left at the side of the house wait teasle said panic in his voice you cant do that he shouted thats not yours to do like kern before him trautman was gone dammit wait teasle shouted he rolled on his stomach pawing the sidewalk i have to be there it has to be me he groped to his hands and knees coughing blood dripping from his stomach onto the sidewalk the two policemen grabbed him pushing him down youve got to rest the one said take it easy leave me alone i mean it they were struggling to control him he was thrashing i have a right i started this better let him go if he tries fighting us anymore hell rip himself wide open look at his blood on me how much more can he have inside him enough teasle was thinking enough he groped again to his hands and knees drew up one leg then the other concentrating to stand he had the salt taste of blood in his mouth i started this trautman he was thinking hes mine not yours he wants it to be me he braced himself rose walked a step then listed contending for his balance if he fell he was certain he would never be able to raise himself again he had to hold himself steady balancing as he wove up the lawn toward the house i know it trautman he was thinking he wants it to be me not you me in agony rambo crawled through the brambles toward the shed the firelight extended weakly onto it and he saw how one wall leaned inward the roof on an angle but he could not see in through the halfopen door stark black in there he crawled but he seemed to be taking a very long while to go a short space and then he found he was just doing the motions of a crawl not getting anywhere he worked harder slowly managing some distance toward the shed but when he came to the black entrance he refused in there it was too much like the hole where he had been held prisoner in the war dark compressed constricting it reminded him strangely of the shower stall teasle had made him go into and of the cell teasle had wanted to lock him in they had been brightly lit that was true but the repulsion had been the same everything he was running from he thought and how could he have been so tired as to consider making a fight from in there a fight was out of the question now anyway he had seen too many men die from bullet wounds not to know that he was bleeding to death the pain continued in his chest in his head sharply accented by each pump of his heart but his legs were cold and numb from the loss of blood that was why he had trouble crawling and his fingers were senseless his hands nerve extremities gradually shutting off he did not have much life to go at least he still had the choice of where it would leave him not in there as in the caves he was determined never to experience that again no in the open where he could see the sky unhampered and smell the night airs unrestricted flow he groped to the right of the shed burrowing awkwardly farther into the brush the correct spot that was the necessary thing someplace comfortable and friendly proper to him soothing he needed to find it before it was too late a shallow bodylong trough seemed promising but when he lay face up in it the trough was too much like a grave plenty of time to lie in his grave someplace else he needed just the opposite high boundless his last moments for a taste of it crawling he peered forward through the brush and there was a gentle rise ahead and when he reached the top it was a mound slopes of brush down every side the dome a clearing of drooped autumn grass not as high as he had wanted still it was above the field and stretching back on top of the grass was pleasant as if on a strawstuffed blanket he peered up at the glorious orange patterns that the flames projected onto the night clouds at ease this was the place at any rate his mind was at ease but his pain quickened racking him and in contrast the numbness crept to his knees his elbows soon it would creep to his chest cancelling the pain and where after that his head or would he be gone before then well he had better think if there was anything more to do anything important he had forgotten he stiffened in pain no there didnt seem anything more to do what about god the idea embarrassed him it was only in moments of absolute fear that he had ever thought about god and prayed to him always embarrassed because he did not believe and felt so hypocritical when he prayed out of fear as if in spite of his disbelief there might be a god after all god who could be fooled by a hypocrite when he was a child then he believed he certainly did believe when he was a child how did it go the nightly act of contrition the words came hesitantly unfamiliarly to him oh my god i am heartily sorry for for what for everything that happened the last few days sorry that it all had to happen but it all did have to happen he regretted it but he knew if this were monday again he would go through the next days the same as he had up to now just as he knew teasle would there was no avoiding any of it if their fight had been for pride it had also been for something more important like what like what a lot of horseshit he told himself freedom and rights he had not set out to prove a principle he had set out to show a fight to anyone who pushed him anymore and that was quite different not ethical but personal emotional he had killed a great many people and he could pretend their deaths were necessary because they were all a part of what was pushing him making it impossible for someone like him to get along but he did not totally believe it he had enjoyed the fight too much enjoyed too much the risk and the excitement perhaps the war had conditioned him he thought perhaps he had become so used to action that he could not ease off no that was not quite true either if he had really wanted to control himself he could have he simply had not wanted to control himself to live his way he had been determined to fight anyone who interfered so all right then in a way he had fought for a principle but it was not that simple because he had also been proud and delighted to show how good he was at fighting he was the wrong man to be shoved oh yes he was and now he was dying and nobody wanted to die and all that he was thinking about principles was a lot of crap to justify it to think that he would do everything again the same was just a trick to convince himself that what was happening right now could not have been avoided christ it was right now and he could not do one damn thing about it and neither principles nor pride had any matter in the face of what was to come what he should have done was cherish more smiling girls and drink more icy water and taste more summer melons and that was a lot of horseshit too what he should have done and all that about god was merely complicating what he had shortly decided if the numbness creeping up his thighs and forearms was an easy way to die it was also poor and helpless passively defeating the one choice left to him was how to die and it was not going to be like a holedup wounded animal a quiet pathetic gradually senseless deterioration at once in a great burst of feeling since his first sight of tribesmen mutilating a body in the jungle he had been afraid of what would happen to his own body when he died as if his body still would have some nerve responses he had imagined with chilling repulsion what it would be like having the blood drained from his veins embalming fluid pumped in his central organs removed his chest cavity treated with preservatives he had imagined what it would be like having the undertaker sew his lips together and his eye lids down and he had been sickened death strange that death should not bother him so much as what would happen to him after well they could not do all that to him if there was nothing of him to have it done to at least this way doing it to himself there was the chance of pleasure he took the final stick of dynamite from his pocket opened the softlypacked box of fuses and exploders slipped one set of them into the stick then arranged the stick between his pants and his stomach he hesitated to light the fuse this damn business about god complicating things it was suicide he was about and that could send him to hell forever if he believed but he did not and he had lived with the idea of suicide for a long while in the war carrying the poison capsule his commander had given him to prevent being captured tortured then when he had been captured he had not had time to swallow it now though he would light the fuse but what if there was god well if god was he could not fault him for being true to his disbelief one intense sensation yet reserved for him no pain too instantaneous for pain just one bright dissolving flash at least that would be something the numbness up to his groin now he prepared to light the fuse then with one last bleary glance across the field to the playground he saw in the firelight the doublefocused image of a man in a beret uniform stalking low and carefully through the cover of the swings and slides he carried a rifle or a shotgun rambos eyes could no longer tell him which but he could make out it was a beret uniform and he new that it was trautman it could be no one else and behind trautman stumbling across the playground clutching his stomach came teasle it had to be him lurching against a rectangular maze of climbing bars and rambo understood then there was a better way teasle clung to the bars resting then pushed himself away staggering toward the fence he had been frantic that trautman would get into the field before him but now everything was going to be fine trautman was just a few steps ahead of him crouched beside a bench studying the thick brush of the field just a few steps ahead of him he reached out and grabbed the bench to stop from falling stood against it breathing hoarsely without a glance away from the field trautman told him get down hell see you for sure i would but id never stand again so what would be the need you cant do any good the way you are stay out of it youre killing yourself lie down and let you finish it for me screw im dying anyhow trautman looked at him then kern was nearby out of sight yelling christ get the hell down he has perfect cover and im not risking any men to go in i sent for gasoline he likes to play with fire well burn him out yes thats your style kern he thought he grabbed at the itch in his stomach holding himself wetly in and shuffled clumsily forward propping himself against the fence get the hell down kern yelled again screw burn him out will you kern thats the kind of idea i expected from you he thought and you can bet that before the fire gets to him hell come through here shooting to take a few of your men with him theres only one way to do this and thats for somebody like me who doesnt have a hope anyhow to go in and take him you havent lost enough men yet or youd know that what the hell was that kern shouted and teasle realized that what he had been thinking he had said out loud that startled him and he had to get over the fence while he still was able there was blood here on the fence the kids good he would be going over where the kid had his blood dripping on the kids he gathered himself and toppled over the fence he guessed that he struck the ground hard but his brain did not register the impact in a quick rush trautman came from the bench vaulted the fence and landed in a neat crouch in a clump of brush beside him stay out of here teasle told him no and if you dont shut up hell be onto everything we do hes not anywhere around to hear hes way over in the center of the field look you know he wants it to be me i have a right to be there at the end you know that yes then stay out of what doesnt concern you i started this long before you and im going to help theres no disgrace in taking help now shut up and lets go while you still can all right you want to help then help me stand i cant do it on my own you mean it what a mess this is going to be thats what shingleton said what nothing trautman had him on his feet now and then trautman was crawling into the brush disappearing and teasle stood his head above the brush surveying it thinking go go on and crawl as fast as you can it wont make a difference what you do ill get to him before he coughed and spat something salty and shifted forward through the brush in a straight line toward the shed it was clear that the kid had gone this way the branches broken down in a crude trail he kept his pace slow not chancing the helplessness of a fall even so he was surprised at how soon he reached the shed but as he prepared to go inside he realized instinctively that the kid was not in there he glanced around and as if drawn toward a magnet he shambled swaying down another broken path toward a large mound there the kid was there he knew it could feel it there was no doubt when he had been spread out on the sidewalk someone had said he was delirious but that had been wrong he had not been delirious not then now now he was delirious and his body seemed to be melting from him just his mind floating over the brush toward the mound and the night was becoming glorious day the orange reflection of the flames growing brighter dancing wildly at the bottom of the mound he ceased floating and hovered transfixed the splendorous sheen illuminating him it was coming he had no more time as if his will belonged to another he saw his arm rise up before him his pistol aiming toward the mound the numbness was at rambos shoulders now at his navel and steadying the gun was like aiming with two stumps of wood he saw teasle dispersing into triple focus down there eyes bright aiming and he knew there should be no other way no passive lapse into nothing no lit fuse selfdisruption but this way the only proper way in the last of the fight trying his best to kill teasle eyes and hands betraying him he did not think he could hit teasle but he had to try then if he missed teasle would see the flash of his gun and fire at it and at least then ill have died trying he thought he strove to squeeze his finger on the trigger directing his aim at teasles center image the barrel was wobbling and he would never hit him but he could not fake it he had to try as hard as he could he told his hand to squeeze on the trigger but his hand would not work and as he concentrated on it clenching the gun went off unintended so careless and sloppy he cursed himself not the real fight he had hoped for and now teasles bullet would come when he did not deserve it he waited it should have come already he squinted to clear his vision looking down the mound where teasle lay flat in the brush christ he had hit him god he had not wanted that and the numbness was so overwhelming by now that he could never light the fuse before it nulled him so poor so ugly and poor then death took him over but it was not at all the stupefying sleep bottomless and murky that he had expected it was more like what he had expected from the dynamite but coming from his head instead of his stomach and he could not understand why it should be like that and it frightened him then since it was the total of what remained he let it happen went with it erupted free through the back of his head and his skull catapulted through the sky through myriad spectra onward outward forever dazzling brilliant and he thought if he kept on like this for long enough he might be wrong and see god after all well teasle thought well he lay back on the brush marvelling at the stars repeating to himself that he did not know what had hit him he really did not he had seen the flash of the gun and he had fallen but he had been slow and gentle to fall and he really did not know what had hit him did not sense it respond to it he thought about anna and then stopped that not because the memory was painful but because after everything she just didnt seem important anymore he heard someone stepping cracking through the brush the kid coming he thought but slow very slow to come well sure hes hurt bad but then it was only trautman standing there head outlined against the sky face and uniform lustrous from the flames but eyes dull whats it like trautman said is it bad no he said actually its kind of pleasant if i dont think about what its bringing what was that explosion i heard it sounded like another gas station me i guess it was me i took the top of his head off with this shotgun whats it like for you better than when i knew he was in pain yes trautman pumped the empty shell from the shotgun and teasle watched its wide arc glistening through the air he thought about anna again and she still did not interest him he thought about his house he had fixed up in the hills the cats there and none of that interested him either he thought about the kid and flooded with love for him and just a second before the empty shell would have completed its arc to the ground he relaxed accepted peacefully and was dead the end
