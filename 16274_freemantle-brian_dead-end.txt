dead end brian freemantle one in such an internationally established acclaimed and aggressive pharmaceutical conglomerate there were obviously laboratories in every overseas division of dubette inc but each was effectively a subsidiary of the north virginia headquarters at mcleans priority park just off the beltway that laboratory was designed to a rigid structure that provided the name by which it was universally referred to never research and development but always the spiders web which was apposite the office of the fittingly spindlelimbed bespectacled vice president dwight newton was at the very centre of a concentric series of specialized research departments and divisions included here because their cure or prevention was the holy grail of commercial medical research were a variety of cancers aids and its human immunodeficiency virus precursor hiv both a and b strains of hepatitis the common cold and a variety of frequently mutating fatal influenza viruses the final outer circle was devoted to what was with surprising unprofessionalism suspiciously regarded as the new and unproven science of genetics and its engineering for medical benefit it was here that richard parnell had been allocated his laboratories parnell liked america he liked its cando ethos and sameday deliveries of whatever hed wanted to furnish the new easily arranged apartment rented on the first day and dayone car purchase and most of all he liked the more than trebled salary that made everything affordable and still left him with more money than hed earned apart of course from the international recognition that had resulted in his being headhunted from cambridge as a leading participant in britains considerable contribution to the global genome project codifying human dna it was a reputation parnell was determined to increase which made his relegation to the outer circle an absurd and irritating dismissal he was about to rectify like the spiders web after which it was nicknamed the expanding circles were each linked by connected threading corridors all glassed and therefore all visible to everyone along his route to the vice presidents inner sanctum as he walked the gauntlet parnell was aware of the attention and recognition of people on either side and recognized the point to the pretentious outerspace laboratory design no one could approach the spiderlike man without being seen to initiate the paranoia is he being promoted over me have i made a dismissable mistake am i being reprimanded am i going to be fired it was a good feeling not to be afraid to be sure enough of himself and his international reputation to do what he was about to do professor dwight newton was thin to the point of being emaciated a cadaverous face dominated almost overwhelmed by overly heavy blackframed spectacles stickthin arms protruding from the sleeves of a white laboratory coat forewarned by his outside secretariat newton was standing a tall man although still shorter than the broadshouldered athletically bodied parnell good to see you again dick good to see you sorry it hasnt been sooner must say though i dont understand your memo there was a helpless sweeping gesture towards the empire beyond so much to keep a handle on never a moment its a big operation acknowledged parnell the biggest worldwide said newton and youre part of it now parnell said thats what i very much want to be part of it but a proper part newtons affability went out like a switchedoff light he picked up and let drop parnells meeting request and said so whats all this about keeping all your equipment on hold and not advertising for staff ive nowhere to put equipment or staff declared parnell newton gave an uncertain laugh youve got your own internal laboratories what two separate working spaces offices secretarial space everything you could want in the wrong place ive been appointed dubettes professor of pharmacogenomics applying what i did in england to drug development here to do that i need to be alongside the laboratories and the people developing those drugs not isolated as i have been newton frowned everything radiates out from what has to be the most tightly and securely controlled working area i didnt accept the offer here in order to be a totem just a recognizable name on a staff list said parnell if im going to make any contribution to dubettes research and development i need to be at the centre of things if im not it makes quite pointless my being here as part of the dubette empire pinpricks of anger began colouring newtons face i dont believe archimedes principle came to him when he overflowed the bath water research here is programmed according to a strict schedule of antibiotic exploration which is the business were in i dont believe the archimedes legend either nor see how its supposed to fit what were talking about rejected parnell its now been recognized that the majority of what pharmaceutical industries produce does nothing to alleviate help or by the very worst analysis save the lives of people theyre supposed to help with the drugs theyre offering if i can create the proper research team working in proper liaising research with medical expertise dubette could revolutionize diagnostic approach its an approach already being tried in europe and one upon which im well advanced from my work on the genome project parnell resigned to the thought that his job was over before it had begun supposed he could always stay in washington for an extended holiday to minimize the loss on the apartment lease and whatever else was nonrefundable before moving on he was probably still within his relocation budget in any case there was another edge of uncertainty in newtons laugh youre talking as if you can walk away if you dont like the housing arrangements thats exactly how im talking parnell was glad he hadnt advertised vacancies in his new department and given people false hopes you forgotten youve got a legally enforceable contract studied and agreed not just by dubettes lawyers but your independent attorney as well it very specifically sets out in that contract that i shall have every research facility i might need which i dont have i dont intend any ridiculous breachofcontract litigation against dubette ill just resign and well both put it down to experience you dont intend any litigation exploded the research director incredulous you think this organization lets people walk away just because they dont have a desk by the window im not complaining about not having a desk by the window retorted parnell im saying i do not have my contracted working conditions and facilities now tell me what youre saying are you telling me that if i resign dubette will take me to court youre damned right i am ok said parnell rising ill see the lawyer who negotiated for me and get my resignation letter in to you in the next day or two sit down ordered newton sharply youve scarcely been here long enough to find the washroom lets not get off to a wrong start the two of us you want a change of location ill see what i can do but if were going to work together theres something youve got to understand very clearly i dont like wont have confrontations i dont want any wrong starts or confrontations either said parnell easily i accepted dubettes approach precisely because i recognized the opportunity to extend genetic science through an international organization with huge research resources thats all im asking for that chance to do the work i came here to do but cant leave me to work it out so ill get the laboratory i want where i want it persisted parnell thats confrontational accused the spindly man thats honest contradicted parnell i said leave it with me insisted the american if he pushed any further any harder theyd both fall off the edge parnell accepted im glad weve had this conversation so am i liar parnell thought it was a trait hed have to remember im grateful for your staying late thanked newton whod spent the afternoon with dubettes inhouse lawyers and didnt like what hed been told theres obviously a reason for your asking said russell benn he was the large black rumblingvoiced scientific director of the predominant antibacterial research sections of the laboratory were going to have to move things around a little make some space announced the vice president benn frowned space for what the english guy parnell whos opening up the genetics section for what repeated the other man he has to be part of the inner core able to liaise with you i need all the space ive got protested benn this is how its got to be russ how i want it to be newton enjoyed the power knowing that people were actually frightened of him as he in turn was frightened of edward c grant newton promised himself hed manipulate parnell as he would a piece of modelling clay until parnell was as pliably obedient as hed made everyone else in the research and development division benn who was trying to put three of his five sons through private school and had a mortgage lapping up to his chin shrugged and said its going to upset things my guys like their routines knowing where they are its what i want insisted newton if it causes problems ill need to talk to you about it said benn anxious to pretend he was not as intimidated as everyone else enmeshed in the spiders web do that urged the director sincerely the moment theres a problem a conflict i want to know about it that afternoon the legal opinion had been that professional disruption affecting major research nullified parnells breachofcontract claim and provided dubette with a matching pressure to keep him in line an outer not an inner line two richard parnells reassigned research area was directly in line with the vice presidents office which parnell supposed was intended to be intimidating but wasnt he was far more interested in the newly arrived equipment everything hed requested without a single budgetary challenge which was what he told russell benn at their first meeting after his transfer glad youre satisfied said the other man the voice seeming to come from deep within him parnell at once discerned the resentment id like to think were going to get on together so would i why dont we establish our parameters right now why dont we echoed benn he was pushing against a closed door thought parnell im here to head up a new pharmacogenomics division right the black scientist nodded that involves me or the people who are going to join me employing what was discovered during the genome project to drug development which is your division so were going to have to work pretty closely together wouldnt you agree you really think you can make a contribution genetically to what we do here demanded benn you accept that more than ninety per cent of the drugs produced drugs we produce are only effective upon between thirty to fifty per cent of the people for whom theyre prescribed ive heard the figures i think theyre debatable and youve heard of singlenucleotide polymorphisms genetically matching a person to the most efficacious drug sure ive heard of it but arent impressed by it challenged parnell im waiting to be convinced abacavir threw back parnell at once ok conceded the other man so genetically it has been established that abacavir is a drug that could potentially be fatal to about five per cent of hiv sufferers in aids treatment and brings out violent skin reaction rashes in those to whom it isnt fatal persisted parnell ive read the findings and the stats scientifically accepted findings and statistics insisted parnell like theres general scientific acceptance that single nucleotide polymorphisms could not only test peoples vulnerability to a particular drugs side effects but also whether or not it will work at all you want coffee the other man invited suddenly making a vague movement to a percolator on a side table upon which several mugs all loyally marked with the dubette logo were laid out in readiness parnell recognized it as a gesture coffee would be good you know your stuff said benn as he poured you were testing me accused parnell wasnt that what you were doing with me no denied parnell i was trying to build a bridge for both of us to cross seems to me youre arguing against superbug resistance the awkward bastard was still testing parnell decided i think and intend to prove that pharmacogenomics could become successful enough to reduce antibiotic resistance or rejection the other scientist fixed him with a direct stare unspeaking for several moments then he said am i hearing what youre saying its a selfdefeating ladder developing stronger antibiotics when resistance makes useless those that already exist making cocktails of drugs a lot of the constituents of which are totally ineffective and can even be harmful is bad medicine the logic can only be the buildup of even greater resistance which in turn needs even greater stronger antibiotics its happened worldwide with methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus were breeding our own superbugs from superbugs not eradicating anything eradicating picked out benn at once isnt eventual eradication the focus of medical science frowned parnell medical science heavily qualified benn our focus is pharmaceutical research and developing and improving drugs to combat known diseases arent they allied i suppose thats a point of view allowed the section director doubtfully its always been mine you havent yet been to a company seminar have you asked russell benn not yet said parnell theres one soon youll find it interesting i am finding this conversation interesting said parnell directly interesting as well as confusing did you know that years ago tyre manufacturers perfected a tyre that never wears out if they were fitted to cars and trucks theyd last the lifetime of the vehicle no i didnt know that encouraged parnell who did but wanted the analogy expanded planned obsolescence declared benn yes said parnell i think youre right declared benn on another tangent i think there could be work we could do together there cant be any doubt were virtually the left and right hand each having to know what the others doing and how we can each realistically decide how to complement the other towards a successful development hed gone straight from cambridge university into the rarefied atmosphere of pure medical research parnell reminded himself but he wasnt in any rarefied atmosphere any longer he was in the real hardheaded commercial world now how difficult would the adjustment be hi parnell looked up from science today beside his unseen stabbedat lunch to the darkhaired girl smiling down upon him hi this seat taken help yourself he stood politely taking her tray as she unloaded the sandwich and a pickle the same choice hed made he saw there were several alternative empty tables throughout the commissary my names rebecca i know said parnell the id tag hanging from her neck chain matched the nameplate on her white laboratory coat both reading rebecca lang and i know that youre richard parnell she said reading his identification name badges one of the great american innovations acknowledged parnell he closed the journal you dont have to do that stop reading i mean of course i do he sliced his sandwich salt beef on rye more easily to eat now i feel uncomfortable she bit into her sandwich without cutting it no you dont she smiled again her teeth a tribute to attentive dentistry and teenage torture confident that she didnt need any more facial help rebecca wore only a light lipstick pale pink like her nail colouring all right so i dont want to know a secret sure parnell heard his own word and thought it sounded american an early resolution was that he wouldnt let himself relapse into any idiom it was one of several preconceptions she nodded generally around the restaurant it was a bet who got to talk to you first talk to me first the mysterious and famous foreigner publicly known for his work on the genome project and you won im here talking to you so i guess i did im english which is hardly mysterious and a lot of people are known for what they did on the genome project it was an international effort involving many people rebecca nodded to the closed magazine its you everyone wrote about whats your prize parnell wished he could go back to science today who knows it wasnt a coquettish remark what section are you in if he had to talk it might as well be professional back of the bus stuff coordinating and crossreferencing overseas research with what were doing here where its applicable flagging up stuff that might be worthwhile our pursuing further concentrating upon id say that makes you a pretty important person too she sniggered there are a lot of units i dont do it all by myself any breakthroughs the girl hesitated not yet ever hopeful still quite a responsibility for someone who considers themself at the back of the bus theres a line manager checking me and a section head checking him its all very structured havent you appreciated everythings run here to a tightly ordered and controlled set of rules im beginning to get the idea i told you my secret now tell me yours parnell looked blankly at her i dont know what youre asking how come you got shifted so quickly from the back of the bus parnell no longer regretted putting his magazine aside trying to separate the discordant echoes of this exchange from the earlier one with russell benn how can you imagine theres something secret about it just like that he snapped his fingers everythings very structured she emphasized again you were given your space but you moved it it was temporary avoided parnell rebecca regarded him doubtfully over her coffee mug her sandwich abandoned half eaten youre at the heart of the spiders web now thats where the real research is and where i want and need to be to fulfil my appointment and justify the creation of the new department said parnell you want to be she isolated at once where i have to be parnell reiterated you really think genetics could bring about miracles no parnell immediately answered i think its an avenue with medical benefits that has to be explored to discover what its engineering can achieve and im going to be among the first to achieve it he promised himself i dont think hes our sort of team player judged russell benn itll take time predicted dwight newton in time hell learn or come to accept the way things work here im not so sure keep a tight handle on things russ on him the tightest of all you think theres anything ive missed you come tell me right away i dont want any disruption to the smooth way things always work here i know you dont said the black scientist but hes got a proven track record ive got an odd feeling an instinct that professionally hell be useful sufficiently useful to put up with his attitude problem arrogance is an irritation not a cause for censure said benn im suggesting we let things run their way for a while to discover for ourselves how good he really is thats what weve got to decide agreed newton just how good he is and how amenable he can be made to commercial reality came in benn on a familiar cue three it was richard parnells first ever commercialfirm seminar and even though he was not looped into the internal machinations of dubette inc he was conscious of a frisson ruffling the faint strands of the spiders web it was however peripheral to his establishing himself in his new innercircle surroundings which coincidentally on the day of the seminar he finally completed to achieve his selfimposed deadline parnell got to his section by six to supervise the technicians last installations and was fully set up with time for an unhurried breakfast of an eggtopped corned beef hash he saw rebecca langs approach from some way off the nameplated laboratory coat was replaced by a dark grey business suit which by the severity of its cut showed off an even more attractive figure than hed imagined there was more makeup too mascara and eye shadow parnell preferred her without either he smiled and said hi again what did you win she didnt reply stopping to look down at him as she had the day of the supposed bet no one told you bastards told me what grants addressing us he always does i was told theres a dress code he likes formality parnell looked down at his sweatshirt jeans and loafers before coming back up to her you are joking arent you about it being important how were dressed no i think its funny even if you dont anything that stupid has got to be funny i dont think its funny ill hide myself in the crowd promised parnell but he couldnt the seats were designated and his was in the second row directly in front of an already emplaced podium on a higher dais behind the podium were seats for the parentcompany directors and the chief executives from dubettes overseas divisions parnell was aware of the attention and the frowns of those around him as he edged along his reserved line to his assigned place parnell sensed the stir and rose with everyone else at the entry of the governing directors on to the raised area led by edward c grant the president was a small bullchested man the whiteness of his hair heightened by a deep tan the man made his way across the stage with the confidence of someone who knew seas would part if he demanded it he wore a dark blue suit that parnell realized had been copied by virtually everyone surrounding him parnells sweatshirt was yellow and he accepted that he stood out like a beacon being made him even more of a lighthouse among his smaller neighbours when the president came to the podium for his keynote address parnell at once became grants unremitting focus parnell stared back unperturbed hed heard of commercial companies ruled like medieval fiefdoms but always imagined the stories exaggerated by those in pure research to reassure themselves they were right to remain aloof in cosseted scientific academia the past year had been more successful than that preceding it opened grant there had been a per cent increase in aftertax profits which he was later that month going to announce to the stockholders with a recommendation for an overall salary increase the excellence of the research division gave every expectation of new or improved drugs being introduced into the marketplace medical breakthroughs even they could not however relax competition was intense and would remain so increase even turning to acknowledge one of the men assembled behind him grant said there had been from their french subsidiary a suggestion how to thwart reverseanalyses of their more successful drugs it was essential to guard against that from their competitors as it was against their products being pirated by such analyses particularly by third world countries pleading poverty as an excuse for manufacturing their own cheaper versions from published formulae denying companies like themselves the profits essential to recover their huge and continuing research expenditure during the past year dubette had initiated twentythree patent and copyright infringement actions in ten countries and so far had succeeded in fifteen with every confidence of the remaining eight being adjudged in their favour although too large and too diverse properly to fit the description grant nevertheless considered dubette a family structure people working together pulling together according to a strictly observed set of understandings like a united cohesive household parnell went through the motions of clapping along with everyone else and thought that the individual presentations from chief executives of dubettes foreignbased divisions that followed sounded exactly like an endofterm report to the headmaster they funnelled into a lounge of easy chairs and potted plants that adjoined the commissary today the furniture had been rearranged to create an open communal space premixed drinks were already laid out on a bartended table that ran the full length of the glassed wall overlooking the grassed park and its artificial lake parnell noted the concentration of people helping themselves was around the mineralwater selection he saved himself the search by asking one of the barmen for gin and tonic hed separated from rebecca lang at the entrance to the conference room and not seen where shed sat he saw her now though among the mineralwater group she saw him when she turned hesitated and then made her way towards him parnell said we got a cure for leprosy among what we make she smiled and said that bad he grinned back youre risking infection just talking to me ill check our stock list see what there is that i can take she had to tilt her head to look up at him you sure grew up big when you were small i worked out and ate up all my greens dubette should patent the formula you didnt tell me what you won you dont want to know there was a shift throughout the room at the arrival of the president with a retinue of division and overseas directors a general turning in their direction parnell said its your last chance to escape from where he stood and with his height parnell could see better than rebecca the approaching dignitaries in their carefully stagemanaged procession through the room he said theyre getting closer time for you to distance yourself dont mock me you wanna bet upon their picking on us youd have lost said parnell at the groups arrival we havent met announced the dubette president im edward c grant im started parnell but the burly whitehaired man said i know who you are richard and you rebecca to the woman he gave an odd headjerking bow coming back to parnell he said welcome to the dubette family thank you said parnell dwight newton was amidst the retinue which explained how he had been identified and the christianname familiarity was an americanism he was already used to think youre going to like it here demanded grant he had a short staccato delivery that made everything he said sound urgent there was no offered hand too early to tell yet rebecca had slightly withdrawn and parnell was conscious of the concentration from everyone in the room upon him and the smaller man who had to strain up even more than rebecca to look at him which parnell guessed would be an annoyance got everything you want i think i have now parnell was aware of newtons features tightening behind the president when are you going to start recruitment parnell wondered what excuse had been made for the delay about which grant obviously knew virtually at once were expecting great things from you richard im expecting great things from myself there was an overtheshoulder head jerk ive asked dwight to keep me up to speed like to be able to talk about something at the next seminar but he hadnt mentioned the creation of the new division in his keynote speech at this one parnell thought ive got some ideas but i dont expect things to move that fast id be disappointed if you didnt have ideas said grant positive sharpness in his voice thats why we made you our offer why were setting up the division and have given you the budget we have and thats why i accepted it expecting to be able to develop them through a company as large and extensive as this so were both rowing in the same direction was that a casual remark or a very direct reference to how close hed been to getting a rowing blue at cambridge university before his graduation parnell said lets hope we dont miss a stroke lets both of us very much hope you dont miss a stroke echoed the other man am i also expected to apologize for what frowned grant being improperly dressed the smile was as tight as the manner in which the man spoke youll know next time parnell was tempted to respond but didnt it wasnt after all a verbal contest as he led the group away grant said dont forget my expectations parnell decided not to reply to that either rebecca waited until the presidential party was beyond hearing before closing the gap between them parnell said i warned you to go under the wire when you still had a chance at least he knows my name now maybe not for the right reason ive thought about our stock list rebecca shrugged we dont do a leprosy treatment we wouldnt would we invited parnell refusing to pick up on their earlier lightness its largely eradicated except in underdeveloped countries and weve just been lectured that theres no profit trying to sell to the third world ouch grimaced rebecca you want to risk having dinner what time rebecca chose the restaurant italian just up wisconsin avenue from m street and said shed meet him there instead of his going all the way out to bethesda to pick her up parnell arrived intentionally early which gave him time to study the menu which looked good and get through most of a martini before she arrived she laughed the moment she saw him and said weve got to start getting this dress code right she wore jeans and a suede shirt hed changed into a blazer with the cambridge university breastpocket motif and grey trousers parnell said lets keep surprising each other rebecca nodded to a matching martini and parnell ordered a second he offered the menu but she said i know what im going to have i worked through college as a waitress here i get special treatment she did the owner giorgio falcone genuinely italianborn personally returned with the drinks and kissed her and shook parnells hand effusively and recommended the veal which parnell accepted rebecca and the owner conversed in italian and the moustached chef who was introduced only as ciro was brought from the kitchen to be introduced as well when they were finally alone parnell said im impressed youre supposed to be im showing off why just because she said fluent in italian difficult not to be mom was italian she nodded to the departing owner hes my uncle looks after me you do me wrong you get a contract put out on you parnell laughed with her liking the atmosphere so a local girl with connections georgetown university reserve intern at johns hopkins for a year then dubette for fame and fortune listed rebecca short on the fame at the moment but the moneys good and there was a promise of more this morning remember was this the moment to put the questions he asked himself it might puncture the mood and he didnt want to risk that not yet edging towards it though he said quite a lot to remember from this morning what do you think i told you what i think i think the place is kneedeep in bullshit and posturing and you dont like bullshit and posturing they paused for their first courses and for parnell to taste the barollo another owner recommendation its not going to affect me or what ive taken the job to do you always been this confident ive always known what i wanted to do from the day of my first science lesson specialization came at university how parnell hesitated genetics was comparatively new a lot of opportunities quickly to become known in the field she finished she raised her glass and said heres to ambition you have a degree in psychology native intuition ive told you about me tell me about you brought up by my grandmother while my abandoned unmarried mother qualified as a solicitor grammar school i dont know what the equivalent is here in america scholarship to cambridge university graduated in time to become involved in the genome project worked with a lot of very qualified and clever guys learned everything i could from them and achieved the fame she quickly finished again i finished off what a lot of those very qualified and clever guys began which i said at the time i read it you were very generous honest he insisted i think thats been noticed their plates were changed more wine poured deciding the remark made the timing right parnell said am i missing something i certainly am with that question protested rebecca about dubette its as if theres a second meaning behind everything thats said or done all this dress code and understood rules and family crap crap because theres an atmosphere an impression that people are insecure frightened almost which is me compounding the nonsense dubette are big payers the best in the business people with commitments kids dont want to lose bigpaying jobs rebecca began twirling her glass between her fingers her meal forgotten looking down into the wine why should they lose their bigpaying jobs unless they screw up you get a good job you do it properly do it well not to lose it dubette expect the biggest commitment to be to them total loyalty you signed the confidentiality contract didnt you of course i did its pretty standard commercial practice according to the lawyer who negotiated for me i dont see how it alters my argument or affects yours i think you might have given the impression that youre too independent that youre oh i dont know not respectful enough a flush came briefly to her face showing up freckles around her nose because i got my laboratory where it should have been in the first place and didnt wear a jacket and tie to edward c grants party come on rebecca i was just offering a thought what about the laboratory you get included in this afternoons tour parnell shook his head passed me by how do you read that i dont and wont said parnell but who were the bastards you kept on about this morning you were set up to go into the seminar like you did newton should have told you or benn or someone someone like you someone like me she accepted only i didnt think id have to i already told you im not going to become part of it he had asked enough questions to indicate otherwise parnell conceded dont you think weve talked enough shop she suddenly demanded more than enough agreed parnell rebecca had used her own car to get in from bethesda so she drove him home refusing to start the car until he had fastened his seat belt thats how mom and dad died driving without their belts done up he didnt suggest she come up to his apartment for a final nightcap which she didnt appear to expect she kept the engine running and said shed probably see him the following day in a voice from which he inferred she wouldnt be particularly concerned if she didnt when he did arrive that following day at the office hed allocated to himself adjoining the main general research area there were four responses to his genetics specialists advertisements and three for the secretarial vacancy there was also an email from the personnel director saying that a psychological assessment appointment had been made for him for three oclock that afternoon at dubettes fully staffed medical centre four what psychological assessment demanded parnell its a provision under the employment contract reminded the personnel director his name was wayne denny from their one previous encounter when the man had been one of the selection panel parnell remembered a small almost diminutive man who blinked a lot through thicklensed glasses and found it necessary to consult papers and documents he never appeared able to locate parnell knew such assessments were contractual provisions from the earlier guidance given by his lawyer when hed seriously considered terminating his appointment before it had even begun psychological assessments come before employment not after if i flunk it although not having transgressed any company policy you going to pay me off with a twoyear salary compensation thats the severance term isnt it is there something medical or mental you havent been totally forthcoming about asked the man from the other end of the telephone whats the real question behind that question refused parnell you seem very uptight resistant ive got a job to do a department to set up i want to get on with it so theres nothing you have withheld honesty is a legal requirement in the contract said parnell a reminder of his own yes it is agreed the man surely they werent for whatever reason legally seeking cause to get rid of him paranoia he thought at once why not invoke it why oppose the assessment im not opposing any assessment just any further unnecessary timewasting i should have talked to you about your diary convenience im sorry but things have been moving slowly havent they you want a postponement hed be conforming becoming one of the unprotesting herd if he agreed but making an equally meaningless gesture if he demanded a rescheduling ill be there as close to three as i can manage better warn him i could be late if hes got other appointments she corrected denny what she repeated the man the psychologist is a woman barbara spacey and itll be ok if youre late shes blocked out her diary for the whole afternoon parnell remained unmoving for a long time after replacing gently holding back from slamming down the receiver it would be very easy to become paranoid do something behave somehow to draw more attention to himself than he appeared already to have done maybe he was expected to he thought and at once recognized that that was paranoid but why why in gods name was all this idiocy happening could it actually be psychological trying to fit him into a convenient mental mould another in the obedient flock why not go with the flow very definitely not join the herd but just as definitely not emerge the maverick until he worked out the silly process in which hed become embroiled exasperating though the distraction was parnell asked for and immediately got a temporary secretary a matronly greyhaired woman from the pool and replied to all the applications so far staggering his interviews over the following week which gave him the intervening weekend fully to go through the geneticists submissions all of which looked impressive while his responses were being typed he referenced the three applicants on the internet and discovered two had submitted papers to scientific journals he printed off both one was on the possible application of genetics to the treatment of hepatitis b the other to the prevalence of genetic inheritance of downs syndrome he judged both to be sound certainly indicating a strong basic genetic knowledge but lacking any substantive rethinking both the secretarial replies one from a medical secretary at johns hopkins the other from the george washington hospital listed dc addresses and parnell arranged appointments for the following day parnell considered calling rebecca on her internal extension but decided against it he decided too against eating in the commissary going instead for the first time to the staff health centre the gymnasium had every piece of equipment hed ever seen anywhere and some weighttraining apparatus he hadnt there was a bank of rowing machines three in use far superior to any upon which hed ever trained parnell counted five logoidentified personal trainers all working with individual clients the sauna and steam room matched the olympicproportioned swimming pool and parnell thought it would be easy and good getting back to the rowing fitness hed once known but let lapse for far too long when he returned to his office all his mail was immaculately prepared for signature and there was an email from rebecca thanking him for the previous evening it was still only two thirty but parnell set out to be early not late wondering how barbara spacey would assess that psychologically she was a large neglected woman who could have shed at least lb in the sports centre hed just left without it even showing the straggly hair had deposited a snowfall of dandruff over a handknitted cardigan with odd buttons two of which were missing and the ashtray on her desk was mountained with butts although she wasnt smoking when he entered she sat in front of not behind her desk so there would be no separation between them his positioned chair was just a little over a metre from hers in a direct line she smiled briefly showing nicotineyellowed teeth i was warned you might be late she had a hoarse smokers voice too i got through earlier than i expected you think this is going to be a waste of time just bullshit parnell didnt think he showed surprise at the abruptness of the question isnt that for you to decide isnt that your avoiding the question i understand its a common employment process although as i am already employed it seems a little out of sequence i havent undergone the process before so ive no criteria to judge if its worthwhile or not so it really is for you to decide you smoke no do you mind if i do no i shouldnt of course theres a strict nonsmoking policy within the building she lit her cigarette from a battered zippo parnell shrugged unsure if there was a point to the admission what about you richard what about me he frowned you buck the system get impatient with rules and regulations you cant see the purpose of so there was a point sometimes what about here you found things you dont see the purpose of here parnell wished he wasnt so close to the cigarette smoke i havent been here long enough it was becoming an escape cliche he recognized you were quite a presence at the seminar there was very definitely an intention behind this belated interview uncaring of the impatience he said it wasnt intended as any sort of statement i simply didnt know youd have conformed if you had known certainly to have avoided all the nonsense thats followed no one told you parnell sighed no no one told me you resent that i think it was childish and therefore totally irrelevant so you did resent it something else for you to judge it seemed more likecrossexamination from a courtroom soap opera than what hed expected a psychological assessment to be how you liking america very much no homesickness adjustment difficulties parnell snorted a laugh no homesickness no adjustment difficulties no overhanging relationships then no youre not married no he nodded sideways to her desk it says im not on my personnel file there barbara spacey gave no response divorced no it says that on the personnel file too children no also in the file parents alive my mother what about your father i never knew a father whoever he was he left my mother unmarried when she became pregnant you hate him for doing that walking out on her no the psychologist used the act of stubbing out her cigarette to cover the doubtful pause i find that hard to believe makes her pregnant and then turns his back on his responsibility wasnt that better than doing his duty and spending the rest of their lives unhappy or later going through the trauma of a divorce they might have become happy in time thats hypothetical what about your mother you despise her for becoming pregnant thats an absurd question erupted parnell discarding the determination not to lose his temper she didnt abandon me she worked her way through college qualified as a lawyer took me through school and college i love her admire her shes a fantastic woman so you despise me for asking an absurd question yes answered parnell fuck you he thought how would you feel about a wordassociation test you know daynight blackwhite the first word that enters your head she clicked her stained fingers quick as that ive never played one before but if you want to lets do it to get it over with she was very definitely goading him youve allocated all afternoon to me so were in no hurry are we night she suddenly demanded black he said at once not caught out sea boat woman mother god philosophy war death medicine cure disease pestilence king exalted president parnell hesitated america tyranny overthrow sermon speech church house choir song failure mistake barbara spacey sat back in her chair a fresh cigarette adding to the rooms fug i expected you to cheat reply with a word you thought id want to hear how do you know i didnt its my job to know on your application and cv you put yourself down as a protestant but you dont believe in god do you parnell shifted uncomfortable with the analysis a lot of scientists dont why didnt you say so on your personal application i thought protestant would look better than agnostic or atheist americas a pretty religious country isnt it honest now but not then ive got the job now i didnt have it then which is it agnostic i suppose you did cheat once in the test didnt you parnell accepted that barbara spacey was unsettling him more with her analysis than she had done by provocation perhaps one was a professional precursor of the other yes so what was the word you really thought of when i said president exalted why didnt you say it i had once already you could have used it again wouldnt it have meant the same not necessarily ill remember next time you expect there to be a next time something else for you to decide you have any problem with authority she said i dont understand the question accepting it i dont think so how do you feel about exercising it im not sure i understand that question either you ever been in a position of authority before have power over a bunch of people no it frighten you i havent thought about it think about it now you take on someone with an impressive cv but he turns out not to be so good makes mistakes affects your whole division what do you do tell him hes screwing up that if he doesnt shape up his jobs on the line he makes an effort but it isnt any good i give him the mandatory warnings and then tell him hes got to go hes got a kid with a permanent illness that needs the medical cover that comes with his job here thats why hes screwing up hes distracted it would have been on his personnel file barbara spacey frowned offbalanced by the reply so i would have asked early on to look at the kids case notes tried to find out if thered been any genetic exploration personal involvement like that would be against company policy sos smoking on the premises if our distracted father was willing and the case notes indicated the slightest benefit from genetic exploration id say wed have a situation everyone should take advantage of parnell saw the woman was about to speak but everything would be legally consensual with signed documents and agreements nothing that would lay myself or dubette open to any legal or ethical challenges the psychologist didnt try to speak after all seemingly thinking then she said you do your genetics exploration it doesnt help the guys work doesnt improve then he has to go you think you could do that if the department was being continually undermined yes and you if you were being continually undermined im going to be its director the departments failures and weaknesses will be my failures and weaknesses barbara spacey finally moved her head towards the personnel file on her desk you havent failed much so far have you richard its been a pretty uninterrupted upwards climb ive worked hard to make it so so you deserve it parnell considered his answer yes i think ive deserved it the zippo flared again weve used all our afternoon up howd i do interesting thats what scientists say when theyre confronted by something they dont recognize or understand the woman dutifully laughed as do a lot of other confused people as well im intrigued by your word responses they didnt fit a pattern were they supposed to barbara spacey shook her head positively thats whats intriguing do i get a copy of the assessment its a legal requirement ill look forward to it try to avoid being too independent advised the psychologist people need people its whats called human nature i thought it was called tribal instinct its warm in the winter said the woman or when theres more of them than you richard parnell preferred the second secretarial applicant a middleaged woman named kathy richardson who currently worked at the george washington hospital but he deferred any decision because by the following afternoon when he met her there were two more enquiries one from baltimore and the other from new york there were also four more approaches from doctoratequalified research assistants one a woman listing genetics experience parnell got the same pool secretary as the previous day and scheduled confirmed meetings with each accepting as he did that with the possibility of postponements and rearrangements a full fortnight if not longer was going to be taken up with job interviews he sent an advisory memorandum to dwight newton who replied that it was essential to get the selection right the first time and that he should take as much time as he considered necessary the final paragraph asked for three days advanced warning of the selection process parnell kept to his intention to spend the early part of saturday rereading those cvs so far submitted and which he had taken home with him from mclean but still arrived at the tidal basin before rebecca she wore no makeup and had followed his advice with the bill cap thick sweater and jeans so were going on the river she guessed dont you like the water lets find out there were only tourist skiffs available thickbodied and cumbersome compared to the racing sculls to which he was accustomed and rebecca hindered more than helped by trying too enthusiastically to steer too often taking the boat across instead of into the current once they got out on to the potomac he went upriver past the canoe club by the key bridge disappointed that he began so quickly to feel the strain across his back and shoulders and resolved yet again to use the sports facilities in the dubette building despite his slowly recited instructions she brought the boat about too sharply for the turn actually shipping water it was easier going downstream but parnell was still relieved to get back into the basin they snacked off hot dogs from a stall and at the standup table rebecca announced im impressed youre supposed to be said parnell uncomfortable now at the posturing he so easily criticized in others because of the sudden embarrassment he cut short the account of coming as close as he had to representing cambridge in the traditional annual boat race but you didnt make it no pissed off very never the loser never if i can help it they walked without any positive direction across constitution gardens but decided against going to the smithsonian when he suggested a movie she said or we could food shop and i could cook dinner at your place they shopped in the supermarket in the basement of the watergate building and parnell bought cooking wine and drinking wine from an adjoining liquor store hed anticipated spaghetti instead rebecca cooked beef and shallots in her chosen wine with a garlicky vegetable stew followed by a soft goats cheese hed never tasted before there wasnt a lot of conversation clearing away and afterwards they settled together on the couch although she was distanced from him by how she curled her legs beneath her creating a barrier between them their small talk became smaller and smaller after a long pause he said you dont want to go out to a movie absolutely not anything just staying here is good i think its good too i told you i brought some clothes things i thought you just said he began but she stopped him i mean i dont have to go all the way back to bethesda tonight what about your mafia connections rebecca sniggered welcoming the lightness i was trying to impress you like you tried earlier breaking your back rowing up and down the river so were quits not quite i told you a lie about the bet there never was one i just wanted to speak to you im glad i want this to be right so do i so this isnt any big deal not unless it becomes one ok ok you think you can manage after all that rowing we wont know until we try they tried twice and afterwards wetly pressed against him rebecca said im not sure ill be able to manage once you get in shape ill be gentle dont be five the eventual establishment of dubettes pharmacogenomics unit took a further month and a half the secretarial choice remained parnells but having gone through a similar process himself he should objectively have known the choice would be decided not by him alone but by a filleting committee composed of himself dwight newton russell benn wayne denny company lawyer peter baldwin and the deputy head of the budgetary division parnells budget was sufficient for a scientific staff of six with a review after a year his rejection of five candidates as underqualified was supported by the selection panel the strongest argument against his choice of the one woman applicant came from russell benn who insisted she was too inexperienced having only graduated from medical school three years earlier it took parnell an hour to win a majority decision in beverley jacksons favour arguing her graduation pass was the highest of any applicant that shed already risen to joint deputy of the genetics research department at johns hopkins and published two respected scientific journal papers on the genetics links with drug research two of the other applicants one from los angeles cedars of lebanon hospital the other from the research department at harvard medical school had also published impressively on the genome project ted lapidus a fourth applicant and the oldest candidate with specialized experience in his native athens before moving from greece to the george washington hospital in dc actually questioned one of parnells own published opinions which is a pretty good way of talking yourself out of a job opened newton in the afterinterview analysis i want a man with that sort of confidence contradicted parnell he probably sees himself taking over your job warned benn then hes going to work like hell isnt he replied parnell i want that too parnells longest theoretical scientific discussion about applying genetics to drug development came with deke pulbrow another johns hopkins university candidate for almost fortyfive minutes the two men conducted a debate that more than proved to parnells satisfaction that pulbrow had a much broader and deeper understanding of pharmacogenomics than had been obvious in the journal publication that parnell had found disappointing not once did newton or benn intrude a comment or offer an opinion parnell was surprised at newtons luncheon invitation to a logframed inn in the north virginia countryside not the dubette commissary the day after they made their final selection i want us to get along declared the research and development director at the bar the thin man was drinking mineral water parnell chose gin so do i said parnell he was already getting a deja vu echo from this conversation deja vu upon deja vu in fact you really believe you can map a genetically matched responder to a genetically acceptable drug cutting out all the rejection not all acknowledged parnell realistically a lot hopefully how much is a lot i cant give an estimate not yet ballpark figure pressed newton id be satisfied with fifty per cent matching fifty per cent of effective drugs to responsive patients persisted newton parnell didnt hurry his reply matching responsive drugs to responsive patients was the very science of pharmacogenomics which newton which none of them should have needed explaining so why was newton demanding just that i dont think i could aim higher who knows so you fit an acceptable drug to a genetically accepting patient you knock two or three four maybe other drugs from a cocktail administration newton paused as if seeking an example aids or hepatitis for instance when the waiter came with the menu parnell ordered another gin and tonic and chose scrod newton took the same impatient with the interruption aids or hepatitis prompted the research director when the waiter left if we get the match right we wont need the two or three or four others stated parnell flatly so we lose fifty per cent of the sale of two or three or four other drugs i said it was an estimate maybe i wont get that high there was an obvious direction to this conversation parnell recognized lets use it urged newton you start reducing drug multiplication by fifty per cent youre talking of a lot less drugs being prescribed for a hell of a lot of conditions you understand what im saying i understand that its your business parnell stopped to correct himself my business now dubettes business to sell drugs that its a commercial operation but i dont believe thered be a dramatic financial fall if im anywhere near successful which i stress ive no guarantee of being in either the short or long term my specialized science is still very experimental what for instance if we slot one of the unnecessary cocktail medicines into a condition where its properly effective you get an increase not a decrease in sales to the commercial benefit of dubette and the medical benefit of the patients taking it everyones a winner you cant guarantee that parnell felt the irritation rising i cant guarantee anything except by a compensatory measure an increase in the sales of one matched drug more than making up for any loss from the reduced sales of another what did you think of barbara spaceys psychological assessment the profile had come in the middle of the first of the interminable selection weeks the psychologist described him as independently minded verging upon overconfidence with a predilection to decide upon and follow his own opinions and judgements over those of others it was shed judged a tendency that could in fact lead to misjudgements her conclusion was that he should be encouraged to share and discuss his work throughout the research division parnell said seemed to jar a few chords thats what worries me conceded newton youve lost me complained parnell youre not here to jar things said newton throwing parnells word back at him you start a programme you think has got potential but which might detrimentally affect one of our existing products i want to know about it in fact i want to be kept fully up to speed on everything you do on every programme you and your new staff embark on no independentmindedness ok of course youll know what im doing said parnell which wasnt the undertaking newton had demanded the waiter told them their table was ready and as they made their way towards it newton said a guy can live very comfortably at dubette you remember the presidents salaryreview promise at the seminar yes said parnell questioningly its going to be ten per cent you havent even started to work properly yet and your salary has already gone up ten per cent parnell dismissed what had clearly been a conformity warning from dwight newton just as hed dismissed the much earlier but virtually identical conversation with russell benn but not contemptuously both jobdependent men were overlooking how long it might take years potentially genetically to refine a drug cocktail to a single constituent dosage until that happened it wasnt a personal consideration if indeed it would ever become one he was concerned with his science and its beneficial use not the price on the label parnell had had time on his hands during the appointments hiatus and partially to fill it established a rigid fitness schedule at the health centre by the end of the month hed dropped almost lb most of it he was sure excess stomach flab when he ate lunch with rebecca he swapped saltbeef sandwiches for salads and after three days she started to do the same and complained that shed picked him out for sex not healthy eating in the comparable period she lost lb their relationship settled to both their satisfaction although it was rebecca who occasionally insisted that it remained only a relationship with no binding commitments they spent most weekends together more often at his more central apartment than at bethesda where she rented a small clapboard house with a garden which turned out to be her hobby parnell helped on the occasions they did stay there but strictly under her direction after killing a longestablished honeysuckle climber he believed himself to be pruning the honeysuckle mistake occurred on the final sixth week and he took her withdrawal as annoyance at his gardening stupidity finally he said if you want me to say it again im sorry i cut your flowering thing down ill buy you another to replace it what asked rebecca they were in the lounge of the bethesda cottage littered with the fallout of the sunday newspapers you havent said more than four words since i cut the honeysuckle down its not the fucking honeysuckle the vehemence startled him he came forward towards her and said hey whats the problem here theres something odd happening at dubette they couldnt dodge it all the time when hed told her of the psychological assessment shed mocked that it was totally right that he was an arrogant son of a bitch but most of the time they avoided talking about the firm she nodded saying nothing what for christs sake i told you i dont know rebecca youre not making a lot of sense you want to talk about it i want to listen but talk in words i can understand rebecca straightened in her chair forcing herself out of her reverie theres some stuff coming in stuff im not being allowed to assess and pass on up the line youre being sidelined rebecca shook her head its bypassing my line manager too its divisional director to dwight newton we wouldnt have known it was even happening except for a misdirected email asking for confirmation that it had arrived which didnt tell us anything but sent newton into apeshitting cartwheels so its not personal persisted parnell its never happened before not since ive been in the division relax theres got to be a hundred reasons why things go between subdirector to god himself without going the normal route its never happened before rebecca insisted i heard you the first time the email came from paris so said parnell havent you wondered what our ultimate god edward c grant himself meant at the seminar about a way to prevent our products being reverseanalysed for cheaper manufacture i am now said parnell six richard parnell looked around his finally assembled staff and said there were times i never thought wed get here that bad smiled beverley jackson sympathetically that long complained parnell it seemed far longer than just a month and a half and now that everything and everyone was in place there was a hesitating moment of anticlimax parnell said but at last were here now weve got to prove ourselves and that ours is not a jungle science a what challenged mark easton at once he was one of the two original geneticist applicants a languid blondhaired clippedvoiced bostonian whod worked at john hopkins parnell smiled hoping to cover the thoughtless tooglib expression pharmacogenonomics is new were new theres got to be a coming together with everyone else here which he singularly hadnt bothered to do since his arrival he acknowledged were surely among qualified people sufficiently qualified at least to know about the existence of genes and their potential application took up ted lapidus there was little trace of an accent the greek had a very full drooping moustache that made him look permanently doleful even the smile which accompanied the overstressed cynicism was mournful i misspoke parnell apologized this was sliding downhill into an awkward opening day lets just not forget our newness and human nature dubette go in for rules although theyre mostly understood rather than official within dubette the recurring theme is that its one big happy family were not an accepted part of that family not yet oh christ he thought hearing his own voice and seeing the expressions of those facing him i was trained that science builds upon the free exchange of ideas and theories thats how i want us to operate any of you get or already have an hypothesis you follow it and talk about it to each and every one of us if in the end it doesnt pan out it doesnt pan out more experiments and research fails than succeeds as you all know at least well have taken a possibility as far as we can he paused as an idea came to him but decided against proposing it until hed more fully thought it through supposing that it was something he should mention first to dwight newton before he could go on deke pulbrow said you mean there isnt going to be a formulated schedule integrated with what other sections are working on parnell decided that pulbrow would definitely need advice about the dress code for the next seminar beneath the regulation nameplated laboratory coat the man wore bibandbraces overalls and a denim work shirt parnell said no i dont mean that at all i very definitely expect and intend to work in tandem with the rest of this division and to get channelled through to us via the ongoing research here anything that comes in from overseas its our contribution thats got to be innovative the most obvious is nucleotide polymorphism of dubette products weve been set up genetically to research and develop treatments and drugs in conjunction if necessary with the traditional chemical experimentation that until now has been dubettes established route parnell accepted that he was preaching to the converted but he hoped at least he was making better sense than the careless way in which hed begun bacteria are genetic declared lapidus already theres been complete genetic sequencing of streptococcus aureus streptococcus pneumoniae mycobacterium tuberculosis helicobacter pylori pseudomonas aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae genetics and its engineering in the drug development for treatment of such conditions has already been scientifically accepted are you seriously telling us that theres a resistance here parnell acknowledged that he was very obviously before an audience being tested by the man whom dwight newton had judged to be a potential challenger for his job you missed off your list the genome of a prototypic streptomycete streptomyces coelicolor reminded parnell confronting professional knowledge with professional knowledge and yes thats exactly what im seriously telling you and that is my battle to fight as head of this department no one broke into the pause this time smiling at the greek geneticist determined to come out the winner of the exchange parnell said im grateful for your listing although i know none of us needed reminding of it any more than any of us needed reminding of the potential of genome exploration in combating disease precisely what disease demanded peter battey the second of the original washingtonbased applicants a balding pebblespectacled man ive already told you i havent worked out a specific tandem schedule i wont until ive had detailed discussions with russell benn across the corridor but there are obvious targets and i think we should shoot for as many as we can so were going for the top prizes aids hepatitis b cancers influenza variants common cold enumerated beverley jackson it wasnt a sardonic professionally combative list like that of the greek geneticist needing a matching confrontation his unspoken idea came again into parnells mind as he said why not i dont expect wont have any of you backing off from a project thats taken everyone else into a culdesac its because theyve ended in dead ends that weve got to try something different something newer and better if we can think of something newer and better said lapidus doubtfully the only way to find out is to try said sean sato the japaneseamerican had the deeply black hair of his asian ancestry but was taller almost he was immaculately and fastidiously dressed beneath the laboratory uniform the clubpatterned tie tight behind a pincollared shirt the trousers of his muted check suit razorcreased above mirrorpolished brogues it wasnt a sycophantic remark parnell immediately guessed youre arriving with some alreadyformed ideas the mans smile was apologetic not so much preformed projects that could be added to the list such as this first gettingtoknoweachother meeting was evolving far differently from how hed expected but it was better than hed imagined certainly thered been some professional posturing but already they were scratching the surface into which he wanted them more deeply to dig i could be accused of personal interest announced sato i wont accuse you until i hear what it is promised parnell theres a lot of concentration upon aids rightly so said the man eagerly his gesture towards beverley was a polite bow theres a lot of concentration upon hepatitis b rightly so again seventyfive per cent of the thirtyfive million suffering from it are in the western pacific and south east asia region which very much includes japan but in less than five years with little if any reduction in that figure it will be overtaken by hepatitis c an obviously genetically linked but wholly different strain of the same disease at the moment the only antiviral agent that suppresses hepatitis b is lamivudine which is also effective in treating hiv already there are some indications of superbug resistance to lamivudine if that resistance becomes established it will reduce any fight against not only hepatitis b but c as well and aids which conveniently rounds the square to drug resistance began parnell not quite refused lapidus interferon is a very successful treatment for hepatitis c if the disease is identified sufficiently early accepted sato the problem is that its usually without symptoms until its too late by which time liver disease and cancer are already established the last paper i read estimated in five years from now ten at the most more people will be dying of the c strain than from aids far better than hed expected parnell thought again it could scarcely even be acknowledged as the first step but this was exactly how he wanted them to work arguing not to prove him or herself more knowledgeable or qualified but properly expertly bouncing ideas and theories off each other thats a chickenandegg situation said beverley if disease is already generally established before there are any noticeable symptoms the answer must be in much earlier screening of risk groups and youve already identified them demographically perhaps i havent explained myself sufficiently said sato earlier screening is obviously a factor and when the seriousness of hepatitis c is globally recognized governments will have to devise a better and quicker diagnostic system some indeed have already started to move in that direction what im talking about is a new drug or treatment when chronic liver inflammation or cirrhosis or cancer is already there lets start our list with it decided parnell unwilling for a specific discussion to become too protracted this soon he decided too against remarking upon their seemingly unconscious adoption of his operating plan to do so would have sounded schoolmasterly and he considered hed already suffered too much from that himself instead he said i think things have started well i do want drug rejection and resistance to be on our agenda that is where we might make our most obvious hopefully even quick contribution he nodded towards lapidus were all familiar with the diseases that have already been genetically coded i want our work to identify others high on our agenda even before we start properly liaising with the people next door he hesitated nodding now towards his side office on the subject of doors mine isnt ever going to be closed any problems difficulties anything at all upsetting anyone i want to know about it and i want them solved not gestating out of their proper proportions thank you for coming to work with me i think its going to turn out just fine did he really think that first an anticlimax now uncertainty about something he couldnt identify unless that is it was not about his international acclaim as a genetic explorer but selfdoubt at his personal competence to control administrate financially supervise and lead as he was determined to lead along the forevergodsgifted upward spiral parnell was as unaccustomed to selfdoubt as he was to commercial science he wasnt sure he liked either parnell was surprised at the sameday response from dwight newton promptly although not prematurely on time for the agreed meeting the earlier uncertainties boxed away hopefully forever neither was to be ashamed of each was understandable acceptable there was no avuncular standinginreadiness greeting this time from the research and development vice president instead the stickthin man remained behind his desk gazing up from between humped shoulders spidersleg fingers at momentary rest before him easily remembering the upbeat reachforthesky presentations at the seminar parnell enthused about his opening encounter with his staff unembarrassed at the hypocrisy of intentional phrases like team players and pulling together as he recounted that mornings gathering the scuttleready hands remained unmoving newton said i told you i always wanted to know what was going on ive just told you i would have liked to have sat in on it it was a gettingtogether of a team nothing formal nothing formative i would still have liked to have been there ive found where the washrooms are now retorted parnell and can go there all by myself and i wash my hands afterwards i dont understand that remark protested newton you asked to be fully informed of everything that happens in my section you just have been fully informed i dont expect everything i say or do or initiate to be monitored ive been given the responsibility of a department which i intend to fulfil according to the terms of my employment ive made it perfectly clear to you that i want to know every intended genetic research project before it is initiated not after there could be conflict with other parallel research not if its carried out as it should be with total coordinated exchanges between every section broke in parnell i am the ultimate coordinator said newton ill decide if theres a conflict or unnecessary duplication what appears to be parallel duplication cant be avoided if my section genetically compares and crossreferences matching although alternative experimentation thats the whole purpose of pharmacogenomics being set up here forming a part of what becomes a whole i will coordinate and decide upon everything that is conducted in the research and development division of this organization pedantically insisted newton the fingers at last scrabbling back and forth in exasperation ill make that clear in a written memorandum which perhaps i should have done earlier there seems to have been some verbal misunderstanding there was no benefit in any longer revolving on this argumentative carousel parnell recognized just as he recognized the weak threat of putting this latest disagreement on written record i came here to talk about something else what demanded the research vice president the peculiar fingers drumming out his impatience at the dispute ending on parnells terms not his science all sciences benefit from exchange from the crossfertilization of ideas are you lecturing consciously to irritate or arent you aware how you sound i want to set up a dedicated website announced parnell the hands stopped newton became quite still his rising colour the only indication of his incredulity heightened when he finally spoke by the way in which he spaced the words youwanttodowhat set up a website dedicated to my section repeated the more controlled parnell upon which every competitor can log on and work out not just what you but every other dubette research section might be working on and anticipate every patent and licence before we even apply for it are you actually expecting me to take you seriously he hadnt properly balanced the counterargument conceded parnell i think thats a minimal danger dependent entirely upon how the research is set out what i propose lets hypothesize just to amuse ourselves and show this up as the insane absurd idea it is persisted newton relentlessly lets say someone outside the company suggests something you incorporate whose copyright exclusive patent or licence will it be how many civil courts in how many countries do you imagine wed keep in business for the next millennium arguing infringement or plagiarism actions let me tell you parnell tried yet again no refused the other man loudly youre not going to tell me anything i am going to tell you you will not set up any dedicated website now or in the foreseeable future if indeed the future for you here at dubette is foreseeable i will put my refusal and my reasons for it in writing too and attach to it the legally binding and agreed confidentiality agreement signed by you as a condition of your employment to which i want a written response from you that youve read that agreement and fully understand it lets start right now you understand everything every single thing ive just told you parnell burned with the humiliation accepting that hed not only been outargued but that the defeat was entirely of his own making shortly he said yes i understand the next time we talk i want common sense not nonsense said newton warmed by the conviction that hed irreparably punctured all the previous insufferable arrogance he couldnt remember enjoying himself so much for a long time it sounds like a onevictim massacre if there is such a thing sympathized rebecca it was admitted parnell god knows what kathy imagined id done when i dictated the reply newton insisted upon kathy richardson was the greying middleaged divorcee whom hed finally engaged as his secretary the only position dwight newton hadnt insisted be considered by the appointments committee hardly a day to celebrate said rebecca they were eating in her uncles restaurant accustomed now to the food and wine choice being made for them and to ciro sometimes talking them through special dishes hed created always just for you two i wanted a change from eating crow said parnell and it was a good day until the newton episode i think theyre all going to come together very well shouldnt you give it more than a firstday impression like you should have given the website idea more thought cautioned the woman i am only talking firstday impression said parnell and ive already admitted to the other mistake i still dont believe it represented more than a one or two per cent danger five tops darling to a company like dubette the one or two per cent possibility of a competitor getting into its research is a major drama five per cent registers ten on the richter scale youre not involved in pure science any more youve got to remember that i will in future believe me parnell didnt like losing certainly not to someone like newton whom he judged to be a bully but it had been an illconsidered mistake and he was determined not to make another i asked outright suddenly blurted rebecca what frowned parnell totally confused my section head burt showcross i asked him outright what all the secrecy was about between france and us what did he say his mind blocked by the humiliating confrontation with newton parnell had forgotten his earlier conversation with rebecca about backchannelled secrecy from dubettes french division that he didnt know either but that it sometimes happened and that i wasnt to concern myself with it any of it again parnell was about to say that she should let it go at that but was halted by a sudden thought instead he said if paris has come up with something theyre excited about something to which theyre attaching such a degree of priority and secrecy it could be something which has an application to pharmacogenomics rebecca shrugged who knows but guess what parnell wished rebecca didnt so often conduct conversations like a quiz game what there was a mistyped report from paris a good enough excuse to telephone them direct while i was chatting to the girl i normally deal with i was told the chief executive had been recalled to new york along with the researchdivision head who misdirected that one message that no one not even showcross was supposed to see i think you should do what showcross told you forget about it maybe its been a bad day for both of us forget about it repeated parnell he wasnt sure he would though seven edward c grant said i needed to speak to you like this just the two of us discreetly of course agreed dwight newton who had caught the first shuttle from washington that morning wanting to be at the dubette corporate building before the president hed failed hed been careful to wear his seminar suit which matched the dark grey of grants and to enter as instructed in the summons by the special penthouseonly elevator were talking risk assessment announced the dubette president i understand newton thought the footballpitch size of grants desk accentuated the mans bantamcock shortness it was a good idea to have security check everything out as thoroughly as they did it was a safeguard to let the other man imagine hed initiated the precaution which he hadnt after what grant regarded as the one and only mistake of his life relegating that in his mind to a lapse more than a mistake he now took no risks that amounted to praise newton decided i thought so i had the same done in paris that was useful too youve seen everything i sent up about the website proposal grant nodded tapping a folder on the left of his desk you did good there too dwight i wish others had newton was quite relaxed which he rarely was in grants presence certainly on a onetoone basis but hed calculated the situation from every which way and concluded that he was probably the only person who couldnt be accused of mistake or misjudgement it certainly seemed that way from the conversation so far guessing the other mans reference he said whats the take from paris buckpassing replied grant at once i hauled saby back for a personal explanation and mendaille obviously newton was surprised properly realizing how seriously the president was treating the misdirected communication henri saby was the chief executive of the french subsidiary georges mendaille was head of research in paris and the man personally responsible for the mistake what do they say saby entirely blames mendaille mendaille says it was a simple but understandable mistake that out of habit he mishit the automatically logged email address sending it to washington in the normal way instead of personally to you which was the specific instruction if it was the specific instruction mendaille shouldnt have been hitting keys from habit said newton he should have been concentrating exactly toadying bastard thought grant but hadnt he made everyone with whom he had to deal a toadying bastard you firing him grant shook his head dismissed hed be resentful wanting to hit back a potential whistleblower i want him where i can see him know what hes doing all the time the man paused mendailles our hostage were not ever going to be his thats the way it always works there was another pause which brings us back to your problems newton shifted uncomfortably at it being described as his problem recognizing that no blame or culpability for anything would ever be traceable to edward c grant thered be no record not even a diary entry of this meeting newton accepted too that despite everything being already set out in the file upon grants desk it all had to be talked through rebecca langs in a relationship with parnell he began sometimes she stays at his place sometimes usually weekends he stays over with her in bethesda we got photographs cut in grant who already knew the answer from his direct contact with harry johnson the head of dubette security the question was to bind newton into any future action that might be necessary coming and going from both places confirmed newton that wasnt in the file so perhaps there was after all a purpose in talking it through she asked showcross outright what was going on he told her it was beyond her clearance and nothing to do with her but then she rang paris cut in grant again on a cockamamie excuse about a transmission screwup that could have been sorted out in a second by email we know who she spoke to in paris what was said newton humped his thin shoulders just the phone log recording the outgoing call it lasted six and a half minutes long time to sort out a simple transmission misprint judged grant too long agreed newton you think we should get saby or mendaille to find out who she spoke to what was discussed we need to know said grant but i dont want any more curiosity in paris than might already have been aroused by my bringing saby and mendaille back not my problem or my decision thought newton thankfully i think weve got to assume rebecca will have told parnell told him what seized grant at once is there any way she could have seen anything other than that one misdirected message newton didnt answer at once trying to assess the commitment being forced from him then he said no no im sure she couldnt and what could she infer from what she did see only that there was an outoftheordinary exchange going on at the highest level between paris and washington you were the guy who mentioned france publicly at the seminar thought newton grant pulled a sheet of paper from another folder gazing down at it for several moments before reading aloud welcome your assessment of our detailed security proposal and its signed mendaille he didnt speak for several more moments and newton remained silent too no the bulky whitehaired man abruptly decided by itself it wouldnt mean anything i think ill keep security on to things ensure that she does as shes been told warn showcross that i want to be told if she shows any more curiosity do that agreed grant whod already given the order to the security chief what about showcross he likely to become too curious newton shook his head positively showcross knows where his salary cheque comes from keep the security check on parnell too lets watch for any interest there shouldnt be from him there was another pat on the washington dossier i really do think you handled that website business very well too what i find unbelievable is that the son of a bitch actually suggested it in the first place hes got a lot of adjustments still to make to living in the commercial world but im knocking him into shape ive set up some other things openly boasted newton keep on the job dwight i always do and im always grateful there was a too obvious look at his watch sorry i cant offer you lunch grant put a hand tight beneath his chin im up to here it would have risked his new york visit becoming too publicly known acknowledged newton i need to get back anyway well keep in close touch the closest insisted the president i dont want to lose control of this control of everything and every one and every cent was edward c grants watchword im not clear on one thing said newton briefly refusing the dismissal are we going to go ahead with the french idea grant gave himself time to compose the reply commercially it makes very good sense but the medical decision has got to be yours dwight if it is medically safe as the french insist theres no reason why we shouldnt do it but we cant obviously risk being caught out which is why youre being given the total responsibility thought grant it put his name very firmly and provably on the proposal newton realized so he couldnt relax the very opposite in fact if i decide theres a chemical danger we dont go ahead we cant chance anything unethical but at the same time weve got every right to protect our products intellectual and otherwise smiled grant it would certainly be commercially good for the company i want you to keep that in mind that was the closest hed get to a positive order accepted newton well put it through every test i know you will thats why you are where you are dwight id trust you with my life and those of everyone else whose lives are made better by the drugs and treatments we devise thank you thats good to hear it was almost as if they were working from a script now he wished it wasnt a script written entirely by the other man and dwight added grant as newton was almost at the door to the suite what frowned newton turning back into the room not that way the private elevator dont forget the security or the culpability thought newton so youre finally set up and ready to go agreed parnell today there was no obvious resentment and the coffee had been freshly brewed and waiting when he reached russell benns office parnell had considered inviting the head of chemical and medical research across to the newly established pharmacogenomics wing only changing his mind during the twoday delay in this intended workplanning meeting interoffice protocol decreed he still go to the other man sorry i couldnt make it earlier apologized benn the way i understood our earlier meeting was quite simply that youd like to be involved in everything were currently doing become an integral extra part of it yes said parnell and run simple nucleotide polymorphism tests on what dubette are already producing to make them more effective the change in benns attitude was encouraging the other professor nodded that as of an hour ago involves something like three hundred and sixty different experiments covering new possibilities with existing drugs treatments and therapies currently under phase one evaluation between oral blood or muscle injection additionally there are fiftythree other quite new investigations still at animallevel testing which obviously are at the moment openended thats a hell of a schedule exclaimed parnell he hadnt anticipated half that number were a hell of a cuttingedge company said benn and i havent included competitor analyses whats the extent of your total programme stick a pin anywhere into an infectiousdiseases dictionary and were doing it the most obvious and current at the top of the list it was all very forthcoming prepared almost looks like quite a challenge you really want it all frowned benn i want to go through the entire schedule qualified parnell until i study it all i wont be able to decide how applicable it is to my discipline therell have to be prioritizing why of what challenged benn the sharpness of the demand was parnells second surprise i would have thought our liaising would initially be better begun with your newer experiments than looking for possible improvements to remedies already tried and proven you said you wanted everything in a proper workable order hows that to be decided between the two of us between others in our departments maybe with the workload youve just outlined itll make practical sense to delegate dont you think you want details of everything persisted benn unless youve got a more effective way of our cooperation getting off the ground you think youve got sufficient people no admitted parnell at once thats why its necessary to prioritize from the very beginning so you start we start with a long list and the research notes of that list all of which i guess is computerized and easily downloaded without causing any of your people any extra work well simply create our genetic order of priority where we think we can make the best contribution share it with you and arrange to the convenience of us both the inclusion of my people in the ongoing physical experiments which wont mean anything more than the exchange of slides and cultures and specimens surely parnell was glad he was talking now as if hed had everything ready in advance which he hadnt there were only a few things one specifically that he wanted to introduce when he considered the time to be right ok said benn not trying to conceal the doubt lets try it your way and if it doesnt work my way well devise another said parnell easily he nodded acceptance to the offered coffee refill what about your people asked benn any of those arrive with anything interesting from what they did before satos interested in hepatitis c hes got a good argument going beyond interferon that ill let him follow you doing anything on that tokyo is canberra too this could be the route he was seeking parnell realized that fits the demographics but youd have everything copied here right itll be on the list what about asia and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars is being worked out of tokyo again he hesitated forced into a concession you know of course that the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases is experimenting with a vaccine containing the dna from the virus yes i do know said parnell who had intentionally manoeuvred the conversation crossspecies infection from animals to humans is a field we could successfully explore suggested parnell its virus mutation which is genetic and its a carrierborne condition so it isnt demographically limited it just starts in china and hong kong from their liveanimal trade but then spreads globally thats why its on the list said benn parnell wasnt sure whether the other mans patience was forced working genetically on hepatitis c will obviously lead on to tumours restricted perhaps to liver cancer cancers on every list here and throughout all the subsidiaries the door was creaking open parnell decided generally or defined region to region benn frowned at the specific question rome and canberra are concentrating on sungenerated melanomas because of the predominant climate delhi and manila on lung cancer because of the combination of heavy nicotine use and uncontrolled air pollution in their countries what about france what about france echoed the black professor diet said parnell rehearsed japan with its very particular diet a lot of fish and much of it raw has the lowest cancer incidence in the world you probably couldnt find more polarized eating than the fat oil and rich sauce preparations of france any subsidiary or us here working on a dietary connection to cancer bowel or stomach maybe part of a general investigation said benn in france no said benn here hed taken it as far as he could and wasted his time parnell decided it had probably been stupid hoping benn would disclose whatever the restricted french communications were about and after the website debacle hed determined against stupid approaches i look forward to getting the list i m looking forward to your showing us how you can improve it theres no possibility of any complaint assured russell benn i followed every lead you suggested the pharmacogenomics division will have enough research material for months if not years which is what parnell wanted what did he say about the volume asked dwight newton the other man smiled that it was a lot and that he didnt have sufficient staff to whom to delegate it so that a priority schedule will have to be created we have to know what that is insisted newton we agreed that ill have his itemized working schedule so weve got a check on everything theyre doing quite separate from what hes under strict orders to tell me pressed newton it created a doublecheck system the best he believed he could evolve thats how you wanted it wasnt it anything out of the ordinary anything you didnt expect from the conversation he got a bit ahead of himself began itemizing things i told him to wait until he got the complete schedule to see what we were covering itemizing what particularly demanded newton hepatitis cancers all the obvious stuff wanted to know if some of the subsidiaries were specializing he mention a particular subsidiary hes got some idea of a comparison between japan and france that might show up a dietary connection with tumours what did he say about france demanded newton benn gave an uncertain gesture nothing particular newton let some silence into the conversation then he said would you say he explicitly manoeuvred the conversation to include france maybe that could be an impression it wasnt mine until now when were talking about it is it important weve worked together for a long time russ said newton ignoring the question yes agreed benn asking one in return dubette appreciates you and your loyalty you know it doesnt have to be questioned thats exactly what we do know appreciate most of all and what we want you to understand im not sure i do not at the moment said benn doubtfully i want you to carry out some tests you personally no one else not delegated to anyone not discussed with or known about by anyone benn straightened in his seat his concentration suddenly absolute what france is traditionally africas colonial power french or a patois of it is the first language throughout a lot of african countries its our french subsidiary drugs and treatments that are predominantly copied the presidents seminar remark remembered benn the idea is to cheat the cheats revealed newton at last introduce into the printed formulae of our most often pirated research placebos or nonactive constituents to make them more expensive and less costeffective to replicate than our competitors thats not ethical protested benn placebos and nonactive constituents repeated newton colour alteration more palatable taste theres nothing nonethical in our doing that im not sure said benn doubtfully hows the new house and the kids ok said benn uncomfortably thanks for asking i want you to understand how much we appreciate the way you run your operation in addition to the acrosstheboard ten per cent increase im approving an additional salary increase for you of fifteen thousand dollars thats very generous benn was beyond surprise practically in shock very much deserved whos got these formulae changes i have what if there are adverse reactions the ideas scrapped im to do this totally alone no im your check you initiate and confirm i repeat the experiment and doubly confirm ive your word the idea will be abandoned if there is the remotest risk i am not going to put you at risk myself at risk or the company at risk guaranteed newton and id see the results of your separate analyses and tests of course thank you for the salary increase its nothing you dont deserve eight the dubette computer printers were predictably the fastest stateoftheart available but it still took almost five hours completely to download the full development schedules and each set of individually attached research procedures in addition to the separate material covering the original production of those listed that were in the course of improvement or refinement ted lapidus finally facing parnell over battlements of piled paper said itll take five years optimistically to examine it all weve just been avalanched that awareness had come to parnell halfway through the print run he said i got what i asked for now weve got to dig ourselves out he was conscious of looks quickly exchanged between lapidus and deke pulbrow identifying both he said ok you two he turned to easton and you mark work from the provided dates and from whats identified as the most current research at the moment youre speed reading i want you to create a priority agenda with which we can potentially and most productively get involved the research thats being giving the most time and attention with no obvious financial constraints relegate anything youre unsure of to secondary or third lists he went to the japanese lets go with your original instinct sean stay with hepatology parnell encompassed the stacked paper sort out from all this anything genetically applicable to hepatitis b or c again youre speed reading flagging up where we could go forward log and crossreference separately liver carcinoma he looked around them all thats a general instruction were going to create our own dedicated cancer programme in time well subdivide and specify but before we even do that well take on board everything that rome and canberra have already done and are maybe currently doing because according to benn both italy and australia are actively working on melanoma research and then there were three broke in beverley jackson her smile took away any impatience in the remark it was an easy smile and for the first time parnell realized its slight unevenness lacked the sculpted dentistry of rebeccas the realization that he was consciously comparing the two women surprised him although rebecca had virtually invited it when hed told her of beverley coming into the department demanding with feigned jealousy a detailed description and claiming the day after they were supposed to begin work that shed lingered in the commissary to see the woman for herself and declaring beverley to be very sexy properly and fully concentrating upon the other geneticist for the first time parnell acknowledged that she was extremely attractive fullerbreasted but smaller featured than rebecca and maybe taller by an inch or two he thought the darkness of their matching deeply auburn hair was about the same but beverley wore hers practicably short concentrating even more he saw beverley didnt have any freckles either from her application cv parnell knew that beverley jackson was divorced although shed kept her married name and still wore what he presumed to be her wedding ring looking between the woman and peter battey he said and were the three well work dates again we wont initially go back further than two years into the improvement and reevaluation of what dubette already manufacture we can work on what went before as and when i wont have a schedule imposed upon us well work at our speed no one elses he smiled apologetically at kathy richardson the bulk of the recording work is going to fall upon you im afraid youll be the person creating the files thats what i came here expecting to do smiled the woman you actually think we were avalanched frowned lapidus i got what i asked for repeated parnell and i was warned of the volume and as youve already made clear were going to have to work for our acceptance reminded beverley if were working nucleotide polymorphism acceptances were going to need a lot of animals said peter battey something else for you kathy when we establish a schedule said parnell im going to be a real busy person accepted the secretary which is what they all set out to be impressing parnell by how quickly they came together as a cohesive unit unasked and unprompted everyone worked late and frequently missed lunch or ate sandwiches at their benches parnells fitness regime flagged and he put on lbs in three weeks even though he was missing lunch too there were two consecutive weekends when he didnt stay over at bethesda with rebecca and she didnt stay in his apartment at all during the second week she didnt once complain insisting she knew how important it was to him parnell adhered strictly to dwight newtons demands and sent detailed memoranda to the research and development vice president with copies to russell benn satisfied that he was avalanching them in return and passingly curious at the lack of response from either scientist during the second week he actually crossed into benns section but was told the man could not be disturbed in the secure laboratory in which he was working all parnells exchanges each identified by number and content were acknowledged the following day newtons replies came the day after that parnell insisted everyone take the third full weekend off and was glad when rebecca announced shed prefer to cook in at bethesda on the saturday night they had drinks on the deck and he fell asleep in the colonial wicker chair when she went into the kitchen to prepare the meal she woke him in mock protest that if he was as tired as that he wasnt going to be much use to a girl as denied as she had been i was just recovering my strength how much longer do you think youre going to have to work like this parnell shrugged a long time you wont be able to keep up the pace the other guys are going to get pissed off theyre working their asses off at the moment youve got to cut some them some slack ill watch it he paused im surprised at newton benn too for that matter by his apparent lack of interest after all the bullshit about knowing everything im doing theyre too busy said rebecca she grinned conspiratorially and i think i know why you promised to back off i dont think i did i think you did shed cooked pot roast and parnell realized that in his annoyance he was facing her across the table with his knife and fork held upright like weapons he put them down pouring wine for them both i didnt go around asking any more questions said rebecca defensively what then i had coffee in the commissary with the filing clerk in benns section shes the girl i deal with all the time and she said benns locked himself away in a laboratory and no one knows what hes doing and youre surmising its the great french mystery it all fits doesnt it no refused parnell youre making it fit and i want you to let it go its becoming an obsession its not an obsession im just curious parnell looked at her suspiciously you spoken to paris again not about this so you have spoken to paris a regular samples shipment went missing i had to confirm the waybill number by phone why not the defensiveness was back when before or after coffee in the commissary with the file clerk the day after but it was a coincidence believe me parnell didnt and all you talked about was a missing samples shipment and a waybill number theres a lot of curiosity in paris too their top guy wouldnt have been called to new york if it wasnt important would he you said anything more to showcross he knew i called paris and why by reconfirming the waybill number i was able to track down the samples i want a solemn promise that youll keep to this time i want you to stop whys it such a big thing with you rebecca demanded showing her own irritation because i think it is approaching an obsession whatever the french thing is its something theyre keeping under wraps which is entirely logical and understandable in a pharmaceutical company whose whole existence and future is based on exactly that keeping as totally controlled and secret as possible what might be an advance the way youre behaving you could far too easily become suspected of being a competitor informant and if that happens youre out so where do you think youre going to work next with that albatross around your neck youd be an untouchable pariah never trusted nor in pure science even if you could get a place rebecca remained looking at him for several moments her barely eaten meal abandoned her wine glass untouched finally she said you really meant all that didnt you about protecting me and stuff yes i really mean it she went back to her wine glass like a clairvoyant studying a crystal ball does that mean were moving on into a commitment youre the resident judge of that its your chosen word rebecca remained engrossed in her glass for several more moments then she said crackvoiced it sounds like it is youre the judge repeated parnell was that what he was offering a commitment he didnt think the conversation had started out in that direction he pushed aside his own now cold pot roast which wasnt anyway an american speciality he liked i just delivered the judgement you dont sound very sure about it it wasnt supposed to come out that way like oh shit she stumbled you any idea where were going with this no rebeccas voice was now mouselike parnell wasnt sure about anything about how theyd stumbled into this quicksand in the first place now weve got this far beyond the refusal why dont we wait a while decide what we both want ok accepted rebecca mousevoiced still that was quite a loop she smiled uncertainly i guess it was and now were back at the beginning ive almost forgotten what that was no you havent no more spy games ok i keep saying that say it again ok mean it dont commit professional suicide over some stupid nonmystery rebecca opened her mouth to speak but stopped i wont say ok one more time i promise but this time i really really mean it ill forget about france good i know i shouldnt be but i feel i dont know embarrassed i guess now that weve she floundered to a halt what do you feel parnell only just stopped himself from saying ok which wouldnt have been right in any context i feel you and i have got to talk a lot and laugh a lot and in our own time without any hurry or pressure decide a lot you dont like pot roast do you its not my favourite were deciding already parnell supposed taking pot roast off the menu was a start irrationally parnell felt uncomfortable taking the weekend off and compensated by getting to mclean around six every morning the following week and on the wednesday ran for the elevator that was taking russell benn to their shared floor sorry didnt mean to frighten you apologized parnell surprised at the medical research directors startled reaction to his doorthrusting arrival i had to wait more than five minutes for a car to come back yesterday not used to people this early said the black professor recovering this your usual time asked parnell varies said the man usually try to make an early start came across the other day but you were busy im still going through your stuff look forward to talking about it you on to something new asked parnell what what youre working on i was told you couldnt be interrupted which i understood benn made an awkward armlifting gesture seemed a possibility doesnt appear to be working out what demanded parnell directly there was a hesitation its a respiratory thing a chestmuscle relaxant like i said doesnt seem to be working out on mice trials we going to get a look at it on our side of the fence im not getting anywhere so it looks like a nono i would have thought youve got enough with what weve given you always room for more the man was lying parnell knew nine dwight newton observed the previous protocol catching the first newyorkbound flight from washington and entering the corporate building on wall street using the unobserved codecontrolled penthouse elevator intentionally shielded from cctv range as before edward c grant was there ahead of him waiting on the other side of the overpowering desk youve finished the tests demanded the hunched diminutive man not bothering with any formal politeness thats for you to decide said newton knowing there was no possibility of lunch hed got up in time for the maplesyruped waffles that never added weight to his skeletal frame but he had hoped for coffee there wasnt any and we added all the frenchrecommended colouring and flavouring to a slew of their products linctus cough medicines bronchitis and asthma treatments analgesics most of their range tests on mice and monkeys showed no adverse reaction whatsoever you telling me we can go ahead smiled grant the french also experimented with liulousine so we did too it would add a good twenty per cent on to any pirating cost again nothing adverse in any animal trial because its in the same classification we went further and introduced our beneuflous that would hike the copying cost up to thirty per cent theres no indigenous source so both liulousine and beneuflous would have to be imported theyd be buying beneuflous our drug to pirate us sniggered grant it would be more costeffective to copy other manufacturers which i thought was the strategy were trying to set up said newton but if they chose to use our formulae then yes theyd have to buy our drugs to manufacture their copies of our drugs i like it i like it very much no bad reactions at all there was always a nearorgasmic feeling at the thought of making money none what are liulousine and beneuflous expectorants so youre signing the whole thing off as safe we can go ahead paris hasnt tested on humans neither have we i thought mice were comparable and compatible enough questioned the nonmedical president there could be minimal variations we or france should test on human volunteers to be one hundred per cent sure were talking africa not civilization dwight newton whod believed himself beyond any reaction to anything grant might say or do was momentarily shocked into silence you know the threephase testings he managed every preparation were talking about has gone through the french testing schedule and conforms to their licensing regulations insisted grant what about these additions georges mendaille doesnt anticipate any difficulty neither does saby providing none of it is sold on the domestic market once again newton had to pause before speaking how can that be explained to the licensing authorities rifofludine said grant shortly having rehearsed the moment the frenchrecommended flavouring queried newton saby described it as a preservative in hot climates it would have helped if id spoken to saby when he was here i didnt test for that it was the nearest newton had ever come to confronting the president and his stomach lurched as he spoke you can test now cant you said grant sharply what else did saby claim that the colouring agent is a total placebo but very practicable among people who have difficulty reading or comprehending but who can understand differences in colours anticipated newton he felt physically nauseous exactly agreed grant enthusiastically we could even get some public health recognition for this hed sold his soul to a man who was beyond imagination or parody newton realized at once he wondered why it had taken him this long to realize it i need to make the heat test on rifofludine saby says its ok im signing it off right right then i should confirm the experiment and its result as i should test upon human volunteers we got a sudden problem here dwight asked grant newtons stomach dipped again we need to consider the company and its global reputation dont we always said grant at once thats what im doing of course you are said grant the smile as tight as the bittenoff words how about this itll take a while to get french licensing approval you finish off what you feel you have to do in the laboratory while paris goes through the formalities that way were on the block ready to take off the moment we get the go ahead he was a puppet in a responsibilityclearing performance accepted the research vice president the decision had already been made to go ahead with manufacture for africa what happens if i dont confirm sabys insistence on the preservative ive already given you my word dwight we scrap everything thats what i have your word thats what you have what youve always had ok agreed newton as hed known he would agree from the beginning weve got other things to talk about announced grant hand on the familiar although expanded file to the left of his desk security put a trace on rebecca langs office phone started newton knowing what grant expected got the full transcript of a conversation with the girl she talks to in paris stephanie paruch grant pulled the extract from the file flicking the edge of the paper with an irritated finger your great mystery he paraphrased im going to keep on until i find out known here as a smoking gun you know the trouble with guns dwight they go off and hurt people thats when they smoke newton hesitated briefly unsure how to respond he took his own copy of the transcript from his briefcase and reading from it quoted its the talk of the division here benn and newton have locked themselves away havent been seen for days its got to be something big he looked up i dont like that my name being on the record i dont like that at all what about parnell grant hurried on caught benn in the elevator a day or two back asked him outright what was going on what did russell say that it was an experiment that wasnt working out parnell accept that asked if pharmacogenomics were going to get a look at it russ said there wasnt any point grant sat silently for a long time the only sound the increasingly rapid click of his irritated flicking against the paper edge finally he said is it true what she said that its the talk of the division there was an unquestionable benefit repeating the questions hed already put to harry johnson the security director with whom he was talking personally and only ever onetoone with increasing frequency its not my reading or benns security harry personally are tapping all outgoing calls from the floor ive told them we suspect a competitor informer rebecca langs the only person whos shown any interest in france spoken to paris even not parnell no but theyve got to be talking havent they they cant just screw all the time shes a goddamned nuisance angrily declared the dubette president whod had a contradictory conversation with harry johnson whose professional experience and opinion he trusted more than an amateur like newton you think i should officially warn her off no refused grant still angry thatll just make her more curious she certainly had to be stopped it was not something to discuss with newton not even he thought with johnson there were special people he employed for special things what then just finish off what youve got to grant brightened looks like france came up with a good one had the figures calculated we stop the piracy reduce it even in africa and asia we could save as much as ten million dollars in a full year and that could even translate into a matching loss to our opposition if they become the alternative targets thats a damned good days work there was an abrupt reflective darkening and why it isnt going to be jeopardized you want security to go on watching her keep the telephone taps on throughout the department hers particularly and obviously keep an eye on parnell leave me to worry about everything else and dwight yes youre doing a hell of a good job that morning newton didnt make the mistake of trying to leave through the wrong door sorry i havent got back to you before now apologized newton not a lot for us to discuss so far accepted parnell enough said the vice president you seem to have everything parcelled up pretty efficiently newton hadnt set out intending this meeting his mind hadnt gone beyond the new york encounter and what there was to discuss with edward c grant it was only afterwards on the return washington shuttle when he was still very much thinking of that discussion and grants numbing cynicism during it and of his openly being named on the security eavesdrop that the idea came of personally speaking to parnell and trying to assess what suspicion or curiosity the englishman might disclose still a long way to go why the sudden summons after playing the invisible man looks to me like youre working to an agenda trying to create one thats practical qualified parnell i thought the best initial contribution we might try was on some of the most current research to complete an entire package was that a veiled reference to paris sounds a sensible approach how many have you got in mind parnell was sure he prevented the frown those that ive already memoed you about sure said newton awkwardly gesturing to a disordered pile of paper on his desk you think theres anything likely nothing thats leapt out of the petrie dish at us but then we neither of us expect archimedesstyle discoveries do we newton forced the smile sure the other man was mocking him still be nice the exchange system appears to be working well between russells section and mine that had to be a reference to france sure you wont be overwhelmed no answered parnell honestly thats why were working to an agenda trying to keep up to speed with whats ongoing allowing space to go back to earlier stuff when were able he had to force it along newton decided im afraid russ has been a little preoccupied lately me too he told me the quick halt was intentional to lure newton into saying more turned out to be a waste of time its all being scrapped insisted newton parnell didnt believe newton any more than hed believed russell benn gastrointestinal is where pharmacogenomics might have a real place the son of a bitch was trying to trick him it was respiratory a decongestant of course russell told me my mistake you think of any way things could be improved for you i dont think so said parnell might suggest closer contact between russell and myself in the future but not yet the backlogs too big you sure theres no purpose in my having a different look at the respiratory experiments none said newton positively thats a principle i work from here dick we dont waste time with failed ideas it doesnt work we scrap it move on ill remember that said parnell what was the point of all this maybe we should have lunch together again soon good idea now that you can raise your head from the microscope i look forward to it another reference isolated newton well do it real soon there very definitely had to be another earlymorning trip to new york arranged from a public kiosk he reminded himself every phone on the research floor was being security monitored from the way the toyota was parked parnell saw the damage when he was still some yards away despite the twilight the damage began at the passenger door but was worse on the nearside wing the dents deep enough to have broken a lot of paint he looked for a culprits note under the windscreen wipers there wasnt one shit he said he yanked at the nearside wheel which felt secure enough he drove slowly through the nearempty car park satisfying himself there was no wheel damage before he reached the highway in the apartment he made the single evening drink he allowed himself a strong gin and tonic briefly undecided but finally ringing rebecca you coming to the house she asked at once just wanted to talk what about some bastard drove into my car in the car park did they leave a note no such luck how bad passenger door and wing the damage kind of goes around to the front which is slightly buckled you told security not yet you should she insisted i will emptily promised parnell dont put it off i wont im looking forward to the weekend so am i you really mean that she asked i really mean it i love you i love you too said parnell once again wishing he didnt have so much difficulty saying the words ten rebecca insisted it was her decision how they spent the weekend although it was limited to sunday she arrived early at washington circle and told parnell to dress in jeans and a work shirt she refused coffee which shed already delayed herself by making in bethesda as usual she refused to start the engine until he fastened his seat belt now im strapped in tell me where were going out into the great big country that youve never seen said rebecca what if i dont like it too bad youre being kidnapped she drove him in fact to chesapeake bay to eat the inseason bitesized softshelled crabs with a pitcher of beer despite the jeans and work shirt parnell got glued and dirty from the shakers of glutinous salt and herb flavourings and couldnt properly clean himself up even in the washroom rebecca said you think any cleanliving respectable girl would get into bed with someone looking like you do no said parnell but the food would be worth the abstinence and youve got grunge all around your face too ill try to develop a treatment for it ive beaten you rebecca declared triumphantly im getting accustomed to it acknowledged parnell in weak protest beaten me to what exactly the guided tour you know your way from washington dc to mclean north virginia and from washington circle to georgetown and thats it until today congratulations you pushed the covered wagon out beyond the stockade and hostile indians arent firing arrows they didnt three hundred years ago our settlers fired on them first book learning she refused this is your first great step for mankind parnell scrubbed his face with a gritty crumpled paper towel but didnt feel any improvement so im not much fun eh severely limited whyd you stay he felt safe with the question because the conversation was light unendangering although embarrassingly he recognized that rebecca was making a deserved complaint we crossed the boundary made the commitment we always held back from which we still seem to be holding back from i could blame work but i wont good you changed your mind no i wasnt sure if you might have done that wasnt entirely true he admitted to himself you could have asked you keep nagging and i will blame work you do that and ill know youve changed your mind you ever think of studying law rather than science youd have made a great prosecuting attorney that how it sounds to you a prosecution the lightness was going as hed feared it would no thats not how it sounds at all im sorry and im wrong and i have put work before anything else before you and thats badly wrong too it was at rebeccas urging that hed imposed a permanent sundayoff edict and a sevenatnight finish despite which people still often remained later at their benches parnell the latest stayer of all silence encompassed them in a restaurant that was no more than a bare trestletabled shack with a pier that thrust out into the bay and in which they sat with hands and faces tightening with the glue of the flavouring salt they laughed unprompted but simultaneously reached out sticky fingers and parnell said how the hell did that build up rebecca said i planned it angry at me no youve got to go on now i dont have any words parnell wasnt sure he had either are we talking marriage no the quickness and vehemence of the rejection visibly startled him and rebecca said this really isnt the place to have this sort of conversation parnell wasnt sure what sort of conversation they were having your choice you take it rebecca slid her hand away from his holding both of hers tightly before her staring down at them as if they held some message yes it is my choice aware of her tension he said i dont want to go on with this not here not now not if you dont want to she said this was supposed to be a day out how the fuck did it get to this lets stop he said no rebecca refused again still vehement but just as abruptly stopped parnell waited you want to go on us i mean she said finally yes you cant decide that yet parnell saw that rebeccas knuckles were whitening so hard was she gripping one hand against the other and there were shudders rippling through her dont darling whatever it is dont rebeccas words came out in spurts i have to everything has to be clear out in the open i had a relationship two years ago got pregnant he wasnt sure so i had a termination thats why i have to be sure now ive done all the pushing and i wish i hadnt now and today is a total fucking mess and im sorry i ever started it and i wish youd shut up interrupted parnell rebecca did he stretched across the table and took her clenched hands once more prising them open stroking them dont be frightened i wanted you to know now i do and and nothing now he was talking childtalk say something anything ive been selfish about us im sorry theres life beyond far beyond dubette im angry at myself for getting ensnared in their system its insidious i was the guy determined not to get caught up in the spiders web remember so you forgot for a moment do i get out of the stockade every weekend you havent said anything about she started but trailed off unable to finish im sorry to say it if you loved him but i think he was an idiot but im glad because i met you you sure im sure parnell did his best to fill the silences on the drive back to washington falling back upon exaggerated anecdotes from cambridge and england intentionally avoiding any references to dubette but recognizing as he did so how blinkered he had become in his total absorption with work they finally washed away the salt residue at his apartment and decided they didnt want to eat again parnell suggested a movie but rebecca said she didnt feel like it and when parnell asked if she was staying looked down at her stained shirt and said she hadnt brought a change of clothes for the morning as it seems to have been a day for decisions perhaps another one should be where were going to live he declared she remained looking at him unspeaking for what seemed a long time then almost in a whisper she said you asking me to move in parnell supposed he was although he hadnt intended the words to come out quite as they had they say you dont properly get to know a person until you live with them bethesdas bigger than here and theres the garden the commutes about the same parnell wasnt sure he wanted to move away from the convenience of the city why dont we try both places see which we prefer starting when whenever ok she agreed here first maybe bethesda at the weekends to keep the place lived in fine help me move my stuff in tomorrow right after work with two cars we could probably manage it in one trip he really had made a commitment parnell realized lets do that rebecca left washington circle promising to start packing that night and parnell was glad to be alone wanting to think although he didnt exactly know about what at last he told himself to stop being stupid because he knew exactly what it was it was being permanently with living with sharing with rebecca which came down quite simply and logically to loving her so did he he didnt know or wasnt sure that was better he wasnt sure he enjoyed being with her and wasnt attracted to anyone else and he actually liked the idea of their living together but did that amount to being in love was it sufficient for them to be together it was a commitment but it wasnt irrevocable in fact what they were doing was probably the best thing the sensible thing it would give them both the time and the opportunity properly to decide if there was enough between them to make it permanent to marry perhaps he should change the way he was thinking selfishly rather than objectively what about how rebecca felt or would feel among a lot of other things today there had been some long overdue selfawareness if he hadnt already become a workobsessed bore he was certainly running the risk of doing so rebecca might easily tire of him he had adjustments to make parnell accepted positive changes even starting the following day by leaving mclean at a sensible time to help rebecca ferry her stuff into the apartment not just a sensible time he determined early so that after shed moved in they could go to giorgios restaurant to celebrate with everything firmly planned in his mind assuring himself it wasnt workobsession to compensate for leaving early parnell got to work before seven the following morning and had been at his bench for four hours when the secretary at rebeccas section came hesitantly into the pharmacogenomics department burt showcross says can you come the girl said eleven richard parnell was the last to arrive at the outerring section and burt showcrosss personal office was already overcrowded showcross had surrendered his desk to dwight newton who sat at it whitefaced gazing unseeing at its empty top showcross a haphazardly haired man with a distracted manner was supportively at the vice presidents shoulder although appearing more distracted than normal there were two uniformidentified officers from metro dc police department a man who introduced himself as peter bellamy and a woman whose id named her as helen montgomery the fifth person was the logolabelled harry johnson head of dubette security a balding bespectacled man whose expansive stomach melted over a too tightly drawn belt from which hung a variety of lawenforcement weaponry the most obvious a pistol and equipment it was johnson whom parnell had never properly met but whom rebecca had pointed out to him weeks before who encouraged parnell further into the cramped office johnson said hope you may be able to help us a little here dick whats happened demanded parnell from where he stood he could see rebeccas bench space she wasnt at it rebecca said johnson theres been an accident where is she im sorry said the female officer its bad as bad as it gets shes dead everyone in the room except newton looked sharply at helen montgomery critical at the bluntness she stared back at them shrugging unrepentant parnell waited wanting to feel something but didnt all the cliches snowed in like it had to be a mistake and it wasnt true and what were they talking about but he didnt utter any of them either he said tell me peter bellamy pedantically took out a notebook although he didnt seem to need its reminders seems she was going through rock creek park a little too fast in the dark overshot a righthander went over the edge into a canyon took a while this morning before anyone realized the barrier had been busted the car wasnt visible from the road so it took us even longer to find the vehicle under a rock overhang what started parnell but the forthright helen montgomery stopped him the autopsys going on now there wasnt a lot in her purse but there was the dubette id were looking for next of kin an address in fact she nodded towards johnson from hank we understood theres an uncle runs a restaurant in georgetown italian her parents are dead rebecca had a house in bethesda do you go through rock creek park to get to bethesda instead of answering bellamy said were you with ms lang yesterday parnell nodded trying to get himself his thoughts into some sort of comprehensible sequence some sort of order he didnt think it was necessary to talk about crab fests and salt glue and rebecca moving in of positive commitments no one elses business only theirs his and rebeccas she took me up to chesapeake we ate crab it was he stopped himself from saying fun realizing that he was talking about crab fests and he wasnt thinking straight rebecca had driven away crashed why hadnt she stayed why hadnt he gone back with her wouldnt have happened if hed gone back with her looked after her looked after her instead of staying by himself thinking of himself we need to ask you something mr parnell said the woman you been drinking you and ms lang parnell wished theyd stop being politically correct or whatever it was and pronouncing ms as miz which sounded like a nickname we had just one pitcher of beer i drank most of it because she was driving rebecca wasnt drunk you didnt stop on the way back at my apartment we got dirty eating the crabs washed up there parnell was suddenly caught by dwight newtons stillness the man didnt appear to have moved since hed come into the office the usual twitching hands clasped tightly in his lap you do get dirty said johnson as if there were a need for confirmation you have a drink back at your apartment persisted helen montgomery no so the day ended early questioned bellamy how early would you say mr parnell i dont know shrugged parnell emptily eightish nineish i dont know the car clocks busted at eight fifty said bellamy like i said eightish nineish said parnell numbly you have an argument mr parnell demanded the woman hardvoiced no protested parnell why ask me that where she crashed its a bad spot lots of warnings to slow down be careful to have gone through the barrier over the barrier like she did she was going a lot too fast speedos broke too came in bellamy stuck at sixtyfive thats an illegal speed in rock creek park rebecca didnt drive fast insisted parnell defensively she didnt drive fast and she wasnt drunk and we hadnt had a fight hadnt had a fight echoed in his mind but it hadnt been an easy day the contradiction came at once yes it had ended good at least theyd decided to live together for christs sake she was happy going home to pack could that have been it the opposite of what they were thinking going home too quickly to pack so she was a good driver persisted the woman very good what about seat belts what about seat belts echoed parnell she wasnt wearing hers said bellamy flatly no refused parnell she always wore a seat belt it was a routine always thats how her parents died not wearing their seat belts she wasnt wearing one last night said bellamy just as insistent it might have helped if she had been you sure things were ok between you asked helen montgomery couldnt have been better why not he thought we decided yesterday to move in together the admission deflated some of the womans belligerence but not by a lot im not trying to be offensive she began maybe not trying hard enough said parnell angrily helen montgomery ignored the outburst did ms lang have other friends ms cut into his head like a buzz saw whats that question mean other men friends boyfriends parnell bit back the instinctive rejection he didnt know he conceded shed never introduced him to anyone else male or female or talked about anyone else until yesterday the walkaway lover whod made her pregnant and he didnt know who he was whats the point of that question what car do you drive avoided bellamy once more a toyota why what colour demanded the woman you answer my question first said parnell still angrily no she refused you answer mine grey now why the two police officers looked at one another the woman smiled the man may have nodded parnell wasnt sure the man said the barrier ms lang went into and over its white fluorescent to reflect light like these things do the offside of ms langs car is all stove in we found a lot of another cars paint its grey a cohesive thought wouldnt form the impressions his reactions were jumbled one or two words at a time you think you mean there was another car we need to understand a lot of things mr parnell a lot too much we havent worked out at the moment wait demanded parnell raising both hands towards the tightly packed group you believe rebecca crashed into another car got thrown over the edge of a ravine maybe forced over the edge said helen montgomery or sideswiped added bellamy but didnt stop stumbled parnell why do you think she was going so fast said the woman how about trying to get away from someone in too much of a hurry even to fasten up her seat belt maybe accepted parnell but she would have definitely fastened her seat belt you sure you didnt have a fight demanded the woman we decided yesterday to move in together protested parnell you said nodded bellamy you actually think i drove rebecca off the road i loved her for christs sake we were going to live together finished helen montgomery flatly tell us some more about last night rebecca left around eightish nineish parnell was holding himself rigidly under control hands and arms stiff beside him exasperated and impotent tightly he said rebecca left like i said i sat around thinking wed already decided we didnt want anything to eat i didnt want a drink either i went through some papers id taken home work things research then i went to bed youd decided that day to live together pressed the woman yes you didnt celebrate we were going to tonight at her uncles restaurant it was going to be a surprise you didnt call her see she got home safely no why not parnell thought agonized you didnt call anyone speak to anyone no watch television remember a programme you saw no listen to the radio no your car outside in the lot demanded bellamy a sweep of sickening awareness engulfed parnell its damaged the two officers looked at each other again the man said how did that happen mr parnell hit in the car park this car park when was that last week guy who did it leave a note inform security no parnell wished his voice hadnt wavered did you inform security said bellamy no get an estimate from a repair shop no make an insurers report no tell anyone rebecca no one else no no one else helen montgomery said i think wed better take a look parnell was conscious of the attention of everyone in rebeccas unit as he emerged into it from showcrosss office aware too of the two officers forming up either side of him they stayed that way even as they threaded their way through the linedup cars parnell guessed there would be people watching from the windows behind him as they approached the vehicle he said there there it is bellamy to parnells left said quite a lot of damage mr parnell just the sort of damage that would have been caused by your driving ms lang off the road youre making a mistake said parnell the cliche echoing in his head people tell us that all the time said the woman theyd known about the damage before theyd even begun to question him parnell thought they arrested him there and handcuffed him and as they led him towards their metro police marked car parnell saw there were people lined up at dubettes windows dwight newton walking with them told parnell hed talk to the companys legal department johnson said something parnell didnt hear he didnt hear a remark from helen montgomery either but didnt ask her to repeat it withdrawing into himself forcing himself to think logically coherently he needed a lawyer obviously not the one whod negotiated his contracts a lawyer accustomed to courts america was a laworientated country it would be a formality one hed enjoy humiliating the two assholes in front of him into a demanded and necessary apology science would be the answer as it was to so much he didnt know how long it would take an unwelcome day two at the most forensically to establish that the crashpaint residue on rebeccas car didnt match that of his toyota which was hardly the problem merely an inconvenience who had made her crash who had forced rebecca to drive at sixtyfive miles an hour inevitably to crash why an attack thats what it had to be shed been running fleeing to escape from an attacker someone who had attacked her smashed into her car and forced her over the edge of a canyon or ravine or whatever they called it without a seat belt that didnt make sense parnell decided his mind back to showcrosss office and the knowing questioning from the two in front of him in the car rebecca never ever drove without a seat belt never drove off without buckling up nagging him to do the same so hers would have been fastened outside the apartment at washington circle long before she got to rock creek park what panic aberration had made her unfasten it to jump out of the car to escape not at sixtyfive miles an hour why then so many questions too many questions would could the two officers relaxing ahead of him ever answer them he would parnell determined when his own release had been secured with apologies hed demand a proper investigation not one already decided before it began which prompted another question had they known about the earlier damage to his toyota how he hadnt reported the carpark accident to security hadnt told anyone except rebecca so why had the two police officers behaved as aggressively as disbelievingly as they had in showcrosss office and smirked and nodded when hed shown them the damage to the toyota he was guessing parnell reminded himself shouldnt guess like theyd guessed if he was going to get this right make them get this right and find the man or woman whod caused rebeccas death he had to get everything right not guess be sure hed do it parnell promised himself hed make enough fuss do whatever it took to ensure there was a proper investigation that the bastard was caught and tried and jailed that would surely be the sentence on someone whod chased a terrified woman through a forest driven her to her death that was murder how terrified rebecca must have been all alone fleeing an unknown pursuer lights blazing in her mirror knowing knowing what that she was going to be raped not a woman then had to be a man a man depraved enough insane enough to kill her if he couldnt have her sexually the imagery the horror physically welled up inside parnell and he choked and coughed against it doubling up no good crying english boy said bellamy from the passenger seat we got you fair and square youre going to have all the time in the world for tears and regret you think started parnell but stopped intentionally deciding it was pointless arguing with either of them instead he said dont call me boy youre going to be made to look very stupid dont make it worse for yourselves when i bring a case for wrongful arrest and blatant dereliction of duty and we discuss all this in a court with you in a dock there was a long unsettled silence then helen montgomery said you quite sure we got those charges here on the statute book bellamy filled the silence with an anticipatory snigger english boy the woman finished even exaggerating a southern accent i hope not said parnell recovered and totally in control i hope my lawyers can find something far worse than that youre giving more time for a killer to get away by being stupid thats what im going to hang around both your necks a label saying stupid you ever wonder what it feels like getting a billy club around your neck english boy threatened bellamy hed picked the wrong fight at the wrong time parnell realized there were a dozen witnesses to his docile detention but there would be two against one testimony to his later attempting to resist arrest you lost your tongue english boy said the woman when parnell didnt speak theres a good english boy learning respect mocked bellamy after a further silence youre going to have to learn that well proper respect in an american jail you could even be a prize now wouldnt that be something a big hunky english boy like you being a prison prize you know what a prison prize is english boy i dont think i want to said parnell forcing the humility you bet your very sweet ass you dont want to guffawed bellamy a clearly rehearsed joke but i got money that says youre going to find out in a very big way he and helen montgomery were still laughing when they pulled up in front of the police headquarters parnell had difficulty getting out of the car with his hands locked behind him but managed it without coming into awkward contact with the two officers who stood too close to the rear door the manacles were only released inside the building there they went through the property handover formality bagging his belongings in the interview room all the recording apparatus on parnell was formally read his right against selfincrimination before being charged with causing death by dangerous driving leaving the scene of an accident failing to report an accident and driving in such a way as to endanger life those are holding charges finished bellamy just the start now you want to tell us what really happened demanded helen montgomery i have a right to a lawyer dont i she sighed sticking to the necessary recorded formality she said you have such a right i want to exercise it its being done for you reminded bellamy dwight newton said he was talking to dubettes legal people then well wait until they arrive said parnell seeing the immediate expression on bellamys face parnell decided he was lucky not to have arrived at the station without being beaten for supposedly resisted arrest perhaps although only just perhaps there was an advantage in being an english boy after all both escorted parnell to the detention cell a narrow tiled room equipped with a single bed and a lidless toilet bowl the woman said i want your trouser belt and shoelaces your handkerchief too had a bastard choke himself on his handkerchief once dont want you cheating yourself out of whats yours or cheating a lot of other guys out of their pleasure added bellamy without a watch it was difficult for parnell to judge time but there was still daylight through the barred window when the door opened again the detention officer said the canteens got pot roast you want pot roast parnell winced at the memory no thank you i thought youd want that i didnt ask about anything else i dont want anything else im supposed to be getting a lawyer you called for one it was being arranged for me dont know anything about a lawyer its being done you wanna call again no you sure parnell nodded what time is it four thirty you wont get another chance to eat im not hungry thank you parnell refused again he estimated it to be another hour before the door opened again to the detention officer who jerked his head and said your lawyers are here it wasnt until he was out in the corridor that parnell properly realized how claustrophobically small the detention cell was the man said the pot roast was great you missed a treat peter baldwin the head of dubettes legal department was already in the interview room into which parnell had initially been taken there were no flickering recording lights on the stillinplace apparatus with baldwin was another man who was fat balding and corseted in a tight waistcoated striped suit baldwin said this is gerry fletcher your court attorney dwight wants you to know right away that dubettes handling everything costs i mean i explained already to gerry hes in the picture fletchers handshake like the hand itself was soft the man said sorry its taken so long but maybe its done us a favour what favour asked parnell they took your car obviously said fletcher part of the evidence the evidence and they recovered rebeccas car from the canyon theyve done a paint match thank god tried parnell but the attorney raised a podgy halting hand there is a positive match dick they got forensic proof it was your car you that pushed rebecca over no of course ill go for independent forensic tests but weve got to work a mitigating strategy no refused parnell again as loud as before dick i cant defend you unless youre straight with me i did not run rebeccas car off the road kill her thats being straight with you dick said baldwin youre in bad shape were into limitation here no were not said parnell quieter more controlled dubette are backing you going out on a limb dont make things any more difficult than they already are coming forward towards fletcher across the table parnell said you want me to plead guilty to whatever the final charges are youre a scientist you understand what im saying theyve got irrefutable scientific proof that it was your car that hit hers and shes dead at the bottom of a gorge what other strategy do we have parnell turned to the company lawyer thank you thank dubette for the offer but no baldwin shook his head uncertainly what are you talking about dick another lawyer another strategy the right strategy parnell stood there isnt anything else for us to talk about sit down said baldwin and at once parnell remembered the same snapped instruction from dwight newton this time he didnt do as he was told walking instead to the door and pressing the summons bell from behind him baldwin said youre insane perhaps thats it youre insane fletcher said youre making one hell of a mistake one of the officers who arrested me whod made her mind up that i was guilty just like you told me everyone keeps telling them that in your case she was right said the fat man you through already demanded the detention officer from the corridor yes said parnell dont expect any help from dubette warned baldwin at the door i dont and wont said parnell it took parnell a further hour to convince the desk sergeant that fletcher and baldwin had not been his choice of attorneys and that therefore he still had the legal right to a representative telephone call part of his mind reeling with the awareness that he didnt have or know a lawyer to call apart from the contract attorney hed already decided on his only approach hollowed by the desperation of it when he was finally shown in to an unsupervised inner office so anxious shaking was he that he misdialled at the first attempt jabbing at the button to disconnect actually mentally praying please god let somebody be there for a reply yes said beverley jacksons clipped voice im in trouble said parnell we know get me a trial lawyer please twelve b arry jackson was a heavily built blondhaired man with a deep halfmoon scar on his left cheek he wore a sports shirt jeans and a sports jacket and apologized as he entered the detention cell i was at home when i got the call reading the other mans watch as the lawyer handed him his card parnell saw it was nearly midnight frowning down at the introduction parnell said jackson beverley and i are still good friends just not good at being married she never can bring herself to admit im always right she thought you knew i was a lawyer that that was why you called her no said parnell maybe its my first piece of luck all ive got from the night sergeant are the charges and i wont be able to make a bail application until the morning in between times why dont you tell me the story his story was all that parnell had thought about for so long it seemed forever until his mind blocked and he didnt feel he could think about it from any other direction youre not going to believe it you better hope i do parnell told it hoped he told it chronologically from the moment rebecca had picked him up from washington circle and didnt leave anything out not even rebeccas admission of her pregnancy termination his belief that the metro dc officers had known in advance of the damage to his toyota or the englishboy mockery on his manacled way to the station house this guy fletcher he told you theres forensic evidence that it was your car that hit rebeccas yes did you no i can hear you well enough no repeated parnell more softly he ached with exhaustion i find youre lying i relinquish the case ok im not lying and ok you make a formal statement no jackson sighed relieved you tell them about rebeccas abortion no there was another relieved sigh so they dont have an obvious motive whos side are you on mine dick and yours but i dont take on losers thats what i meant about lying the two officers threatened you you threaten them back yes shit i told you what they were like what they said maybe we can turn it its not the major concern im just worried about rebeccas car i dont understand you dont have to beverley says ive got to do this pro bono i didnt ask for that the lawyer sat looking at him unspeaking realizing parnell said no theres nothing between beverley and me on my life your lifes not worth much at the moment but ill believe you about beverley for the moment it takes away another motive you caught between two women i fired fletcher because hed already decided i was guilty said thats how i had to plead and that we had to try for mitigation i havent decided that or talked about guilty pleas or mitigation but if you want to fire me go ahead itll cost you three hundred bucks for the consultation there was a perry mason rerun on television tonight i didnt want to miss it i want you to believe im innocent i want to believe it too but im already way ahead of you wondering how many cans of how many worms im going to have to open up to prove it please help me pleaded parnell ive thought about it every which way i know how it looks you good for a personal bail bond depends how much it is perhaps well need a bondsman youre a good enough risk with the dubette position if i keep the dubette position said parnell they fire you ahead of a formal verdict ill strip their skin off layer by layer until they bleed to death what about beverley jackson smiled for the first time you just impressed me they go for her while im going at them her compensation would match yours you just impressed me said parnell you dont say anything to anyone about anything ok just yes please and thank you the two officers are out of it now until a court hearing but no more threats against them or anyone else no matter what they do or say ok anything you want to ask me tell me i dont want this no win no fee neither do i so it isnt it was more of a collapse into exhaustion than sleep and parnell was awake long before the same detention officer yawning away the effect of his own rumpled night came into the cell with the offer of a bristlematted electric razor cornedbeef hash and coffee parnell refused everything except the coffee which came in a much stained unbreakable tin mug that retained so much heat it was uncomfortable to drink there were four other officers in the showerequipped washroom to which the warder escorted him but peter bellamy wasnt among them they all regarded him contemptuously parnell accustomed to communal sportsroom bathing stripped without embarrassment one of the watching officers said something to the others when parnell came out of the shower cubicle and on their way back to the holding cell the detention officer said they think youre shit for what you did obedient to the midnight instructions parnell said nothing he estimated it to be another hour before the door opened again to the smirking peter bellamy flanked by helen montgomery the woman said hear you got yourself a hotshot lawyer parnell didnt reply got judge wilson out of bed this morning to put the cars under court jurisdiction cranky son of a bitch old davey wilson wont like that one bit parnell guessed neither of the officers did either you got nothing to say english boy said the woman are we going to court hed expected barry jackson to come back to the police station bet that sweet ass we are said bellamy gonna have you tucked up nice and safe in a proper jail with a lot of new and loving friends by tonight parnell hesitated directly outside the cell door half moving his hands to be manacled again but helen montgomery said that smart lawyer of yours got an order against restraint which doesnt prevent us from cuffing you you do something we dont like warned bellamy you be very very careful english boy it was bravado parnell guessed he didnt think they were worried yet but there was an uncertainty the impression remained as he walked between them out into the receiving hall where three of the officers from the washroom were standing the expressions were still contemptuous but there were no sniggering remarks there werent on the short drive to the courthouse either the car stopped directly in front of the building but it wasnt until he started to get out the two deputies already posed that parnell saw the cameras television as well as presumably newspaper photographers there was a babble of questions which parnell ignored he tried to hurry through the pack but felt bellamys hand upon his arm slowing him although at the same time he heard the man demanding that they be let through which they finally were jackson was waiting outside their assigned court in a subdued suit and muted tie the lawyer said how you feeling like shit thats just how you look those photographs arent going to flatter you either you already got todays headlines in the washington post even lot of background about your scientific work lets get out of here somewhere quieter jackson led the way into an anteroom equipped with a table chairs and a closed glassfronted cabinet of neatly ordered legal books as he sat where jackson indicated parnell said gather you started early earlier than youd believe said jackson did bellamy or montgomery question you about the contents of rebeccas purse no what does af mean to you parnell stared back uncomprehendingly at the lawyer nothing you sure if i tell you it means nothing it means nothing its a flight number an air france flight number of course understood parnell it just didnt seem to fit or did it what were rebeccas political views parnells breath came out in a laugh we never discussed her political views i dont believe she had any not seriously what about you whats this got to do with rebeccas murder it could have a lot to do with it answer the question there was a hardness to the mans questioning there hadnt been before if youre looking for an american near equivalent i guess its democrat but i dont know what the hell youre talking about you ever belonged to a radical political organization at university maybe when everybody does i wasnt one of the everybodies does that mean you never belonged or subscribed in any way whatsoever to a radical political organization thats very precisely what it means said parnell you going to make it any easier for either of us because at the moment i dont know what the hell youre talking about jackson studied him across the table for several moments before saying i find you lied to me ill throw you in the snake pit myself oh for fucks sake said parnell whats the difference between a snake pit and the madhouse im in already you might find out in a very short time said jackson something else you should know is that getting the cars under the courts jurisdiction gets them away from metro dc police im trying to fix independent forensic tests as early as this afternoon if possible maybe if youre telling me the truth it will be by someone more independent than we could hope for prosecution are going for a remand in custody which im going to oppose obviously this is scheduled as an initial formality a bail hearing all that stuff in the papers about your professional career and integrity could help as well as the rabbit i might have in my hat and there might even be another edge what demanded parnell the man hesitated dont want to build up false hopes there was another pause weve got the preliminary autopsy report rebeccas neck was broken and there were extensive crush injuries to the chest and there was no finding of excessive alcohol parnell winced coughing at the listed injuries they said the officers she wasnt wearing a seat belt that cant be she always wore a seat belt you told me last night remembered jackson she wasnt in the car when she was found shed been thrown clear what about crawling out releasing herself and crawling out the lawyer shook his head not with those injuries its not right insisted parnell somethings definitely not right lets not get ahead of ourselves cautioned jackson youre the immediate priority they got an argument for a custodial remand hit and run leaving the scene of a fatal accident im going to have to call you now dont get mad but im going to ask you one more time did you pursue rebecca lang into rock creek park no crash into her car and force her off the road no so how do you account for your cars paint being on rebeccas vehicle i cant you ever been in a court before under crossexamination no the prosecution is going to roll all over you warned the lawyer theyve already guaranteed the publicity headlines its the sort of stuff they go for you think it was the prosecution who got all the stuff in the papers yes they think its a big case from which theyre going to emerge looking good i guess it is accepted parnell no you dont contradicted jackson you cant guess what its like until it happens to you dont lose your temper no matter how much they try to make you dont rush an answer until youve thought about it dont volunteer anything youre not asked you think you can remember all that i hope so dont hope so know so baldwin and fletcher are going to be in court by the way i said i didnt want them fired fletcher theyre not representing you after all todays publicity they applied for and got a watching brief on behalf of dubette how are dubette involved you work for them rebecca worked for them its an obvious precaution for dubette for their reputation against what against whatever rebecca hadnt been the only childspeaker parnell thought i dont think ive properly understood things yet i know you havent properly understood things yet i dont think i have either until i do we go with the flow theres something else you should understand if theres a conviction on any of what theyve already charged you with or charge you with later most certainly if theres a prison term its virtually inevitable your preferential work visa will be revoked youll be deported after serving whatever sentence is imposed im frightened blurted parnell wishing at once that he hadnt spoken he couldnt remember ever admitting that before not meaning it as he meant it now but then hed never been caught up in such a nightmare before do the best you can and try to remember what i said about what to do and what not to do in court ill started parnell but quickly corrected himself i will i promised i will one more time insisted jackson a flight number af means nothing to you absolutely not whys it so important i wish to christ i knew knew too whether i was doing the right thing the prosecuting attorney vernon hanson was a man whose thinness at once reminded parnell of dwight newton although the prosecutor was dressed better to conceal it the suit tailored and waistcoated the spectacles rimless and minimal he had too the demeanour of belonging of being sure of himself in familiar surroundings baldwin and fletcher were in the row behind both had yellow legal pads before them baldwin smiled and nodded fletcher remained expressionless to their right the press gallery was crowded several reporters overflowing on to the extra seats provided everyone stood to the ushers order at the entry of the whitehaired jowlwobbling judge david wilson who pointedly remained standing for several moments peering accusingly at parnell over halfrimmed spectacles before taking his seat at jacksons halting hand parnell remained standing with the lawyer formally to be charged after everyone else sat it was jackson just as formally who entered the notguilty plea to each charge on parnells behalf hanson came up from his bench like a toy from a sprung box his voice surprisingly resonant from such a slightly statured man the charges were sample accusations the prosecutor said at once others more serious might subsequently be proffered the allegations were that the accused had knowingly pursued a terrified woman with whom there had been an existing relationship through a darkened park area at illegal speeds and forced her off the road into a canyon causing her death there was already substantial and irrefutable forensic evidence of contact between the two vehicles he was applying for parnell to be remanded to a place of detention to enable the investigation to proceed and for further possibly more serious charges to be considered peter bellamy was the first officer to be called by the prosecution for formal evidence of arrest parnell was surprised by the closetoverbatim accuracy of the mans account of the encounter in showcrosss office curious what there could be for jackson to contest when his lawyer was given the right to question when did you come into possession of ms langs purse began jackson at the station house replied the officer who had recovered it i understood it to have been found in the car by the engineers who raised it from the gorge in rock creek park had it been opened prior to being handed to you there had been a preliminary examination thats how the dubette id had been discovered it was closed again when it was given to us the id was inside to whom was it given exactly yourself or officer montgomery officer montgomery personally accepted it what happened then are we working towards something here mr jackson intruded the judge i very much believe that we are assured jackson i hope we reach it soon said the ravengowned man i am sure we will said jackson to bellamy he said you were about to tell the court the procedure for an item such as ms langs purse its contents were examined listed ah exclaimed jackson as if it were an important revelation could you read every item of that list to the court i must protest started hanson rising with hands outstretched you promised we would reach the point of this questioning very soon came in the judge supportively a promise i intend to keep said jackson the list please officer bellamy the man went through a litany of cosmetics a pen credit cards the dubette id a tampon a first city bank cheque book and cash card in cash and finally a piece of paper upon which was written af what significance did you draw from that piece of paper with af written on it i didnt said the man we havent begun a proper enquiry yet it will probably be taken from us go over to detectives you and officer montgomery were the first people to list the contents of ms langs purse yes confirmed the man thank you said the lawyer plumping down beside parnell mr jackson demanded the judge warningly may i approach the bench if you hadnt asked i was going to demand it said the judge it was a huddled unheard discussion between the judge jackson and vernon hanson with several bursts of gesticulating from the prosecuting attorney when they returned to the body of the court hanson said to the judge upon your instruction i will say nothing that indicates the content of our conversation but i wish that restraint to be recorded as well as the possibility of a complaint to another body for lack of prior disclosure this is a remand hearing mr hanson said the judge prior disclosure is not a requirement although i will concede there might have been a courtesy extended jackson was immediately upon his feet if i have offended the court or the prosecution then i apologize i would also like that entered into the record helen montgomerys evidence of arrest was an echo of her partners as was her account of their receiving rebecca langs handbag upon their return to the police building jackson took her through that as meticulously as he had peter bellamy towards the end insisting who did what in the listing of the contents who wrote the list who extracted the items one by one the woman shifted uncomfortably i think i took them out pete wrote them down whats af mean to you nothing a flight number i guess which you would have pursued to discover the significance if the investigation were left to us yes but i dont expect it will be now that its a homicide not once was there any intervention from hanson who spent the questioning bent over a yellow legal pad hurriedly writing the forensic scientist was a small elderly thinninghaired man who very positively stressed his professorship and whose hand shook as he took the oath to be sworn in as jacob meadows the man who needed constantly to clear his throat testified to being shown two cars the previous afternoon in the policedepartment garage he was also shown substantial paint debris collected from the scene of a fatal accident involving a registered blue ford grey paint adhering to the ford and in places wedged into that extensively damaged bodywork together with more that had been among the dislodged blue paint unquestionably matched that of the grey toyota he had been asked to examine and compare jackson was quickly on his feet again professor where were the two vehicles when you examined them i have already told you in the policedepartment garage replied the coughing man testily and the separate paint debris i dont understand the question where did you find that it was handed to me by whom one of the recovery engineers in an evidence bag yes so you did not yourself examine the scene collect the samples i collected those samples adhering to the ford in the garage and i saw how the preventative barrier had been damaged there was blue paint residue there where it mounted the barrier to go into the canyon the ford in the garage was also marked by paint from the barrier but you yourself did not descend into the canyon to carry out any investigation there its a fortyfoot drop recovery engineers had to be lowered by hoists i understand the ford was recovered by crane you werent there for that recovery no and did not go down on a hoist into the canyon i have already told you i did not but you have carefully examined both cars in the garage yes tell me professor at the speed that these two vehicles are thought to have collided causing the damage youve indicated would you have expected a substantial amount of blue paint from ms langs car to have marked mr parnells grey toyota there was no immediate reply from jacob meadows but there was shuffling in the court particularly from the press bench finally the forensic scientist said shortly yes were there any such blue paint markings my examination was provisional for this hearing were there any blue paint markings persisted jackson the man took a notebook from his pocket flicking through the pages with a shaking hand for several moments i havent recorded any is the direction of this questioning connected with our earlier discussion at the bench mr jackson intervened the judge yes your honour confirmed the lawyer to meadows he said were you shown the contents of the deceaseds handbag no was there any discussion between you and officers at the police station about any handbag no my examination was cursory for the benefit of this hearing cursory seized jackson you conducted a cursory examination for the benefit of this hearing the purpose of which is to decide whether or not richard parnell should be remanded in custody i did what i was asked to do at that stage asked to do by whom im not sure i remember someone at the station neither bellamy nor helen montgomery were smirking any more ive concluded this initial questioning of this witness said jackson i call richard parnell to the stand parnell felt a vague unreality as he walked across the well of the court and he fought against it nervously aware that the last thing he could afford was lightheadedness or lack of concentration he recited the oath to the ushers dictation glad his voice strengthened when he answered jacksons first question that he fully understood what it meant to tell the truth despite knowing the questioning was necessary to establish a good character parnell regretted having to list his academic and scientific qualifications background and acclaim to the journalists hurried scribbling wondering if his arrest and arraignment would appear in british newspapers he hoped it wouldnt cause any embarrassment or harassment of english colleagues if it did or he abruptly thought his mother he had to call her just in case jackson took him in just as much detail through his employment by dubette and even into a detailed explanation of pharmacogenomics the media notetaking increased when jackson led the questioning on to parnells relationship with rebecca lang generalizing at first before coming specifically to the sunday at chesapeake bay and their return to the washington circle apartment parnells tension tightened when he began talking about the decision he and rebecca had made to live together frightened that jackson would introduce rebeccas admission of pregnancy but the lawyer didnt what was rebecca langs demeanour when she left your apartment to return to bethesda she was happy we both were about living together you didnt have an argument absolutely not fall out absolutely not what did you do after rebecca left your apartment sat around did some work id brought home with me went to bed you didnt call her no why not youd just made a romantic commitment a lot of people might have expected you to call to make sure she got home safely i know i just didnt i wish i had i could have started a search earlier maybe parnell swallowed not finishing he supposed jackson was anticipating some of the questioning he had to expect from the prosecutor now tell the court about the damage to your car insisted jackson it happened last thursday it had been all day in the dubette car park there was no damage when i left it there just after seven in the morning when i came out around seven thirty nine oclock someone had hit it describe the damage a wing and door were badly dented the bumper the fender was bent in the paint was broken yes was there much paint around on the ground i dont remember there being any what about paint from the car that hit you no i dont remember there being any trace of that either mr hanson stopped the judge addressing the prosecutor isnt that something that the court might have found useful to have been told as professor meadows has testified his was a preliminary examination said hanson not as quick to his feet as before told the court under crossexamination reminded the judge and used the word cursory not preliminary during a hearing to determine whether the accused is granted bail or remanded into custody to decide which the court wishes to know all facts available at the time of such consideration do you have witnesses either available or who can be called to help the court hanson turned questioningly to the two arresting officers bellamy shook his head turning back to the judge hanson said not at this moment mr jackson invited the judge mr parnell resumed his lawyer youve heard evidence of the contents of rebeccas handbag including a piece of paper with af written upon it have you any idea why that was there part of rebeccas job was to liaise with dubettes foreign subsidiaries and receive shipments from them for analysis and testing at mclean i can only assume it had something to do with that assume picked out jackson you and she did not discuss it on sunday no you had no idea it was in her purse none whatsoever i have an application to make which you might have already anticipated jackson told the judge but at this moment i have no further questions for my client mr hanson came the second invitation it was jackinthebox abruptness again but parnell had already inferred what jackson had referred to as an edge guessing that a lot of other people in the court were at least suspecting an inference as well and the sting was taken out of the attack but it was still an attack hanson took parnell through every question that had been put to him by jackson repeating them rewording them hectoring for replies but parnell remained quite controlled relaxed almost telling himself he hadnt really needed jacksons warnings although at once conceding that that was probably overconfidence there was a palpable desperation in hansons repetitive conclusion culminating with you killed her didnt you no chased her in the dark no rammed her off the road why should i have done that to the woman i loved and decided i wanted to set up home with it was not instinctive it was a reaction that had been growing in parnells mind throughout the rephrasing and repetition but the timing was devastating hanson had been bent over his legal pad intent on his listed hopefully hammerblow questions he came up startled by a question in return not a denying response hurriedly he said thats what im asking you to tell me as i have repeatedly tried to explain there is nothing to tell retorted parnell except to repeat as many times as you have repeated yourself that i did not chase by car crash into try to kill or successfully kill rebecca lang points and denials that i believe already to be well established mr hanson said the judge i think its time to get to submissions i would like to hear yours the confidence had gone from the prosecutor he spoke coherently prepared prepared clearly before the courtroom reversals but his argument lacked conviction or belief he stressed the seriousness of the accusations and insisted even more serious charges were to follow and demanded that the remand be in custody for the investigation to proceed to enable those additional charges to be formulated barry jacksons rebuttal was as forceful as vernon hansons had been falteringly weak the prosecutions grounds for a remand in custody had not been proved by a failed premature and inadequately conducted investigation upon which he might at some later stage invite the courts comment richard parnell was a man of unquestioned rectitude and integrity he totally and utterly refuted all the current and any subsequent charges and was prepared to offer in his own recognisance whatever bail the court might demand parnell was further prepared to surrender his passport to the court and report daily to any police authority although jackson invited the judge to rule that that authority be other than the one involved in the ongoing investigation throughout the submission hanson the two officers and professor jacob meadows sat stonefaced not looking at anyone the dubette lawyers peter baldwin and gerald fletcher also remained expressionless i want counsel to approach the bench again insisted the judge this time it was jackson who did most of the gesticulating but when they returned to their places hanson said i would once more like my strongest objection to any bail application to be placed on record in view of our discussions judge david wilson said let it be so recorded but it is in view of that discussion and at the moment unsubstantiated observations of defence counsel barry jackson that i am minded to take an unusual course i have concerns about several aspects of this custody application i do not consider it is one upon which i can or will give an immediate decision from the bench until matters raised by mr jackson have been resolved i fully recognize however that this court is considering a persons freedom or detention albeit how brief of either mr jackson where is your clients passport before his lawyer fully bent towards him parnell said the apartment loud enough for the judge to hear so nodded the blackrobed man without waiting for the relay i am putting the accused into the temporary custody of a court official and yourself mr jackson for the passport to be retrieved and returned here at two oclock today to be placed in the custody of this court should it be my decision to grant the bail application during that adjournment i shall properly and fully consider both submissions made to me this morning hope to get guidance upon the matter that has so far not been disclosed in open court and rule accordingly until then everyone rose to the ushers order it was the same usher whom wilson appointed their court escort with the admonishment that any overheard conversation between jackson and parnell was wholly governed and protected by client confidentiality despite that instruction parnell waited for jacksons lead in the car taking the three of them to the apartment the usher driving almost before they cleared the court precincts jackson said ebulliently we got our breaks parnell said i still need to know what the hell that is or was or perhaps still is this really is perry mason i know grinned jackson tomorrows headlines are going to be twice as big as todays please implored parnell he ached with the strain of the concentration with which hed had to hold himself in court what in christs name is the importance of af i havent confirmed that yet said jackson until i do it remains a matter for the closed court so how come i got released like this professor jacob meadows announced jackson his expert evidence has been discredited on three appeals one two years ago overturned a judgment of judge wilson i couldnt believe hansons court list when i saw it this morning thats why i so easily got the court protection order with the cars i just busked the questioning in court believing even less that id get the admissions that i did from him theres still a lot i dont understand about whats being claimed protested parnell me too conceded jackson soberly now i didnt know how right i was last night about opening up cans of worms there could be some we dont want to see the usher was lucky with a meter very close to parnells apartment outside of which there was already a waiting phalanx of cameramen the usher said i suppose ive got to come in with you this is a first for me as well come and get your moment of fame said jackson they endured the flashlights and strobes and parnell was conscious of faces at windows as there had been when hed left the dubette building inside the apartment he went directly to the bureau and retrieved the passport as he turned away offering it to the usher jackson nodded towards the telephone and said your lights flashing youve got a message all three men stood looking down at the apparatus while the message rewound then a bright voice said this is the acme toyota garage am monday responding to ms langs message of saturday sorry we havent been able to get back to you sooner mr parnell you want to call us on well fix a time either in dc or mclean to sort a repair estimate for your toyota like we told ms lang our estimates are free and we are the authorized toyota repair shop in the dc area look forward to hearing from you jackson extracted the tape from the machine with a surgeons delicacy and said this has gone beyond luck were now into i dont know what he looked parnell up and down disdainfully ive got calls to make and while im doing that you got time to clean yourself up and put on something you havent slept in you got to start making yourself look good for the cameras because theres going to be a lot more of those around before the days out thirteen richard parnell showered for a second time to wash off the imagined smell of detention and chose a collar and tie to go with the discreetly patterned sports jacket to match jacksons conservatism the lawyer nodded at his reappearance and said thatll do fine for whatever the hell else is going to come today ive lit a lot of fuses and there could be a very big bang i dont understand a word youve just said and i need to know when im going to protested parnell he felt like a specimen under one of his own microscopes an essentially alive but inanimate object blindly writhing and twisting youll know when i know promised jackson for the moment were going an inch at a time starting from when we leave here if we get ambushed again you say nothing i do all the talking but we dont hurry guilty people hurry and sure as hell richard my friend we aint guilty but other people are exactly of what im not at this moment quite sure so were lighting as many more fuses as we can there was the expected media encirclement outside the apartment and jackson murmured it was just what hed wanted and waited patiently for them all to get into position with their cameras focused before announcing that there had been a sensational development which he was unable to disclose until it had been brought before judge wilson with whom he had been in telephone contact and who had delayed for one hour the original court resumption for this new evidence to be produced that new evidence had elevated the investigation into the tragic death of rebecca lang to a federal level the circumstances of which would become clear later that day in the car the usher once more at the wheel parnell demanded what federal level flight af said jackson it rang a distant bell i had my office check it out while you were cleaning up and then spoke to guys i know at the j edgar hoover building its a paris to washington dc flight that was cancelled four times about three months ago after intelligence electronic eavesdropping picked up a reference to a terrorism attack it was in rebeccas bag said parnell disbelievingly you heard what bellamy and the montgomery woman said in court had it anything to do with the mystery french consignment wondered parnell at once why this one number thats a question youre going to be asked a lot of times over the next few days predicted jackson like i said im not sure were going to be happy with all the cans of worms weve opened this is now an fbi and homeland security investigation youre not suggesting rebecca could have been involved no thats too absurd even to think about im afraid youre going to have to think about it a lot said jackson there was some stuff from paris that didnt arrive in the usual way disclosed parnell at last rebecca was curious it turned out to be some check experiments that didnt work out according to the research vice president the project was cancelled you think its connected with that in the drivers seat the usher shifted and said im becoming uncomfortable about the confidentiality restrictions of this jackson said youre bound by a specific court order the judge is going to be told to parnell he said in court you leave everything to me understood with as much difficulty as im having understanding anything said parnell suddenly alert to where they were parnell said hey you took the wrong turn were going back into washington stop to make first said jackson were going to crystal city to the acme body shop no need for you to come in when we get there you just stay in the car remember who i am demanded parnell rhetorically im the person accused of what amounts to murder i have the right im not contesting that right shot back jackson and i havent forgotten who you are or what youre accused of you stay in the car because i think its best the best for you so thats what youll do im a client protested parnell and im not used to being talked to like that and winced at his own pomposity look at it as a learning curve dismissed jackson they went over the potomac high at the arlington bridge to miss the traffic buildup and as they turned along the george washington memorial parkway parnell saw the tidal basin to his left and remembered boastfully rowing rebecca upriver and unthinkingly said oh christ what demanded jackson beside him nothing you said something its not important everythings important i just thought of something everything you think about is important insisted the lawyer this wasnt refused parnell except that it was it was the first proper deeper realization deeper than that which had registered with him in burt showcrosss overcrowded office the previous day rebecca was dead he thought stepping the words out in his mind he wasnt any more going to take her rowing on the river or to a restaurant where their meal and wine was chosen for them or to a shack on a bay that looked as big as an ocean to glue themselves up eating crabs so small you ate everything shells and all someone had killed her murdered her and tried to make him a victim frame him as the murderer as well why what had she they done for anyone to do all that hate them so much to do all that parnell rejected the threadbare phrase that came automatically to mind hed make it make sense what could af mean except rebeccas obsession with that damned french business who where was the runaway lover rebecca would have taken him to her uncles restaurant introduced him given the man a name just as shed introduced parnell a place the obvious place to start bethesda even more obvious there had to be a clue there among her personal belongings a photograph a letter a name in an address book no matter how much she might have despised the man for her abandonment belongings he had no way no right to examine he reminded himself he had to find a way any way hed do it find it parnell came out of the reverie at their entry into an industrial park conscious that jackson was leaning forward to guide the court official at the wheel actually gesturing directions from an earlier tornoff page from the much used legal pad almost at once parnell saw the neon sign of the acme repair facility the lettering of its toyota appointment almost as big as the name itself the forecourt and a lot of what he could see behind the warehousesized building was a dead cars graveyard wait insisted jackson the usher shifted uncertainly i shouldnt leave him im responsible parnell said you mind not talking across me like i dont exist just give us a moment jackson asked parnell no longer demanding youll understand soon enough it was only a moment parnell straightened at the returning approach of jackson and the court officer another man and a woman walked with them almost to his car before detouring to another vehicle predictably a toyota all set announced jackson coming heavily into the back seat beside parnell theyre going to follow manager and the gal whose job it is to pick up all the weekend messages and did she do a hell of a good job he held up another cassette rebeccas voice is on it i didnt want you to have to go through hearing it more than once later in court im sorry said parnell and thanks parnell was by now accustomed to the waiting media scrum to which jackson repeated what hed said outside the apartment everyone from the morning arraignment was already waiting inside parnell took the seat hed previously occupied jackson sat the two acme garage employees in the first row beyond the separating court rail beside two men to whom he spoke after shaking hands finally he crossed for a whispered conversation with vernon hanson showing the prosecuting attorney the two tape loops and indicating the four beyond the rail they were interrupted by the court usher returning from the judges chambers at once the two lawyers followed the man back through a door from which hed just emerged the usher continued on gesturing to the two men whom jackson had greeted one a slightly studiously bespectacled man pushed through the rail and followed the usher with an awkward stifflegged walk it was ten minutes before they returned the usher with a tape replay machine under his arm bending close to parnell jackson said judge wilson listened to the tapes and heard who i intended to call hanson wanted to withdraw the charges there and then but i argued it should be done in open court and the judge agreed its payback time for jacob meadows and you everyone rose to the judges entry and this time the lawyer gestured for parnell to sit immediately after the man was settled there was a momentary uncertainty before hanson rose hurriedly but no longer with jackinthebox urgency and announced that in the light of new evidence of which the judge was aware he wished to withdraw all the charges i am aware of what has developed agreed the blackgowned judge and in view of the considerable publicity this matter has already aroused i believe in fairness to mr parnell that these new facts should be entered into the public domain i also think there are other matters that have been brought to my attention that should be discussed in open court after that you may withdraw your charges mr hanson but not before he turned into the court i believe there is another attorney who wishes to make an application before me i understand that neither mr jackson nor mr hanson has any objection both lawyers shook their heads as the man who had seen the judge in private pushed once more through the separating rail and walked unevenly to the stand the man gave his name on oath as edwin pullinger and identified himself as a counsel for the federal bureau of investigation he had been made aware of evidence that had been produced in court concerning an air france flight that had been the subject of an inconclusive terrorism investigation both in the united states and france the fbi in conjunction with the office of homeland security were responsible for investigations into terrorism and he was making formal application for the death of ms rebecca lang to be officially transferred by the court from metro dc police to the federal bureau of investigation mr hanson questioned the judge there is no objection from the prosecution immediately surrendered the lawyer mr jackson i am anxious for it to be transferred said parnells lawyer before this court so orders there are other matters for it to consider mr jackson parnells lawyer stood with a legal pad in his hand but did not appear to need the notes his client had been arraigned on totally false charges as the result of an investigation that was this afternoon to be exposed as initially wrongly and too hastily conducted incompetent and potentially criminal in intent and which could have resulted in a serious miscarriage of justice that was not strictly a matter within the fbi remit into the terrorist aspect that had emerged but he hoped their enquiries extended to what had clearly been a criminal attempt to incriminate his client he intended further to invite the court to order a separate examination into the conduct and competence of the metro dc police department and its claimed expert witnesses as jackson spoke parnell pointedly turned looking first to vernon hanson and then more intently to the two metro dc officers all three were staring unfocused directly ahead so was the forensics professor jacob meadows parnell was surprised although he supposed he shouldnt have been at jackson recalling him to the stand formally to give evidence of his having discovered the answeringmachine message from the toyotaapproved garage at his apartment that morning which was confirmed by the court official who followed him to the stand hanson shook his head tightlipped at the overly courteous invitation to crossexamine it was the usher who operated the tape machine to play back the repairshop message directly after which jackson called its manager the man testified that the voice on the tape was his and that he had been responding at eightthirty on the previous day monday morning to a message that had been left on their answering service timed at five thirtytwo on the saturday afternoon the girl followed her manager to the stand she described accessing the recorded messages as her first job of the day their machine had a time counter which was how they could be so precise on ms langs saturday call coming at five thirtytwo pm at jacksons demand she stopped for the usher to insert into the replay machine the tape recovered that morning from the repair shop rebeccas voice echoed into the hushed court rising and falling rebecca obviously doing something else at the same time a friends car got hit in his firms car lot hes very busy will let it go if someone doesnt fix it for him please call him she dictated the apartment number then if he asks how why you called tell him a friend its a surprise the coughing gulping emotion welled up within parnell who knew most people in the court were looking at him as hed known there would have been faces at the dubette windows yesterday his eyes misted in his effort to subdue the coughing which he did trying to wipe them at the same time as blowing his nose which he needed to do thats why she hadnt told him on the sunday shed wanted an innocent simple surprise for someone too workobsessed to do anything for himself this court rules in favour of the fbi application announced judge wilson to prevent any future prejudice in what is now to be at my formal request an ongoing fbi investigation i will not comment beyond making clear my deep and profound disappointment at having such a case brought before me in the manner in which it was even at a remand stage i do however require for any future action i might consider separate explanations from both the metro dc police department and the attorneys division of this city detailing how such a situation arose he nodded to parnell who hurriedly stood to jacksons prompting you mr parnell leave this court a totally innocent and vindicated man with the apologies of this court for the experience to which you were subjected i further order that complete and full costs be paid for your defence irrespective of any separate action you and your legal advisors might contemplate you also have the courts sympathy for your personal loss jackson bustled parnell into the barely furnished anteroom in which they had begun the day together pressing the door closed behind him by leaning against it as he said jesus what a day but we won boy how we won thanks said parnell simply a lot of it fell into my lap our laps the tape particularly howd you get the fbi involved like that started out in their counsels department at the j edgar hoover building before going private kept a few friends there once i confirmed af it was a walk in the park i want the bastards who did it exclaimed parnell itll get done promised jackson you pick up on the judges hint for a civil suit against the police of course shrugged parnell but whats the point dont make any decisions yet its all too soon he shouted enter to the hesitant knock at the door striding forward to meet the fbi lawyer whom he at once introduced to parnell ed pullinger said barry tells me youve no idea at all how that flight number came to be in ms langs purse none declared parnell what i do know am totally sure of is that rebecca had no knowledge of or connection with terrorism its ludicrous barry told me that too youre not planning to go anywhere are you mr parnell no ill give you my personal guarantee that my client will remain in the city and be available at all times said jackson formally pullinger nodded smiling for the first time to the other lawyer he said you sure kicked ass in there they were bending over making it easy said jackson i guess well be seeing quite a lot of each other said pullinger i guess said jackson to parnell he said you ready to meet the baying media i suppose so dont gloat advised jackson you won but rebeccas dead you think i need reminding and be careful as you go continued the lawyer ignoring the retort we just humiliated a whole police department whove now been put under investigation themselves and stand a good chance of being humiliated a lot more the officer who catches you drunk at the wheel or even parking illegally goes straight on to the roll of honour with extra laurel leaves i dont drive drunk but i hear what youre saying they were overwhelmed by the waiting media on the courtroom steps and this time jackson shuffled back into second place responding to the questions he could select from the babble parnell said he was glad the matter was now in the hands of the fbi and looked forward to an early arrest of the people whod murdered rebecca and tried to incriminate him he had no idea how the af flight number came to be in rebecca langs purse but part of her job at dubette had been to liaise with their overseas subsidiaries and he believed that was the connection he would of course cooperate in every way demanded by the fbi he had not yet decided whether to sue metro dc police it had been a frightening experience made the more horrifying by rebeccas death he hesitated at a repeated onceignored question before saying that he had hoped to marry rebecca and that he was devastated by her killing he was anxious to return to his job and his department as soon as possible it was too early for them to expect that he or those working with him would have made any genetic breakthroughs of course they were hopeful expectant even he couldnt give any details of what the results might be parnell was grateful for jacksons pressure at his elbow moving forward to the lawyers waiting car shaking his head against any more questions inside the vehicle jackson said where do you want to go he didnt know parnell thought it was a brief but unsettling moment of mental blankness hurriedly recovering he said the nearest hertz rental outlet ive got some catching up to do as he drove jackson said youve got all my numbers well obviously need to keep in touch dont forget what i said about watching your back i wont how absurd unreal to be seriously getting and intending to take a warning like that in the supposed land of freedom and law any time day or night ive got it parnell hesitated at hiring another toyota but irritably dismissed the hesitation it was the car with which he was most familiar and which it therefore made sense for him to drive on his way back to the apartment he remembered the gapingmouthed answering machine and stopped for a replacement recording loop he approached washington circle cautiously unwilling to face another media gauntlet relieved that there wasnt one inside the apartment he reloaded the machine and remained reflectively by the telephone it was already four thirty and it would probably take him an hour to get to mclean as the rush hour built up there was no ongoing work he could usefully do until the following day maybe not even then so it was pointless contemplating the mile journey and he hadnt been talking about dubette when hed told the lawyer he had a lot of catching up to do it was dubette he called though smiling at kathy richardsons immediate concern when she recognized his voice before hed said who he was he assured her he was fine that everything was fine and got himself transferred to beverley jackson she said at once weve been hearing a lot on the radio im ok i only wish rebecca was theyre talking murder on the radio thats what its being investigated as thanks for what you did getting barry hes a hell of a lawyer i didnt know not when i called anything more i can do asked the woman get me put over to dwight newton ill be in tomorrow morning sure youre ok persisted beverley no thought parnell im not sure at all he said i told you im fine spread the word ill be in first thing tomorrow newtons secretary said the vice president wasnt there and wouldnt be in until the following afternoon shed mark his diary for parnell to be his first appointment and was glad things had worked out as well as she understood they had but it was awful about rebecca the urgent introductory music to live at was playing when parnell switched on the television to be confronted by his own oddly averted face a blownup still photograph when the voiceover commentary referred to murder his picture was replaced by one of rebecca lang which he guessed to be a dubettes personnel file print she looked startled almost nervous of the camera what about his appearance parnell hadnt been conscious of television cameras inside the court which he thought he would have been judge wilsons concluding speech was given in full with parnell half in shot and he was curious at his own subdued appearance which persisted outside with the impromptu press conference into his mind came the brief blankness in jacksons car and parnell acknowledged that how he looked on film was how hed felt frightened needing someone elses support which was as much a surprise as his earlier selfacknowledgement of being frightened because parnell had always been sure he could climb the highest mountain and swim the widest oceans all by himself he wasnt used to and most certainly didnt like the obvious loss of the confidence hed always known and taken for granted barbara spacey dubettes chainsmoking psychologist would doubtless argue it was nothing about which to be ashamed or discomfited but he was the segment ended still on the courthouse steps with a reporter restating the fbis official confirmation that they were conducting their enquiry as a murder investigation the reporter also recounted the official refusal of metro dc police to respond to the judges criticism of its competence over shots of peter bellamy and helen montgomery hurriedly leaving the rear of their headquarters building bellamy holding his hat to shield his face youre all over the papers and on television and you look awful said his mother i was afraid i would be what the hells its ok stopped parnell not wanting another familiar phrase ive been cleared by the court of being in any way connected with rebeccas death someone tried to set me up what about terrorism demanded the woman in england its an fbi investigation now why should anyone want to set you up who would want to set you up i dont know no one knows not yet whos rebecca lang a girl ive been seeing theyre saying you were going to get married we were moving in together i think i should come out no refused parnell theres no need im all right now ive got a good lawyer was this girl murdered we think so and they tried to get you accused of it yes get the hell out of there come home i certainly cant wont do that the fbi want me here you sure youre not in any danger no thought parnell who hadnt been able to think what sort of situation he was in absolutely positive keep in touch ill start rearranging my diary just in case i dont want you to come over because you think there is danger because i dont want you to get caught up in the nonsense of it well see ill keep in touch i promise youd better parnell timed his leaving the apartment to arrive in wisconsin avenue at the moment the restaurant opened not thinking until he was passing the four seasons hotel actually into georgetown that in the circumstances it might be shut having got that close he continued anyway the blackness of the restaurant the moment he turned up from m street answering the unasked question parnell accepted that the lights at the rear could be part of a burglary precaution but ignored the closed sign and repeatedly sounded the bell as well as knocking against the glass and rattling the door encouraged by what he thought to be a sound from within finally a door opened at the back and an accented voice shouted that they were closed and couldnt he read before rebeccas uncle looked out and saw him for the first few seconds parnell believed giorgio falcone was still going to turn him away instead the man finally picked his way through the alreadylaid tables opened the door and pulled parnell in arms around his shoulders mumbling words parnell couldnt understand from the way he was shaking parnell realized the older man was crying parnell was led back into the kitchen where the chef hed only ever known as ciro and an assistant hed never met both dressed for work were sitting at a table on which were already stacked three dirty plates next to a pot of remaining spaghetti there was also one empty wine bottle and another half full falcone wiped his eyes unembarrassed and said something in italian and the two men stood awkwardly to offer their hands which parnell shook selfconsciously just as awkwardly the chef said we saw you on television you cried almost admitted parnell wishing as he spoke that he hadnt qualified it the other man pulled another chair up for parnell all three waited until he sat down before sitting themselves falcone said who did it no one knows not yet said parnell theyll get him though catch the pigfucker parnell hesitated deciding against saying he didnt know instead he said yes theyll get him you know what happened only what the police who arrested me told me pigfuckers too said ciro have you eaten he hadnt not since the softshelled crabs parnell remembered im not hungry it didnt seem right to eat to want to eat although he suddenly accepted that he did desperately unasked the other man poured parnell a glass of chianti what did they tell you asked falcone parnell hesitated looking at the redeyed man theres a canyon a gorge in rock creek park rebeccas car was hit forced over a protective barrier falcones throat began to work but he swallowed against more tears would she have no stopped parnell no i dont think so he didnt know if she would have suffered from her injuries before dying he realized the chef muttered something in italian and crossed himself falcone said why did they accuse you they thought they had evidence but they were wrong parnell sipped his wine aware of the hollowness of his echoing stomach on television stumbled falcone they said on television that you and rebecca were going to marry and celebrate here last night remembered parnell we only decided at the weekend you would have been good together decided the uncle you would have had my blessing he straightened finishing the wine between them and nodding to the chefs assistant to open another bottle the funeral is friday that could be the needed excuse for his visit parnell decided when we were talking at the weekend rebecca told me she had a previous fiance falcone frowned a long time ago about two years i thought she said the man shrugged maybe it broke up but they came here together i guess do you remember his name where he lived falcone made an uncertain movement again washington somewhere i guess what about a name there was a further dismissive shrug the older mans mouth pulled down doubtfully i dont remember alan perhaps i think it was alan but im not sure why i thought it might be right to invite him to the funeral said parnell thats kind said the restaurant owner but i dont have a name or an address pressed parnell falcone shook his head im sorry it had always been an outside chance parnell accepted if you remember find something giorgio frowned curious for the first time sure the fbi are investigating parnell hurried on they said on television they might want to talk to you what about rebecca theyll want to know about rebecca everyone loved her insisted the chef why did they do it demanded falcone thickvoiced again i want them caught i want them dead what did he want parnell wondered to know why he answered himself fourteen by edward c grants edict this new york encounter wasnt at the corporate building but at an hotel the plaza on central park south overlooking the park it was booked from a reservations agency in an assumed name and paid for in advance in cash dwight newton was given the suite number by telephone grants cellphone to his cellphone not through the hotel switchboard or traceably dialled surprisingly there was coffee on a separating table when newton arrived grant waited expectantly for the vice president to pour as he did newton said the fbi are investigating i saw the newscasts read the newspapers said grant totally controlled evenvoiced what are we going to do grant had to be nervous to have arranged the meeting like this like something out of a movie grant frowned concerned at the other mans nervousness to assess which was the major reason for his summoning the stickthin scientist yet again on the first shuttle from washington im not sure about that question dwight said the disconcerted whitemaned man not sure we need to do anything are you the fbi are investigating for christs sake repeated newton theyll almost certainly want to question us you corrected grant still evenvoiced theyll almost certainly want to question you i dont see that ill be able to help them very much newton sat with his cooling coffee untouched before him looking as steadily as possible at the other man wondering how directly he could ask the awful question to get the awful confirmation of his every doubt not directly at all newton decided instead he said what shall i tell them what is there to tell them rebecca lang worked in your overseas unit she was very competent did her work well we were very happy with her were devastated by what happened what if they ask about france grant lifted and dropped his shoulders here again i dont see why they should its got nothing to do with what theyre enquiring into has it newton tensed himself lips initially tight together hasnt it grant came forward from the opposing chair elbows on his knees dwight i really am finding it difficult to follow you here theyll most definitely talk to security learn about the telephone monitor so her names on the list talking to paris she was in the overseas liaison unit wed be disappointed if she hadnt spoken to paris and a lot of other places abroad the monitor wasnt exclusively on her telephone was it no conceded newton expectantly and her name isnt the only one on the list no further conceded the other man again fuck you he thought and then he thought i wish i could i wish so very much i could escape from the entanglement in which i am enmeshed in which you are enmeshed she wasnt being specifically targeted security came up with a lot of names agreed newton but none proved to be the suspected outside informant certainly not from any of the researchdivision telephones it was all so easily so satisfactorily explainable newton accepted no he said we didnt find an outside informant from the checks we initiated but weve every right to be vigilant yes newton had the irrational impression of being stuck in a sucking morass mud too thick to get out of with the rising water creeping up to engulf him could you get me another coffee dwight the vice president poured ignoring his own almost full cup they could come across the french things along with every other research experiment were conducting exclaimed the dubette president genuinely incredulous but lets stay with that for a moment tell me about rifofludine does it have a preserving quality in hot climactic conditions to a degree allowed newton reluctantly grant sighed theatrically does it have a preserving quality in hot climatic conditions yes and the colouring additives make dosage administration and recognition easier in third world countries yes which means were providing a necessary service improving our products for a specific market yes i really thought wed already talked all this through dwight i suppose we had we got anything more to talk through i dont think so you really sure about that dwight yes im really sure im glad about that really glad were understanding each other now tell me about parnell i havent seen him yet he rejected our attorney gerry fletcher but baldwin kept fletcher in court to represent dubettes interests why didnt parnell want our guy fletcher thought the only way was to enter a plea grant nodded but didnt immediately comment parnells an ornery son of a bitch and isnt that the truth i guess how much further how much more was he expected to capitulate grant said that was a good move keeping fletcher in court to watch our backs important to keep ourselves up to speed on anything and everything that might adversely affect the company theres too much publicity im worried about it affecting the stock lets get the legal department to ensure a legal heavyweight better than fletcher in case we need him need him for what risked newton unchallenged situations getting out of hand weve got nothing to hide everything to protect you understand what im saying i think so get public affairs working give the media full access to what rebecca lang did i dont want dubette fouled up in any mystery theories that her death had anything to do with what she was working on ok for a brief moment it was difficult for newton to find the words any word to respond dont you think that might be difficult in the circumstances tell public affairs full cooperation with every media outlet maybe you head up a press conference after all weve got nothing whatsoever to hide remember that nothing whatsoever echoed newton flatly the water had to be almost up to his chin now he wasnt sure whether he wanted to strain upwards to save himself or put his head down to drown what do we know about rebecca lang family friends stuff like that briskly demanded grant now it was newton who frowned she and parnell were going to get married according to the papers and what he said on television her mother and father are both dead next of kin is listed on the personnel records as an uncle lives locally in the dc area get personnel involved wayne denny himself dubette will pick up all the bills whatever sort of funeral they want they get reception afterwards their choice whatever wherever you attend showcross too of course anyone else in the unit who wants to go i understand oh god do i understand thought newton tell parnell to take as much time off as he wants get denny anyone else you can think of involved here too ok how about you dwight me whats happened is horrifying a member of dubette staff your staffmurdered an attempt made apparently to incriminate a department head understandable that it would have gotten to you its gotten to a lot of us one way and another im ok lied newton he was anxious now to get away no longer to feel he was drowning to be part of whatever he feared himself to be part of thats good to hear said grant very good indeed he came forward once more across their intervening table arms on his knees intense i want you to tell me something dwight something its very important for me to know totally and completely believe you dont think dont believe that anyone in dubette is in any way involved or connected with whatever happened to rebecca and almost happened to dick parnell do you no newton finally surrendered as hed known all along that he would the nausea a physical sensation deep in his stomach i dont think that at all what would have happened to him he wondered if hed said anything otherwise no one seemed to know how to react to his return parnell had accepted during the ride to mclean that he would inevitably be the focus of everyones attention from the very moment of his arrival at the dubette gatehouse but hadnt known how it would register it started with uncertain looks or pointedly no looks in his direction at all from other drivers as he parked the rented toyota only four spaces from where hed left his own car three days earlier there were more hesitant earlywarned faces at the windows and as he got closer to the building he was conscious of a lot of doubtful needingtobeguided faces very occasionally there was a half wave or gesture of encouragement from people he didnt know in front of the elevator bank three people a man and two women held back for him to get a car to himself there were more half smiles and a few inconclusive gestures as he walked the gauntlet of the overlooked corridor into the spiders web initially the indeterminate attitude existed even in his own pharmacogenomics department where everyone was already assembled in greeting which they didnt know how to make once he got there it was beverley jackson who broke the impasse coming towards him with both hands outstretched to prompt his reaching forward in response leading the rest to follow with awkward handshakes and shoulder slaps we dont quite know what to say what to do beverley unnecessarily admitted i dont know that theres anything to say or do said parnell i seem to be causing some embarrassment whatever you want need just ted lapiduss offer trailed away into more awkwardness i think i want to get back to work catch up on whatever needs to be caught up with you quite sure youre started sean sato halted by the look on parnells face parnell said we just got a new unbreakable rule for the department no one asks me if im ok ok only deke pulbrow said ok and then he said oh shit the japanese american said im sorry its just that just that just that theres nothing else to do or to say parnell finished for him he allowed space into the discomfort hoping to puncture it thanks all of you to borrow dekes word its been a shit time and will probably go on being a shit time for i dont know how long whatever i want things to go on here without me if its necessary with me if and whenever its possible he looked to kathy richardson anything i need to do need to know a lot of media calls yesterday and already today ive logged them his newly installed answeringmachine loop at washington circle had been exhausted by the time hed got back from georgetown the previous evening parnell hadnt responded to any and let the tape fill up again without picking up the receiver he shook his head in refusal and said nothing else the matronly secretary looked fleetingly at beverley jackson your lawyer called said he was at the office number you have and would be for most of the day if you want to talk anything from dwights office the woman shook her head you want me to check hes not due back until this afternoon accepted parnell just thought his schedule might have changed he looked around the people still gathered around him knowing they were expecting something from him but not able at that precise brief moment to formulate anything in his mind it was going to be difficult to force the pace the dispassion even but parnell acknowledged that he had to evolve a way of conducting himself to make happen what he wanted to happen for his life to go on at two separate equally important levels as unlinked and independent of each other as possible were the two levels equally important of course not finding rebeccas killer whod tried to incriminate him as well was the most important his absolute priority the department this department that had once all too recently and far far too much consumed him and his every thought was secondary now very secondary indeed to avenging rebecca forcing himself to be still certainly striving for a lightness that wasnt there parnell said so whos made the breakthrough thats going to make us all famous the headslowered hesitation was the criticism he didnt need of how wrongly placed the remark had been it was beverley who hurried in trying to cover his difficulty talking of three experiments shed conducted upon mice with dubettes products without finding an immediate way of introducing a genetically linked improvement which gradually opened the discussion among the others it quickly became apparent to parnell that virtually no experimental avenues had emerged to follow which he hadnt expected anyway but it took away the atmosphere caused by his mistaken remark and he was grateful it was hard for him to concentrate as fully as he knew he should upon their individual accounts but he managed sufficiently to ask the necessarily comprehending questions more than once ted lapidus remarked that everything parnell was being told had been fully discussed and agreed in the committeestyle manner in which they had decided to operate sean sato was the last to contribute and almost from the moment the man began talking parnells attention became absolute avian influenza he queried interrupting the man i thought you were focusing on hepatitis c we got a visit from russell benn soon after you lapidus halted on monday tokyos heading up a project decided on by the company the speciesjumping of flu from fowls and wild animals to humans that causes epidemics that start in asia virtually every year the world health organization are warning that if a human being already suffering influenza becomes infected with bird flu the two viruses could integrate and mutate into an unknown and currently untreatable strain transmitting from human to human very easily to become a global pandemic like the one that killed more than twenty million people after the first world war what direction is the project taking asked parnell he wasnt letting his mind drift now properly committedly back at work it felt good a vaccine said sato for humans or birds asked parnell both if possible said lapidus hn the avian virus that emerged in early is too lethal to be grown in chicken eggs even to hope to create a vaccine parnell pointed out thats why benns been tasked with producing something a different way said lapidus and why he wants us on board finished sato everything tokyos tried should be arriving later today or tomorrow wed better prepare the sterile laboratory said parnell already done said lapidus i know none of you need to be told but have you warned kathy itll be out of bounds asked parnell indicating her office to which the secretary had already returned very clearly said the balding pebblebespectacled peter battey i like the way youve worked while i wasnt here thanked parnell sincerely i started lapidus but at once corrected himself again we talked about it and decided hepatitis could wait this is our first chance to get involved in a current priority programme and he hadnt been here when it was formulated thought parnell but he was now do we know if the competition are trying to do the same as us not at this level said mark easton the former johns hopkins geneticist but its an easy guess that they are were talking megabucks on a global scale thailand just one of seven or eight asian countries farming chicken exports one and a half billion dollars worth of poultry every year europe imports a third of the chicken thailand produces its good to be involved even if its because our traditional colleagues across the corridor recognize that they need all the help they can get said parnell but from the rundown youve just given me seans working on it alone if its a priority with red lights flashing shouldnt we make up our own definition of a task force thought about that too assured lapidus as i said we dont yet have the specimens to begin work which we should be able to do tomorrow seans doing the groundwork now youre back its obviously your decision but i was intending to join him along with beverley the greek had very definitely adopted the role of deputy leader parnell recognized which was good providing it didnt arouse any jealousy or resentment among the others and that didnt seem to have happened so far sounds a good plan to me agreed parnell ill go across the corridor sometime to see how benn and his people are working i really dont know how youve got the resilience to consider working yourself said beverley im not sure i have admitted parnell harry johnson was grants second visitor of the day to the discreet plaza hotel suite the bell summons repeated impatiently before grant opened the door the dubette security chief was dressed for what he imagined the occasion to be in a suit and tie but with the permanently shined plasticized dubette uniform shoes the suit was baggy and stained the shirt crumpled from previous wear nobody saw me arrive assured johnson whats going down here his visit had been arranged in the same cellphonetocellphone way thats what i want to talk about said grant the hotel security needed overhauling not to have questioned johnsons dishevelled presence grant hoped the man wouldnt be remembered if any hotel staff were called upon to do so johnson collapsed uninvited into an encompassing armchair looked around the suite and said nice place class thats what i like class when wondered grant had the man sitting opposite ever experienced it but then he sometimes frequented places that would have surprised anyone who knew him how the fuck did af get into the frame you wanted to discredit parnell create a situation where you could dispense with him in such a way as to make him unemployable reminded johnson i didnt know rebecca lang was dead how shed died i didnt stir this shit like you did once before dont forget that will i ever be allowed to were a long way from the cliff edge said johnson helping himself to the now virtually cold coffee youve involved the fbi for fucks sake i didnt know rebecca lang was going to die didnt know until i got the call from the metro dc police guys at which time i didnt have the opportunity to talk to you i had to improvise use my own judgement this isnt good insisted grant it could all unravel howd she die how why did rebecca die i dont know sir a lot of unusual things strangely coincidental things happened that sunday things i didnt expect to happen rebecca langs death the most unexpected of all can you help me with that i told you i dont know we gotta smelly bunch of shit to pick our way through judged johnson you wanna point out the path were going to take together to make the stories chime edward c grants recitation was practically a repeat of his earlier conversation with dwight newton at the end of it johnson said could hold if everyone in turn holds their nerve what about the two metro dc shitheads demanded grant theyre looking at the drop if they start to flake know theyre looking at steak and cake if they stay cool but they didnt know it was murder when we did the deal if ive got to keep a handle on this i need to know the facts he sniggered remember that what they used to say in dragnet just the facts just give me the facts i used to love that show its too long ago to remember sighed grant who considered harry johnson to be the one unavoidable forever inescapable mistake he had ever allowed to happen dont forget your drop harry or yours came back the security chief at once everythings superglued nothings going to fall apart you absolutely sure about that im absolutely sure about that echoed the fatbellied man thats what im employed to be isnt it to be absolutely sure about everything thats what youre employed for agreed grant softly i wont forget that nor should you ever but johnson had forgotten grant thought hed become complacent not properly fully thinking things through to their logical conclusion which made him a liability grant didnt like liabilities his own most of all so we dont have a problem said johnson you ensure that we dont insisted grant you gotta drink anywhere here find a bar downtown ordered grant a long way downtown the greeting was even more effusive than it had initially been on the day of parnells threatened resignation dwight newton was already around his desk leg hitched upon its front at parnells entry he thrust forward and enclosed the englishmans hand in both of his changing the grip as he was pumping up and down to slap parnell on the shoulder the gesture was timed to the second abruptly ending for parnell to be ushered into the already prepared chair the grave look already in place when the head of research regained his own side of the desk good to see you back dick damned good a tragedy an absolute tragedy about rebecca you got my sympathy the sympathy of the entire upper management of dubette thank you said parnell illogically he felt the sort of embarrassment he guessed everyone had been feeling at encountering him earlier ive got some things to tell you announced newton carefully listing every assistance proposed by edward c grant earlier that day in new york thats from the president himself and im to tell you youre to take off as much time as you want none of us can imagine what it was like is like for you just cant imagine what id like is to get back to work as quickly and as uninterrupted as possible said parnell repeating what hed told his own team im not sure how rebeccas uncle will take the offer of help i get the feeling hes a pretty proud and independent old guy nothing for you to worry about thats for wayne denny and personnel i want you to know something on a personal level i never believed for a moment that you could be in any way involved why not the question blurted from parnell unthinkingly and his surprise at uttering it was increased at newtons obvious and immediate confusion it was unthinkable inconceivable you were a couple in love everybody knew that you dont murder the woman you love did everyone know it parnell supposed they did someone murdered her and tried to frame me someone who certainly knew them both knew their cars and their movements certainly rebeccas when shed left washington circle but whoever it was couldnt have known she wasnt staying over so he and rebecca would have had to have been watched all the time the killer would have had to follow her from bethesda on sunday morning seen them leave the apartment in rebeccas car both tightly safely seatbelted been at an adjoining bench at chesapeake bay maybe and driven behind them all the way back again and then sat and waited and watched some more as long as they had to until rebecca got into a position to be ambushed whoever had done that couldnt have known rebecca wouldnt be staying overnight so the surveillance had to have been absolute around the clock it was obvious but parnell hadnt thought the sequence through it would be more than obvious to the trained investigators from the fbi too but hed still mention it set it out to illustrate how meticulously it had all been planned whats that flight number all about i dont know insisted parnell you didnt know it was in rebeccas purse no she didnt talk to you about it no the switch and the interrogation was intriguing thought parnell i cant believe it any of it protested the headshaking vice president its monstrous the work of a monster how many wondered newton and led or ordered by the head monster he was glad hed changed into the white laboratory coat sure the sweat that was gluing his body at the effort he was having to make would have soaked through his shirt to become visible i hear theres a big project underway said parnell anxious to move the conversation on accepting that this interview was a required courtesy sympathy offered help extended but there seemed little point or purpose i told you it didnt work started newton but then quickly said the flu research sure were really under the gun on this one you think youre going to be able to help flu animal and human is viral thats how its medically feasible for those viruses to mutate into one killer strain said parnell and viruses have genes we can isolate and experiment with which isnt a promise for any sort of discovery just my agreeing with you and russell benn that its well within the pharmacogenomics discipline you work closely with russ urged newton i plan to remember everything i said insisted newton dont forget dubettes family orientation i wont undertook parnell kathy richardson was waiting for his return jotting pad in hand to tell him barbara spacey wanted to see him he said call her back and say thanks but i dont want or need to see her she said youd say that makes her good at her job said parnell call her it wasnt until he recovered the papers that hed abandoned on the monday morning that parnell properly recalled what he had been working on the compilation of their separate cancer file which hed been in the process of subdividing eventually to establish a working routine when it became a project for the entire department now there was another more urgent project one it was important they devoted as much of their undivided attention to as possible which meant the cancer undertaking would have to be further postponed but then it always had been one for the future when they had exhausted all the immediate examination of possible dubette updates hed attach himself to the flu research parnell decided it was the first specific demand that had been directed at them so it was right would be expected that he should lead it as head of the department parnell felt a flicker of anticipation it would in many ways be getting back to the pure research hed known on the genome project in england parnell was reassembling the cancer folder to give to kathy richardson to file when there was a sharp rap at the door just ahead of the secretarys warning and the shawled and longskirted figure of barbara spacey surged into his office like a ship under full sail the psychologist said you didnt want to see me but i wanted to see you and dwight newton can see us both if he bothers to look so you cant smoke see the sacrifice im making you neednt ive banned the remark from the department but for just one last time im ok and i dont need counselling how do you know because i do childtalk he recognized your fiancee just got killed and you got charged with it and theres an fbi terrorism investigation linked to an obvious murder and youre telling me you feel fine and just want to get on with the job no im telling you i feel anything but fine because how could i feel fine after whats happened and i want the bastards who did it caught but that im not suffering any psychological problem but if i begin to think that i am ill come back to you ok how often too often that word those two letters entered every conversation barbara spacey pulled a chair forward to be closer to parnell as she had been at their previous session and slumped into it the voluminous clothes concealed her like an enveloping curtain but beneath the folds parnell knew she would be overlapping the seat she said sorry buddy company instructions every care for someone in distress they want another assessment im not in started parnell and stopped his mind focused far ahead of this conversation two assessments the youknowhowitis movement ruffled barbara spaceys layers of clothes like feathers you really want to discuss to try to discuss the circumstances lets give everyone a break here how do families look after families most of the time by not smothering each other no thats a copout you realize how much support dubette are offering i wont be smothered the way its going youll know dubette will know more about me than i know about myself isnt that what families do persisted the woman her hands were twitching over her handbag which parnell guessed contained her cigarettes no thats smothering as i already told you ive got to do what ive got to do said the woman give me a break ok to cooperate would be the quickest way to get rid of the psychologist parnell realized ok tell me how you feel i already told you tell me again confused frightened parnell examined the question no i dont feel frightened i suppose i should but at this moment i dont why not youre right you should i dont know you think you can solve it all by yourself parnell hesitated again no of course i dont think that im a scientist not a detective but youve thought about it solving it by yourself exacting your own justice maybe barbara spaceys prescience was unnerving sure ive thought about it wouldnt anyone im glad youre being honest how can you tell we did this before remember parnell didnt is that it i think so her hands were actually moving scratching at her handbag do i get a copy like before its the law she reminded him like not smoking whats your point whats your verdict barbara spacey smiled that confirms it what the hells that mean what i was deciding you ducking my question the psychologist shook her head youre not so much of the asshole that you were before for several moments parnell stared at her across the desk stunned at last he said so whats that make me now thats the mystery admitted barbara spacey i dontknow from behind the dividing glass between the two offices kathy richardson was gesturing towards the telephone to the psychologist parnell said maybe youll never know i analyse mysteries i dont want to have it happen to me barbara spacey smiled ive got to go im dying for a cigarette kathy richardson was at the door waiting to enter as the psychologist left the secretary said the fbi want a meet with you tomorrow wherever you want theyre suggesting ten oclock tell them ten oclocks fine at the washington field office to save him coming all the way out here fifteen but for the fact that there was no facial resemblance which didnt alter parnells immediate impression the two men confronting him in the fbis washington field office could have been twins they were both of the same indeterminate height and build and wore their mousy hair short and neatly parted to the left the spectacles were rimless the style minimal their faces unlined by apparent worry or concentration they didnt smile either the suits were grey the faint check difficult to detect the ties matching but subdued red parnell guessed the identical pins in their lapels represented a college fraternity howard dingley his seniority marked by his being behind the uncluttered desk wore a signet ring on the little finger of his left hand his partner david benton didnt instead a copper rheumatismpreventing bracelet protruded slightly from beneath the left arm of his doublecuffed shirt dingley said weve got ourselves a very highprofile investigation here mr parnell highprofile because of what was attempted against you after ms langs murder you any idea how lucky you were that ms lang made that call no i dont suppose i have not fully admitted parnell im still trying to understand what the hells going on there was the familiar buzzsaw sound to ms thats what were trying to do have to do said benton and why youre the key to everything said dingley predictably the accents matched clipped inahurry east coast which parnell believed he could already isolate guess at least from the more leisurely midwest or west coast thats why im here to do all everything i can do to help thats what we wanted to hear said benton tell us about af theres nothing to tell said parnell i dont know what it was doing in rebeccas bag her job was to liaise with dubettes overseas subsidiaries there are a lot it has to be something to do with that a flight on which a shipment came in a particular flight which both your gchq and our national security agency picked up while listening to suspected terrorist chatter said dingley as well as french security which was why it was cancelled four times i know i cant help you said parnell how do you know seized benton it was stated in court when i was released whats your take on it demanded benton your arrest the way metro dc police behaved you mean what do i think dingley nodded i dont know stumbled parnell awkwardly i mean i know what happened but i dont know how or why tell us about ms lang said benton it came as a shock to parnell to realize how very little he actually did know about rebecca we met at dubette started seeing each other a relationship began her father was american her mother italian both dead now he stopped in full recollection in a car crash as far as i know her only relation is an uncle who owns giorgios pizzeria on wisconsin its called giorgios his name is giorgio falcone she was a graduate of georgetown university here in dc worked at johns hopkins before joining dubette she was attached to the division coordinating their overseas subsidiarys laboratories the two fbi agents looked at him waiting yes prompted dingley thats about it said parnell benton frowned i thought you were getting married wed decided to live together i guess with the eventual intention of getting married but you hadnt learned a lot about each other said dingley thats what people live together for isnt it to learn about each other said parnell he wasnt sounding very intelligent parnell realized forthcoming even before there could be any further questions parnell said i have thought about things about that sunday wed like to hear about it urged benton it began in a disorganized rush but parnell stopped correcting his chronology and his calculation of how he and rebecca must have been under surveillance throughout their visit to chesapeake towards the end of the account dingley began nodding in agreement benton said thats how weve got it figured and why youre the key they werent making notes so parnell assumed the conversation was being recorded although there was no obvious apparatus what about ms langs friends asked dingley i never met any not a one demanded benton disbelievingly no said parnell knowing how empty it sounded she didnt i dont know it never came up youre telling us that ms lang didnt have a single friend apart from you im telling you that she never introduced me to anyone it was a new relationship old enough for you to decide to move in together challenged dingley there hadnt been a chance to meet any of her friends i work a lot we were down to about one day a week mostly a sunday you have dangerous chemicals out at dubette asked benton im not attached to the chemical division but yes id expect there to be dangerous chemicals on the premises ricin sarin stuff like that pressed dingley theyre chemicalweapons agents with no therapeutic value i doubt anything like that would be there let me tell you how my minds working invited dingley a terrorist group discover theres an aeroplane shipping route between paris and washington they make a contact get tipped off in advance when theres a shipment of something toxic something that could have the same effect as a chemical weapon if it got loose they put a bomb on the plane timed to go off just before landing here in washington dc bang we got another nineeleven but this time we got a chemical fallout as well as maybe four hundred people blown out the sky hows that sound it sounds horrifying it also sounds like youre suggesting that rebecca was the source which is absolute and utter nonsense she never had any terrorist associations how do you know said benton you never met a single one of her friends according to what youve told us what ive told you is the truth im also telling you youre going about things the wrong way to try to link rebecca into any sort of terrorist association ms lang gets rammed into a gorge and is killed you come pretty damned close to getting charged with it what had you the two of you done to make someone want to fit you up like that asked benton nothing insisted parnell i know it sounds ridiculous but i cant think of anything sufficient for someone to want to kill rebecca and get me accused of doing it youre right mr parnell agreed dingley it does sound ridiculous they didnt believe him thought he was holding something back decided parnell less hurriedly than hed recounted his realization of how they must have been watched parnell told the two doubting agents about rebeccas sunday confession of her previous relationship and the pregnancy termination almost without pause continuing with her persistent curiosity at being bypassed with something involving dubettes french ancillaries with dwight newtons odd misunderstanding in mind as he talked the two men facing him remained expressionless benton said you think theres a significance there somewhere i dont know said parnell regretting the exasperation the moment he spoke you asked me to tell you anything that might help and thats what im trying to do i know how empty how unhelpful it all sounds we know youre under a lot of strain mr parnell said dingley and that youve lost someone very close were just trying to build a picture and i know im not doing a lot to help apologized parnell you got any lead to the man with whom ms lang had the previous relationship asked dingley parnell shook his head her uncle thinks his name was alan and that he lived in the dc area it was about two years ago he hesitated i wouldnt imagine her uncle knows anything about the termination we know how to be discreet said benton im sorry you asked the uncle about this man then yes when after the court discharged me why im trying to find out whats going on just as you are its our job to find out whats going on thats what were trained for said benton we dont want you playing amateur detective mr parnell apart from that being dangerous you might foul things up for us which would mean no one will ever find out whats going on dangerous isolated parnell someones already been killed said dingley letting his exasperation show now hasnt it occurred to you that having failed to put you in the frame for it whoever murdered ms lang might make a move on you no no it hadnt admitted parnell incredulously my lawyer no it doesnt matter everything matters said benton what about your lawyer he told me to be careful not to give the metro police any excuse to come at me again driving stuff like that but i never thought beyond that to there being some physical danger from anywhere else think about it now and take your lawyers advice said benton but most of all take ours added dingley let us do the investigating thats all i did tried to find out about the other man which well now do said dingley if someone did make a move against me it could help couldnt it if they made mistakes i mean the silence seemed to last a long time before dingley said and if they didnt make a mistake and managed to kill you it maybe wouldnt help us at all and certainly wouldnt help you you werent thinking like a bad movie script setting yourself up as an intentional target were you mr parnell said the other fbi man no denied the scientist honestly i was thinking that if something happened if i thought something happened something occurred i thought was odd i could tell you you do that pressed dingley you tell us dont go off on your own ive already given that undertaking insisted parnell so i need numbers where i can reach you it was dingley who offered the cards bentons as well as his own parnell saw there were cellphone listings as well as the field office land lines day or night said benton id like to keep in touch hear how things are going said parnell you got the numbers said dingley well probably need to get back to you when things come up we havent covered whats come up so far demanded parnell the two agents exchanged looks dingley said anything we tell you were telling you only you if it turns up in a newspaper or on television it could wreck the investigation you understand of course i understand were concentrating on forensics at the moment said dingley and you found what pressed parnell there was a further hesitation from the two men parnell said i told you i understood there are some marks dents on the rear fender of ms langs car that our people dont think were caused by it going over the edge of the gorge disclosed benton they think she was hit shunted in the back several times being chased hit and hit again not knowing who or what it was imagined parnell something like that agreed benton seat belts broke in parnell the police officers told me rebecca was outside the car when she was found that she hadnt been wearing a seat belt but seat belts were a thing with her she always wore one thats how her parents died not fastening theirs was rebeccas broken we havent been told it was said dingley our forensics guys arent helped by everything being moved and collected from the scene he paused before saying theres going to be another autopsy too by our pathologists the seat belts another mystery to add to all the rest said benton could it be significant asked parnell its something to flag accepted benton i interrupted you apologized the scientist theyre not happy about the damage to your car either continued benton they dont think the dents and the paint loss was caused by your car being hit by another vehicle the damage is too regular they think it was more likely caused by being hit and scratched by some sort of implement or tool if another car had been involved its almost inevitable that some of its paint would have been left on yours theres absolutely no trace something else remembered parnell i got the impression that the police already knew about the damage to my car before they questioned me but i hadnt reported it to dubette security during the day there must be what three four hundred cars in the lot maybe more how come they knew about my car among all the rest how indeed echoed dingley you discovered the damage on the thursday queried benton yes in the lot yes when i went to get into the car to go home what time was that took up dingley parnell shrugged i cant be precise late seven thirty eight oclock halflight getting that way the lots lighted of course what about paint on the ground anything at all parnell shook his head recalling the courtroom examination i dont remember seeing any looking even i just thought it was a carpark knock one of those things it was certainly that said benton you go through this with the deputies maybe not in quite so much detail said parnell you going to talk to them benton smiled at the question were going to talk to just about as many people as we can and maybe it was worthwhile letting you in on the preliminary forensic findings after all you are going to find out who did it arent you said parnell were going to try our damnedest promised dingley parnell felt selfconscious embarrassed concentrating upon everyone around him as he left the fbi field office and went into the multistorey car park to retrieve his car checking the mirrors before and after driving out trying to establish whether he was being followed which he couldnt remembering what one of the bureau agents had said parnell decided it was just like being in a b movie but tried to convince himself that it was the sort of precaution they were advising but couldnt do that either how long would it have to go on until the unknown they were caught he supposed what if they werent howard dingleys parting remark hadnt sounded particularly hopeful parnell didnt think he could maintain the vigilance forever wasnt sure he could maintain it even over days or weeks it was a frightening conclusion frightening enough for it to stop being embarrassing and become unsettling reality parnell tried to check his mirrors all the way to mclean and with the dubette building in sight came close to hitting a suddenly braking car in front because he was studying the reflection of vehicles behind he reached the pharmacogenomics division still an object of attention as he walked the windowed corridors disorientated knowing it would be difficult to keep his mind undividedly upon the priority work in which hed decided to involve himself initially however he didnt try he shook his head against kathy richardsons gesture that she had some messages and securely closed against interruption the office door he recalled telling the staff would always remain open he dialled barry jacksons office number parnell was connected immediately i just got back from an fbi interview i dont think i did very well why didnt you tell me you were going ask me to come along it didnt occur to me didnt think it was necessary why dont you think it went very well i couldnt tell them anything of course you couldnt it sounded like oh i dont know what it sounded like as if i could even have been hiding something i should have come with you youre probably right but wouldnt it have appeared that i did have something to hide needing my lawyer beside me representations your legal right weve already proved in a court that youre not involved in murder theyre concentrating on terrorism they said theyll probably need to speak to me again next time ill come along they said something else too that i might be in physical danger not from the metro dc police although they agreed with your warning from whoever killed rebecca they told me to be careful sounds like good advice you agree with them that its a possibility of course its a possibility i would have thought that was obvious it hasnt been until now its not a very comforting thought its not intended to be its intended to be advice you should take im trying dont stop and dont try going alone any more talk to me thats what eventually youre going to pay a lot of money for parnell was conscious of kathy richardson through the glassed separation intently watching for him to replace the telephone so he turned the movement into a welcoming gesture opening his closed door to admit her the woman said at once dwight newton wanted to see you the moment you got back she offered a strong sealed manila envelope and this came from dr spacey parnell weighed the choices as well as physically testing the envelope and decided upon the vice president first on his way further into the spiders web he thought he should have telephoned ahead but continued on anyway he was admitted immediately to a reception in distinct contrast to the previous day the whitecoated man remained hunched forward over his desk and said at once you didnt tell me you were going to the fbi when we spoke i didnt know i was i should have known been told dubette are being dissected in the media in connection with it all i should have known it was my oversight im sorry what was it all about they wanted to interview me obviously someone from dubette should have been with you i dont think so dwight do you yes i do the lawyer you chose for me would have railroaded me into god knows what sort of situation if id let him represent me if im accompanied for any further meetings itll be by the man who got me freed on the spot rebecca langs tape would have been found insisted the other man not by me or a court official newton coloured so how was it the interview i mean still very preliminary there wasnt a lot i could tell them what was said about dubette nothing specifically as i said everything was preliminary they got any leads parnell looked steadily at the other man for several moments preliminary he repeated for the third time no leads no nothing just mystery the greatest of all was when and how and by whom will an attempt be made to kill me he thought and wished he hadnt because he was back into a bmovie mindset your people working on the flu request abruptly switched newton the current samples were only due today i havent yet had time to check if theyve arrived im going to head it up with three others i want everyone involved insisted newton and i want to be kept in the closest touch about everything i hear the message said parnell it would be difficult not to so often had it been repeated back in his office the door secured again parnell sat for several moments gazing down at barbara spaceys sealed report wondering if the man he had just left had read it before their confrontation confused by newtons pendulum mood swings impatiently parnell tore open the envelope not expecting the brevity of the womans assessment in barbara spaceys opinion the events to which he had been subjected had profoundly affected him psychologically he was making every effort much of it subconsciously to suppress any obvious reaction but would be overly worried by the reaction of others towards him she was unsure of the true depths of his feelings towards rebecca lang and believed parnell felt although he might be unable to identify the reason a deep sense of guilt there was a marked absence of the overconfidence that she had commented upon in her first report she wanted another interview in the near future she might thought parnell he didnt sixteen there appeared to be no resentment at parnells announcement that he was joining the expanded flu research team and it was automatically accepted that he would be its leader from tokyo there were frozen specimens of the current bird flu virus as well as quite separate and unexpected samples of sars from the masked palm civet cat the wild animal species considered a culinary delicacy in china and suspected of being the source of a renewed but so far limited outbreak of the disease that became an epidemic in the far east in there were also cultures from two human victims of the new sars outbreak in chinas guangzhou city the inconclusive research notes on both from dubettes japanese subsidiary ran to forty pages and included warnings from the world health organization of a potential pandemic from both respiratory illnesses we didnt know we were getting the additional severe acute respiratory syndrome material queried parnell ted lapidus shook his head maybe tokyo is treating them as allied conditions to examine in conjunction parnell said and if the viral composition is different we could confuse ourselves it could be something russell benn and his merry men want to work on at the same time suggested beverley jackson ill find out said parnell and if it is then let them here for the moment well leave the who worrying about sars pandemics well concentrate on avian flu and come back to sars as a separate project a part of his mind was still preoccupied which he guessed it would be for a long time to come but parnell believed the majority of his concentration to be back upon the work at hand and it pleased him it made him feel in charge of himself which hed always been supremely sure of but hadnt felt for the last few days needing to be reliant on or at the mercy of others which he acknowledged had been barbara spaceys psychological assessment we could have a boost for our flu experiments said sean sato did a web surf yesterday while i was waiting for the tokyo stuff to arrive the scripps research institute in san diego working with the national institute for medical research in england have found how the influenza transferred from birds to humans the importance of the discovery from our point of view is that its genetic take us through it said parnell they worked with genes from the virus recovered from an inuit woman whose body was preserved in a frozen alaskan tundra grave and from kept samples from us soldiers who died in the pandemic recounted sato enjoying the audience and isolated the birdflu viral protein haemagglutinin its got spikes like darts its the darts that locked it on to human cells like spears and by which it gained entry to cause the infection which no one would have understood at the time because the human flu virus wasnt isolated until intruded lapidus we know that of the fifteen different strains of bird influenza that have been identified only three until now have ever mutated to infect humans in and said sato what they havent been able to discover is why having made the species jump from bird to human it becomes so pathogenic from human to human he hesitated again to make a point ive pieced together some other already published data weve got tokyos material to confirm the opinions but one analysis suggests the current avian flu is similar to the human virus that caused the pandemic theres another theory that it possibly has a haemagglutinintype protein like that of no one not even lapidus spoke for several moments digesting what the japaneseamerican had just suggested it was parnell who said you just outlined a doublebarrelled global pandemic that would make a death toll of twenty million in little more than a starting figure i know said sato quietly it frightens the shit out of me this informations public questioned beverley on the internet for everyone to read said sato gesturing towards the deadeyed computer at his station who knows how many people have put it together why hasnt there been some who warning demanded lapidus against what demanded parnell in return surprised at the question theres no vaccine or prevention thats what were supposed to be trying to find to issue dire predictions and make the connections that sean has just done would simply cause panic scripps and london synthesized haemagglutinin queried beverley thats my understanding agreed sato ive downloaded individual copies of everything ive found for all of us if its synthesized weve got something positive to begin with judged beverley im frightened as shitless as sean by his doomsday scenario said parnell lets start by making the most obvious comparison open to us the synthesized haemagglutinin against whats come in from tokyo looking for matching spikes matching anything and then against the hong kong flu to see if theres a possible fit which way are you thinking of going asked lapidus the only way answered parnell one step after the other you got any thoughts the greek scientist shook his head dont like the idea we cant culture in chicken eggs at the moment thats the least of our problems lets get reading and get started despite lapiduss assurance parnell crossed to kathy richardsons office forbidding her from going anywhere near the specialized laboratory in which the potentially virulent asian samples were being stored but asked her to prepare files in which they could record and crossreference their experiments the woman said she had already been told and appreciated the dangers reminding him with a hint of stiffness that she had long experience as a medical secretary parnell also asked her to obtain a map of the fluaffected countries in asia upon which the incidence of outbreaks could be charted he dictated a lengthy email to tokyo asking why they had included the sars material in their shipment and requested daily reports on the increase or otherwise of flu outbreaks in the region to update his intended map and advised in advance that he might ask for more physical samples parnell entered russell benns laboratory complex at the end of what had obviously been a similar conference to the one hed just held and was ushered at once into the mans side office with the permanently percolating coffee and the dubettelogo mugs the black professor described what hed just conducted as a jam session as yet without any formulated approach apart from chemically reanalysing what tokyo had already done he didnt know why the sars stuff had been included either and looked forward to tokyos reply to parnells query he listened intently to an account of the geneticists discussion and when parnell finished said jesus h christ its theory at this stage cautioned parnell with a basis argued benn you told dwight nothing to tell him until weve satisfied ourselves we know the cause its the way to the cure or prevention were looking for i havent said how sorry i am about rebecca declared the other man suddenly which i am truly sorry and for what it almost caused you personally with terrorism in the mix its one big crock of shit lets hope the fbi can sort it out parnell regretted benns reminder for a brief while it had actually gone out of his mind but now it was back they any idea what its all about none i guess theyll be spending time here i guess said parnell guardedly he didnt want to say or do anything to anyone that might stop the exchange of information between himself and the fbi investigators it must be distracting ill cope how well parnell wondered remembering the difficult drive from washington and barbara spaceys analysis look forward to our working properly together so do i said parnell he hesitated on the point of trying to draw the man on the french experimentation that dwight newton had dismissed as a failure but decided against it it was hopefully something he could learn or at least get a guide to from the fbi after itemizing it as he had that morning it was inevitable the two bureau agents would ask about it at giorgio falcones insistence parnell travelled in the lead funeral car apart from the restaurateur there were two occasionally weeping aunts and a niece what whispered conversation there was between them was in italian in english to parnell falcone said dubette offered to pay for everything i told them i didnt want their charity i thought you might said parnell hed been surprised by the dubette contingent in the following cars personnel director wayne denny was with dwight newton russell benn and burt showcross and two other men whom parnell didnt know but assumed to be from rebeccas division he hadnt expected barry jackson or the two fbi men either the undertakers told me theyve sent four wreaths one from the president himself rebecca was very popular they valued her work thats what the man said who came to see me about paying for the funeral the fbi came too yesterday asked me about the previous boyfriend like you did i wasnt able to help them beyond what i told you do they think he did it no said parnell they need to talk to everyone who knew rebecca and theyve searched rebeccas house they wanted a key they asked for photographs of her too what had they found at the house wondered parnell he felt exhausted straining to keep any coherence in his speculation hed worked until nine on the day of his return to dubette and wished he hadnt when hed finally left the complex because the car lot was almost deserted and now almost two days later he ached physically from what he imagined he had to do to remain alert to everything and everybody around him hed scarcely slept on the night of the return and the following day actually jumped only just stopping short of crying out at a lorrys backfire and after that stared so hard at whom he judged to be two different suspiciously behaving men on two separate occasions that theyd frowned back with equal suspicion one parnell guessed on the point of confronting him to ask what the hell he was doing although he knew it was an irrational expectation and was impatient with himself for it hed still wanted something positive from their experiments and had been tetchy with everyone when there wasnt hed hardly slept the previous night either and hed eaten nothing since he couldnt remember when but crackers and cheese and now there was none left of either in the apartment all the wine had gone too youll let me know if you hear anything pressed rebeccas uncle parnell brought himself back to the older man beside him if i hear anything the service was in a catholic church in bethesda and there was an already waiting cordon of television and stills cameras which jostled into action as the mourners formed up behind the flowerdraped coffin to file into the church behind it the priest was young and bearded which parnell considered odd until accepting it to be yet another irrational reaction parnell allowed his mind to wander during the service believing it a brief and welcome opportunity to release the selfimposed exhausting tension he caught snatches though disjointed references to violence and tragedy and young life savagely cut short intermingled with insistences upon gods infinite wisdom and mysterious ways he stood and sat in time with everyone around him who stood and sat and matched with them the opening and closing of his blurred hymn book from which he didnt try to sing there was more filming when the procession moved towards the grave which parnell bringing his mind to bear once more realized was that in which rebeccas mother and father were interred the aunts and the niece wept on during the dust to dust ashes to ashes ritual so did giorgio falcone there were probably others whom parnell didnt see they all threw individual flowers into the gaping hole falcone plucked a lily from a waiting wreath and offered it and parnell dropped it into the grave without looking down into where rebeccas body lay as he turned back towards the grieving family with whom he had been standing parnell saw that his commemorative flower had come from one of the dubette wreaths his spray of white lilies and his handwritten card goodbye my love to be had been relegated to the second row of the banked floral tributes behind dubettes elaborate creations determinedly parnell reached forward bringing his into the front unconcerned at the flurry it caused among the hovering media there was an uncertain hiatus around the graveside which parnell finally stirred himself to resolve leading the immediate family back towards the waiting cars as they walked falcone said i wonder how many will come back come back echoed parnell ive closed the restaurant for the reception you didnt hear the priest invite everybody no said parnell it was already difficult for him to remember what he had or had not heard the moment he relaxed he had the impression of his awareness ebbing and flowing he did its expected of course parnell discovered almost with a jolt that he was back in the funeral car and assumed they were heading into washington he clenched his hands as tightly as he could to achieve a physical sensation something on to which he could lock his mind to stop him drifting from what was happening around him and he contorted his face squeezing his eyes shut for the same reason it helped just but parnell wasnt sure how long it would last a touch on his arm brought him around to one of the no longer crying aunts who said in a heavily accented voice that she thought it had been a wonderful service and dutifully parnell said he thought so too she added that she was sorry for his loss and that he and rebecca would have made a wonderful life together and parnell nodded but didnt reply the wisconsin avenue restaurant had a closed notice at the window and the blinds were drawn a blacksuited ciro whom parnell hadnt seen at the funeral unlocked the door shepherding the staff in ahead of everyone and turning on the interior lights it was not until he saw falcone assembling the rest of the family mourners that parnell appreciated that there was going to be a receiving line he held back until the italian beckoned him forward at the arrival of the others as parnell joined the line the man said you count as family the handshaking unheard commiseration ritual seemed to last forever and parnell was embarrassed by it glad when it ended he moved away at once taking from ciro the offered glass of red wine so full he needed to sip before carrying it more safely further into the room tightening his selfcontrol to face and understand the impending ordeal at once he was conscious of barry jacksons supporting presence at his elbow the lawyer said you look rough so you keep telling me so you keep looking specific problem or just everything constantly watching my back i suppose and not sleeping you could get something to sleep parnell snorted a laugh i work for a drugs company and i dont take drugs hows that for irony stupid said jackson if youre not sleeping properly you cant work properly or be as selfaware and careful as youve got to be take a pill across the room howard dingley and david benton were moving among the dubette contingent nodding in headbent concentration both were wearing subdued blue today following parnells look jackson said they come back to you yet not yet as if on cue dingley detached himself and crossed to them as he arrived he said making plans to come out to dubette jackson said youre going to need to talk to my client again of course id think so agreed the frowning fbi man id like to be there whys that mr jackson to represent him dingley smiled fleetingly ill have to remember to appoint you as my lawyer if ever i get into trouble my clients not in any trouble but call me any time no trouble apart from being a potential murder victim thought parnell he said anything come up since we talked nothing that helps join the dots together dismissed the agent what about rebeccas house youve been through the house her uncle told me youre not next of kin mr parnell im the person who was going to marry her and got wrongly arraigned for her murder and whom your partner a couple of days ago agreed it was worthwhile to talk things through with dingley sighed we picked up an address book and found a listing in arlington for an alan smeldon he left there about a year ago the couple who took over his apartment think he went to california he didnt leave a forwarding address nothing else persisted parnell like i said nothing that takes us forward refused dingley everything kept very neat and tidy thats what ms lang was very neat and tidy you thought of anything that might help us mr parnell a friend of ms langs maybe parnell shook his head unsure when hed last had a comprehensible thought but then abruptly the clouds cleared in his head to a moment of crystal clarity the key he exclaimed you asked giorgio falcone for the key to get into rebeccas house but she had one in her purse would have had to have had one when she left me to get back into her house there wasnt one among the property metro dc police surrendered to us said dingley did you and your partner do the search asked jackson entering the conversation at last yes said dingley you find any evidence of someone having been there before you persisted the lawyer we didnt said dingley but weve got forensics there now theyre better at finding out the little things than we are seventeen r ichard parnell thought one of his better successes maybe even his only success so far at dubette was perhaps his refusal to be distracted by the fameorfear procession up and down the openplan glassed corridor to dwight newtons lair he would have ignored the bustle that day too if beverley jacksons remark hadnt included an fbi reference parnell looked up in time to see company lawyer peter baldwin hurrying towards the vice presidents innermost office leading two briefcasecarrying darksuited men he said how do you figure its a bureau thing theyre lawyers and i know lawyers remember theyre cloned in a lawyer factory somewhere hidden in ohio beverley had the bench space next to him for the avianflu investigation barry doesnt look like that he was a prototype that didnt work they abandoned the model he sure as hell worked for me said parnell uncaring at the american phraseology he felt better not totally better convinced as he once had been that he could climb mountains and swim oceans but the cottonwool feeling had gone from his head and every moving part of his body didnt ache at the slightest motion the previous night had again been more of an exhausted collapse than sleep but it had been rest of sorts and that morning alert as he now had to be there hadnt any longer been the confused disorientation of making monsters out of shadows pity he didnt work so well for me it was more a throwaway line than an inviting complaint an invitation parnell wouldnt anyway have accepted but he thought it confirmed that beverley jackson was someone who always demanded the last word in any onetoone conversation he decided to allow it to her because he wasnt interested in trying to outtalk the woman what he was far more interested in was configuring something from the earlier influenza pandemics with the current outbreak which yet again he accepted to be an illogical expectation but for which hed hoped after sean satos initial seemingly encouraging discoveries tokyos response to parnells sars query was as lapidus had predicted that their research was predicated on a connecting transmission link between that and avian flu and that they had anticipated the exploration would be duplicated in america parnell copied the email to russell benn together with his reply that the pharmacogenomics unit were treating the two respiratory conditions separately as an afterthought he made a separate copy to the vice president towards whose office hed just seen the legal procession head by then he beverley jackson ted lapidus and sato had exhausted every microscope comparison with the limited tokyo samples without finding anything approaching a visual match to the spiked haemagglutinin gene or the structure of the hong kong virus it was because there was a momentary hiatus in their work that beverley had been looking out into the corridor and it was the woman who said again and then there were more parnell looked up in time to see howard dingley and david benton passing parnell almost expected them to be walking in step but they werent as he went by dingley looked into the unit and gestured parnell said theyre fbi so i was right insisted beverley definitely a lastword syndrome thought parnell he said it was set up at the funeral whats our next step forward impatiently broke in sean sato there was something proprietorial in the way the japaneseamerican spoke as if his earlier findings qualified him above the other two under parnells supervision parnell said the obvious one animals well try to synthesize in mice to begin with see if we can bring about a mutation and then monitor it to find the bridge the virus crosses all of us queried lapidus we dont need to be involved all of us this early acknowledged parnell you three kick it off i want to go back on that research sean found see if we can take it further and open up a separate path were going to need more samples from tokyo too well jointly discuss each days progress youre secondchecking seized lapidus parnell was surprised at the interjection of course nothings going to leave this department unless its been second and third and fourth time checked and thats before it goes into the statutory threephase licensing process we going to manage that in our lifetime asked lapidus its somebody elses lifetime were concerned with reminded parnell i didnt mean started lapidus disconcerted im talking about what emerges from this unit not anything else parnell halted him sparing the man we all clear on what were doing the two other men nodded beverley said perfectly kathy richardson looked up at parnells emergence from the restricted laboratory shaking her head at his enquiring look as he approached to let him know there were no messages inside her office the woman was enclosed behind the battlement of file boxes some already filled many more waiting to be filled with the raw data she was in the process of sorting he said itll get better you promise i promise and ill send my own emails you neednt democracy rules in the dubette pharmacogenomics unit ill get the tshirts and the fender stickers printed parnell laughed openly at the gradually emerging independent irony convinced hed made the right choice in kathy richardson as he had with everyone else his email to tokyo was brief a simple request for more samples parnell experienced a nostalgic deja vu of his openminded freeexchange period in pure research when he began communicating with the scripps research institute in san diego and the national institute for medical research in london literally within an hour there were enthusiastic acknowledgements from the directors of both each promising the raw experimental data of their respective findings that had not appeared either on the internet or in the scientific journals from each it was flatteringly obvious the quickness of their responses came from their recognition of his name and reputation on the genome project parnell wondered and quickly wished he hadnt whether the notoriety of the past week might also have contributed so immersed was he that parnell had forgotten the presence of the fbi investigators further along the corridor until kathy richardsons warning arrival dingley and benton hovering close behind she said theyre asking for a minute or two parnell waved them in thats all just a minute or two promised dingley benton said hows it going better than it was said parnell but only just hows that said dingley trying to adjust getting used to things said parnell both men nodded as if they understood you wanted a minute or two prompted parnell trying to fit in to everyones convenience is all said dingley any progress asked parnell offering seats a lot of people still to see nothing clear yet whens there going to be anything thats clear pressed parnell benton made an openhanded gesture of uncertainty a lot of people still to see he echoed his partner howd it go with the vice president asked parnell directly there was another handsspread movement from benton he had counsel with him thats why we stopped by were certainly going to need to speak to you again in the next little while your lawyer told us he wants to come along parnell reminded himself as he had at the moment of his premature arrest that america was the land of litigation and that he didnt know anything whatsoever about the law ill warn him to be ready thatll be helpful thanked dingley what about the forensic examination of rebeccas house demanded parnell was there any evidence of it having been searched before you still being gone over avoided dingley still queried parnell disbelievingly theyre very thorough guys said benton thats what their job is being very thorough what about the flight listing persisted parnell you should wait until youre with your counsel said dingley what the hell for demanded parnell loudvoiced it means you should wait until youre with your counsel said benton in another of his irritating echo responses and tell him theres going to be a fingerprint request what asked parnell elimination said dingley its routine will you have something when we meet said parnell maybe who knows avoided dingley again from the other side of the glass partition kathy richardson was gesturing with one hand the other holding the internal telephone benton said were in the way dingley said whats a good time for you that depends on barry ill call him with the choices and get back to you it made sense he knew to have the lawyer with him but he wasnt totally convinced of the need he said why dont we get on with it now dingley shook his head your lawyer was very clear mr parnell there was a closetoimperceptible head movement back in the direction of newtons suite we get the rule book dictated to us like we just have weve got to go with the rule book we make one mistake its all over what mistake whats all over said parnell taking the wrong step in the investigation said dingley you still think i might be someway involved demanded parnell indignantly we collect evidence mr parnell said benton we leave other people to decide what to do with it youll get back to us right right said parnell as soon as ive talked to my lawyer were obliged said benton parnell delayed responding to dwight newtons summons while he tried to reach barry jackson leaving kathy richardson to make the contact after thirty minutes from his side office parnell hadnt seen the lawyers departure but the research division vice president was alone when parnell reached the mans suite the greeting pendulum had swung again newton was hunchshouldered behind his desk glowering up from a lowered head you talked about confidential work under progress here newton accused at once what exclaimed parnell surprised you heard what i said i heard what you said i didnt understand what you said ive just been officially interviewed protested the other man asked about work we were doing here on something that emanated from france yes said parnell he was content for newton to lead which you told them about the research vice president continued to accuse him thats information governed by the confidentiality contract you signed i dont recall any clause in that contract covering a murder investigation theyre talking terrorism for christs sake you knew about the air france flight listings it came up in court those guys are treating it as sinister trying to make a connection to dubette because of what you told them i didnt disclose any secrets dwight i dont have any secrets so i cant have breached any confidentiality contract they wanted to know about anything and i mean that anything that rebecca might have regarded as out of the ordinary in the last few weeks she was curious why she and her department had been bypassed about france thats what i told them that it was out of the ordinary and she hadnt understood why simple as that simple as that and only that because there was nothing more to tell them was there the other man gave the impression of relaxing although only slightly what did rebecca say about france only that she couldnt understand why things werent normal and that burt showcross told her to leave it which is what i told her particularly after you told me the french idea hadnt worked out newton examined parnell steadily for several moments they spoke to showcross and russell benn parnell wasnt sure what he was supposed to say with the lawyers present newton nodded do you think they will want to see you again they do confirmed parnell barry jackson will be with me hes representing you personally id like our people there as well why dubette have got to be protected from all this terror rubbish youve seen the papers and the television all this terror rubbish queried parnell misleading accusations specified newton dwight im not up with you on this i know the case theyre trying to build that dubette with its access to drugs and chemicals has some connection with terrorism thats why the fbi are involved in the first place i really dont believe this theres a perfectly understandable and acceptable explanation for why rebecca had that flight number in her bag her job was to deal with samples coming in by air from overseas and dingley and benton have accepted it as far as i am aware thats not my impression impression questioned parnell pointedly a second ago you told me they were building a definite case were talking about company lawyers being with you for the next fbi interview said newton you were talking about company lawyers contradicted parnell i wasnt im going to see the bureau guys again with just my lawyer and if i get the slightest indication of dubette being compromised ill stop the interview and tell you immediately im not sure thats the attitude we welcome said newton its not an attitude contradicted parnell again its commonsense refusal to be panicked when theres no reason nor cause to be panicked ive got to see the board up in new york im sure you have said parnell unsure why he was being told which will have to include your refusal to cooperate dwight dont you think the fbi might imagine that i and dubette have something to hide if i arrive next time surrounded by attorneys im not refusing to cooperate im refusing to let there be any wrongful suspicion wrongful suspicion about me and wrongful suspicion about dubette make sure you tell the board that in those words ill definitely make sure of that said newton in an attempted threat that failed theres nothing to hide insisted parnell once more i havent he thought he increasingly wasnt sure about dwight newton or russell benn when parnell got back to his department kathy richardson said jackson had suggested ten the following morning when he told dingley the fbi agent said you told him about fingerprints he wants to know why eighteen richard parnell was at jacksons office by eight thirty and had to wait fifteen minutes for the lawyers arrival wanting advice not so much for the meeting that was to come but for the uncertainties that appeared to be arising from those that had already taken place when parnell finished jackson said what do you think youre telling me lets not go this route protested parnell from the moment we first met in the middle of the night in a detention cell i dont know how many days or weeks ago ive not known what the fuck im telling you or anyone else its feelings nuances uncertainties square things that dont go into round holes its all wrong rebeccas dead murdered and somethings wrong and im not talking about her being killed or my getting accused of it jackson tried silently to pick his way through the jumbled declaration you think there is something to link dubette with terrorism absolutely not but theres something something big enough important enough to have got rebecca killed maybe but this is another route weve travelled before you got the slightest whisper the slightest feeling nuance square uncertainty that wont fit into a round hole of proof you mocking me no denied the lawyer at once im trying to balance what youre saying suggesting against what precious little else makes sense and and nothing said the scarfaced man maybe thats the cleverness of the whole thing i dont understand said parnell exasperated by the too familiar protest its too clever to understand ill accept that philosophy in experimental science but not having stood at the graveside of someone whos been murdered murder cant be too clever to understand or solve sometimes it is said jackson flatly this isnt going to be one of those times the lawyer shook his head didnt you tell me the fbi guys warned you against the way youre thinking whoever set this whole thing up did what they did killed rebecca like they did has got to be punished found exposed and punished which is why were going where we are now to try to achieve that reminded jackson mines the legally protective presence youre the guy theyre going to be talking to you dont wander on about amorphous conspiracy theories without a single jot of evidence to substantiate them you listen to the questions and you answer them as honestly but most importantly as succinctly as you can i dont want you talking yourself into a different dead end from the one ive already got you out of im not going to talk myself into anything insisted parnell thats what im coming along to stop you doing why its essential that i do come along and even more essential that you dont ever think you can do things by yourself ive already had that lecture have it again listen really listen to it again youre right about nuances and uncertainties dont entangle yourself in them remember what i said about not representing losers im not a loser insisted parnell nor will i be ever hed probably come close he acknowledged but suddenly now he felt he could climb the mountains and swim the oceans again it was a feeling he welcomed back it was a different larger room at the fbi field office with easy chairs and plants with polished leaves instead of desk and stiffbackedseat formality parnell thought he recognized the third waiting fbi man but it wasnt until jackson made the reintroduction that he remembered edwin pullinger as the bureau counsel from the court hearing and later brief anteroom hearing parnell said at once how can i help you further i didnt get the impression i contributed much last time no you didnt agreed benton you had any more thoughts about that airline flight number asked dingley it was a clever almost hypnotic double act parnell finally recognized each man so finely attuned that one could pick up upon the other to weave the loose ends that jackson had warned about into a snare i thought wed covered that so did we agreed dingley but you know what we cant find any dubettedestined waybill on that flight out of pariss charles de gaulle for the last three months which leaves us with a problem took up benton what was ms lang doing with a number of a paris to washington dc flight that wasnt carrying anything for dubette but was it turns out a flight that got cancelled four times in a row on the advice of antiterrorist electronic intercepts i dont know conceded parnell drythroated seeing the mountains grow higher the oceans wider what i do know and what ive already told you is that rebecca lang was totally apolitical had no connection interest or association whatsoever with terrorism and that the only possible explanation is that it was planted in her bag like paint from my car was used to make it look as if i was the one who forced her over the canyon edge the fbi lawyer wasnt taking part in the interrogation parnell realized thats not quite my recollection said dingley my recollection is that the last time we talked you said it would have been a flight carrying a dubette shipment from its paris subsidiary the last time we talked i said i thought it would have been carrying something for dubette rejected parnell youve just told me it wasnt so the next possible explanation is that it was planted what about your political views mr parnell asked benton abruptly parnell laughed genuinely amused i dont have the right to vote in this country which im sure you know in england i voted for the liberal democrats the smallest of the three english political parties i have never been a member of any radical political movement or organization am not a muslim nor do i subscribe to any fanatical islamic movement or jihads or suicide bombings he looked at jackson anything ive left out i dont think so frowned the lawyer uncomfortably benton said that wasnt a question to be treated lightly i wasnt treating it lightly i was treating it with the contempt it deserved parnell felt his lawyers warning pressure against his arm and recognized his returning confidence was tipping over into arrogance did you have a key to the bethesda house asked dingley in one of his sudden directional changes no said parnell did ms lang have a key to your apartment asked benton no you moved back and forth between the two queried dingley rhetorically you were going to set up home together yet you didnt have keys to each others homes it never came up as a problem wed have got around to it when we started to live together arriving and leaving at different times he was making another bad impression parnell accepted he had to correct it correct it and try to discover what if anything they had learned find out why they were so obviously treating him with the suspicion that they were before either agent could speak he said what about bethesda sir questioned benton in return had it been entered before you got there with giorgio falcones key there was the familiar exchange of looks between the two men we think so said dingley was it or wasnt it insisted parnell impatiently looks that way admitted benton how does it look that way persisted parnell like i think i told you before everything was very neat too neat said dingley which brings us to our request picked up benton we need fingerprints for elimination yours will be about the place wont they my clients not required to provide them unless he agrees intruded jackson at last of course i agree said parnell before the fbi group had a chance to reply why shouldnt i addressing the two agents he said you think something was taken from rebeccas house benton gave another of his openpalmed gestures weve got no way of telling we dont know what was there in the first place youve got more to be suspicious about than the fact that the house was too tidy challenged jackson thats not even forensic thats soapopera bullshit dingley smiled bleakly not quite sir there wasnt an item of furniture an article anywhere that hadnt been lifted looked at and replaced but not exactly put back in the right place where it had been before it was shifted just offcentre marks in the carpeting that carpeting not properly resecured where it had been lifted to look beneath offcentre again where kitchen appliances had been replaced like i said too neat always too neat was ms lang particularly neat asked benton not particularly remembered parnell she didnt live in a mess but the house was lived in magazines newspapers wouldnt have been carefully stacked and aligned books always in the shelves for the titles to be read none with dustcover flaps used as bookmarks said dingley parnell shook his head i dont think so and persisted jackson this time dingley looked back at the fbi lawyer who nodded and said ok dingley said there wasnt any personal mail forensics are thorough suggested we check the mail drop for the monday ms lang was found murdered mailman remembers three one package bigger than the other two which were ordinary letter size there wasnt any mail when we got there or any that our forensics guys could find and repeated jackson benton said to parnell you ever write to ms lang a note a proper letter maybe parnell didnt respond at once thinking no he said almost surprised i never did never had to because we worked in the same place not even a note but why there wasnt a single personal letter in the house said dingley utility bills credit card receipts all carefully filed but not a single personal note from anyone listed in the address book we found he looked back again to edwin pullinger for another permissive nod and the telephone answering equipment in ms langs machine was brand new hadnt been utilized before on any call whats the significance of that demanded parnell answeringmachine loops are used and rewound to be wiped and rewound and wiped again and again and again said dingley our forensics guys can recover things from loops that are supposed to have been wiped like they can with computer hard disks ms langs loop had been taken a new one put in its place it was her call on my machine that saved me remembered parnell softly which brings us to another request chimed in benton parnell stared at the man refusing the ventriloquistsdummy role finally benton said would you come to bethesda to the house with us look for anything you think might be wrong anything that makes you curious anything out of place jackson said thats a hell of an unusual request this is a hell of an unusual case said pullinger coming into the discussion for the first time you can refuse of course no said parnell hurriedly of course ill come try to do whatever you want me to do but i didnt dont know the house well know where rebecca kept things what might be missing or what might not sure i stayed there but it wasnt my place not with my things in it ive told you it was all too new we hadnt we hadnt got that far wed appreciate it said dingley unannounced insisted jackson my client will not go to ms langs house as a media exhibit the investigation is out of the hands of the dc metro police reminded pullinger pointedly ive got to have your guarantee ed insisted jackson we pitch up to a media reception and blinding lights we aint stopping the car im not having my client publicly exposed or compromised in any way weve no intention of publicly exposing or compromising your client in any way retorted the other lawyer stiffly thats good to hear said jackson unrepentant when we pull up i still want to see the surroundings to rebecca langs house emptier than a kansas prairie in december it was going too fast and in the wrong direction parnell decided with things still unresolved in his mind irrespective of everyone elses uncertainties i still dont understand the air france flight number as i told you thats our biggest problem too said benton howd you check that flight didnt carry anything for dubette in the last six months air france dispatch here and in paris said dingley were as thorough as our forensics people in our own way im sure you are said parnell unconcerned at getting under the other mans skin you doublecheck with dubette with their security division i guess thats who are responsible for the dulles airport collection security agreed benton that isnt the answer to my question said parnell dubette security have no record of any dubetteaddressed consignment on af in the last six months recited dingley there is another inconsistency here mr parnell said benton one we were coming to you told us that ms lang didnt understand why she was being bypassed by something from paris but that whatever it was it hadnt worked out in the laboratories at mclean anyway yes said parnell glad he had not needed to be more direct thats not the impression weve got from the people weve spoken to at dubette so far said benton how not specifically seems the french research wasnt a failure after all according to mr newton its being incorporated into some of your existing products i didnt know that but now he did parnell accepted you must have been mistaken suggested dingley obviously said parnell who knew he hadnt been i hope that didnt mislead you it made us curious along with everything else i can understand that im sorry its been a difficult time he let the apology trail we understand that said benton in what sounded to parnell like mockery it created something else for him to understand too decided parnell what about dubette security and the metro dc officers you talked to them yet about knowing my car was damaged before we went out into the lot only to the security chief harry johnson so far said dingley he told us he didnt know anything about your car until you all got to it that morning that he hadnt had any conversation with the metro dc guys about it wasnt even sure what your car was looks like another mistaken impression said benton parnell curbed the instinctive reply instead he said i guess it does why dont we clear a few things up unexpectedly suggested barry jackson were happy to provide fingerprints and come out to bethesda why dont we do both right away i told you no media leak would come from here said dingley is there any reason why we cant do it right now persisted jackson no said dingley so said the lawyer lets do it now agreed benton theyd driven to the fbi field office in barry jacksons car so they went in convoy to rebecca langs bethesda clapboard the most direct route to which was through rock creek park past the gorge into which rebeccas car had plunged when he realized the way the fbi agents were going jackson said you all right with this i could use different roads ill be all right said parnell despite washing his hands after being fingerprinted his fingers still retained some of the blackness of the ink you could do better said the lawyer what an investigative technique a courtroom technique to catch people out is to make them lose their temper speak without thinking which ive warned you about you lost your temper back there why are they trying to catch me out trick me exploded parnell youre doing it again barry help me how many times had he made that plea thats what im trying to do you heard what they said a lot of things arent making up any sort of picture until it does theyve got to poke sticks into every bees nest youre not doing yourself any favours snapping back so stop it dont take every question as a personal attack or accusation thats what it sounds like said parnell petulantly thats what its supposed to sound like i just told you that for christs sake the lawyers voice softened were getting close now you sure youre all right parnell did not immediately respond recognizing the twisting narrow roads realizing shocked that he hadnt properly until now fixed in his mind the precise location of the crash he knew now before they got to the fatal turn what lay beyond suddenly there it was the crumpled supposedly protective barrier over which shed been forced the impact marks running almost its entire length the final collapsed edge where the vehicle had mounted and then gone over the end oil marks as black as death and then they were past oh fuck said parnell in a breathless rush not aware until that moment that he had actually been holding his breath not knowing what he was going to confront ok i think we should have gone the other way can you imagine no stopped jackson i dont want you trying to imagine it either leave it leave it if you can youve got things to do things to concentrate upon you think they did it purposely brought us this way maybe dont let it get to you how the fuck can i avoid that by not letting it get to you dont you start doubletalking like everyone else thats not doubletalking thats straighttalking you ready were almost at the house i hope im ready so do i the bethesda cottage was secured by yellow police tape and there was an obvious police black and white parked outside the driver and observer competing for boredomoftheyear awards as they assembled from the two cars parnell said i thought metro dc were off limits they are said dingley theyre just here by court order to stop anyone who isnt authorized going near the place thats going to piss them off it cant piss them off any more than they already are so how do you know theyre doing their job demanded jackson we got temporary but inconspicuous cctv in every room and external in every direction and a tap on the telephone you didnt tell us that complained jackson ive got all the court orders said pullinger we should have been told insisted the other lawyer the house isnt your jurisdiction said pullinger ed its our cooperation youre asking for youre not doing a lot to encourage it warned jackson the three fbi men began to move off towards the house but jackson didnt move keeping parnell with him softly he said you want to go through with it dont you think i should i dont think we should look as if were accepting it your call said parnell the others had stopped about ten yards away pullinger shouted is there a problem we cant hear you jackson yelled back there was a hesitation before the three men walked back pullinger said i asked if there was a problem yes said jackson we going to operate on level ground or we going to fuck about you want me to say sorry asked pullinger i want you to do it right like were doing it right youve made your point ive taken it said pullinger shall we go on inside jackson held them for another moment or two before moving towards the house bringing the rest with him it was dingley who opened the door standing back for parnell to go in first the last time when he thought unable to remember had been with rebecca hurrying in ahead of him carrying the lightest of the grocery shopping him the packhorse behind she talking as she always talked butterflying from point to point never properly fully finishing what she was saying before fluttering to something else queen of her own castle selfproclaimed queen of his dropping the bags gesturing where she wanted him to drop his turning on lights music opening windows hurrying him back to the car for what they hadnt been able to bring in the first time no he thought suddenly moving through the living room into the kitchen rebecca hadnt been neat and tidy organized certainly writtenout shopping lists for stores and markets listed in convenient order but not like this not as if the house had been made ready prepared for a prospective buyer in quick recollection he looked into the double sink then the empty dishwasher and finally to the coffee pot opening it to confirm the filter chamber was clean what asked benton on the sunday morning when rebecca came to pick me up remembered parnell i asked her if she wanted coffee because i was just making some she said shed already had some and juice theres no cups or glasses and the coffee pots empty and clean dingley accepted parnell led the way into the den dominated by the television and music system and saw the regimented books and the orderly magazine arrangement and then up to the bedrooms the bedroom he and rebecca had occupied and loved in and partially discovered each other in first and made himself look around it and open and close drawers although he didnt know now what for and then he looked around the other two bedrooms knowing even less what he was supposed to find out of place or rather wrongly in place before he retreated downstairs well demanded dingley its an impression said parnell thats all it can be thats all were asking for no said parnell its not right doesnt feel right thats all i can say this doesnt look feel like the house that rebecca left that sunday morning to pick me up he stopped at another recollection thats why the coffee pots wrong no cup in the washer she was late said we had a drive to get where we were going she wouldnt tell me where we were going in time it was in time to get a table for lunch although she wouldnt tell me that either if she was late in a hurry she wouldnt have cleared away would she not unless she was particularly fastidious said benton rebecca wasnt particularly fastidious said parnell then no she wouldnt agreed dingley wheres this all got us demanded jackson we dont know not yet said pullinger were looking forward to something we can understand that does get us somewhere once more it was pointlessly too late for parnell to drive out to mclean he telephoned from the apartment that he would be in the following morning before going out again to shop uninterestedly for essentials bread and milk and packaged meals he could heat in seconds in the microwave he also just as uninterestedly bought three litresized bottles of screwtopped red wine which he thought was as much as he could carry on his way back to the apartment he saw one man whom he thought might be watching him but there wasnt any longer a stomach lurch before he reached him the downtown bus arrived and the man got on it back in the apartment parnell unpacked and opened one of the bottles of wine slumping with the glass between his cupped hands reviewing the day he hadnt done well he had in fact been stupid losing his temper too late now for selfrecrimination hed got it wrong again and deserved jacksons rebuke and next time hed try to remember and behave better he had little doubt there would be a next time maybe even a time after that bethesda had disorientated him although not in the way jackson suggested the fbi agents had expected him to be disorientated he hadnt suddenly collapsed said anything or done anything on being somewhere where hed been with rebecca to indicate any guilt or awareness of something he hadnt told the investigators the disorientation had actually been far deeper than any of them had imagined on the nearwordless return to washington parnell had confronted a truth he hadnt wanted to admit to himself let alone to anyone else he didnt think hed loved rebecca he had feelings of course maybe in time he would even have come to love her although that was the most scourging of uncertainties but not that sunday when hed unthinkingly talked of their living together and not now not ever so he had a lie to live pitied by the few who knew him here as someone whod lost a woman whom hed planned to marry how difficult he wondered would that be to live with something else he didnt know like so much else he jumped startled at the telephone recognizing his mothers voice as soon as hed answered whats going on she demanded at once you know i told you its all right its not all right ive been questioned so have people at cambridge what some of parnells wine spilled with the urgency with which he came up out of his chair two americans fbi from the london embassy they wanted to know if you were political if you belonged to any organizations thats what they asked the people at cambridge ive had two calls one from alex bell your old tutor everyone here is worried about you theres nothing to worry about its an unusual investigation i want to come out no refused parnell its not necessary and i dont want you to if he were a target so would she be he supposed whos looking after you im looking after myself very well why not come back quit and come back that isnt a question i thought id hear you ask at this stage of the enquiry i doubt id be allowed to leave the country anyway and i dont want or intend to leave the country there was an attempt to frame you once how do you know it wont happen again succeed this time because it wont ive got a good lawyer and im not going to be framed i didnt like being questioned as i was as if you were still a suspect or in some way involved in terrorism is that what they talked about terrorism of course it was asked about foreign countries youd visited how long youd stayed there thats what they asked everyone else here the same questions im sorry call me back with the names of everyone who was bothered ill call them and apologize and im sorry to you too i didnt imagine it would come to that theyre hysterical about terrorism everybody is not everybody she contradicted you want anything money no thank you youll tell me if you do yes lied parnell call me i want you to call me every day not every day mother often i want your lawyers name and contact numbers just in case just in case of what just in case nineteen it was a welcome change for dwight newton to enter the dubette corporate building on wall street at the same time as everyone else and take a public elevator to the executive floor hed been able to catch a later shuttle too but hed still allowed himself time for waffles and maple syrup unsure if the emergency meeting of the parent board and its subsidiaries would run over lunch time he entered edward c grants office through the secretarial cordon to smiles and insistences it was good to see him again the moment newton was inside without any greeting from behind his enormous desk grant demanded bring me up to date i need to know everything the other man was frightened newton guessed enjoying the thought prepared having even made himself prompt notes to read on the plane from washington the research vice president recounted his encounter with the fbi agents for once without any interruption from grant the lawyers have to intervene to prevent any awkward questions no said newton hed have to disclose the problem but not this early thats good right they should have been there but we dont want to give the impression of having anything to hide i thought wed decided you and i that we didnt have anything to hide newton actually felt superior to grant and he enjoyed that too what about that godamned flight number grant ignored him they didnt ask thats good as well nodded grant how did it go with the others the upset wasnt far away accepted newton we got a bit out of synch there what do you mean out of synch the concern was immediate the way they set out their interview request was to see me first then russell benn and after him harry johnson thats how i arranged it to have the lawyers with me waiting before going on to russells interview and after that to harrys but they saw harry first alone yes shit i think its all right itd sure as hell better be i want it all of it in every little detail harrys a former metro dc officer i know that do they they didnt ask he didnt tell them what did they ask if af ever carried anything addressed to dubette which it didnt did it grant stared across his desk momentarily unspeaking then baldwin think thats ok i havent talked it through with him because i dont want to be complicit newton thought no perhaps not what do you think im a scientist not a lawyer refused newton grant stirred irritably whats johnson say from his police experience that he answered all their questions completely honestly that thats how it could be argued in court if it ever got to a court that he was asked a specific question to which he provided a specific answer said newton grant remained unmoving his face fixed with witchdoctor clairvoyance he said what else he didnt tell them anything about the phonetapping why not they didnt ask so he didnt offer his interpretation of the law you answer the questions youre asked not those that youre not asked he shouldnt have been left by himself it wasnt intended he should be left by himself i told you how it happened hes not to be alone if the fbi come back to him i know that he wont be if theres another approach hes to tell me before it happens and well get the attorneys back with baldwin did johnson set the tap up by himself he says so says he learned to do it when he was with the police and that he didnt need help from any electronics guys the switchboard must have known something its automated just a few supervisory staff and johnson says it was easy to use his security authority to get by them and work unobserved it still in place i wanted your views today take it off get rid of it today as soon as you get back i will we got some frayed edges decided the president too many frayed edges you seen the journal he should have bought the wall street journal at the airport newton immediately realized a bad mistake i didnt have time theyve picked up on todays meeting weve dropped three points already your problem not mine thought newton we had to be affected in the circumstances weve got to lose this terrorism tag i dont want this to become a mess i dont see why it should dubette hasnt done anything wrong doesnt have any skeletons in any closets does it you know what i mean said grant carelessly no im not sure that i do newton thought hed made that refusal before he wondered how many more times he was going to have to say it again he became aware how creased unkempt grants suit appeared to be newton was glad hed had his pressed the boardroom normally overlarge was today inadequate for its intended function of reassuring unsettled boards the cause was the electronic paraphernalia needed to link every other subsidiary board by satellite on to a walldominating screen in many cases in what was the middle of their nights or early mornings each location was served by three cameras the primary to provide a single encompassing view of each and every board composition the others to enable splitscreen closeups against that general view of individual speakers to make that visually possible none was able to sit in the normal way around a complete table but had to be in a horseshoe each chief executive at its middle edwin c grant heading the assembly and the global gathering from new york irrationally but even more unfittingly dwight newton had a mental image of the last supper even before noticing that including himself in new york there were a total of thirteen men he refused to extend the judas reflection the worldwide gathering began oddly with the unnecessary introductions of individual boards and each member from each country that done the master camera came back upon grant they were said the president caught up in a situation beyond their control the tragic death of a valued member of their headquarters staff was upsetting enough the repercussions of her having in her possession the number of an air france flight which had been the subject of a terrorist alert was severely affecting the company already that morning the stock was down three points on the dow jones after this conference had been publicized which brought to a twelvepoint drop the total loss since rebecca langs killing and the discovery of the flight details certain people at mclean were cooperating fully with the fbi investigation the parent board hoped for an early and successful conclusion of that investigation until which time they had reluctantly to expect dubette to be the subject of unsubstantiated speculation to restrict that as much as possible and by so doing limit any further stockmarket uncertainty the parent boards lawyers were retaining additional attorneys to initiate immediate action against publication of any material judged malicious or likely adversely to affect the reputation of the company there was going to be a full media release at the end of todays meeting in which this precaution was going to feature prominently as a warning to the media the parent board wanted that release simultaneously issued by each subsidiary additionally legal teams were to be established by each overseas board he was addressing to take similar action against any confidencedamaging publication in their respective countries one by one the chief executives of the subsidiaries recounted the individual effects upon them of what publicity there had already been there had been stockslippage in england germany france and japan there had been no drop so far in italy spain or australia antiterrorist police or agencies had examined company laboratories in england germany and france it was chief executive henri saby who spoke from paris newton only just stopped himself physically coming forward and thought he detected a similar heldback shift from grant the thinninghaired urbane saby appeared quite relaxed on the satellite link the superbly cut grey suit a sharp contrast to that of the president in addition to scientifically examining everything in their laboratory french antiterrorism officers had personally questioned him about the af flight listing being in rebecca langs possession like everyone at dubette headquarters he had been unable to explain it but had assured the investigators of his full cooperation on any future developments edward c grant picked up on that insisting that all subsidiaries offer every assistance to official enquiries and investigators the promised media release had been prepared well in advance by dubettes public affairs division and faxed to every overseas branch the president invited improvements additions or corrections from every linkup there was no challenge from any foreign division this has the utmost priority concluded grant i want daily input from all of you we must know here in new york of everything that happens in your countries nothing nothing whatsoever is too small or inconsequential he hesitated and then as if theyd had a choice said thank you for participating particularly those of you for whom your local timing is inconvenient the parent board remained in session after the closedown of the satellite connection but the discussion was a pointless repetition of what had been debated before and after the global conference they adjourned both for the electronic equipment to be removed and to watch the midday television news in an outer office all three major networks carried the press release threatening legal action against malicious publication tacked at the end of stories about the global conference to groans from almost everyone and the outburst of shit from grant all three described it as an emergency session and listed the current stockmarket loss to dwight newtons surprise lunch was provided in the restored boardroom by the time they emerged dubettes stock was down a total of ten points on the day sorry i couldnt see you yesterday apologized newton i was up in new york i saw the stories on television and read about it in this mornings post said parnell you got something on the flu research thats going to lift our spirits and maybe our stock ratings said newton not exactly said parnell the vice president frowned what is it then there seems to have been a misunderstanding said parnell newtons frown remained and he felt a twitch of apprehension about what when we spoke about that business from france i understood you to say it was something that hadnt worked i dont recall exactly said newton warily why liar thought parnell thats not what i understood from the fbi guys they thought it was something ongoing something thats being adopted it wasnt a problem newton decided maybe i gave the wrong impression like i said i dont really remember its some changes being made to the routine formulas coming out of france on proprietary stuff cough mixtures linctuses decongestants that sort of thing what type of changes colourings mostly for better recognition all placebos but we had to check them out chemically of course thats what it was safety checks newton was sweating now under the regulation white coat again glad he was wearing it at the seminar i thought the president referred to it as a way of preventing piracy of our products persisted parnell there was nothing dangerous in the truth newton thought that too its a winner every which way if the formula is pirated it makes it more expensive than our competitors if the products are bought genuinely it makes them easier to recognize by people who cant read too well i looked on my list everything made available to check out genetically pressed parnell i couldnt find anything as up to date as that newton smiled wasnt that list provided before we checked out the french stuff only for our french subsidiary nowhere else no why not across the board i told you specifically targeted its in the third world where the piracy is greatest and where the literacy and comprehension is the lowest ill ask russell for some samples shall i newtons frown return what the hell for i thought i was getting everything thats the arrangement isnt it and i thought your unit had been very specifically tasked it has and were working on it in every way thats open to us im not for a moment suggesting we break away certainly not on something like placebo infusion youve already cleared to be totally safe i just want to stick with the working arrangement we agreed when we set my unit up to get everything and look at everything over the course of time there was no danger newton told himself again he shrugged sure get samples from russ just dont take your eye off the main ball ok i wont take my eye off the main ball promised parnell an assurance more for his satisfaction than dwight newtons twenty parnell tried to seize the moment and see russell benn that afternoon talking generally of comparing their separate progress not disclosing his lack of it but the chemical research director pleaded pressure of work and postponed a meeting until the following day which parnell guessed to be a delay to consult with dwight newton and which lost him his hopedfor advantage benn was waiting when parnell arrived his desk cleared the coffee prepared once again parnell had gone into benns territory and he continued the concession providing his empty account first benn declared himself impressed by what he called the generosity of the scripps research institute and the national institute for medical research in sharing their research material more or less in its entirety disclosing in return his divisions equal failure even to know where to start upon a commercial vaccine after parnell further conceded his department hadnt yet succeeded in synthesizing a gene from the tokyo samples nor produced anything worthwhile from their animal testing what about the complete mapping of the poultry genome asked the black scientist displaying his medicalpublication awareness once more fleetingly parnell had the impression of being tested it gives us and every other researcher and group trying to do what were attempting three thousand million bases to compare against three thousand million human genetic bases to find one just one that might provide a mutatinginviting host cell which youre doing of course were doing it said parnell although refusing to rise to the other mans challenge but there are at least six different strains of domestic chicken farmed in china quite apart from all the other global test species but lets just stay with china which alone gives us a multiplication of eighteen thousand million i can work out the mathematics for myself patronized benn but not chemically a quicker way towards a treatment maybe neither of us will be the lucky ones benn said with forced philosophy i didnt believe we were allowed to think like that here at dubette were not smiled the other man dont tell anyone i ever said it i spoke with dwight yesterday about the work you both did on the french stuff announced parnell impatient with the sparring it was just placebo additions to existing formulae dismissed benn the confidence confirming parnells belief of prior consultation with dwight newton dwight explained he agreed the improvements should be added to everything else ive been given to be looked at genetically some time not sure weve got any batch samples left said benn once we established the safety i think they were all destroyed could you check sure and if you dont have madeup samples youd have the old and new formulae and i could get shipped from paris the old against the new couldnt i insisted parnell sure said benn again like i said ill check by noon the following day parnell received fifteen differently namemarked phials with the comparable number of dubette commercially packaged and identified bottles previously produced in france using that comparison he quickly discovered the major differences between the old and new formulae were liulousine and beneuflous which the pharmacological register described as expectorants and a flavouring agent called rifofludine which in hot climates had a limited function as a preservative when refrigeration was unavailable there were also six colouring agents all of which were listed as simply that nonmedicallyactive colourants also that day the raw research material each with its research notes arrived from san diego and london both far more extensive and detailed than parnell had anticipated parnell stored everything from russell benns division under refrigeration separating the rifofludine for later temperature match the whole operation took him less than an hour and was completed long before russell benn unexpectedly came into the pharmacogenomics unit get everything you wanted greeted the man if fifteen samples are everything i wanted then yes i have thanks parnell saw benn looking at the justopened packages occupying virtually all of his desk and it took all of this to discover the haemagglutinin protein of the flu epidemic what are you going to do with it study it hope to get an idea a possible path to follow at least somewhere among all this is the specific attempt by the scripps institute and the london school of medicine to match the chicken genome if theyd done it already it would have been announced im hoping well get a lead from everything theyve done from which we might find a different approach for our particular needs and if you dont we go on stumbling about in the dark you get a lead i could follow as well id appreciate your telling me if i get any sort of direction im not going to keep it to myself assured parnell there was an overwhelming temptation to start on the material at once but parnell remained strictly professional actually helping kathy richardson make duplicates not just for the four seconded to the specific influenza team but for mark easton and peter battey as well he included the two men in the regular endofday general discussion offering each their full dossier cases and suggesting their sparetime input what spare time mocked the pebblespectacled battey coffee breaks lunch periods those sort of times parnell partially mocked back i dont know if were ever going to get anywhere but if we dont it wont be for want of trying id certainly like to get out of the culdesac im in at the moment complained sato whose internet find the genetic discoveries had been all im doing is killing mice what are you cutting your genetic strings down to for ease of working asked lapidus ten thousand at a time said sato you five this way well still be comparing when were old and grey said beverley jackson maybe we take a break from routine practical application and instead go through this stuff looking for a new approach proposed parnell the source notes alone might lead us somewhere one or both will have already covered a lot of the ground that were duplicating is that an order asked beverley lets give it a shot stop our eyes glazing over said parnell they all worked on late that night with parnell the last to leave taking more files with him to continue working on at home it had become a nolongerunsettling habit to check his surroundings crossing the now sparsely occupied car park and constantly to check his mirrors once he began moving he drove with his mind hedgehopping between what hed been studying none of which had given him any new ideas and stray unconnected thoughts enquiring when he could have his own car back would give him an excuse to speak to the fbi agents in the hope of learning of any progress there hadnt been any mention of the second autopsy at their last meeting but the funeral wouldnt have been allowed unless it had been completed he had no doubt that russell benn had been forewarned of his approach about france which made nonsense of the mans prevarication about there not being any surviving samples when there blatantly had been how why had rebecca had the air france flight number it had to be significant but how why hadnt she done as shed promised and stopped probing had those headlights now in his rearview mirror been there as long as he imagined he slowed eyes constantly flickering to the mirror the more so when the lights grew bigger brighter but abruptly the following car pulled out and past with an impatient blast on the horn no hurry to get home no one waiting for him he supposed he should eat although he wasnt hungry he couldnt remember what prepacked meals he had in the refrigerator hed choose something he could cut onehanded with just a fork so he could eat and read at the same time he was still less than halfway through the san diego material he had to avoid the growing temptation to go out of sequence and read all the source notes instead of waiting for their numbered listing in the developing research narrative had dwight newton and russell benn told him the truth hed look further than the pharmacological register to find out more about liulousine beneuflous and rifofludine and the supposed harmless flavourings but carefully unsuspected unseen by anyone rebeccas murder was unquestionably connected to dubette and despite every fbi and lawyers warning parnell remained determined to discover that connection until he did he was going to have his eyes a lot on the rearview mirror watching for headlights closing behind parnell had always intended to stop when hed reached that part of the san diego material in which the attempts had been made to connect and then intrude the spikeshaped haemagglutinin protein into a receptive human host cell and awoke at two am startled cold and disorientated to discover hed sprawled across the table too close to the remains of a now nearsickening precooked lasagne the last litre bottle of wine now empty like the glass was on the table beside it parnell ached from how hed slumped for however long it had been and his stomach churned from the smell of the abandoned food his eyes felt as if there was grit or sand in them every time he blinked and blurred when he initially tried to focus upon the papers to see what section hed reached parnell forced himself to clear the table and dispose of the debris of the meal leaving his clothes where they fell almost literally to crawl into bed his last conscious thought that hed reached that part of the research from which he most hoped to find a way forward everything he remembered reading before epitomized the purity of research science but hadnt taken his mind any further forward in any direction parnell awoke again later than he had intended still grittyeyed but glad hed cleared away and didnt have to leave the previous nights litter festering in his urgency to get back to mclean he was still the first to arrive deeply into what hed expectantly decided to be the genesis for their specific interest before beverley came into the unit closely followed almost in procession by everyone else parnell waited until they were at their benches before emerging from his office i know im going against our established schedule but anyone had any startling revelations overnight from what you might have read there was no immediate response then deke pulbrow said were not big enough dont have sufficient resources to do what were trying to do you count how many countries contributed to decode the domestic chicken genome six countries with all the resources of six leading scientifically advanced institutions competing against which theres just six of us six ordinary people not six countries you making up the seventh dick what chance do you think weve genuinely practicably got it comes down to fractions admitted parnell you saying because its fractions we shouldnt try no denied pulbrow at once what im saying is that were pissing into the wind to imagine weve a chance in hell of finding anything no matter how hard we try and i cant imagine anyone trying any harder than us guys are trying there was another brief silence parnell said dekes point is taken anyone else im not proposing i break away from the new regime reading all that there is here for us to read but id like to run another string through the synthesizer said sato go ahead agreed parnell at once anyone else this time there was no response parnell said ok lets keep reading anyone get any brilliant ideas lets hear them right away as he read with growing acceptance that he wasnt going to get a lead parnell felt the disappointment of the others at san diegos unsuccessful efforts to find link between their flu discovery and the genome map theyd chosen from one of the most commonly eaten chinese chickens although conceding immediately that the connection was not the direct focus of their investigation but a naturally ongoing and maybe ultimately successful progression of it initially the only movement in the outside laboratory had been sean sato moving around his equipment but that soon ended no one bothered to leave for a coffee break all accepting kathy richardsons offer to bring it in lunch was more to rest wearily fogged eyes than to eat no one took more than half an hour away from their desks or benches without any conscious decision six oclock had evolved into the time for their endofday review and that friday night parnell stuck rigidly to it coming out of his side office precisely on time and bringing everyone up with the cry of ok guys days over as well as the week make it a full weekend i know youre going to take stuff home like i am but keep it light the way were working were going all of us to end up braindead and braindead were no use to anyone certainly not to wives or partners or loved ones he was instantly aware of the abrupt attention from everyone at the remark not sure himself why hed said it it had just come naturally and there hadnt been any clog of emotion when hed said it he hadnt even been thinking of rebecca lets clear our minds and our heads and start again on monday he concluded parnell didnt intend waiting until monday of course and he had other work in mind as well parnell arrived at mclean just after seven on the saturday morning his reading until midnight bringing him two thirds of the way through the scripps material he put what remained of the american documentation beside that from san diego on his desk everything temporarily suspended sure what he intended would only take up the morning possibly even less he accepted that there would have to be an explanation for the rest of the unit when they saw the obvious evidence of an experiment but was unconcerned about it he was after all working in his spare time and by monday he would have completed all the necessary reading so hed be further ahead than anyone else on all their benches and desks there were sections of both dossiers obediently left for the following week parnell concentrated his experiment upon the medicines to which the additional expectorants and the rifofludine partialpreservative had been added recording the dosages of each to his carefully separated test mice from each of which he first took a blood sample to provide a comparative dna string to measure the effect if any of the new formulae against the old he was almost at the end of his preparation when the other idea came to him and he physically stopped what he was doing considering it with the exception of the three new constituents every drug had gone through the required threephase licensing process and those three ingredients could not in themselves be humanly harmful he wasnt anyway considering human testing as such just a shortcut to extend the experiments beyond mice he prepared each petrie dish with a measured sample of every brand product containing liulousine beneuflous and rifofludine it was difficult extruding the vein in his left arm and he inserted the hypodermic awkwardly hurting himself but he managed to withdraw sufficient blood identically to match the drug measures already in the culture dishes he was concentrating so totally upon storing them that he didnt hear beverley jackson come into the laboratory the first he knew of her presence was when she said what the hell are you doing and so startled was he that he came close to dropping the culture dish in his hand he turned to face her at the door aware that the shirt sleeve of his left arm was still rolled up and that the hypodermic with some blood remaining in the chamber was lying very obviously on the bench alongside russell benns samples im just working my way through something parnell said inadequately beverley came further into the room absorbing everything as she did so for christs sake dick youre experimenting on yourself what is it what have you injected tell me you havent done anything stupid holy christ stop it he said hoping his calmness would calm her i havent injected myself with anything i just needed human blood and i was the only donor what for she persisted looking more intently at the neatly stacked bottles and phials before parnell could answer she said they came from the chemical division a couple of days back right yes he said im just carrying out a few tests thats all why why on these specific samples when weve got hundreds of others we havent even looked at yet and when were supposed to be working exclusively on the flu research which incidentally is what ive come in here today to go on doing it could only be his suspicion that there was some connection with rebeccas killing but he couldnt compromise beverley in any way i want you to trust me trust me and not talk to anyone about what im doing which is what i am going to ask everyone else on monday when they see the mice and the cultures its personal there was only one inference if he answered that trust me beverley regarded him steadily for several moments am i going to regret coming in here today you could go im logged in at the security gatehouse as you are shit thought parnell you dont know anything youre not part of anything theres probably nothing to know or be part of there was another silence were you and rebecca doing something you shouldnt have been beverley was too clever too prescient parnell conceded neither rebecca nor i were betraying dubette in any way nor were or have either of us done anything illegal or against the company ive got to trust you on that im asking you to trust me on that qualified parnell do i get to know sometime i cant answer that like i said maybe theres nothing to know it would have been a good day to stay at home wouldnt it it would have avoided a lot of complications beverley jackson didnt reply and parnell accepted surprised that hed had the last word they read parnell retreating into his private office for the rest of the morning he was surprised although not as much as he had been earlier by her sudden arrival at his office door what are you doing about lunch i hadnt thought about it probably wont bother you know what you look like dont stopped parnell realizing he hadnt even bothered to shave that morning and yes i know everyone keeps telling me shit completed the woman refusing the interruption thats it thats what everyone keeps telling me did you make breakfast i didnt have time what was dinner last night that really was shit a prepared lasagne i didnt get all the plastic covering off before the microwave it didnt add to the flavour but then i dont think anything could have done you lectured us last night about the danger of being braindead yes youre a mess and getting messier for a lot of reasons i know and for a lot more that i dont what i do know is that a messedup fuckedup head of department is even more of a danger than being braindead ill do better eat better get better tonight i know you will said the woman im personally going to see that you do but also that you shave first christ you really are a fuckedup mess twentyone parnell managed to finish all there was to read by two am on the monday without finding a direction from either the english or american flu discoveries to pursue his units particular search there was always the possibility he told himself that someone else in the pharmacogenomics section had spotted something hed missed it was at least a slender straw at which to clutch he was at mclean by seven determined to be the first there although still without an explanation for the experiment beverley had caught him conducting on the saturday trying to convince himself that as head of the department he didnt necessarily have to provide one hed expected beverley to press him further during dinner but she hadnt not in fact referring to it once which he didnt fully understand most of the time the talk had been light although theyd obviously discussed the influenza project but not in any depth parnell warning that neither of them at that stage had completed their reading creating the need to avoid one misguiding the other with halfformed or illformed impressions and although thered been no indication of it parnell tried to overcome any difficulty beverley might have by openly referring to rebecca that had been the moment hed expected beverley to challenge him about that mornings experiment they hadnt talked at all about her exhusband hed enjoyed the evening positively physically relaxing beverley chose the restaurant in a part of midtown he hadnt been to before and met him there it was traditional hometown american cooking which dictated portions sufficient to relieve an african famine even though he tried to order minimally he decided the only thing missing from the ribeye steak were hooves and tail as he had anticipated beverley initially led the conversation but gave way to him as the evening progressed and by its end hed realized surprised that he was dominating the exchanges and beverley appeared content to let him not once trying for the last word he refused her demand that they split the bill which she accepted without continuing argument and theyd parted quite comfortably outside the restaurant without any awkwardness about nightcaps at another bar or eithers apartment in the cab on his way back to washington circle parnell found himself wondering what possibly could have gone wrong between beverley and her husband that reflection prompted the half thought that hed found the first evening with beverley easier than he had with rebecca but that was where hed halted it as a half thought not to be completed it left him feeling guilty which was worsened throughout the following day by his failure to pick up something from the san diego or london research richard parnell wasnt a man upon whom the rarity of professional disappointment rested easily none of the mice hed injected with the frenchsuggested drug modifications showed any obvious ill effects after the fortyeightyhour period and he was halfway through extracting blood comparisons when beverley jackson arrived she said at once we going to learn all today you finished the fluidentification papers avoided parnell almost i didnt get a lead i havent either not yet lets hope you do before you finish or one of the others might come up with something you didnt answer my question she said no parnell agreed turning back to his sampling he was conscious of other arrivals behind him but didnt respond to them until he had the tests from all the experimental mice on to slides he turned back into the main laboratory unsurprised to find himself the focus of everyones attention he said this has nothing to do with what were looking for its something i set up over the weekend anyone come up with anything anything at all from what youve read so far there were various headshakes deke pulbrow said not a godamned thing sean sato said its great research but theres nothing here thats going to help us i havent found anything either conceded parnell again lets talk about it when were all through hed tell them as much of the truth as he felt able parnell finally determined not about his suspicion that rebeccas death was somehow connected with the french material but that he had become curious at the apparent secrecy in which it had been chemically tested and had decided to put it through the most basic of genetic programmes without interfering in any way at all with what they were concentrating upon parnell worked with total concentration able as he always had been to isolate himself from all or any surrounding distraction bowbacked over his microscope to contrast his beforeandafter slides anxious for a variation he didnt find reluctant to accept yet another disappointment at the same time objectively warning himself that there should not be any change after russell benn and dwight newtons medical clearances he repeated every examination under stronger magnification and once more found nothing with growing unwelcome resignation parnell eventually turned to his own beforeandafter blood specimens starting at the lower magnification and for the briefest of seconds not fully absorbing what he was seeing parnell was too consummate a professional to accept a single illustration patiently although with increasing satisfaction he checked every single treated and untreated slide one against the other and obtained the same result in every case it was only when he pushed his stool away from his bench stretching against the aching tension in his back and shoulders that parnell became properly aware of how tightly and how long he had been hunched over his microscope it was a fleeting discomfort virtually at once compensated by a surge of excitement which in turn was tempered by further inherent professionalism he had positive findings from a lot of separate uncontaminated tests which in his own opinion was unequivocal but which by the standards of research and certainly the challenge he would have to face was insufficient there had to be separate independent experiments with no prior alerting indication of what the expected result might be and he needed to duplicate everything himself on himself against the remote possibility that this initial analysis had inadvertently been contaminated to produce a faulty result only ted lapidus was still reading when parnell emerged into the main laboratory surprised to find it was already noon the rest of the unit looked up at him in solemn expectation he said any bright shining pathways there was a further series of headshaking mark easton said in the words of the prophet back to the drawing board i want everything temporarily suspended at least for the rest of today announced parnell im asking all of you to conduct blind bloodsampling using your own blood involving something dubette is making available on a limited market what are we looking for asked lapidus coming up from his final paper blind tests like i said refused parnell no prior indication i dont want us challenged on this were bypassing phaseone animal assessment queried battey yes acknowledged parnell why the mystery demanded beverley there isnt one i want independent corroborative findings thats all or was it all he asked himself parnell refined and extended the confirming experiments testing upon the altered dubette medicines before individually duplicating the experiments by separately adding liulousine beneuflous and rifofludine having already established the research once parnell completed the repetition ahead of everyone else he withdrew briefly to his side office to avoid the appearance of hovering over them but used the vantage point to watch them at work once again he was impressed at how quickly and expertly they had unquestioningly adjusted to his limited briefing beverley was the first to finish of the rest of the group as parnell came out into the main laboratory she said i expected to sweat blood not give it this is a oneoff situation said parnell i hope it is said lapidus ive never gone along with this scientisttestyourself mumbojumbo neither have i assured parnell as i said its a oneoff when do we know what its all about he didnt know parnell acknowledged the mutation on his own initial selfexperiment had shown after fortyeight hours but it could have occurred far quicker than that he should have monitored it during the saturday and most certainly have checked on the sunday not having a time sequence risked his first findings being dismissed as flawed research lets give it an hour what were you doing when we arrived pressed sato ive duplicated everything for a comparison you expect us to do that too demanded battey no assured parnell if your findings match mine and my second tests corroborate thatll be enough should he set up a meeting with dwight newton in advance there was every reason to move as quickly as possible if his findings were confirmed and the french subsidiary were already in production but his findings werent yet confirmed and until they were he couldnt risk setting off alarm bells and challenging a company vice president and the director of chemical research there was another familiar hiatus throughout the unit sean sato and deke pulbrow returned to their earlier contrasting of chicken and human dna strings parnell told kathy richardson how he wanted the san diego and london research filed and dictated letters to both institutions congratulating them upon their exploratory work but regretting it hadnt led them anywhere parnell adhered strictly to his hourly check there was no mutation on any of his carefully prepared petrie dishes one by one unasked the rest of the unit ran their own checks on their own experiments there was no response from anyone impatiently lapidus said i really dont see why we cant be told what were looking for neither did he now conceded parnell it was overly cautious imposing blind comparisons as he had he deservedly risked the ridicule of the rest of the unit whose respect he believed hed had until now if his cultures were inconclusive youll see it soon enough how long do you want us to stay here questioned sean sato im not complaining but i actually have something fixed for tonight i need to rearrange if this is going to go on he needed at least one independent observer accepted parnell lets give it another hour well decide what to do in another hour he sounded weak ineffectual he realized he hadnt thought it through prepared properly beverley said im not doing anything in no hurry to get away neither am i said peter battey he led the afternoon coffee break parnell declined so did beverley when the two of them were alone beverley said this is looking a little strange its looking fucking ridiculous corrected parnell thats what i meant i didnt want to influence anyone as i didnt want us to influence each other on saturday when we were halfway through reading the flu research you cant influence a genetic reaction by telling someone in advance what it might possibly be itll either happen or it wont and if it doesnt youre not going to look good ive already realized that you ought to talk to people more maybe i should everyone was back fifteen minutes before the next scheduled culturedish examination again parnell was the first the focus of every eye he was even aware of kathy richardson watching from her separate office it was a warm positively physical feeling deep within him as if hed ingested something a quickreacting drug even which was an analogy that irritated him although only for a passing second because there was no irritation or disappointment at what he was looking at through the microscope lens the mutation wasnt as extensive as it had been when hed first looked that morning so far only three out of a total of fifteen of the newly prepared petrie dishes but it was sufficient confirmation to substantiate his every fear and there was every reason to be frightened he realized still bent over his apparatus but no longer concentrating solely on what was happening on the slide in front of him he couldnt remember an experiment either one hed conducted himself or one hed read about in any scientific research paper in which a mutation occurred as quickly as this appeared to be doing he turned to face them all personal satisfaction euphoria even gone his attitude and mind coldly analytical i didnt do this right asking you to work as i did im sorry if it ever arises again which i hope it doesnt itll be different give your cultures a little longer than the hour we decided upon im going to analyse mine later but particularly try to isolate if any of the three drugs that have been introduced appear to be causing the greatest damage what sort of damage asked pulbrow france may be producing a range of dubettebrand medicines that are going to kill people declared parnell already on his way to the door as he walked further into the spiders web parnell tried to calculate the fallout from what he was about to do what he had no alternative but to do but very quickly gave up there could only be one consideration the ethical diagnostic requirement any personal repercussions were secondary less than secondary even dubette should actually be eternally grateful although he doubted that they would be he certainly doubted if dwight newton and russell benn would be parnell hesitated at the door into the chemical research division wondering whether to alert benn first but hurried on the alarm however it was sounded had to come with the authority of newton to discuss it first explain it first to benn would be a waste of time and from the speed of the mutation parnell didnt believe there was any time whatsoever to waste any production of the new products had to be stopped immediately any distribution not just halted but withdrawn every single last bottle or pill no matter how difficult to trace and if that distribution were in africa that was going to be very difficult indeed to find there were still three women in newtons outer secretariat all of whom looked up in surprise as parnell burst in what trailed newtons personal assistant i need to see dwight the woman shook her head hes chairing an audit meeting and i know he wants to get away early tell him began parnell but stopped abruptly guessing there would be a damagelimitation operation less urgently he said tell him that something extremely important has come up something that cant wait until tomorrow something hes got to hear about and act upon tonight ill be waiting in my office will you tell him that what on earth is it asked the woman very important like i just told you parnell did stop at russell benns unit on his way back the research director was in his side office notebook calculations and reference books side by side on the cluttered desk before him benn said youre whipping up quite a wind the speed youre moving around hope youre not planning to leave early tonight said parnell why shouldnt i demanded the man ive told dwight i need to see him right away now you need to be included in what frowned benn stopping dubette killing people declared parnell shortly what exclaimed benn parnell nodded at the shelves of textbooks behind the other man look up hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and get a message through to dwight that you want to be there when he and i speak everyone had completed their initial analysis by the time parnell got back to his own department lapidus said how did you know i didnt admitted parnell whats causing it to happen asked beverley i dont know that either i just know it is happening that in humans at this rate of mutation its potentially fatal and that its got to be withdrawn you mean its already in production said pulbrow i think it might be why how said beverley i guess it comes down to money said parnell twentytwo parnell had anticipated that russell benn would already be in dwight newtons office when he arrived seated oddly at the side of the vice presidents desk which gave the impression of a twoagainstone confrontation hed expected it to be that too an initially belligerent confrontation but it didnt begin that way quietly without hectoring newton said whats this about dubette killing people you told me everything added to the french formulae were placebos that you and russell had run all the checks and cleared them as safe parnell decided as much as possible against it appearing a challenge although he guessed it wouldnt be easy they are insisted benn at once more forceful than the vice president benn at least considered himself to be challenged parnell accepted what animals did you test on in your clinical trials mice said benn theyre the most compatible parnell nodded you look up hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase as i suggested a growth enzyme identified benn the man had not looked beyond the dictionary definition parnell guessed present in mice and humans and essential people born without it rarely reach maturity overproduction of it can lead to all sorts of genetic imbalances can even cause tumours or leukaemia and the human body has no hprt control mechanism i told you we tested on mice insisted benn there was no harmful effect whatsoever mice have a control mechanism why or how hasnt been isolated he looked directly at the black scientist ive tested everything you gave me made up from the new french formulae on human blood everyone else in my department has done the same today independent blind tests all with the same unequivocal results in about two hours there is a rapid increase in the production of hprt an increase a human body couldnt control administration quite obviously will be fatal production in france has got to be stopped immediately i hope to god distribution hasnt already begun there must be more different independent experiments blustered benn all truculence gone production distribution has got to be stopped right away insisted parnell i extended my tests separately upon liulousine beneuflous and rifofludine by themselves they dont cause any hprt increase there has to be some chemical effect when theyre combined in the cocktail or maybe with the colouring agents although i doubt the colorants contributed parnell hesitated unsure if hed left anything unsaid quickly he added ive obviously kept all the tests all the cultures for you both to examine why did you do this asked the virtually silent newton still quietvoiced you your unit had been given a specific assignment parnell felt the rising anger but suppressed it having hoped the absurd demand wouldnt be made but deep within himself believing himself adjusted now to dubette thinking and dubette rationalizing he was not truly surprised that newton had asked it tightly careless of their inferring contempt or disgust in his tone parnell said which we have been working upon uninterrupted except for two or three hours today and that interruption was upon my very definite instructions to confirm my initial personal findings i worked here on saturday russell had made the samples available to me after our conversation dwight about france i did the tests on impulse because the samples were there right in front of me you really want to talk about why i did it my having just told you there was no positive reason when ive just also told you what dubette are manufacturing in france and what the result of that manufacture will be he didnt feel like the explaining schoolboy any longer instead he very much felt himself the castigating schoolmaster addressing careless culpably inattentive students they even looked like caughtout culpable inattentive students no longer unchangeable senior pharmaceutical executives it didnt give parnell any satisfaction newton said its late in france gone midnight wake people up insisted parnell i think began newton but stopped what demanded parnell i should talk to new york finished the skeletally thin research vice president you do whatever needs to be done if the french production isnt stopped it will destroy dubette as an international pharmaceutical conglomerate yes accepted newton dully just as dully practically to himself benn said we cleared everything as safe caught by a sudden uncertainty parnell said did i have everything or was there more more admitted benn unhesitatingly some childrens decongestants some linctuses its all got to be stopped withdrawn demanded parnell frustrated by their apparent failure to understand the urgency yes said newton again the other two men were virtually shellshocked parnell decided careless now of patronizing or challenging or even demanding he said it will be done wont it you will speak to new york or paris or whoever you need to warn tonight newton made a physical effort to recover straightening in his chair although yet again all he managed to say was yes do you want me to be part of any linkup technically to explain whats happened and the effect of it asked parnell no refused newton recovering further its scarcely technical i think my unit should examine all that we havent so far tested of what france was going to distribute persisted parnell a tiny irritating sand grit of doubt settling in his mind he looked once more directly at russell benn and that you should start again from the beginning youve made your point well enough bristled the man emerging from his lethargy you want me to tell you we fucked up ok we fucked up satisfied i will be when im sure nothings being distributed throughout africa or that anything that has is being withdrawn and destroyed said parnell im not scoring points looking for admissions of mistakes im trying to stop a potential disaster i accept that and thank you said newton what about the cultures asked parnell do you want to examine them now im prepared to take your word for the moment said the vice president the calls ive got to make are more important only beverley jackson was in the pharmacogenomics unit when parnell returned she said by yourself dwight has calls to make we thought theyd want to see for themselves that it would be more discreet if as few as possible were around it is eight oclock parnell pointed out he calculated that it would be two am in paris from the way you talked on saturday youre an authority on the bars of georgetown you fancy buying a girl a drink on her way home sure accepted parnell surprised as well as pleased ill follow you it meant he didnt have to worry about lights in his rearview mirror parnell supposed as he led the way back into the city one thought prompted another apart from the first two or three days after having his lawyers warning confirmed by the fbi parnell had increasingly found it difficult completely to believe he was in any physical danger the more so as the days passed although he still did what he considered to be taking care but the fbi had been serious so too had beverleys exhusband from which it was logical that anyone was exposed by association with him he took his normal route home crossing at the key bridge but didnt find any convenient parking in georgetown itself so he continued on to his reserved slot at washington square there was a second space for beverley practically outside the apartment he held her door open for her and said i hope you dont mind the walk it hardly counts as a walk she took his arm almost automatically as they went back into georgetown he chose the bar hed found on his first few days in the city the student hed got to know wasnt there any longer beverley asked for beer and he had the same she said at once i didnt wait on at work accidentally im the elected spokesperson to say what to ask what she corrected whyd you test that particular batch of stuff rather than anything else the question brought parnells mind back to his thoughts about inherent danger on the way in from mclean i was thinking on the way here rebecca was murdered the bureau and barry both think i could be targeted too why parnell humped his shoulders no ones worked out yet why rebecca was killed or why anyone would want to kill me but if im at risk then so must be anyone whos with me me you mean she sounded surprised youre with me she sniggered an uncertain laugh and actually looked around the crowded bar its not easy to take that on board parnell said thats what i did the first time i was warned actually looked around me as if expecting to see someone coming at me has anyone come at you i mean no maybe there was something beverley stopped looking awkwardly into her drink i think thats a big part of the investigation trying to find out if there was anything in rebeccas past guessed parnell he definitely had to use the excuse of getting his own car back to talk to howard dingley or david benton im sorry i wasnt beverley stumbled its ok it seems unreal talking about murder and the possibility of someone trying to murder you talking of terrorism all unreal i dont think i ever believed it properly took it in when barry used to talk about cases killings i thought it was right i should tell you thank you she sniggered again this seems unreal as well doesnt it you warning me i might get hit by a bullet meant for you they go in for car accidents corrected parnell you didnt answer my question about testing those french formulae improvements it was something to do with rebecca wasnt it she was curious about it thats all with good reason parnell shook his head not because she thought there was anything wrong with them they went outwith the normal delivery system hardly sufficient to become curious it doesnt seem to be not now accepted parnell it did to her what did you mean about everything coming down to money that had been a stupid unthinking remark acknowledged parnell i dont want you any of you to get mixed up in this any more than you already have been im sorry now that i asked you all in the first place it had to be done in a hurry for the confirmation i needed to get it stopped to get what stopped the production and distribution distribution where stop it beverley we the unit are involved no more did dwight newton and russell benn sign it all off as being safe parnell refused to reply she was back in her lastword mode he decided you know what i find strange she continued undeterred if i was head of an entire division a vice president or the research director and a guy told me that something id cleared as safe could would kill people for whom it was prescribed the first thing id do would be to demand it be proven to me under proper laboratory conditions it was more important to put a stop on it on the production and marketing id have still wanted proof before i did anything i offered them the opportunity they didnt take it my priority was getting it halted the other guys were uneasy about what happened today i gave them and you my word it wont ever be that way again and it wont she sipped her beer in silence for several moments its a pretty impressive success for the department isnt it i suppose it is it was the first time hed thought of it being that what did newton say they were both numbed but he did thank me they werent professional cut corners declared the woman they should be called to account for that not everything was made available to us ive asked that it should be you going to go over their heads complain to new york i hadnt thought of doing that admitted parnell thats what newton said he had to do talk to new york lets hope he does it he cant avoid it exclaimed parnell youd be surprised what someone will do to keep five hundred thousand a year and stock options he cant avoid it insisted parnell although another sand speck of doubt settled in his mind its late beverley suddenly announced we should eat accepted parnell giorgios restaurant was less than a hundred yards up wisconsin avenue it was unthinkable that he should go there with another woman totally innocent and uninvolved though they were ive got something ready at home said beverley parnell later decided that it was probably the thought of giorgios trattoria and the celebration hed planned with rebecca there that prompted his response you mind if i drive home with you in your car i mean beverley looked steadily at him understanding immediately you are taking it seriously arent you if id been with rebecca that night she would probably still be alive or youd both be dead i prefer it my way beverley took his arm again on their way back to washington square but parnell could feel a stiffness beverleys apartment was off dupont and they drove there in silence as she parked she said i didnt like that im sorry im being overreactive he made no attempt to get out of the car theres enough for two said beverley i was going to butterfly it anyway it was coincidentally ribeye steak large enough easily to be shared between the two of them there was salad and a napa valley red but not a lot of conversation as he helped her clear away parnell said im sorry if i frightened you its ok said beverley in a voice indicating that it wasnt weve only been out together twice said parnell trying to lift the mood maybe we should avoid each other from now on beverley held him for several moments with one of her direct looks maybe she said in the same voice as before im at dinner with guests complained edward c grant this cant wait insisted dwight newton he could hear people in the background what newton told him unsettled by the length of the silence from the other end newton said you still there im going into the study wait the line went dead and then picked up again without any background noise grant saidyou told me it was safe dwight you said you and benn had run all the checks and that it was safe i doublechecked russells tests tried newton but you didnt did you he didnt do this test why didnt you you take two weeks and tell me everythings kosher parnell takes two days and discovers its fucking fatal its a genetic discipline this whatever its called is known not to affect mice upon which benn did test but it does affect humans right thats what you said i know what i said newton wished he hadnt sounded so uncertain so it would have been obvious to do the comparison it wasnt done capitulated newton you know i should fire you and benn yes but you wouldnt newton thought but that i cant because of the attention it would attract you want us to resign that wasnt possible either still too much risk of publicity youre hanging on by a thread both of you hanging on by default you hear what im saying yes benn with you no you tell him what im telling you you pressed me on this wanted the decision you got said newton clumsily the line went silent again for what seemed longer than before finally grant said if that was a threat the thread by which youre hanging just started to fray dwight it wasnt any sort of threat retreated the vice president weakly have france gone into production started to distribute i dont know its got to be stopped all of it of course its got to be stopped said grant irritably you call them right now wake saby up i thought youd want to do that said newton he was soaked in perspiration bowed forward over his desk with his free hand supporting his forehead its your responsibility dwight everythings your responsibility youve got the authority exercise it you going to tell the board of course im going to have to tell the board and youre going to be here when i do explaining it newton felt physically sick swallowing against the bile at the back of his throat what about parnell what about parnell echoed the other man from new york hopefully hes prevented a potential catastrophe shouldnt he be thanked congratulated there was yet another hesitation although shorter this time did you thank him yes thatll do for the moment until youve worked out your escape from every danger and pitfall you bastard thought newton ok talk to me about parnell demanded grant is he a whistleblower newton at once saw the chance to unsettle the other man hes certainly got a lot of principles all he kept on about today was stopping everything you ask him why he made the check that he did of course he worked the weekend in his own time said he did it because the stuff was just there in his laboratory that there was no positive reason you believe that asked grant his voice betraying that he clearly didnt im telling you what he said insisted newton uncaring about the petulance he felt drained too exhausted to keep his thoughts in order what else did he say persisted the president newton weighed the questioning he wanted to run his tests of everything from france when he learned that there was some stuff he hadnt been shown let him instructed grant i dont want him thinking anythings being kept away from him i was obviously going to anyway said newton they were in it together werent they abruptly demanded grant parnell and that damned girl probing together and now hes discovered this if he tells the fbi the fbi will tell the food and drug administration wholl tell whoevers responsible for licensing in france and were dangling from a high branch newton felt a surge of satisfaction at the fear that was coming clearly down the line unusually emboldened in his own desperation sure there was nothing left for him to lose newton said wed better hope he doesnt suffer an accident to make the fbi and the media even more curious than they already are hadnt we the line went dead from the other end twentythree david benton described parnells call as coincidence because theyd intended contacting him to arrange another meeting you got something demanded parnell at once just touching bases sidestepped the fbi man guess youll need to liaise with your attorney get back to us asap barry jacksons secretary didnt know when he would be out of court parnell asked for the lawyer to call back juggling in his mind all the things he had to do smiling to himself as bentons phrase intruded into his mind trying to remember all the bases he had to cover it was a bitty fragmented schedule he supposed he should add to it the promised phone call to his mother that morning there had been two replies from england to his apology letters one from someone hed worked with on the genome project in cambridge asked why he didnt come back there was a position available all he had to do was officially apply and it was his sublime academia awaited parnell thought it truly sounded sublime as well as knowing he wouldnt make the application first on parnells list of things to do was to reassure his unit after what beverley had told him he waited for everyone to arrive beverley being the last before going out into the communal laboratory conscious of their waiting expectantly i told you yesterday that what happened then wont happen again reiterated parnell now im telling you one more time because i know theres some concern you all know now that it was necessary and why it was necessary but ive made it clear to the vice president how and why it had to be done hes grateful now we get back to the assignment weve been given has everything been stopped in france said lapidus the vice president was talking to new york overnight said parnell so whats the answer demanded lapidus i none of us want to get caught up in a licensing situation it was career concern which was understandable accepted parnell positively he said thats not going to happen either it surely had to go before the licensing authorities in france said sato these are things im going to find out promised parnell i have to find out today broke in peter battey we none of us know what the hells going on which isnt any way to work how we came here to work another base to cover thought parnell if i can im waiting to hear from the vice president we didnt get the whole range of french products made up from the new formulae when we do something else im hopefully arranging today ill personally do the testing no one else after all we scarcely need confirmation everything requires confirmation contradicted beverley which dwight and russell can provide after my initial examination suggested parnell you involved us said lapidus close to an accusation we found the bad science were caught up now in bad science your professional reputations established ours isnt what is it you want asked parnell written acknowledgement that this unit each of us named found and exposed the bad science declared lapidus there couldnt have been more than one smokybarroom or wineandcheese session to have reached that decision decided parnell beverley said get real for christs sake ted you think youre going to get something like that on paper from dubette beverley hadnt been in a smoky bar room or had cheese and wine parnell knew ill try to get it in the form of an official letter of thanks which is the best i imagine i can hope for if i cant even get that he hesitated embarrassed at what he intended to say if i cant get that taking into account my professional reputation will you all accept individually written letters from me to each of you from the uncertainty that went through the group before him parnell guessed none of them had anticipated such an offer lapidus clearly once more the dominant figure said i think we need to consider that i dont said beverley i dont think i need any sort of letter i think this is fucking ridiculous id be happy with something from you sean sato told parnell so would i agreed mark easton parnell shook his head do what ted suggests think on it while youre thinking on it keep always in mind that ill do everything possible everything in my power to avoid your careers being affected by this i dont in fact see why your careers should in any way be affected apart from being bettered but obviously its something worrying you some of us qualified beverley however im looking beyond this picked up parnell i could not be happier more satisfied with the way this units worked out weve considered whats worrying some of you now hear whats worrying me whats worrying me is that this is going to fuck up what weve had going thus far i dont want it to and i hope you dont want it to wont let it happen either he looked at beverley what weve done for dubette should establish us not knock us off balance damaging what were building between us have i made myself clear i hope we both have said lapidus parnell decided a further hour without contact from dwight newton was sufficient refusing to wait any longer or risk being fobbed off on the telephone by one of the mans protective secretariat parnell made another unannounced approach into the centre of the spiders web this time he did stop off at the chemical research unit and wasnt surprised to be told russell benn was with the vice president at newtons outer office the mans personal assistant an indeterminately aged woman with crimped hair not wearing a wedding band said the vice president was in conference and could not be disturbed under any circumstances parnell said he would wait but asked that the woman tell newton that he was doing just that waiting in the outer office he told me he wasnt to be disturbed under any circumstances repeated the woman making no move towards newtons office and you told me said parnell ive no idea how long itll be as long as it takes said parnell settling himself in an easy chair in direct line with newtons office door he ignored the magazines on a side table near a tall plant with polished leaves reminiscent of the fbi field office inwardly unsettled by the doubt of the previous evenings conversation with beverley surely newton had called new york spoken to edward c grant it was inconceivable that newton wouldnt have made the call salaries and stock options didnt come into the consideration any consideration for newton to have hesitated looked for an excuse or an escape would be criminal literally criminal opening him and dubette up to both criminal and civil prosecution but what if newton hadnt telephoned new york had looked was still looking for a way out should he go over the vice presidents head as beverley had asked if he would hed have to parnell accepted hed have no alternative another recollection from the previous night swirled into his mind his now embarrassing insistence upon travelling home with the woman in her car about which he shouldnt be embarrassed he told himself the danger did exist without any reason any evidence for the speculation he asked himself if it would increase become any clearer if he did go directly to new york he didnt have to he realized there was an intended meeting with the fbi team he wasnt sure didnt care if it came within their jurisdiction theyd have to take some action if he told them it would after all amount to possible mass murder would you do me a favour he called to the obstructive personal assistant would you just slip a message to dwight and tell him im waiting out here that the fbi are waiting on me to fix a meeting he doesnt want to be interrupted just tell him that insisted parnell he doesnt want to be interrupted the woman repeated hell want to be about this she hesitated looked for guidance to the other secretaries each of whom shrugged refusing advice or involvement and finally got to her feet she reappeared almost immediately at newtons office door smiling with relief he says to come in what meeting with the fbi demanded newton virtually as parnell crossed the threshold they want to see me again what about russell benn was beside the desk again and parnell thought they looked like two boys exchanging secrets they didnt say i was told you were in conference i thought i might have been invited you were just about to be fortunate i came by then have paris been stopped yes parnell was unsure whether to believe the man there was a possible way of finding out he thought had any been distributed theyre checking they dont know queried parnell disbelievingly it was the middle of the night said benn now its getting towards the middle of their day insisted parnell theyre checking repeated the vice president you havent yet seen the cultures the overnight hprt production was enormous id like to go over them in my laboratory said benn unable to meet parnells look as he spoke to avoid an accusing audience thought parnell at once the cultures werent sterile so there was no reason why they shouldnt be transferred no reason either why newton or benn should be humiliated further sure did you tell paris we want everything that hasnt been tested newton said im going to speak to saby again later i havent forgotten ive already prepared a schedule of whats to come added benn supportively offering the single sheet of paper from which parnell quickly saw that there were still six missing items all were for child treatments they need to be withdrawn ahead of any examination said parnell thats what ive told paris that everythings got to be stopped assured newton parnell paused mentally rehearsing his promised approach i think it would be appropriate for my unit to be thanked officially by letter for their contribution yesterday youre the unit director said newton sharply havent you thanked them of course then its done insisted newton just as i thanked you last night ill tell them dubette is grateful but not tell you im doing it by the official letter youre frightened will lock you into a scandal parnell decided hed known in advance what newtons response would be and had only asked the question because hed promised the unit hed do so newtons rejection was still what indicative he supposed whens the meeting with the fbi asked newton abruptly not fixed yet said parnell but its about rebecca her death they were shitscared about france parnell guessed at once with every cause and reason they didnt tell me what it was about but it has to be connected with rebecca doesnt it theres im sure youre aware stumbled the vice president you got something to say why dont you say it dwight demanded parnell after rebeccas murder your discovery could totally destroy dubette if it ever became public blurted the thin man dwight thats what i told you in as many words remember im not going to talk to anyone about it neither is anyone in my unit your only risk dubettes only risk is if some of this stuff has already been shipped for sale or use and people start dying i know and thank you again for the assurance i mean thats what we need not my positive assurance but far more importantly the positive guarantee from paris that everythings recovered destroyed were agreed on that arent we we cant be anything else but agreed on that challenged parnell abandoning all his previous reservations about what he said at this encounter abandoning too any reliance upon newton to achieve anything into parnells mind drifted beverleys cynicism youd be surprised what someone will do to keep five hundred thousand a year and stock options the vice president and benn were still shellshocked their ears ringing deafened from the reverberations of an explosion they hadnt ever imagined thats what were getting promised benn parnell wasnt at all sure that was what they were getting or would get he still needed to be convinced even that dwight newton had done everything he should to contain the situation fleetingly doubting it was something he should do as head of department but very much aware of his undertaking to distance everyone else in his unit from any further involvement parnell personally transferred all the exploding hprt cultures to russell benns section to which benn had still not returned pedantically insisting that he got while he waited an individually itemized receipt from benns impatiently sighing secretary for every sample he missed barry jacksons returned call while he waited but reached the lawyer at his second attempt glad of the further delay because it had given him time to think and decide upon something else something he initially dismissed as paranoid until forcing himself to confront rebecca langs murder and his insisting upon driving home the previous night with beverley and the fear of blazing headlights in his rearview mirror jackson said the following morning before eleven was good for him and benton promised theyd be expecting him at the fbis washington field office any time after nine when he went back to jackson to confirm the fbi encounter parnell said theres something else i think i need to do before tomorrow you free at lunchtime i dont often eat lunch i wasnt inviting you to lunch anyway russell benn said parnells got us by the balls and he knows it you think i need to be told that said newton impatiently the conversational carousel had gone around and around since parnell left always arriving back at the point at which it began youve got to call saby i dont need to be told that either retorted newton why hasnt he come back to you i dont know its been despatched hasnt it some of the stuffs already gone into distribution weve got to give him time are new york giving you time ive got another couple of hours were going to stay together on this arent we dwight you and i i mean i know what you mean cut off newton of course were together on this what else can we be he fervently wished he knew that there was some escape he could make abandoning the other man i dont like my balls being in a vice said benn im in there with you you think you can trust the son of a bitch how the fuck do i know does anyone know erupted newton he came to me didnt blow any whistles to any authorities as far as you know cautioned benn that reassure you it sure as hell doesnt reassure me just making a point said newton wearily he didnt think hed slept at all the previous night and he was having problems now concentrating upon every point being made to him what did grant say he didnt believe it was like parnell said that it was a spur of the moment decision to analyse the samples just because they were there what are you going to tell the board what the hell can i tell them we screwed up parnell might just might have saved us saved the company we screwed up echoed benn although with emphasis im not going to dump on you russ how can i repeated newton you really sure were all right i got commitments dwight more commitments than i know what to do with know how to handle were going to be all right providing parnell stays all right you should call paris lets give saby another couple of hours another couple of hours thats all conceded benn i think whatever parnell does or might do depends on whether or not france has started distributing barry jackson went line by line through parnells sworn affidavit and still didnt speak after several moments finally he said sometimes lawyerclient confidentiality is a burden one were both having to bear said parnell you did the right thing swearing this statement reassured jackson you think dubette killed rebecca i think someone in dubette knows who did and why you going to tell the fbi that tomorrow without an iota of proof challenged parnell in return you going to tell them this asked the lawyer fluttering the affidavit does what was almost allowed to happen in france constitute a crime in this country jackson gave an empty laugh youre making a point i should have made you think i should tell them i think we first need to know whats happened in france one way it could be as serious as negligent homicide the other way its a responsible doublecheck by a responsible international pharmaceutical company that prevented a catastrophe what personal protection is that asked parnell nodding to the statement on the table between them none whatsoever if dubettes into murder and they know youve sworn it you know what a maze is demanded parnell rhetorically a lot of dead ends with only one way out i know what a maze is said jackson i do my best not to get into any i wish i could get out of this one said parnell he hadnt told the lawyer about the two occasions with beverley and decided now against doing so neither were important dangerous and last night hed decided there wouldnt be a third by the time he got back to mclean parnell calculated it was just after six in the evening in paris and hoped he was not too late annoyed for not saving the travelling time by making the intended call from his more conveniently close apartment he risked a further few minutes confirming with kathy richardson that thered been no contact from the vice president although russell benn had called to thank him for the cultures and wondered where he was and seemed surprised when shed said she didnt know parnell got the paris number from the dubette directory and dialled it himself his nolongeralwaysopen door securely closed against intrusion there was an uncertain moment before a woman answered from henri sabys office and a further worrying echoing gap after hed identified himself before a mans voice came on the line the english scarcely accented saby said at once it seems we have a lot to thank you for parnell hadnt realized how tensed hed been at the fear of calling too late in the day until he felt it easing away his excuse for making the call carefully prepared parnell said theres still some we need to look at i thought id just run through the list ive been given ive already done that with dwight it was a doublecheck that picked up the problem parnell hadnt expected the advantage of the frenchman knowing his name or how the danger had been isolated sure accepted saby he reverted to french and verbally ticked off with a curt oui each of the outstanding items parnell recited from russell benns list thats all there is nothing more asked parnell hed let the conversation run to gain the other mans confidence thats everything confirmed saby and all the production has been stopped when was the last time you talked with dwight not since this morning replied parnell honestly he hadnt spoken to you then i told him everything had been halted sabys english was so good that parnell detected the doubt in the mans voice what about distribution there was a hesitation from the other end its being recalled i told dwight that too parnell forced himself on not wanting his immediate alarm to be obvious how difficult is that going to be not easy but possible im a research scientist parnell seemingly apologized i dont know anything about marketing is there batch numbering some way you can be sure youve got everything back there are batch numbers allowed saby questioningly not a complete enough answer to the question parnell decided from which you can be sure of getting it all back ive discussed all this with dwight why not talk to him i will said parnell knowing that he didnt have to paris couldnt guarantee recovering medicine that could result in people children dying the additional stuff you want saby unexpectedly asked you want to use the box number rather than the normal delivery like before what the hell did that question mean yes risked parnell remembering the word from rebeccas conversations he added youll let me know the waybill number tell me direct i mean what about harry johnson what about the head of security wondered parnell in view of the sensitivity i think its best if you tell me i can involve harry from this end and he would parnell decided if he could find a way twentyfour there was a familiarity about being collected from washington circle by barry jackson and logging in at the fbi field office and not needing the stipulated escort to find his way to the two waiting agents with their oddly cloned dress code todays was muted brown check the waiting coffee was an innovation so hows it going asked jackson thats our problem admitted dingley its not weve interviewed everybody even alan smeldon the guy rebecca had the previous relationship with and so far weve got diddly squat weve even started to wonder if ms lang wasnt the victim of a crazy just picked at random she wasnt picked at random insisted parnell irritably her keys were taken her house searched i said we even started to wonder not that were going that route placated dingley which is why we wanted to talk to you again said benton you thought about anything more that might help us along absolutely nothing i was expecting you to tell me of some progress said parnell virtually the only subject of his conversation with jackson on their way to the field office had been france parnell had told the lawyer of his doubts about the tainted medicines being recovered although he had not told him about the box number or secret delivery or sabys reference to the dubette security chief because he couldnt see a connecting relevance jackson had advised against prematurely disclosing dubettes drug mistake arguing it could confuse rather than assist the investigation i told you we were just touching bases reminded benton like i said offered dingley weve gone back through ms langs life since before grade school we couldnt find a single person with whom shed ever had what youd call an argument which keeps bringing us back to dubette picked up benton and where we hoped you might help us further mr parnell weve got this feeling a feeling nothing else that there has to be some connection to ms langs workplace let me ask you something said dingley you familiar with anyone out at mclean who carries a knife maybe one of those little itty bitty clasp things that people sometimes use to pare their nails what exclaimed jackson seconds ahead of parnell saying the same thing something sharp like a knife repeated benton a chisel even i dont understand this questioning said jackson you mind if mr parnell answers us first said benton jackson moved to speak but before he could parnell said i suppose a knife might be the sort of thing a security guard or officer might carry something sharp might be part of a police cars equipment thats what we thought about security guards said dingley harry johnson told us he never carries a knife nor do any of his people as far as hes aware what about policecar equipment asked parnell we asked the two who took you into custody said benton they said no too you talking about my car how the paint was chipped off we told you what our forensic s people thought said benton and there was ms langs seat belt the seat belt you were always so sure she would fasten said benson what about it it was cut disclosed dingley forensics first impression was that it had snapped but after the second autopsy they looked again and changed their minds theyre saying now it was cut what about the second autopsy asked jackson he was looking intently between the two fbi men the medical examiner isnt sure ms lang sustained benton stopped coughed and resumed with what he thought betterchosen words suffered all her injuries when the car went over the edge you mean her broken neck demanded parnell bluntly we know someone went down after her into the canyon they had to to get the keys to her house are you saying she was still alive but that she was cut out and murdered thats the way the technical guys are putting it to us thats planned murder assassination a professional said jackson still intent which brings us back god knows how to the flight number and terrorism said dingley terrorists are professional assassins and youve traced rebeccas life back to before grade school reminded parnell you know shes never had the slightest connection whatsoever with or to terrorism and from your questioning of my mother and friends in england you know i dont either see our problem invited dingley youre forcing into the jigsaw pieces that dont fit said jackson were coming around to thinking that agreed benton which is the wrong piece its got to be the af flight number insisted parnell thats the reason were here youre here said dingley until we discover the relevance of that to everything else ms langs undoubted murder is a federal enquiry and people along the road at the j edgar hoover building are getting impatient as well as pissed off being told by the media what an inefficient jerkoff organization the bureau is there was something wrong about my arrest insisted parnell metro dc uniforms particularly couldnt find an egg in a hen house said benton you were a victim of bad policing theyd made their minds up persisted parnell they thought they had something being served up to them on a plate commendations and headlines all round sneered benton you had a lot of trouble obstruction guessed jackson smiling expectantly lets say they werent overly cooperative what about fingerprints jackson demanded unexpectedly did they go along with the elimination we didnt get a match said benton to his partners sharp look match to what pressed jackson dingley shrugged we got a half thumb print a right thumb from the flight number scrap of paper it wasnt ms langs didnt match the two metro dc guys either or you mr parnell we want it kept under wraps obviously you think it could be the person who killed her asked parnell we wont know what to think until we match it said benton judge wilson made some court orders reminded jackson sir queried dingley about civil suits and claims for wrongful arrest said the lawyer which you havent pursued said benton not yet if mr parnell chose to sue thered legally have to be full disclosure yes there would acknowledged dingley smiling now i think my client and i should talk about that dont you full legally required disclosure might be interesting said benton anything beyond what weve got would be interesting said dingley mr parnells in a kind of limbo until we get somewhere with this wouldnt you say parnell hadnt considered himself to be in any sort of limbo but supposed he was hed definitely have to speak to his mother tonight and reply to the letters thered been two more that morning one enclosing cuttings of the english media coverage of the case the extent had surprised him one article had quite wrongly identified him as the leading british research scientist in the genomemapping breakthrough he said if you all think this might break the logjam lets do it well discuss it cautioned jackson jackson began that discussion directly upon leaving the fbi field office building theyre good what frowned parnell those guys back there theyre good they got exactly what they wanted im needing some help said parnell as usual he thought ed pullinger the fbi counsel was in court remember he heard the judges orders the bureau are getting the closed door a civil suit might be the way to open it just a little it would certainly tighten the media screw on metro dc police department you mean that was a setup back there the whole meeting i think so even to the disclosure about the thumb print jesus from their point of view its a good move beverley abruptly came into parnells mind he said you warned me to be careful of police harassment as well as being a target for whoever killed beverley wont the risk of harassment increase if we sue jackson shook his head positively not even metro dc would dare itll act more as a protection i should have thought of it earlier but is it really likely to get the investigation any further forward we shant know that until we serve the writs and start demanding disclosure said jackson dwight newton had expected an inquisition but not that it would be led by grant nor that it would be so scathing with virtually no defence he tried to hide behind jargon talking of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase instead of hprt and mutations and the unpredictability of drug cocktails but there was sufficient knowledge among some of the board members not to be deflected and at one stage the whitehaired president told him to cut the scientific crap and explain the problem in words they would all understand newton tried too to shift the primary responsibility onto russell benn minimizing his function to that of a secondary check but was refused that escape by having to concede as he had earlier had to admit to edward c grant at one of their private encounters that if that had been his role then hed singularly failed to perform it the accusations and recriminations logically gave way to a slightly less hostile but even more commercially based debate upon the damage to public confidence as well as that to be expected from the regulatory authority that dubette would suffer from any leaks publicity or exposure which brought into the exchanges a renewed use of words like catastrophe and disaster and meltdown and kept the concentration upon newton he tried in a desperate snatch for recovery to stress parnells assurance of discretion to be confronted by two separate challenges from directors about the loyalty of the rest of the pharmacogenomics unit whod demonstrated his blatant scientific inefficiency which were the precise words that were used blatant scientific inefficiency it was not so much the final straw that broke the camels back but the final unendurable bruise from the misdirectedly wielded stick more loudly than he had intended newton said ok lets take a few things into consideration here i am youre not grant stopped him positively refusing any awkward defensive outburst a mistake was made mistakes do get made its the nature the sometimes inevitable result of the business were in its been isolated dealt with i do not recommend would argue as strongly as possible against any reprimand or censure he paused a man with the fifth ace in his hand this is in fact an unrecorded composition of the board and therefore restricted by regulations of which i am sure were all aware i repeat a mistake was made a series of mistakes were all of us fallible those mistakes have been corrected we are im sure i dont have to remind you meeting in unrecorded session to which all of us agreed earlier one of the regulatory restrictions is that decisions made during such discussions legally need to be confirmed by a recorded meeting of the board the records made available to an annual meeting or by a specially convened meeting of shareholders the pause was as timed as the words were rehearsed but that means said a voice each of you know the terms of reference of the boards composition the company restrictions i have just outlined my concern which i anticipated to be the concern of us all to preserve the company is to limit within corporate legality the sort of public exposure weve agreed during this discussion would lead to the total destruction of dubette newton was never to be sure that however briefly his mouth didnt visibly fall open in his incredulity at the piratical manoeuvre certainly the expression on at least three of the men around the table was of astonishment another began scrabbling through a document case newton presumed in a search for the company formation regulations i dont agree with this it cant possibly be legal said the man who had first protested everyone has a copy of our formation and incorporation documents said grant looking at the man still rummaging through his briefcase for those who havent ill specify the section im referring to its paragraphs four through seven but id draw your attention to paragraph nine those preceding sections four to seven can be superseded by a majority vote here and now for us to go on record or for a special shareholders meeting to be convened to commit commercial suicide like lemmings jumping off a cliff said the outspoken objector each of us around this table agreed the terms presumably upon the advice of our individual investment lawyers said grant i certainly did the searching man found what he was looking for consulted it and sat back in his chair shaking his head grant said i am not coercing this board into anything illegal merely reminding it of its operational parameters our research vice president dwight newton has acknowledged and apologized for his oversight and his error i propose that is how it remains a rectified matter restricted to a very limited number of people the alternative is in your hands as i have already set out how is this board going to look if it does become public knowledge demanded the man with the regulations still in his hand like a responsible body of responsible men operating as it is legally empowered to do to protect its shareholders interests and investments as well as reacting promptly to prevent any harmful effects from a mistaken batch issue said grant i invite a vote on the course i am proposing it was unanimous a buffet lunch was arranged to follow at least half the board left without eating anything those who remained picked and sampled the most token of token gestures what conversation there was was mumbled seriousfaced with a lot of headshaking newton ate nothing and drank club soda at his shoulder as the room thinned with tight perfunctory farewells grant told newton dont go not until weve talked where can i go asked newton nowhere said grant refusing the selfpity it was a further hour before they got yet again into the presidents office as soon as the door closed behind them newton said you hung me out to dry back there you deserved to be hung out to dry you fucked up there wasnt a member of the board me included who didnt want to sacrifice you what i did instead was save your ass yours with it fought back newton i didnt say anything about other meetings like this because there was nothing to say i told you all along everything had to be safe you didnt ensure that it was you still got a job be grateful what right had this manipulative neverguiltyofanything motherfucker to treat him with contempt newton asked himself what did you want me to stay on for parnell called saby direct asked about getting everything back saby thought parnell was on the inside somehow parnell knows about the boxnumber route he obviously got that from that damned woman you heard from saby direct how the hell else would i know what did you tell saby to do send the stuff as they discussed i couldnt do otherwise what else did saby tell him that it could be got back thats what saby told me with the taps lifted we dont know exactly what was said not any more we got too many loose ends parnell the loosest it never appeared to have occurred to anyone at the board meeting to thank parnell for what hed possibly prevented newton suddenly realized but then he accepted officially it had been an un official unrecorded meeting which he supposed meant any corporate gratitude was impossible you going to see parnell theres enough reason arrogant son of a bitch said grant not an arrogant son of a bitch mentally corrected newton someone who wasnt afraid of edward c grant and who hadnt been sucked into the imploding black hole of dubette inc are you he repeated have johnson set up some surveillance on him again lets find a weak spot grants modus operandi thought newton what if he hasnt got one everyones got a weak spot insisted the president newton wondered what edward c grants weak spot was then he thought it was time long after time that he tried to evolve some personal protection for himself but what talk time again announced barbara spacey sailing into parnells office on a gust of nicotine im busy thats good a lot of psychologists deny it but work is often a good stress reliever would you believe that ill believe anything you tell me im not asking you to go that far so how are you as i was when we met last time im fine how are you sleeping like a baby how do you occupy your spare time with the stressrelief of work you miss rebecca thats an offensive question of course i miss rebecca the woman appeared unperturbed the police getting anywhere its not a police investigation its the fbi the fbi getting anywhere there was no reaction to the correction they dont take me into their confidence lied parnell suddenly attentive to the questioning before she could ask something else he said this is the third time weve talked you normally interview staff this many times youre the first staff member to be involved in a murder a hell of an unusual murder at that i think you misdiagnosed my other assessments he goaded youre allowed to lodge an objection seek a secondary opinion even reminded the woman dont forget the freedom of information act no one can sneak any more didnt think it important enough you get many objections a few howd you score pretty good ive still got a job what happens to these assessments they go on your personnel file so who has access to that file personnel senior executives barbara spacey gestured towards the outside laboratory youve got the authority to see your guys assessments i didnt know youd made any i havent not yet about to start who else has access persisted parnell legal department security seems a lot of people suggested parnell dubettes a caring company i think you told me that already some people would say it was an inquisitive company is that what you think it wouldnt be difficult for me to think just that which i might judge to be paranoia do invited parnell are you familiar with a very famous book by an english author named george orwell about a control state its called nineteen eightyfour she finished for him yeah ive read it howd you diagnose that how about paranoia i thought it was about the danger of a control state i dont remember winston smith who tried to fight the system coming out of it all that well said the woman twentyfive richard parnell didnt set out upon a warnedagainst personal investigation although there was something about the last meeting with barbara spacey that stayed in his mind like a distracting noise for which he couldnt locate a source but there suddenly seemed to be a lot he found distracting although he fully understood his mothers concern her insistence upon such regular contact was intrusive and he found it irksome having to respond to letters from former vague acquaintances in england whod obviously got his washington address from closer genuinely concerned colleagues and written as if it were a membersclub obligation the most positive persistent distraction of all of course remained the discontinuity within his unit the lack of a single feasible experimental idea to further the influenza research had made the previous nights endofday discussion virtually pointless although hed thought sean satos suggestion of a combined discussion with russell benns unit worth pursuing until being told by benn that morning that his scientists didnt have anything to contribute either parnell was increasingly accepting ted lapiduss view that they werent ever going to find a treatment as objective logic rather than impatient defeatism although he hadnt yet openly admitted it it was the persistent nag of uncertainty from his meeting with the psychologist that prompted parnell to go to the personnel department in a part of the complex so remote he had to use the wall guides as he moved through connecting corridors he supposed it would have been a courtesy to tell wayne denny that he was coming but accessing his own personnel file without any positive reason for doing so scarcely justified bothering the department director he was greeted at the enquiry section quite separate from an openplan glassedoff office beyond by a blonde milkfed girl who clearly recognized him without needing to read his id tag hers identified her as sally kline adopting the american informality he called her sally she called him professor with have a good day glibness she assured him retrieving his file wouldnt be a problem which it obviously wasnt because she returned from a side room with a manila folder in minutes directing him to one of the several reading tables she asked if he wanted coffee parnell thanked her but refused the folder was thicker than hed expected and far more detailed all his references had been taken up and there were copies of every scientific publication paper he could remember submitting surprisingly the beginning of what became intense even unsettling curiosity there were confirming copies of all his academic testimonials school as well as college duplicating every one hed disclosed on his original application a substantial reason for the files thickness were cuttings of what parnell judged to be every newspaper account he could remember and some he couldnt of his work on the international genome project including all the interviews hed given after his participation became public there was also at least a quarter of an inch taken up by media accounts of rebecca langs murder the inexplicable terrorism connection his initial arrest and subsequent release several he saw were even from british newspapers from which he was able to see how widespread the coverage had been in england and better appreciate his mothers concern beyond the printed text were a selection of photographs of him at the time of his arrest and afterwards on the court steps they were on top of an assortment of other prints two of him gowned and mortarboarded at graduation ceremonies and three showing him in rowing strip at college events barbara spaceys first and second assessments her third yet to come were attached to his itemized personal records the second so specific that it ran to two single spaced a pages parnells surprise had grown into astonishment by the time he finished the dossier it contained he calculated more information than he knew about himself certainly things he had totally forgotten about himself and more much more than he believed any employer no matter how caring to use barbara spaceys justifying word would or should need his remark to barbara spacey about nineteen eightyfour was very apposite parnells mind jumped the fbi had traced rebecca back to grade school according to howard dingley had they had access to her dubette file the answer should be obvious but so very little of what he knew about rebeccas murder investigation seemed obvious that it was definitely worth mentioning to the two agents he ached from the concentration with which hed read all about himself realizing for the first time that hed been hunched over the table for forty minutes sally kline responded at once to the summons bell through the glass behind her parnell saw several obviously alerted people looking at him in the smaller office everything ok she asked fine i filled out all thats necessary for you she said all you need to do is sign your access im sorry frowned parnell the log explained the girl every file has an individual log recording the date and the arrival and departure times of anyone reading it i filled in everything for you all you need to do is add your signature to agree my figures the document was upside down on the counter before him but he could see there were three entries above his own name thats whos read it before me yes confirmed the girl parnell accepted the offered pen tensed for the users log to be reversed towards him he instantly registered the names barbara spacey harry johnson and dwight newton each was timed and dated the security chief was listed ahead of the vice president as having spent fifty minutes with the dossier starting at ten past five in the evening four days before rebeccas death im sorry he said ive just remembered something could i just quickly check what ive forgotten it wont take a minute if its only a minute said sally ive already written down your handback time a minute pledged parnell which was all it needed to find his itemized personal records and confirm that the number of his toyota was dutifully recorded three days before the sunday when rebecca was killed would have been the thursday hed found his car damage the car whose make and number johnson had told the fbi he hadnt known when he got back to his unit there was a message from henri saby in paris that the missing samples had been despatched as arranged with the waybill number parnell telephoned harry johnson first on the internal system and immediately afterwards barry jackson on an external line the lawyer said clients always had to pay for lunch i should have been told parnell knew about the boxnumber facility complained harry johnson i didnt know myself until yesterday said newton determined to get as much as he could from the abruptly demanded meeting with the security chief how much does he know the president isnt sure said newton taking the first step to distance himself as much as possible from edward c grant johnson shook his head i dont understand this ive just had a call from parnell asking me to collect some outstanding samples from paris that would be arriving the boxnumber route those were his exact words the boxnumber route how does he know there is such a system its supposed to be restricted youre going to have to ask him i guess said newton johnson looked at him suspiciously youve specifically spoken to the president about this in new york yesterday confirmed newton so what did he say insisted the security chief impatiently you normally deal direct with grant dont you challenged newton i wanted guidance this time before i did that might be a good idea in the future you and i talking to each other suggested newton could he make an ally an informant of this man why asked johnson the tone openly suspicious now it was me he spoke to about parnells call to paris and he told me that it should be handled as it normally is i dont know why he didnt bother to call you as well saby didnt call me which was the arrangement i understood agreed johnson wed both avoid being left out of decisions if we talked to each other things are too uncertain to be left out maybe youre right accepted johnson so im to collect it as parnells asked me to yes who do i give it to parnell not you or russell benn parnell repeated the research director and youre to reimpose the surveillance on parnell new york tell you that too yes johnson stared challengingly at newton do dubette think they can afford to cut me out of the loop i dont know what that means harry hed sown more doubt than hed imagined possible decided newton ill talk to new york said the security chief intending it to sound like a threat i dont know what your direct contact is all about said newton but i definitely think you should get on to new york but itll still be an idea for us to talk about it too and for you to let me know what happens when you deliver the french stuff to parnell how much was he protectively going to learn from this man wondered newton parnell was disappointed at barry jacksons calm reaction the lawyer continued to pick at his caesar salad and sip at the mineral water hed chosen in preference to parnells wine and when parnell finished recounting his morning discoveries in dubettes personnel department said have you spoken with beverley beverley whats she got to do with what ive just told you nothing my misunderstanding forget it barry havent you heard anything ive said every word so why are you asking about beverley professional indiscretion i said forget it parnell didnt respond for several moments totally confused so what have i just told you something intriguing intriguing enough to tell dingley and benton definitely decided the lawyer but not yet not before we serve the wrongfularrest writs upon bellamy and montgomery which well do within the next twentyfour hours as well now as summoning johnson as a material witness locking him into the frame incidentally im setting the claim against metro dc police department at ten million dollars what demanded parnell not immediately understanding its a civil case were claiming damages for loss of reputation and character youre a publicly known guy with a reputation and character to protect we wont get anything like that of course but itll concentrate their minds and stop any intimidation move against you you ok with that figure im not interested in any figure said parnell still curious at jacksons reference to beverley jackson grinned at him you might be when you get my final bill parnell didnt smile back what ive told you fits in with what dingley and benton said about rebeccas death having something to do with her workplace doesnt it no refused jackson at once it gives them a very good reason to talk to harry johnson again thats all he lied about not knowing what car i drove the fucking numbers in a file he read the very same night my car was vandalized in the car park theres proof he read your personnel file not that he noted your car make and number thats playing with words thats what the law is playing with words youve got to make those words work in your favour what about johnsons involvement knowledge of the french situation the sideways route that made rebecca so damned curious exactly what it is damned curious agreed jackson which is what ill get him to explain in a lot more detail in a court on oath thats where we can have him twisting in the wind parnell pushed aside his pastrami sandwich half of it uneaten itll make public what the french division with washingtons approval were preparing to do did do if its not all recalled wont it conceivably destroy the company now jackson finished eating dont get fainthearted after what almost happened to you after what happened to rebecca and could have happened to god knows how many people kids in africa if you hadnt picked up on it im not getting fainthearted denied parnell what then its difficult sometimes like now fully to accept what the outcome of it all could be to believe that its real and that im part of it not part of it corrected jackson central to it i dont understand why you asked about beverley i told you i misunderstood what did you misunderstand what would you say if i told you it was covered by client confidentiality id say bullshit should he tell the lawyer about the two utterly meaningless occasions its covered by client confidentiality recited jackson bullshit said parnell but nothing more barry jackson had compromised driving part of the way out to mclean so parnell was back at the dubette complex by two oclock only deke pulbrow and mark easton were in the department pulbrow said everyone else is at lunch except ted hes got a dental appointment getting to be like a regular workplace nothing to do lots of time in which to do it there was a note on his desk from kathy richardson who also wasnt in her office that harry johnson wanted to see him the security chief answered his own phone and said hed collected the french shipment and did parnell want him to bring it over parnell said hed appreciate it his mind at that moment more occupied by a further distraction as well as disappointment at the quickness with which antipathy appeared to have permeated the unit harry johnson came into the laboratory with a package about the size of a twelvebottle wine case easily under one arm encompassing the inactivity of the office with the look to locate parnells office your guys go in for long lunches johnson commented as he entered the smaller room and long mornings and even longer afternoons right into the evening said parnell heres your stuff safe and sound announced johnson all right here on the desk fine said parnell the waybill number attached to it the box number which he still didnt know should show on it i signed in your name said johnson thats irregular isnt it thought it was easier more convenient im a foreigner here working by permission im sure as hell not going to contravene postal regulations give it to me to countersign johnson hesitated before taking the folded document from his uniform breast pocket the box number was at mcleans main post office your signatures not on the top copy thats the record of delivery ill keep this one as proof that it was delivered to me johnson shook his head in immediate bureaucratic refusal its got to go in with all the other proper records its regulations at that moment parnell saw kathy richardson returning to her office and gestured before she had time to sit down when she entered he asked make me a copy of that will you to johnson he said there thatll satisfy everyone wont it i guess said the security head tightly the man was redfaced from what parnell guessed he saw as and parnell himself regarded as the stupidity of the exchange but the delay allowed the idea to form the french parcel was heavily bound in protective adhesive tape every open edge covered parnell said all weve got to do now is get into it you got a knife harry sure said the security man taking the switchblade familiarly from his right rear pocket and snapping it open in the same movement parnells first impulse was immediately to call jackson with the disclosure of the security heads further lie to the fbi investigators about never carrying a knife but he held back cautioned by his earlier conversation about proof and assumptions instead he personally unpacked the cutopen box sorted the french samples and assembled the new and old formulae on his personal work space it put his back to the doors and he was unaware of beverley jacksons arrival until she spoke startling him id like to talk to you alone she declared he ushered her back into his office following concerned the approach had something to do with the atmosphere in the department whats the problem ive been told i have to take a psychological test i consider it an intrusion into my civil rights that it even contravenes the constitution barry says its an argument that could be made im going to refuse but i wanted you to know first i dont want to upset anything here do you object to my refusing of course i dont why are you smiling you talked to barry today i just told you i had i had lunch with him he obviously thought it was about this when he realized it wasnt he talked of client confidentiality i thought youd told him about the couple of times wed been together and was worried you might be at risk by association beverley smiled back i did tell him about it he said he hoped id enjoyed it and to be careful and i told him i would be and i dont give a damn about any risk by association twentysix the hopedagainst but expected hprt mutations had begun in the newly delivered french products within the predicted twohour timeframe in which it had registered in all parnells earlier experiments and by the following early morning when parnell arrived back at mclean had become as overwhelming as before he isolated all the cultures to be doubly verified by dwight newton and russell benn and because kathy richardson wasnt due for another two hours he once more wrote his own emailed memoranda to both inviting their comparison he sent a separate email warning the vice president of the impending writs upon the two arresting metro dc policemen although saying nothing about involving harry johnson in the suit as a material witness parnell worked knowing in a putaside part of his mind that he was filling the time as hed tried to occupy the previous evening by going long overdue to giorgios trattoria in georgetown to avoid trying to acknowledge the alltooobvious inference from beverley jacksons remark shed immediately retreated discomfited after saying it and hed tried to help by ignoring it but it had hung between them like a reflecting twosided mirror and for the first time since the creation of the unit shed left early long before five the one telephone call the previous night had been from his mother providing the opportunity to warn her of the inevitable and renewed publicity of the civil writs but not from beverley which hed expected throughout the entire evening even at giorgios on what he supposed was a guiltinspired visit hed mentally wrestled with the idea of calling beverley but hadnt not knowing what to say which he still didnt there were already too many mazes and culdesacs and dead ends to contemplate this further complication more altogether too much more than a complication it had only been weeks recollectable days since rebecca had been murdered it was inconceivable that he respond which most guiltily of all he wanted to do to beverleys clear innuendo if not open invitation with the time difference between the united states and europe to his advantage and still wanting to fill that time parnell called henri saby before eight am american time to tell the french chief executive of the complete and conclusive findings which were initially received in silence at last the frenchman said are you going to experiment to isolate the rogue drug in the cocktail no said parnell at once if im asked which i havent yet been i am going to recommend the abandonment of the entire idea its too unstable to be safe he paused in fact im not going to wait to be asked i am going to recommend it anyway a lot of thought and effort was put into this thought and effort that the president and parent board appreciated until it turned out as it did rejected parnell ive told you what my recommendation is going to be whether its accepted or not isnt up to me hed make sure to find out if it was though no agreed saby heavily its not up to you what about the recall demanded parnell has every single thing been traced and recovered yes said the frenchman too quick decided parnell the man had been waiting tensed for the question every single thing i just told you it has been people children will die if it hasnt been ive just told you it has insisted saby then dubette and your subsidiary has nothing to worry about said parnell you must be relieved thank you for what youve done said saby lets hope its enough said parnell unconvinced id appreciate our keeping in touch in case anything comes up if anything comes up and i must admit i dont quite understand what that phrase means precisely ill keep in touch through mr newton your superior said the other man officiously you do that encouraged parnell refusing the condescension ill memo him today that youve positively guaranteed that everything has successfully been recovered that there is no danger whatsoever to dubette but to expect immediately to hear from you if there are any further problems you havent anticipated that should cover it shouldnt it your success has made you extremely confident mr parnell on the contrary monsieur saby what i discovered made me extremely concerned as i imagine it did you and your research staff parnell sent his third email of the morning to newton setting out the conversation with henri saby and his recommendation that the proposal be abandoned and not pursued to eliminate the mutationcausing element in the cocktail parnell paused in midcomposition unsure whether to include his suspicion that paris hadnt recovered everything but decided against what amounted to calling the french chief executive a liar beverley jackson was the last to arrive that morning frowning at the already assembled group but directly and without embarrassment meeting parnells look not childishly trying to avoid it there were going to be some operating changes parnell announced anxious to correct the drift hed detected within the unit he told them he considered it pointless involving everyone in a stalled research programme he wanted to concentrate the influenza search with lapidus pulbrow and beverley freeing up the others for work upon which they had been engaged before being given the specific assignment if lapiduss team made any promising advances or there was progress from russell benns division it could revert to being a fullunit project you should know too that the additional french stuff mutated like all the rest ive recommended to newton that the entire development be abandoned if it ever should have been tried in the first place said lapidus if it ever should have been tried in the first place echoed parnell in agreement anyone got any problems with the new routine fine by me said sato be good to get back to something practical do you want to be the liaison with benns people asked lapidus makes more sense for you to do it as team leader doesnt it suggested parnell i think so accepted lapidus ill make a call and get myself known which group do you plan to be part of something else you should know offered parnell still anxious to reestablish the earlier cohesion between them writs for my wrongful arrest are being served today on the dc police who arrested me therell be publicity how much i dont know but ill be occupied elsewhere from time to time it was a remark that would return to mock him what the hell do you think youre doing demanded dwight newton his voice barely controlled ive sent you three emails this morning dwight reminded parnell which what are you asking me about the similarly highpitched summons had come within thirty minutes of his return to his office from what he hoped to have been a restoration of the nearcamaraderie of their early days you know damned well what im asking you insisted newton striving to recover although the words were still strained suing metro dc police thats what im talking about stirring it all up again the judge allowed me that course of action he had expected internal reaction but not this initial level of something close to hysteria something else which might be indicative although he wasnt sure of what you know whats going to happen just when things were calming down dwight it hasnt anything to do with dubette its to do with me and a washington dc police department my civil right i was wrongfully arrested and charged without any proper investigation and ive every justification and legal invitation for doing what im doing and every justification and legal invitation to do this demanded the thin man waving a sheaf of lengthy legal papers the discarded envelope for which was teetering on the edge of the mans desk i dont know what that is said parnell a witness summons thats what it is im being legally required to appear in court for your damned action which meant parnell reckoned that harry johnson would have received the same warning notice he hadnt expected it to be like this i didnt know that you were going to be called but i did tell you about the writs earlier in one of this mornings emails and you were there at my arrest saw how it all happened reminded parnell what about the other email you sent continued newton spiders leg fingers drumming on the table in front of him dubette could be destroyed if anything else leaks out why should it how can it demanded parnell wishing there was a recording being made of this exchange france hasnt got anything to do with my arrest or rebeccas murder or suspicions of terrorism has it dwight what sort of question is that one you prompted me to ask by what you said jacksons cliche wormed into parnells mind how quickly for what reason would newton twist in the wind of crossexamination in a witness box youve seen from my email that i spoke to saby you tell him about the continuing mutation of course and ive kept everything for you to examine ill have russell benn duplicate as well said newton ive recommended that everything be abandoned said parnell i read your email insisted newton stiffly will it be scrapped persisted parnell ive got to talk to people avoided newton suddenly the words bursting from him as they came into his mind the man said this is a total mess a mess of your causing dwight i dont properly understand why youre so overwrought of course dubette will come into focus again because of the circumstances but the case is between me and a police department dubette are on the periphery im being called protested newton again as a formality improvised parnell i guess everyone who was in showcrosss office that morning will be summoned theyll have to be you talked this through with jackson beverleys exhusband of course i talked it through with barry jackson my attorney qualified parnell it was obvious newton would know of the former husbandandwife relationship but parnell hadnt liked the phrasing of the question you should have talked it through with me with peter baldwin as well too many immediate responses crowded in upon parnell have you told baldwin would jackson have enjoined the company counsel along with everyone else i wanted to talk to you first understand whats happening why should i have talked to you and baldwin courtesy said newton shortly it was courteous that i told you this morning before the issuing of the writs and before you received the witness summons your association with dubette hasnt been a good one has it suddenly demanded the vice president no agreed parnell although i would have thought there was one particular association of which dubette would be profoundly and commercially grateful and im disgusted by the other inference possible from that question newton flushed im sorry im im sorry you got something else something you havent said yet that you want to talk to me about dwight no said the other man sharply what do you mean i dont know what i mean admitted parnell theres been a lot of this conversation that im not sure ive understood what youve meant either dubette cant withstand being this constant focus of attention protested the research vice president i couldnt withstand the prospect of wrongly being accused and maybe even jailed for murder said parnell i guess that gives us something in common his required copy of barbara spaceys third psychological assessment was waiting for parnell when he got back to his office the overconfidence verging upon aggression that shed noted in her first examination had been evident which she interpreted to be his recovering from the trauma of his recent experiences he had been more questioning about the need for such assessments than during either of their two previous encounters referring to a wellknown english novel involving policestate control and even brainwashing shed assessed that as a restoration of his earlier selfconfidence she hadnt used the word paranoia which parnell wouldnt have protested at if she had unwilling to draw any attention to the personnel files that he intended disclosing to the fbi investigators it was midmorning when barry jackson came on the line everythings served the lawyer announced i know ive already had a complaint session with newton he should have taken counsels advice it could be argued he shouldnt have done that you should have warned me too late now theres something i want to talk to you about theres a lot i want to talk to you about ive scheduled a press conference for this afternoon you should have warned me about that too for christs sake thats what im doing now you can make it cant you dubette cant stop you youve got the legal justification and a judges virtual guidance it would still have been polite to have told newton that there was going to be a press conference you tell him said jackson with a hint of exasperation hes got all the time in the world to round up as many lawyers as he wants to attend if they think theres a need theyll think theres a need predicted parnell ill break the inviolable rule and buy lunch but on one condition whats the condition today you drink water not wine very biblical you didnt know i could walk on water id hoped you could twentyseven barry jackson arranged the conference in a midtown hotel and chose the restaurant to which beverley had taken him on their first outing which tightened parnells discomfort it increased further when jackson remarked that it was one of beverleys favourites and parnell decided to confront his difficulty he said i know jackson smiled nodding so do i she told me youd been out together although not that she brought you here the first time quickly admitted parnell its only been twice and i want the lawyers hands came up like forbidding shutters i dont want any explanations for why you and beverley saw each other i told you were good friends with separate lives to pursue as we want as we choose you and i will never have a personal problem about you and beverley jackson let a heavy moment settle but theres a reality to talk through your fiancee was murdered you almost got railroaded youve got the sympathy vote joe ordinary except that youre not that ordinary who got caught up in a situation beyond his control but today we might just might jackson narrowed his forefinger against his thumb manage to shake a few trees eventually to bring down a few forbidden apples we got the fbi waiting with their baskets outstretched you and beverley are grownup consenting adults responsible for everything you choose to do and whatever you guys choose to do is entirely your business im the last one to sit in judgement but others would and are being invited to be judges and juries and theres the media before whom a feast is being laid out with you with the apple in your mouth if there is the faintest whisper that so very soon after the death of your young fiancee youre involved with another woman you lose your sympathy vote so fast therell be scorch marks on the ground and quite irrespective of however much convincing law i can argue and i can argue a hell of a lot i need totally innocent railroaded joe ordinary next to me in every court and in every witness box you in step with me and with what im saying its a pretty effective and convincing speech said parnell sipping the insistedupon mineral water but wishing it were wine its meant to be i spent almost as much time rehearsing it as i did preparing for this afternoons conference theres nothing between beverley and me insisted parnell you missed the point accused jackson its nothing to do with whether or not you and beverley are into a relationship which i know youre not because beverley told me you werent and she and i only ever lied to each other once and havent done since its public perception i do know do hear what youre saying assured parnell it isnt a problem because it isnt a problem a situation that exists what had jackson meant about he and beverley only ever having lied to each other once im glad thats cleared said jackson so am i said parnell meaning it hows your steak i only ordered a salad when it was your treat remember the steaks great and theres still your bill to come with other things said jackson seriously the brief respite over i told beverley to talk to you about refusing a psychological assessment she did i told her id back her a flicker of doubt bubbled up in his mind why did you take the assessment asked the lawyer directly it didnt seem important enough to refuse said parnell being asked to undergo it was written into my contract you still feel that its unimportant now parnell shrugged im english not american so im not protected by your constitution its difficult now to know whats important and what isnt but i think ive discovered something that is what demanded the lawyer at once parnell recounted the arrival of the remaining french samples and harry johnsons easy production of the flick knife and said which he lied about to dingley and benton doesnt make him guilty of anything but that qualified jackson once more i think its interesting and that dingley will find it interesting too lets keep it until we get this over with cautioned jackson you ready for this afternoon how the hell do i know ill take all the questions insisted jackson decide those you can answer and those you cant we dont want to risk a contempt of court why hold a press conference at all then to impose pressure thats the object of this exercise remember did you tell newton of course by email and when i did see him he was only just holding on there were times when he was practically hysterical particularly about france becoming public its enough to become hysterical about it shouldnt come out publicly through what were doing should it asked parnell i dont see how it impacts said jackson shrugging again but who the hell knows youre talking of destroying dubette and youre talking like a terrified pisspants employee frightened of losing his job you forgotten being promised the joys of communal buggery and oral sex english boy youre confusing the two protested parnell and thats what i dont want to do confuse the two why not demanded jackson aggressively you got any good reason to be concerned about dubette and its stockmarket valuation a company prepared to put a product on to a market where but for the fluke of your involving yourself it would have killed god knows how many people probably without it ever becoming known if what they tried to market through france becomes public which im not intending it to unless it simply happens that way then tough shit for dubette you got some convoluted conscience about it with the money im going to get you awarded build a hospital in africa where the kids who would have died can be properly treated with proper drugs i thought the money you were going to get me was to pay your bill said parnell with attempted cynicism that didnt work depending on how successful i am there might be a little left over said the lawyer get hardass dick everyone else is and there are more of them than there are of you they entered the hotel through a side entrance avoiding the initial camera ambush but it was duplicated inside lights and lenses directly in front of the dais and all around the edges of the cavernous room a hedge of microphones had already been built on the waiting table every seat in the room was occupied parnell immediately isolated peter baldwin gerry fletcher the initially engaged trial lawyer was beside him two other men parnell didnt know were clearly part of the dubette group all in the front row also in the front row although quite separate from the lawyers was edwin pullinger the bureau attorney with howard dingley and david benton the room was extremely noisy and questions began to be shouted the moment they entered adding to the din the sudden flood of television lights and camera flashes made it difficult at first to see beyond the first four or five rows jackson flapped his hands up and down in a quietening gesture and eventually the row subsided although not completely he had convened the conference to announce a civil suit against metro dc police department and two of its officers jackson announced a claim was being made for ten million dollars for the inconvenience humiliation and damage to the professional reputation of his client richard parnell a renowned international scientist employed by dubette inc mr parnell had been wrongfully and very publicly arrested on insufficient and inadequate evidence following what subsequently proved to be the murder of his fiancee rebecca lang because of some unusual circumstances that murder was currently being investigated by the federal bureau of investigation his client would take questions but respond under advisement it was initially impossible to distinguish one question from another and again jackson had to wave for quiet changing the gesture when the noise lessened to indicate a woman near the front whats your explanation for ms lang having a terroristassociated flight number in her possession asked the woman jackson nodded his agreement to an answer and parnell said i dont have one rebecca was not a political person nor associated or connected in any way with terrorism or terrorist organizations i understand that to be the findings of the fbi after exhaustive enquiries what about you called someone deeper into the hall jackson shook his head but parnell said i am completely apolitical i have never had any links with any radical organization let alone one that could be described as terrorist thats also been established by the fbi did metro dc police know of the terrorist flight number when they arrested you called someone else the room was quiet now and this time jackson took the question before parnell could speak the lawyer said what the metro dc officers did or did not know at the time of my clients arrest will obviously form a substantial part of the claim my client is making against the department just as obviously i am not able to disclose any part of that at this stage although i can say that it will be a most rigorously pursued aspect of the eventual hearing as his lawyer talked parnell saw that three men and a woman separating the dubette group from the fbi officers were making notes on yellow legal pads and wondered if they were policedepartment attorneys jackson intervened on several more occasions refusing to let parnell answer whether he had been subjected to any physical or verbal abuse whether he had resisted arrest or if his position at dubette had been affected by his detention parnell listened intently aware that with every response jackson was conveying the impression that there were a lot of accusations to be levelled against peter bellamy and helen montgomery hammering the threat home in a reply to a further question jackson said it has not been confirmed to me that the two officers who are named in this action have been suspended as you suggest but i would have been surprised had they not been the evidence i already possess and intend producing during the case will bring metro dc police into considerable disrepute there are others not directly named on the writs whose conduct will also be shown to be highly questionable if not verging on criminal collusion that reply produced a flurry of demands for explanation all of which jackson refused choosing an intervening question from a woman journalist about parnell and rebeccas relationship in order to hand over to parnell parnell did so haltingly badly unprepared it was inexplicable that hed allowed rebecca to drive home alone to bethesda it was a mistake hed regret for the rest of his life no definite date had been decided upon for the wedding there was evidence parnells reply brought a twitch from jackson the lawyer tensed to intervene although he didnt against rebecca being a chosenbychance victim of a random attack he was appalled at rebeccas killer or killers escaping because of metro dcs incompetence jackson leaned forward again ready but that was something to be explored at the impending civil court hearing he had every confidence in the fbi bringing a successful criminal prosecution jackson rejected every request for onetoone television interviews including those from the three major american networks as well as six from england france and germany and from eight american and foreign radio stations jackson had taken a suite as well as reserving the conference room there was wine and alcohol as well as coffee waiting for them when they got there now you can have a glass of wine jackson announced whos this for asked parnell you did well damned well praised the lawyer familiarly avoiding the question im not sure what we achieved i think we achieved everything and more we set out to contradicted jackson we had to make some cracks into the wall facing the fbi which we did and then some theres guys out there thinking hard about personal survival or escape or both which edwin pullinger virtually repeated minutes later when he arrived with dingley and benton answering parnells earlier unanswered question about the reason for the suite thank you added the fbi attorney we made some worried people a lot more worried and theres no reason to stop jackson said to parnell now tell them the other intriguing things youve come across parnell channelhopped watching primetime coverage of the conference surprised at the memory blank he had over quite a number of the questions his general recollection was of uncertainty nervousness even but it wasnt evident on the screen and he was grateful he decided against eating again that day but considered walking along to giorgios or maybe another georgetown bar for a drink but decided against that too he was depressed that nothing had been produced by his division he paraded all the balancing arguments in his mind that it had only been months not years and that research took years not months but it didnt lift the disappointment hed become accustomed to success too expectant perhaps after his involvement in the genome project but that had taken years he reminded himself engaged dozens hundreds even of scientists on an international level his involvement coming luckily at the end when so much mapping had already been achieved and not at the beginning with every twist of the double helix to unravel but everything was overshadowed totally overwhelmed in fact by rebeccas murder the unexplained terroristflight alert and now this civil claim that he abruptly realized had been virtually thrust upon him and which he wouldnt have considered but for the hope of it moving on the fbi investigation what if it didnt what if the murder enquiry remained stalled months running into years like research ran from months into years would it anchor him to dubette there was an insidious big brother ambience about everything at mclean with its spidersweb imagery and inchesthick personal files and intrusive psychology and silent empty faces at watchful windows the entry bell jarred into the apartment startling him and sounded again before he reached the receiver its me announced beverley jackson from the entrance lobby you didnt phone no spur of the moment detour on my way home something come up id like to she said twisting his question or are we going to have a conversation like this parnell pressed the downstairs release and opened his own front door for the arrival of the elevator when beverley emerged she was carrying her briefcase from which parnell knew that she really had been on her way home he said i didnt expect you no she said tossing her coat and case on to a chair slumping into another theres wine maybe a small one something come up he repeated as he poured for both of them beverley said your health and raised her glass parnell raised his in return there wasnt the difficulty hed expected from their next being alone together he didnt believe he should feel as glad as he was that they were together alone again i told personnel i wouldnt undergo the psychological assessment declared beverley wayne denny wants to talk to me about it deke pulbrow doesnt want to take an assessment either parnell shrugged you know how i feel about it youll support deke too its hardly likely id back you and not deke is it i think dekes worried a refusal might go against him at dubette i thought barry told you there was a legal right to refuse it was a kneejerk he needs to check to be sure said the lawyers former wife im going to ask him to make sure would the extent and intrusiveness hed discovered in the personnel files help their objections wondered parnell he wouldnt say anything now but hed remind jackson if it became a problem for either of them you sure its just deke whos worried i told you my only concern and i told you i wasnt worried about it a separation of silence came down between them hurrying to fill it beverley said youre becoming quite the star television performer not from choice said parnell what are you going to do with ten million dollars pay your exhusbands bill said parnell glad of the wellrehearsed joke we had lunch at your favourite midtown restaurant today i told him wed eaten there who paid he did itll go on your bill i told you he knew not about the restaurant but that wed been out a couple of times it was best they confront it parnell supposed he said youd only ever lied to each other once thats offlimits she refused instantly ok accepted parnell just as quickly we talked about it you and i being seen together he said it wouldnt play well if it became public talked about losing the sympathy vote beverley let more silence build up but with a purpose looking very directly at him she said are we going to risk being seen together i feel a total shit parnell confessed needing to purge himself raising his hand to just beneath his chin ive got guilt up to here you and me both she said what are we going to do about it i dont know said parnell another admission he didnt like making i dont want to jeopardize anything cause any embarrassment or disrespect to rebecca you and me both echoed parnell although i dont actually give a damn about any tenmilliondollar court case you tell me you dont care about ten million bucks ill try to believe you but it wont be easy she was trying hard parnell acknowledged he said were avoiding the question lets take everything very slowly suggested beverley were talking like people with a secret and theres nothing to be secretive about at the moment its no more than we like being with each other and seem to understand each others jokes although we could possibly do with more of those if there was more to laugh about said parnell you like big band glen miller music i could find out theres a concert at the kennedy centre at the weekend ill get tickets i already got them you always this forthright so much for excuses about spurofthemoment detours and his undertaking and understanding with barry jackson not always i figured you already had a lot to do you want more wine beverley shook her head rising from the chair im driving and im going now like i said everything nice and slow the duty private investigator from the agency hired cash in advance under a false name and using an equally anonymous cutout procedure let two cars come comfortably between him and beverley jackson for the short ride to dupont circle the light had been bad but the man was sure hed managed at least two identifiable photographs of her leaving parnells apartment building when parnell got to mclean the following day there was a waiting memorandum that the halfyearly seminar had without any given reason been postponed until after the forthcoming annual stockholders meeting it was to be the first of several memos he received that day twentyeight overnight the pendulum swung and parnells day began with the mountains seeming higher and the oceans wider richard parnells unsettling disappointment in himself was compounded by what hed so easily agreed with beverley the previous evening which scarcely made sense because he wasnt in any way disappointed or depressed by the thought of being with her the coming weekend he wanted very much to be with her and that wish outweighed all the rest of the conflicting doubts like guilt and concern at their being seen together or at his being accused of hypocrisy or whatever the accusation might be if the outing or any that hopefully followed became public in fact the biggest contradiction of all for someone with so many conflicting emotional confusions was that for the first time for a very long time he felt remarkably happy by the time he arrived at mclean and that had everything to do with the idea that had come to him after beverley left a thought that had so excited him hed even considered calling her needing someone with whom to talk about it he hadnt though because it would have appeared too much like an excuse and by then he hadnt rationalized his uncertainties as he believed he had finally on his way to north virginia the following day ted lapidus was the first to arrive after parnell and told him at once that the previous days meeting with russell benn hadnt shown any chemical research progress adding that his impression had been that benns unit were expecting a lead from pharmacogenomics which from the way its going so far theyll be lucky to get remarked the dolefully moustached greek scientist lets talk when everyone else arrives suggested parnell ive had a thought beverley was once more the last although it was still only just past eight she smiled and said hi when the greek geneticist led his group into parnells instantly overcrowded office parnell said ive been thinking about approaches so far weve been trying to follow how the flu virus attaches itself and enters a host cell like the spiky little bastard of right thats the a b c d system confirmed lapidus why dont we try d c b a proposed parnell offer up a host target molecule coloured so well be able to trace which if any get hit you get the idea from the colorants the french introduced seized pulbrow at once as a matter of fact i did admitted parnell this time the mutation if it occurs will be beneficial not the other way around i cant understand why the method didnt occur to me earlier or any of us accepted lapidus doubtfully its worth trying if going backwards gets us forwards then lets try it said beverley its the only idea in town itll be a slow process of elimination warned deke pulbrow it was always going to be that parnell pointed out but it doesnt necessarily have to be that slow influenza is basically respiratory that narrows our genetic field by a few thousand said beverley well need more samples and a lot more mice said lapidus get as many samples as you need from tokyo said parnell weve got enough to start already said beverley enthusiastically kathys the mouse mother then start urged parnell pulbrow hesitated as they began filing out and parnell said beverley told me why not close the door pulbrow did so but stayed by it i dont want to cause trouble as far as im concerned its entirely down to you whether you undergo the assessment or not im certainly not going to put any pressure on you i dont see how i could or why i should you think i should have it the man wanted someone to make the decision for him guessed parnell he said i think you should decide yourself what you want to do and then do it ive talked around this seems to be a pretty structured authoritative organization the organization might be this unit certainly isnt said parnell no ones holding a gun to your head deke you took it i thought it was a waste of time still do for that matter i couldnt then be bothered to refuse then questioned the other man i think i might tell her to forget it next time if indeed there is a next time her the psychologist is a woman kind of an earth mother ill think some more about it said pulbrow uncertainly you do that encouraged parnell looking up at kathy richardsons entry youre high on dwights demand list said the secretary written confirmation after the telephone call why the duplication wondered parnell the truckers stop about ten miles into new jersey beyond the hudson tunnel had been designated by edward c grant who had been waiting when harry johnson arrived the untasted coffee like a totem before him the menu pushed to one side johnson chose the big breakfast with an extra side order of hash browns and a double orange juice his necessary and already marked serviette tucked tightly into his collar in a forlorn attempt to protect his shirt johnson said you should have ordered this breakfast is the most important meal of the day sets you up im not hungry said the whitehaired man he sat strangely in their window booth overlooking the interstate car park of dinosaursized trucks as if he feared contamination by contact with the table or the red plastic seat or even the mug you havent touched your coffee either its good coffee im not thirsty im glad we could meet like this said the dubette security chief whod made the demand so am i howd you know about this place know how to dress to fit in like you belong grant was wearing jeans and a work shirt although neither had ever been worked in johnsons better fitted the surroundings more stains being added by what the inadequate serviette wasnt catching grant said thats not what were here to talk about what do you want youre right about that said johnson id say theres a lot for us to talk about one way and another wouldnt you whats your problem harry thats exactly what my problem is said johnson its not knowing what my problem is you watch a lot of television harry crime stuff mostly the old life before dubette i guess you know how it is no denied grant i dont know how it is im waiting for you to tell me which is what i thought the arrangement was between us you telling me me telling you but always direct not through any intermediary like dwight newton grant sighed there was a directors meeting in new york it was easier more convenient to pass the message on through him it was never easier more convenient before i dont like the way everythings falling down i particularly dont like the idea of being cut out of the chain of communication i wouldnt have thought you would either the problems that fucking flight number you told me there was a problem that something had gone wrong and that the girl was dead and parnell had to be incriminated i thought the flight number which the paris office used a lot in the past would make it look as if they were stealing secrets i forgot the earlier terrorist alerts if parnell hadnt dismissed fletcher there would have been a plea imprisonment and parnell would have been disgraced imprisoned and unemployable anywhere else which was what you also told me to fix johnson looked again around the truck stop packed with drivers and if youd had me fix the accident the driver wouldnt have killed rebecca just created the accident in a police district where i could have handled everything what can the fbi find out nothing insisted the man itll run into the ground like dubettes stock value your problem largely of your making insisted johnson im more interested in personal things you and i for instance as i think you should be youre not being cut out of anything insisted grant this was wrong all wrong his worst nightmare he wasnt sure what the feeling was but didnt want it to be fear because johnson was the sort of man who could smell fear like the animal he was thats good to hear thats very good indeed i really wouldnt like that said johnson he mopped up the egg and grease with a piece of bread ate it and immediately belched he said see how good it was you got anything else to say i got this witness summons youve been in enough courts you see the fucking press conference hear the threats what can they threaten you with i dont know the lawyer talked about a lot of evidence its got to be exchanged youll know what youre facing before youre called to the stand i want a good attorney youre going to get the best you know how dubette looks after its people i think i got particular reason to be looked after dont worry i do worry when i think im being cut out of things weve gone through that im not sure about the metro dc guys i think theyre flaky they drop you they drop too i told them i knew where parnells car was i think i told the fbi i didnt know so what you forgot then you remembered thats how it happens a saggybreasted waitress came by with coffee refills freshened johnsons mug and took away the congealed plate as she left johnson ordered toast peanut butter and jelly he said you didnt tell me how a guy like you knows about a place like this stop it harry im not amused what happened to the girl ed what happened to rebecca it was the first time ever that johnson had felt bold enough to address grant like that and a shudder visibly went through the older man it was several moments before grant could reply i dont understand your question i organized the detectiveagency stakeout like you told me to when we were dealing direct alerted you to their sunday day out to chesapeake called my people off like you told me then he clicked his fingers pow poor kids dead at the bottom of a ravine you know what i think i think rebecca lang might just still be alive if id kept agency guys on the job i wouldnt be at all surprised if theyre more than a little concerned the way things happened they dont know you or your connection with dubette do they johnsons laugh was more of a sneer of course not im a professional remember and youre using another agency now just as anonymously so theres no problem you cant guarantee that ed for the first time for a very very long time were into things you cant control or guarantee which im sure you dont like any more than i do you know i was concerned at the possibility of a commercial leak putting in place the precautions that we did was perfectly justifiable as was my taking them off as i did when i did its the coincidence that worries me ed deciding on a sunday of all days that rebecca lang wasnt a snitch and lifting the surveillance from her and lover boy a couple of hours before shes shunted over the edge of a canyon he sat back for his new order to be placed on the table between them the waitress said you sure believe in keeping your strength up dont you gotta lot of grateful gels to keep happy smirked johnson surprised you can manage it the size of that gut the woman smirked back and then theres parnells car resumed the security chief as if there hadnt been any interruption thats another coincidence your asking me for its make and registration on the very day it got damaged like it did wouldnt you say thats one hell of a double coincidence ed grant said stop calling me ed no one calls me ed im sorry said johnson not sounding it i didnt mean any offence you want to try some of this toast with a little jelly its terrific youre so far out of line harry that youre in danger of getting lost and not being able to find your way back said edward c grant you are watching too many bad crime movies you should try different channels and try remembering who i am and who you are i dont ever want anything like this your imagining you can put on anything like this again youve got a direct line to me because i worry because its my job to worry about security at dubette everything ive ever had you do is provably just that my worrying about product and marketing security you can stuff coincidence up your fat ass like youre probably going to have to stuff an enema up your fat ass to get rid of all that shit youve been putting down your throat i dont take threats harry i make them there anything ive said so far that isnt clear to you harry johnson stared back across the table holding grants look his jaws crunching slowly rhythmically on his toast a lost blob of red jelly made its way down his chin finally pitching off to miss the serviette and add another stain to his already much marked jeans i asked you a question said grant let me ask you one back said the other man you think we understand each other now i sure as hell hope you understand me said grant and i sure as hell hope you understand me came back johnson and that we can go on just as we were before this misunderstanding came up between us you think we can do that grant was whitefaced once more not able immediately to form words when he did speak his voice was restricted as if his throat was blocked you told me there was something to show me show you insisted johnson not pass on through dwight newton grant sat waiting it seemed a long time before the security head responded not speaking either but sliding a photograph across the table its not a good picture complained grant good enough said johnson who is she the exwife of parnells lawyer barry jackson shes a geneticist in parnells unit the picture was taken last night as she left parnells apartment where shed been for two hours youve ignored a specific instruction accused dwight newton hows that asked parnell calmly the mountains and rivers were back at their proper surmountable heights i told you i wanted dubette wanted maximum concentration on avian flu youve downscaled put lapidus in charge of a smaller group ignored what i asked you to do it would have been ted lapiduss hopedfor liaison visit across the corridor parnell guessed scarcely interested and even less intimidated by the vice president i downscaled first to save you and russell benn and dubette im still hoping both of you and dubette will be saved i wont know until im sure about paris which at the moment im still not parnell stopped scarcely interested either in the redness that suffused newtons face we werent getting anywhere in fact we were getting in each others way all trying to work on the avian problem when there was only one path to follow and that seemed to be blocked it made absolute research sense to reduce the number of people and occupy other people elsewhere which is what ive done and what i want to continue to do which is not ignoring and certainly not minimizing the project you gave me and my unit its responding properly sensibly and scientifically to it we are today beginning a new approach which it is still too early even to discuss if theres anything whatsoever to discuss you and through you russell benn will be the first to know the pause fitted to make his point but parnell also needed to take breath and i really do think dwight that if youre going to get anything at all worthwhile out of my unit you should let me run it and organize it and not keep calling me in here every five minutes to explain the last thing ive done or thought about you told me in the beginning you wanted to know what i was doing i heard you when theres something that makes sense to tell you and share with other people in this research area then ill tell you and share it just as i hope you will tell me and share with me anything that comes up elsewhere as happened in paris doesnt that seem to you to be a sensible way for us to operate newtons face was blazing now the longfingered hands twitching seeking a scuttling direction we need to establish recognize a working relationship i thought that was what were talking about said parnell were you going to tell me about beverley jackson what about beverley jackson asked parnell guardedly shes refusing to undergo a psychological assessment shes told wayne denny that you know and that youve said you wont pressure her thats exactly what i have told her confirmed parnell and no i wasnt going to tell you because i think thats an administrative company matter for personnel to deal with which is what they exist for most certainly nothing important enough to bring before the vice president of research which brings us back to our problem dwight why are you worried involved even in whether beverley sits some harassed mind test have you seen todays newspapers asked the man instead of replying no replied parnell who hadnt bothered to stop at a newsstand or a gas station on his way from washington dc i guess the coverage is pretty extensive dubette stock is at a sixyear low and the prediction is that it will fall lower i wont accept my action against the police is solely or even partially responsible for that refused parnell you think given a choice id have gone through any of this i got the impression from what you said on television what i read in the papers that youre in close contact with the fbi newtons colour was subsiding his voice no longer strained theyve needed to speak to me said parnell guardedly again they got anything positive suspects if they have they havent told me parnell said evasively they must have said something they havent insisted parnell nothing thats given me any reason to think theyre anywhere close to an arrest anywhere close to understanding it not understanding it was joining the long litany of cliches he thought parnell said what about you dwight youre engaging yourself in everything what do you think about rebeccas murder and french flight numbers you managed to find a connecting thread parnell waited expectantly for newton to say he didnt understand but instead he said maybe i could see something if i knew all that was going on if i had an overview the remark rang like a bell in parnells mind you spoken to the fbi yet newton answered the internal telephone at once identified himself but contributed nothing to the exchange before putting the instrument down he said sorry somethings come up will you excuse me hed leave the office parnell decided but he wouldnt excuse newton from anything which personnel files demanded newton he didnt specify said wayne denny his names pullinger a counsel for the fbi he said he hoped their agents would be allowed access to the personnel records without needing a court order baldwin says it might give a misleading impression if we insisted but that he wants himself and myself to be present go back and tell pullinger that decided newton if he objects then ask for a court order thatll be them creating a problem not us twentynine t he interview was geared for psychological pressure thered been a considerable input from the fbis profiling division at their quantico training facility in virginia from which both howard dingley and david benton were graduates and the pressure was imposed even before the encounter began by inviting harry johnson to the bureaus washington field office not by their going out to mclean and advising the security chief to be accompanied by counsel an obvious implication that hed need legal protection johnson arrived in a sharply pressed suit not his dubette security uniform with two lawyers the company attorney peter baldwin and william clarkson whom the agents recognized from dubettes huddled legal group at the press conference clarkson a quicktalking fidgeting man immediately challenged dingleys request to record the questioning which dingley countered by insisting it was as much to protect his client as it was to establish a verbatim record a duplicate tape as well as a transcript would obviously be made available i dont mind intervened johnson lets get it all down hear what weve got to say to each other why not thank you said david benton activating the machine its good of you to come we appreciate it added dingley at once seizing johnsons overconfident belief that he could handle whatever he was about to face even on alien bureau territory anything to help said johnson youve probably got more experience of this sort of thing than us flattered benton i dont know about that said johnson too quickly you were with metro dc police before joining dubette werent you said benton johnsons face tightened almost imperceptibly uniform never detective certainly not murder or terrorism dont remember your telling us that you were with metro dc police department when we first spoke remarked dingley we didnt know that until we went through dubettes employment files dont remember your asking came back johnson truculently maybe we didnt benton appeared to accept our oversight whats the importance of my client having been with metro dc police demanded clarkson sharply bentons frown was almost overemphasized the two arresting officers were from metro dc he looked at the security man i guess you already knew them didnt you mr johnson im not sure doubted johnson quickly i left in finished benton more quickly peter bellamy and helen montgomery were at that time both serving in the metro dc police department were they said johnson and stopped there was a wariness now the overconfidence wavering yes said dingley and stopped the windows were doubleglazed preventing any outside traffic noise there was none from any inner corridors either just the faintest sigh from the airconditioning clarkson broke the impasse is this meeting over no said benton we werent sure your client had completed his answer johnson was looking at the flickering light of the recording machine i had im surprised mr johnson that you didnt know officers bellamy and montgomery pressed benton i was in administration in and where were they asked dingley outside uniform started johnson stopping at appearing to know they must have been resumed the man again theyd have had to be wouldnt they for me not to be able to remember if i knew them or not we dont ask questions to answer them ourselves said benton is metro dc police division that big theres shared communal facilities surely canteen recreational areas stuff like that ive told you i didnt know every single person in metro dc officers bellamy and montgomery i didnt call to mind when they came to dubette after they came to dubette i remembered seeing them around in the department whats the purpose of this questioning asked clarkson are you regarding my client as being criminally connected with what you are investigating in which case we are not at this stage regarding or treating mr johnson as anything other than an essential witness in an ongoing murder and terroristlinked investigation broke in dingley formerly and with the same interruption preventing whatever closedown threat the lawyer might have intended it would be unfortunate if we strayed away from the reason for this meeting warned benton things appear to be becoming confused and thats what were trying to avoid things that are already confused becoming more confused i think thats an excellent precaution said johnsons lawyer im also approaching the time when i am going seriously to query the point of a lot of this questioning if it continues in the way it has so far done during the exchanges johnson smiled and straightened in his seat his confidence visibly returning im very sorry it went off course apologized dingley our mistake so weve established mr johnson that although you worked for the same police department over an overlapping period you never knew officers bellamy or montgomery not as people i hung out with nineteen sixtynine is a long time ago we certainly werent friends you left retired from metro dc prematurely didnt you mr johnson asked benton again whats the relevance of that question said clarkson establishing the reliability and credibility of witnesses in a forthcoming criminal prosecution said benton our prosecutors dont like courtroom challenges that could have been anticipated he nodded towards the recording apparatus now there it is unequivocally on tape are you impugning my clients integrity absolutely not insisted dingley enunciating each syllable to enforce the denial at the moment as we probably havent sufficiently made clear or established we look to mr johnson as an essential witness to what clarkson continued to challenge my client was briefly present at an arrest an arrest now the subject of a quite separate civil case in no way involving or concerning the fbi how can that brief involvement make him an essential material witness at this stage of our enquiries mr johnson is one of the only witnesses to anything said benton were anxious we dont leave unasked any question that might give us an opening i am glad after all that this interview is being recorded said clarkson so are we said benton immediately thats why we asked for it to be done he switched quickly to johnson you did leave metro dc police department prematurely didnt you mr johnson id reached my first available retirement opportunity i chose to take it why was that asked benton mildly a position came up at dubette in their security division as head of their security division johnsons wariness was back yes that was quite a jump going straight in as head of a unit commented dingley i had the qualifications and experience i was headhunted if you like he smiled at his own pun as im sure you most certainly liked dingley smiled back howd that happen mr johnson how did dubette come to think of you find you out of every likely candidate out of metro dc where there were so many officers that you didnt even get to remember peter bellamy and helen montgomery who were your contemporaries johnsons smile remained their previous security chief joe blanchard hed earlier worked for metro dc police put me forward with a personal recommendation its not what you know its who you know benton said isnt that what they always say thats what they always say agreed johnson so you left metro dc in what was it november something like that said johnson exactly like that november ten said dingley we got it from metro dc records not a good time around then for metro dc police lot of internal enquiries lot of people leaving the force you remember that mr johnson this has got to stop protested clarkson sir came back dingley this is a murder and potential terrorism investigation two metro dc officers arrested a man in questionable circumstances he raised his hand against the lawyers further interruption all right thats being challenged elsewhere in a court with which we have no involvement or jurisdiction but we do have a very real interest in their reliability as witnesses in our ongoing investigation wed hoped your client could simply give us a steer on that reliability my client has already told you he did not know officers bellamy or montgomery well enough to be able to attest to that persisted clarkson indeed he has said benton but the question wasnt about the two officers was it it was about an unfortunate embarrassing time within metro dc police department an embarrassing time in which my client was in no way involved said clarkson and which has no relevance whatsoever to the investigation in which youre currently engaged that wasnt the question or the inference either persisted dingley i asked if mr johnson remembered it of course i remember it said johnson the enquiries were internal but they were widely covered in the press evidencetampering bribery stuff like that recalled benton which brings us up to date with our current investigation theres indications here of tampering with or planting forensic evidence you think officers bellamy and montgomery would be capable of doing anything like that mr johnson how many more times do i have to tell you that i dont know them well enough protested the security chief how can i judge what theyre capable of what about that day persisted benton youre a professional you were with them saw how they operated they look to you to be good honest cops as far as i was aware what i saw they behaved perfectly properly and professionally said johnson this is getting ridiculous reentered the lawyer for the first time the agents ignored the interruption focusing solely upon johnson dingley said you and the security officers you control carry weapons dont you smith and wesson thirtyeights police specials for which we are licensed said johnson we know weve already checked assured dingley anything else mace pepper spray batons my staff and i protect a pharmaceutical research facility a very obvious target in the drug culture in which we live said johnson so what else is it you carry persisted dingley the night staff sometimes the day staff too carry mace and batons ever had to use it or discharge your weapon asked dingley no said johnson lets hope you never do said benton theres an inconsistency wed like you to help us with said dingley in a sudden change of direction our recollection and dave and i have checked our notes on this was that you told us you didnt know what car richard parnell drove or what its registration was is that right mr johnson is it right you didnt know the make of the car or its registration number until richard parnell took you to it on the morning of his arrest the blink was of a country road animal on a dark night transfixed in the lights of an oncoming vehicle johnson said i dont remember what i did or didnt tell you i mean dont remember your asking so lets ask you again mr johnson said benton until the day of richard parnells arrest did you know the make or registration of his vehicle i told you i dont remember no refused dingley what you didnt remember was what you told us when we first talked the question now is whether before mr parnells arrest you knew his car details dubette have a research and administration staff at mclean close to two thousand people said the man one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo supplied benton out of that one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo did you know the details of mr parnells car no blurted johnson you absolutely sure about that said benton on the evening mr parnell found his car damaged damaged sufficiently to remove paint later found around but not adhering to ms langs car you logged on dubettes personnel file access system as having examined mr parnells personal records and in those documents is listed the make and registration of mr parnells car do you remember going through mr parnells file the approaching headlights were blindingly in johnsons eyes he shook his head blinked a lot and looked sideways for help to his lawyer clarkson said this interview ceases now i need further time instruction with my client we can fully understand that accepted dingley as we made very clear from the outset by having this interview recorded we are extending every legally required courtesy to your client mr harry johnson which is why i think this is the moment formally to read him his miranda rights on cue as dingley stopped talking benton recited johnsons legal protection against selfincrimination continuing the double act dingley picked up the moment his partner finished speaking more towards the recording apparatus than to the security chief i am now showing mr johnson and his attorney the search warrant issued earlier today by a judge in private hearing i should have been informed of this before this interview began protested clarkson that warrant authorizes the fbi to search mr johnsons home as well as his office and locker at dubette inc at mclean north virginia continued dingley it effectively seals every article in every stated place under court jurisdiction until bureau searches have been completed the email had been waiting when parnell arrived that morning addressed to him not lapidus despite the request for further avianflu specimens coming from the greek geneticist more cultures were being despatched so were preliminary papers from shanghai university updating research on a sars vaccine incorporating dna from the infecting virus part of the paper indicated that the chinese were also experimenting upon a similar method of immunization against the current lethal bird flu its an idea suggested parnell when lapiduss team assembled it goes along with your d c b a approach said sato and theres the linking respiratory factor in both conditions beverley pointed out the gamble comes as it always does in finding an acceptably safe level said lapidus remember we cant try culture growth in eggs what about the mice we already tested asked parnell did we isolate a specific host gene i tried obviously said sato at once the damned strain is so mephitic its like a pump gun everything gets shot away maybe teds just shown us a path said parnell we minimize the strength of the virus under controlled conditions to the point of destruction every levels logged against each level we administer until we lose the pumpgun effect and then go for tolerance working through the logged levels at an acceptable tolerance we might locate our most likely friendly host we get the mouse host we look for a human match elementary my dear watson gently mocked lapidus how longs a few thousand comparisons going to take parnell mocked back seriously lapidus said how many other companies do you think might as our people have pick up on shanghai i dont even want to make a guess i know this is a race but i dont want any of us running so fast we trip over ourselves cautioned parnell dubette came far too close to that to doing that all too recently we follow this research line if it turns out to be feasible like the scientists we are and always will do as long as i am the director of this unit and thats scientifically if someone comes out ahead of us so be it they did better than us and they deserved to get there first parnell came to a halt suddenly embarrassed at the same time as being aware of how often he seemed to need to stop talking to draw breath that didnt start as the lecture it turned out to be he apologized i didnt think it was a lecture said beverley i thought it was a professional commitment a threeman forensic unit led the entry into the fetid apartment on the anacostia side of capitol hill with the investigators johnson and the two lawyers behind which was where they remained virtually unspeaking as the protectively suited three methodically worked through johnsons home room by room johnson insisted he had a licence for a second smith and wesson discovered in the dishevelled bedroom and which benton bagged but remained silent at the gradual accumulation of namestamped dubette property which ranged from pens and notepaper to crockery linen and towels a switchblade one half of the handle broken was found in a kitchen drawer among an assortment of tools benton put that into an evidence envelope too in the living room there were several photographs of johnson in metro dc police uniform none of them featuring either peter bellamy or helen montgomery there was also a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings of reported cases in which johnson had featured there were also six newspaper stories of the corruption investigation into the metro dc force after a momentary hesitation johnson felt beneath an adjoining drawer for the tapedinplace hidden key to the one locked part of a bureau in which was found johnsons bank deposit book with a credit balance of as dingley said they were seizing the book johnson started i want to say before clarkson said no you dont stopping the man do you carry a notebook a message pad asked dingley maybe theres one in your office around somewhere johnson reached into the drawer in which the deposit book had been locked and groped a plasticbound pocketbook from its rear why do you want that intruded clarkson the warrant gives us legal right to seize whatever we decide to be necessary said benton necessary for what demanded the lawyer there has to be later disclosure but not at this stage reminded dingley there was no conversation whatsoever during the journey out to mclean johnson and clarkson in the rear of the fbi car peter baldwin following in his own vehicle ahead of the forensic scientists the flick knife parnell had described johnson carrying in his trouser pocket was found in a locker drawer as well as a set of brass knuckledusters the forensic examiners extracted the entire drawer and sealed it for further laboratory tests upon what appeared to be small specks of grey paint among debris and dust at its corners and bottom the holstered smith and wesson was in another drawer along with two spare clips of ammunition in a top drawer of the desk in johnsons office the search uncovered complete photocopies of both richard parnell and rebecca langs personnel files dingley said thats fortunate personnel told us ms langs records had been destroyed before we asked for them the field office bar was on th street and it was tradition to celebrate the first potential break in any case benton touched glasses with dingley and said you know what i think weve got enough evidence for stealing a bunch of towels and serviettes from his employers dont forget the salt and pepper shakers and a set of salt and pepper shakers added benton hows a bum like johnson get over a quarter of a million bucks in the bank asked dingley you think hes going to tell us asked benton cynically dingley looked unnecessarily at his watch ed pullinger is making the wiretap application about now maybe thats how well find out lets not forget why were involved reminded benton its not so much the murder its suspected terrorism terrorisms well funded said dingley its a point pullinger is arguing to support the tap and hes trying for an order to get at metro dc police records too towels serviettes and salt and pepper shakers insisted benton gesturing for the bartenders attention dont you forget the paint in the locker drawer thirty the interviews with the two suspended metro dc police officers were of course conducted separately again at the fbi field office and from both there was immediate legal insistence upon instead of objection to tape recordings each was also individually accompanied by two demanding lawyers one personal the other representing the metro dc police department despite their separation each officer quickly appeared to follow a virtually identical script of course they knew harry johnson theyd worked with him but they hadnt been friends acquaintances even he was just a guy theyd seen around no harry hadnt indicated that he knew richard parnells car until the scientist himself led them to it they had not recovered every item from rebecca langs purse from the bottom of the gorge when they arrested him the terroristalert flight number had been shown to them for the first time by a metro dc forensic scientist professor jacob meadows whod produced the entire contents of the handbag after the recovery of the body and the vehicle neither had been present at that recovery as far as they knew the recovery had been carried out by police engineers who had also collected up material later handed over to professor meadows their involvement had begun after a radio alert while they were on patrol with the discovery from the id in her purse that rebecca lang had worked at dubette at the time of their going to mclean the death of ms lang had been considered a fatal traffic accident not murder both believed it was harry johnson who had told them of the personal relationship between ms lang and richard parnell although it might first have been suggested by dwight newton neither could be absolutely sure they had not attached any significance to the flight number when they found it among rebecca langs belongings it had been parnells attorney who had introduced that significance into the initial court hearing they had believed there was bona fide justification to take richard parnell into custody considering the circumstances of what they then believed to be a fatal accident and the damage to parnells car their arrest procedure had conformed to every legal regulation and guidance there had been no intimidation harassment or abuse either verbal or physical throughout they had acted fully within the legally established boundaries of suspect arrest based upon preliminary forensic findings neither remembered johnson specifically drawing their attention to the damage to parnells car it had been obvious as they approached they didnt look around the toyota for any paintdebris evidence of it being hit by a neighbouring car helen montgomery had been the first to be interviewed in the morning towards the end of the encounter dingley said the only reason for your detaining richard parnell when you did was because of the damage to his car wed been told the dead womans car had been in collision with a grey vehicle the toyota was grey youd also been told according to what youre now telling us that richard parnell and rebecca lang were into a relationship said benton wasnt it a very long jump to connect him to the death purely on the basis of the colour of his car is that a question for your specific enquiry immediately intruded the metro dc lawyer phillip brack a man so obese he had to sit with his legs splayed unable to bring them together it could very well be if your client was curious about an inexplicable air france flight number being on the body of the dead woman said dingley my client has already told you that at the moment of the arrest she was unaware of that flight number or its apparent significance so it was what questioned benton taking richard parnell into police custody for further questioning into what was nothing more than a possible coincidence were in danger of straying into wrong territory warned brack i think were on the right side of the dividing line insisted dingley thats what it was said the woman further questioning for which he had to be manacled demanded benton thats it stopped brack just ahead of helen montgomerys personal attorney a heavily bespectacled ivyleaguesuited black lawyer named donald sinclair thats too much said sinclair rewording his protest it wouldnt have been for a suspected terrorist said benton weve already covered that ground reminded sinclair im not sure we have to our satisfaction to satisfy an fbi involvement disputed dingley unless you knew of the terrorist implications i cant see why you had to take richard parnell into custody in chains take us through the conversation you had with harry johnson as best you can remember it for the first time helen montgomery showed a hesitation ive told you we got a dispatchers message that thered been a fatality in rock creek park rebecca lang whose id gave dubette as her workplace do metro dc automatically record their communications broke in benton there was another pause yes so therell be a tape of that exchange i guess so anyway we get to dubette ask to see harry in security who takes us up to ms langs division and calls in the vice president as well as the personnel director whoa stopped benton lets take it all a lot slower you knew harry johnson was head of dubette security you call him from the car tell him you were on your way i may have done im not sure you arrive at dubette you tell harry what the woman shrugged i cant remember precisely something like someone who works for dubette rebecca lang looks to have been killed in a motor accident forced over the edge of a drop in rock creek park and thats what the dispatcher said was it intruded benton once more that it wasnt just an accident that rebecca langs vehicle had been forced over the edge of a drop thats what the tape will show im not sure i mean i think so but i cant recall the precise words stumbled the woman guess that might just have been a reason for cuffing parnell offered dingley what did harry say to that picked up benton maybe how terrible or something like that and that wed better tell people in authority which is what we did so thats when you first heard the name richard parnell when you got to someone in authority said dingley no before that said the woman as we were going through the building i told harry we needed to find out what ms lang had been doing to be in rock creek park harry said parnell would be the person to tell us that he and the girl were involved and that parnell would be the person to know know what tell you what asked dingley whatever we wanted to know i suppose did you talk about parnells car not that i remember how did parnell take it when you told him asked benton all right i guess all right you guess exclaimed benton you tell a man his fiancees been killed in a car crash and he takes it all right no he was shocked i suppose but he didnt break down or anything like that how did parnells car come into the conversation suddenly asked dingley and why you go to dubette to tell them an employee has died you discover shes into a relationship with someone there you go into the car park to find his car damaged so you manacle him and take him into custody wasnt that all a bit too quick too circumstantial im coming in here again brack began to object but dingley overrode him come in as much as you want for the benefit of the tape and to protest later but were talking terrorism and it seems to me to my partner and i that decisions were made either prematurely the halting hand came up again or on the basis of evidence which isnt being disclosed to us which is very much part of our investigation so wed appreciate an answer nothing whatsoever has been withheld insisted the woman why do you think johnson couldnt remember you or officer bellamy my client has already answered that question said sinclair if you want it repeated ill repeat it she has no idea was he involved in the internal metro dc police department enquiries into corruption and evidenceplanting in demanded benton brack said stop just slightly ahead of the black lawyer sinclair said upon my advice my client refuses to answer that question brack added a question that is grossly improper i dont consider it is said dingley mildly but there would be records of those internal enquiries wouldnt there mr brack the obese lawyer shifted in his inadequate chair i have no way of knowing that we hope to be able to said benton she wasnt spooked complained benton theyd just finished listening to the tape replay reloading the machine for peter bellamys afternoon arrival their sandwiches still uneaten on dingleys desk she came close argued dingley close wasnt close enough were still looking at towels and salt and pepper shakers the taps will be on johnsons phones by now started dingley stopping to pick up the telephone which was nearer to where he was by the desk in quick succession he said ok good shit ok thats what we do to restore faith in the bureau what asked benton when his partner replaced the receiver we got our access order against metro dc police said dingley looks between dingley and benton were sufficient within an hour of their afternoon interview unspeakingly to agree that there had been careful rehearsal between peter bellamy and helen montgomery the waddling phillip brack again represented metro dc police department bellamys personal attorney was a woman hilda jeffries she wore a trouser suit a short hairstyle and no makeup it was within that hour that the fbi agents took bellamy through the echoed preliminaries theyd earlier recorded with helen montgomery this time with benton leading the hardcopsoftcop routine although with a sudden hopefully confusing twist bellamy was at the end of a denial of any prior conversation about damage to parnells toyota when dingley said what sort of guy do you think harry is good lucky began the police officer before being halted by brack the metro dc lawyer said wheres this questioning getting us an inch at a time because of so many interruptions said benton why do you consider harry johnson a lucky guy that was a hell of a job he landed himself at dubette right out of the department improvised bellamy i thought it was a shooin said dingley joe blanchard opened the door for him it wasnt that guaranteed said the man believing there was firm ground underfoot how do you know that persisted benton what bearing has this upon your investigation demanded the female lawyer i wont know until i hear the answer said benton to bellamy he said why wasnt it guaranteed that harry would get the dubette job with blanchards backing it couldnt have been could it floundered bellamy there must have been other applicants what about you said benton you ever think you could slot into a dubette job knowing harry like you did could have been an ace in the hole we hear dubette pay well invited dingley top dollar smiled bellamy how much time you got before you can leave queried benton tuned to his partners approach coupla years three maybe is dubette your ace in the hole asked benton wheres this going lumbered brack in a direction replied benton intentionally dismissive you got it in mind that you can get a job with dubette if you choose to leave metro dc police right its always a thought conceded bellamy you ever get caught up in all those troubles in the metro dc police department in abruptly demanded benton my client declines to answer that question interrupted hilda jeffries at once i think you should know that the fbi has obtained a court order enforcing full disclosure not just of the conclusions of internal hearings of that time but also of inconclusive investigations announced benton i wasnt advised of this application protested brack at once we were only advised ourselves of the application by counsel at the j edgar hoover building a few minutes before this interview began said dingley easily this is something i need to discuss with my client said hilda jeffries something phil and i should definitely have been told earlier this was the earliest opportunity insisted dingley unrepentantly before this recorded interview began was an earlier opportunity insisted hilda jeffries in return this could well become a court protest certainly this meeting will progress no further theyre dirty insisted benton an hour later in the th street bar i got five bucks that says harry and pete bellamy and maybe helen montgomery got investigated in but that there was insufficient proof to prosecute harry just got asked to leave hows that sound sounds like a very feasible local police corruption deal agreed dingley which isnt an fbi problem or investigation i know were missing our terrorism link conceded benton but a local police corruption deal is an fbi investigation if metro dc police computers have been going beyond state borders and looking at things they shouldnt be looking at thats a wild guess that gets us nowhere refused dingley i think weve taken a step forward argued benton half a step cautioned dingley all weve got in addition to lies is a lot of conjecture im encouraged beyond towels and salt and pepper shakers said benton and we shouldnt forget dwight newton had a looksee at parnells file according to the log no reason to leave him out accepted dingley lets give it the weekend for him to stop worrying think were not interested weve got a lot of reading to do you know what id like just once said benton what to have an interview without a goddamned lawyer in the way law enforcement would be a hell of a lot easier without lawyers agreed benton they ate at the kennedy centre before the concert inevitably they talked about johnsons headlinegrabbing arrest and previous days bail release and parnell said there hadnt been an opportunity to ask the fbi agents if it was a break in the case hed hoped they would have called him if it were which they hadnt he had planned to contact them at the beginning of the following week but as he and beverley talked parnell remembered dingleys assurance always to be reachable at the numbers theyd given him surprised hed forgotten and decided to try the cellphone listings the next day work had started on the controlled toxicityreduction of the newly arrived avian flu viruses but it was necessarily slow no safe level had been established which left nothing more to say which hadnt already been said during their customary and so far inconclusive endoftheday discussions beverley judged ted lapidus a good researchteam leader but thought sean sato would be the one most likely to make a discovery and finished by saying and now i want to know about you ill get involved the moment we get to a controllable virus level promised parnell deciding against telling her of the most recent confrontation with dwight newton that wasnt the question she said i wouldnt have thought theres anything left to know about me said parnell lets hear about beverley jackson dull story she insisted dad was an industrial chemist so i guess i inherited the interest found i was good at it got caught up in the new science of genetics and wanted to prove i could be good at that too which is why i came after the dubette job didnt think you were particularly impressed by me at the job interview incidentally didnt believe i stood a chance not sure how i feel about the company itself ive got to see wayne denny next week by the way about this psychology nonsense seans decided to go ahead and take it thinks to refuse will screw him up with the company thats about it you missed out marriage and barry would she tell him about the one time theyd lied to each other he wondered college romance stars in our eyes she said didnt live together long enough to get to know each other turned out we were both more interested in work and our careers than we were in each other we talked about it and decided it was a mistake for which neither of us were to blame just one of those things that didnt work so instead of ending up miserable and disliking each other wed call it a day she giggled barry did the divorce for free and i abandoned any claim for alimony just like that said parnell it was a good deal we end up friends even go out together sometimes his folks are dead like mine are now and we spent last christmas together at aspen barry paid all very grownup and civilized said parnell he wasnt going to discover the great unsaid maybe there was nothing to learn waste of time being any other way she looked around her at an obvious exodus about time we made a move dont you think they didnt bother to go to the bar at the intermission and afterwards parnell declared himself a fan of big band do you feel like a drink now not in a bar i guess im going to have to get used to this directness thats if you want to i think i do they went to beverleys apartment at dupont circle without discussion they did open wine but neither finished their first glass although when they got into the bedroom and parnell realized his nervousness he wished he had because it might have helped they kissed a lot and began exploring and searching each other which initially made it worse for him but beverley was very patient relaxing stopping quietly caressing and gradually his tension eased away and they joined in perfect rhythm and climaxed together to her tiny sobbing mew when he was able parnell said i didnt think but she put her fingers gently against his lips stopping him and said but you did and it was wonderful the lighting that night was much better outside beverleys apartment than it had been at washington circle and the photographs of their entering together were much better and the prints were timed too they were again timed at ten thirtythree when parnell and beverley left again the following morning and sharper still in the bright daylight so what did dingley say beverley asked as they got into her car it was going slowly but he was hopeful replied parnell he called it a step at a time thirtyone c riminal investigation particularly interrogation is surprisingly a nearscience of routine comparing one person to another one answer against another overlaying one human template on top of another seeking out the misplaced word the displaced fact the slightest chink in the protective wall that people who see themselves in danger try to build that is the psychological ethos inculcated at quantico and which howard dingley and david benton religiously observed with dubette research vice president dwight newton although they were never professionally to know how effective it was it required as it had with the others that newton be brought into the fbi field office and unsettlingly accompanied by lawyers as always dubettes peter baldwin and gerry fletcher whom newton loyally elected to retain it was fletcher who immediately challenged the fbi demand for their being summoned into washington as well as the use of a tape recording newton having already cooperated fully at the first interview for which the fbi agents had courteously travelled out to mclean and beyond which neither he nor his client could imagine any further help was possible we most definitely do not did not intend any discourtesy said the softcop rehearsed dingley theres a lot coming in at us from every which way weve imposed upon your good nature in asking you to come here youre getting somewhere quickly asked newton he hoped his suit jacket was as effective as his white laboratory coat in covering the sweat rings they had to have something what for christs sake to bring him in like this still trying to fit pieces together said benton the placating cliches arranged in his mind like cards in a poker game thats how we hope you will be able to help us how said fletcher on behalf of his client that flight numbers our biggest problem insisted dingley i know we talked about it before professor newton but have you had any thoughts recollections since our first meeting how it came to be in rebeccas purse i told you then absolutely not you most certainly did agreed benton as if in sudden recollection we didnt know then that youd accessed richard parnells personnel file the day after he was arrested whyd you do that professor newton had every right and authority to access the records as richard parnells immediate superior said baldwin were not doubting that he had said dingley our question is why dick had been arrested id tried to arrange his legal representation said newton itching around his back and sides from the soaking perspiration and exaggerating the shrug in an effort to relieve it not feeling able to explain that it had been personally to discover from the log not the file that had been his excuse for consulting it whether the omnipotent johnson had examined it prior to the encounter in showcrosss office newton desperately extemporized i wondered if there might have been anything there that could have helped dingley and benton went through their lookexchanging formula as if each was inviting the other to ask the obvious question it was dingley who spoke mr parnell already had independent legal representation the day after he was arrested by noon there were newscasts indicating that the case against him might collapse youre not registered as having taken the records out until two ten that afternoon and only looked at them for just under ten minutes added benton thats how long it took me to realize that it was a stupid idea that there couldnt possibly be anything there said newton i was there was another irritationrelieving shoulder twitch just trying to help like i said until it was obvious how pointless it was i was casting around a wellrespected and loved member of dubette had died you were there in burt showcrosss office said dingley tell us about the arrest i dont understand said newton he was being sucked down again the water coming in more quickly to engulf him did you get the impression there had been a lot of discussion between harry johnson and the two metro dc police officers before you all got together in burt showcrosss office asked benton yes which was why i looked at the personnel records thought newton he said i didnt think about it i guess there was what an affinity i guess they were all police officers harry was once they have a way of behaving talking he had to get out stop this sort of questioning he was going to be dragged down destroyed he didnt want to be destroyed by a system and an environment and people a person who believed himself to be god all he wanted the only thing he wanted was to escape to run away somewhere anywhere and hide and never be found again think about it now urged dingley parnells arrest doesnt seem right to us almost as if it had been decided upon in advance is that a focus of your investigation demanded fletcher thats surely a matter for the separate enquiry initiated against the two officers by mr parnell difficult not to cross boundary lines smiled benton in empty apology were troubled by what seem to have been assumptions without obvious evidence to support the action that was taken i dont see how my client can possibly help you with that said fletcher no quickly said newton seizing the more immediate opendoor escape i cant help you with any of this honestly he said i was shocked by it all by rebeccas death how she died how was that persisted benton at once when the officers told you more importantly when they told parnell exactly what did they say had happened newton hesitated trying to anticipate the pitfalls that thered been a traffic accident that rebecca had died did they give any details of the accident asked dingley where was the trap the thing he should or shouldnt say i think they said thered been a collision i cant properly remember that rebeccas car had been forced into a canyon i think im not sure forced into a canyon echoed dingley what were the implications of those words something like that i told you i cant properly remember cant swear to anything youre not being asked to swear to anything professor newton said dingley not yet finished benton do you have a case to make against anyone demanded baldwin at once not yet said dingley in a tone indicating that it could be imminent you sound hopeful pressed the dubette lawyer were always hopeful said benton we got an eightyfive per cent success record howie and me we work hard to stay that way at the top of the league i hope you can with this said newton in a brief flash of belligerence we will predicted benton so you were happy with the way professor parnell was treated i didnt make a judgement protested newton further hoping to recover how do you expect me to know how police are supposed to behave just by started dingley but was stopped by fletcher this isnt your investigation insisted the lawyer this line of questioning belongs to the civil action for which we understand youve been served with a witness subpoena said benton what importance do you attach to that said baldwin overly intrusive none said dingley calmly just making a comment was ms lang considered a problem employee at dubette suddenly asked benton my client declines to answer that inappropriate question refused fletcher someone murdered ms lang reminded dingley so far we havent been able to discover any motive for such a murder any murder my client cannot help you on that blocked fletcher why cant professor newton answer for himself asked benton he is vice president in charge of the mclean installation he was ms langs ultimate boss hes in a position to know if ms lang was a problem employee surely rebecca lang was an exemplary employee said newton thank you smiled benton heres another question i hope you can help us with as vice president of dubette research and development upon dubettes premises at mclean there are very dangerous things viruses disease samples infectious agents generalized benton kept preserved and protected in conditions of total safety insisted newton comfortable for the first time on territory in which he felt safe if they were released into the environment into the atmosphere could what is kept preserved and protected at dubette cause a major health risk infection contagion asked benton the question pedantically phrased if some of the experimental cultures were to escape into the environment there could potentially be publichealth concern replied newton just as pedantically the method and safety precautions in which such samples are housed makes such accidental release impossible all are kept in individual chambers within chambers each separation alarmed to trigger an immediate alert in the event of the most minuscule escape at each level there is a shutdown procedure doubly sealing the penetrated section if the leakage were to continue which is an impossibility in the event of an accident the final section is incendiarized it is automatically heated to two hundred degrees centigrade no known bacillus or virus can survive such a temperature both fbi agents listened patiently through the exposition when it was over dingley said dubette has a total of twelve overseas subsidiaries yes agreed newton at once believing he could anticipate the questioning how often is material of the virulence that we are discussing passed between those overseas subsidiaries and mclean extremely rarely said newton confidently any such transfer is always contained within protective crashresistant outer casings tested to the destruction capability of a major explosion each container is equipped with a similar triggering mechanism to that at mclean to selfdestruct if the casing is breached he smiled at the two agents and im sure youll be reassured to know that no such shipment has moved in either direction between dubette or any of its overseas divisions in the last eighteen months we are reassured agreed dingley you know that and now we know it but a potential terrorist group able to learn when and how shipments were going back and forth wouldnt know it would they for me to answer that question beyond its hypotheses youd have to define the extent of that capability said newton his stomach hollowing again dubette is highly protective of its research and development there is no such leakage within mclean or any of dubettes overseas subsidiaries if you suspected that there were youd move immediately to seal it of course of course said newton with insufficient thought you couldnt though if you hadnt uncovered the source of such leakage could you benton pointed out no admitted newton but there wasnt one dwight said baldwin close to shouting across the car on their way back to mclean im talking to you the slumped scientist came out of his reverie sorry what did you say i said that i thought that went very well repeated the company lawyer i didnt they think im hiding something baldwin at the wheel chanced a look towards the other man thats ridiculous youve got nothing to hide have you no said newton hoping the doubt didnt sound in his voice then i dont know what youre talking about it went well believe me even if parnells laterdiscovered hprt effect had been known the exchanges between mclean and paris would not have required selfdestructing packaging newton tried to convince himself but the protection should have been more substantial than the standard polystyrene and cardboard wrap how could he get out where was his escape a way a place to hide there was not in fact a lot coming in from every which way for howard dingley and david benton to examine although they had initially expected their entire weekend to be taken up reviewing the metro dc police internal corruption investigations ironically the delay was caused by the necessary police records having to be duplicated to comply with the quite separate court order obtained by barry jackson to pursue the falsearrest action and by the time it was all assembled they risked being overwhelmed by its arrival coinciding with the forensic results from the searches of harry johnsons anacostia apartment and his dubette workplace their resolve was roughly to divide it benton taking the metro dc police material into his separate office leaving dingley with the forensics report dingley with less than his partner finished first but needed the time for a lengthy telephone discussion with the fbi laboratory at the j edgar hoover building hed just finished when benton returned benton handed his partner a five dollar note and said you won the bet johnson was investigated on suspicion of improper use of equipment using metro dc police computers to access records of other forces and for accepting bribes everything collapsed for lack of evidence but he was invited to retire didnt anyone examine the bank account broke in dingley apparently not said benton dont forget it was an internal enquiry carried out by people who knew each other according to parnell johnsons the man who picks up shipments to the separate boxnumber address hed know whenever a special consignment was arriving wouldnt he just the sort of terrorist information we were talking about to newton too circumstantial judged dingley i know accepted the other agent would you say this is the photograph he handed across the desk was one of three that had been among the surrendered material it showed johnson in uniform with his arm around helen montgomery also in uniform peter bellamy was among a smiling group in the posed background id say im surprised johnson had so much trouble remembering helen montgomery and peter bellamy as former colleagues said dingley looks to me as if hes got his hand under her left tit and shes enjoying it what about those two one enquiry again failed into bellamy complaint of undue and unreasonable force during an arrest montgomery was his partner it was her evidence denying everything that got the accusation thrown out might help parnells civil case doesnt do much for us none of it does unless johnson tells us where hes got his quarter of a mill from and we sure as hell know he aint going to do that he wouldnt shift from careful saver and lucky gambler not if we pulled his fingernails out lucky gamblers arent careful savers psychology isnt evidence reminded benton you any luckier dingley smiled the half thumb print on the flight number is johnsons perfect match for prints off the handles of both flick knives the knuckleduster and on the butt of the smith and wesson in his uniform holster benton smiled back and he told us on tape that he didnt know anything about that piece of paper its not all good cautioned dingley forensics took both flick knives to pieces not a scrap of fibre in either to match rebeccas cut seat belt the grey paint debris from the bottom of his locker drawer isnt from parnells car and the sheet of paper from his pocketbook isnt a match to that on which the flight number is written shit said benton what about other fingerprints on the flight number none just johnsons half print that doesnt fit insisted benton at once there would have had to be rebeccas mark on it i know agreed dingley so do forensics they checked every other article in rebeccas purse every one had her prints on it you think its time we had another little chat with harry johnson suggested benton not immediately decided dingley why dont we tell his lawyers we want to see him again in say three or four days that somethings come up during ongoing forensic examination that we dont understand and then listen to the phone taps to hear who he calls right agreed benton at once why dont we do that were killing a lot of mice said ted lapidus to save a lot of human lives said parnell mice are genetically our closest match right yes what happens if they ever take over start killing us off with their experiments to save their lives i saw the movie said parnell i thought it was crap the mice would have loved it i gather nothings happening apart from killing mice questioned parnell nothing confirmed the greek geneticist anything from russell benn a hollow echo a week ago days ago the impatience would have welled up within him but now parnell didnt feel any frustration not that is with his own units efforts but there were outside concerns which he was increasingly coming to believe he had professionally to confront was remiss in fact for not having already done so you got any improved ideas a quicker approach im listening i havent lapidus at once conceded were expecting too much of ourselves parnell accepted that wasnt in any way intended as personal criticism but just as easily recognized it could be taken as such although he had not intended to couldnt remember doing so he supposed he could have infused his own unrealistic overambitious expectation into the rest of his team it would have been a bad professional mistake if he had scientists in a hurry missed things sometimes the most obvious and almost invariably made mistakes went the wrong way and he was parnell acknowledged thoroughly pissed off with misdirections reverses instead of progress and overall too many dead ends he couldnt though declare a change of approach sorry guys got it wrong dont go at it like a rat up a drainpipe relax take every weekend off leaving early on friday start whenever you choose on monday illogical to drive you as i have been driving you too soon out of research science this is my first managing position thats my problem sorry like i said unthinkable parnell recognized the sort of soulbaring that would once more although worse this time risk the cohesion he believed rebuilt from his last mistake hed talk it through with beverley hed become very comfortable reliant was a word he refused to consider in his relationship with beverley the guilt hadnt gone but hed got it compartmented now packaged and locked away everything under control he wasnt sure didnt in fact believe that paris was under control that what should have been called back had actually been withdrawn with no contribution he could make to any of the eliminations or tests that were being conducted in his department he crossed the corridor for another unannounced visit to russell benn endured the coffee ritual and after thirty minutes got the same impression as lapidus that the chemical and biological division were not only blocked in a dead end like his own but that unlike his own were content to stay there gazing at a blank wall until they got an exit map drawn or suggested by someone else you heard from paris parnell demanded finally about what asked benn their misconceived idea benns face became fixed do you see any point in talking about that any more i thought youd got your acknowledgement i dont want acknowledgement i want to be told and convinced that none of it got out on to the market ask paris or dwight im very definitely out of that loop and dont want to be caught up in it again which was what parnell did the moment he returned to his own unit curious at the strength of benns rejection as on the one previous occasion parnells connection to the french chief executive was immediate although henri sabys response was noticeably more restrained on this occasion whats the difficulty demanded the frenchman the clipped english perfectly modulated i dont know that there is one said parnell what then i received the missing test samples you acknowledged that and gave me the results reminded saby when we talked the last time you told me there were batch designations from which you could tell if everything had been withdrawn if in fact there had been any release reminded parnell in return yes i thought by now all the checks and comparisons would have been carried out through your marketing division and against their records is french marketing a matter for the head of dubettes pharmacogenomics too quick an answer and the wrong answer decided parnell feeling the first lurch of positive concern yes when dubettes pharmacogenomics unit discovered what could have caused human not to say a commercial damage to that marketing im sorry the frenchman immediately retreated i did not wish to sound discourteous i have already been in contact with new york and with your vice president yes questioned parnell i think were straying outside the proper channels of communication as i believe we did when we last spoke its a simple question persisted parnell careless of the irritation have you got it all back or havent you he didnt need to be told parnell decided lets remain within the proper channels of communication refused saby outright youre started parnell too loudly but stopped what were you about to say demanded the frenchman were in the wrong channel of communication said parnell certainly you are you evasive bastard he thought only slightly venting his feelings by slamming down the telephone he slammed the office door too startling everyone in the laboratory on his way out parnell was prepared for another waitingroom sitin but dwight newton didnt keep him waiting frowning up at the obvious anger when parnell thrust into his office it got out didnt it challenged parnell immediately some of that french shit got distributed and hasnt all been got back how much where whats being done parnell ended with his hands on newtons desk leaning over towards the man who visibly pulled back in his chair sit down said newton weakly why dont you sit down i dont want to sit down i want the answers to the questions why had he left it thered always been the nagging doubt but he hadnt responded to it as he should have done which virtually made him as guilty as everyone else please sit down repeated newton he felt beaten exhausted too tired to use his authority or fight any more parnell did sit but stayed forward in his chair demandingly what are the answers dwight sabys just told me you know it all the research vice president shook his head not everything people are still working on it to get it all back itll get done where demanded parnell africa just africa just africa echoed parnell incredulous africas an entire fucking continent which countries in africa for christs sake i dont know not precisely new york does i think i guess itll be east africa thats where the french have their colonial links isnt it parnell forced the control determined against overlooking anything in his fury how much im not sure how much dwight i told you im not sure maybe a few thousand doses a few thousand doses of each or a few thousand in total im not sure parroted newton ive told you its being gotten back its been weeks now theres no way of knowing how much has been used whats been started he knew how to escape newton abruptly decided all very simple very easy why had it taken him so long too long still time hed just get out quit grant couldnt force him to stay no one could premature retirement like harry johnson from the police force be simple enough to get a physicians note if he needed one couldnt imagine that he would maybe something official involving his pension or severance or stockoption valuation his lawyer could handle all that his lawyer and his doctor that was their job newton actually felt a physical relief at the jumbled thoughts unaware that he was slightly smiling what the hells so funny demanded parnell im sorry nothing i wasnt smiling youre not making sense protested parnell i dont know it all new yorks handling it but i know its under control how the hell can it be under control when there are thousands of doses unaccounted for i told you theyre being gotten back theres got to be a public warning insisted parnell everythings got to be named and warnings issued to prescribing doctors and pharmacies public notices newton felt quite calm now as if he were discussing something in which he was quite uninvolved youre probably right but i dont have that authority only new york could initiate a programme like that then new yorks got to do it insisted parnell ill speak to them said newton do i have your word on that dwight were talking urgency here i know youve got my word i promise ill speak to new york if they cant assure me everythings been recovered ill talk about public warnings maybe we should both speak to new york ill suggest that too undertook newton dont suggest it pleaded parnell make it happen or what picked up newton in a week just days hed be away from all this or someones got to said parnell yes are you alone able to talk yes what is it they want to see me again so its something about forensics so i dont know what theyve got mr grant the tone was wheedling subservient what could they have nothing i dont think weve talked everything through i dont want anything to come out wrong for dubette i mean i dont want that either harry thats why were talking like we are talking now why you have this number so we can protect dubette at all times you got anything more to tell me i want to know youre with me when have i ever not been i just want to know you know what about clarkson hes ok hes top of the tree i guess when are you seeing the fbi again coupla days three let me know itll be the flight number something about the fucking flight number remember yes it happened whats the problem ok let me know ok ok edward c grant the president of dubette inc himself said benton turning off the wiretap replay i havent been up to new york in quite a while said dingley time we went again said benton thirtytwo d wight newton had risked doubling the dose of the strongest tranquillizers dubette made welcoming the lightheaded feeling of unreality and sure he could hold on for what he had to do he was tempted to take a third but didnt knowing he couldnt afford a mistake it had been sensible as well to talk first about what he intended with both his personal physician and his lawyer although he was disappointed at the bloodpressure reading his doctor had insisted upon taking despite it supporting the reason for his quitting dubette but because dubette manufactured it he knew the prescribed calcium antagonist would keep it under control the word stayed in newtons uneven mind that was what he was going to do just minutes from now free himself of dubettes control not dubettes newton corrected himself immediately the tentacleencircling control of edward c grant he smiled emptily at people he didnt know entering the corporate building and again in the elevator and when grants personal assistant suggested it was going to be a nice day newton replied that he was sure it was going to be a very nice day indeed pleased at the quickness of his reply grant was at his favourite vantage point at the penthouse window when newton entered and he stayed looking out over the manhattan skyline for several moments even though he knew newton was in the room when he finally turned there was a faint although satisfied smile on his face and newton thought the supercilious son of a bitch thinks hes king of all he surveys the expression went at once grant said whats so important you had to come all the way to new york when i hadnt asked you to newton was uncertain at the quickness he hadnt rehearsed what he was going to say and wanted to get it over with as soon as possible but at the same time hed hoped for a slightly longer leadup to savour the eventual moment im resigning asking for premature retirement whatever you want to call it youre what exclaimed grant smiling in disbelief quitting dubette declared newton he took the envelope from inside his jacket and pushed it across the overly large desk towards the now seated president heres the formal letter newton wished his hands and face hadnt felt so numb still in control though knew what he was doing saying sit down dwight ordered grant sit down and lets talk it was practically a replay of his conversation with parnell remembered newton he didnt like it having to appear that he was obeying the man theres nothing to talk about i think theres a lot to talk about said grant i wont have things sprung on me like this newton nodded towards the untouched envelope im not springing anything on anyone im sick severe hypertensions the most obvious its all set out in there in a supporting letter from my doctor hypertension is easily treated dismissed grant it isnt my only problem or yours he thought hed expected more immediate anger from the man and was glad it hadnt come all he wanted now was to get out back to washington hed take another tranquillizer on the plane i got the impression that things werent right said grant newton was confused by the remark not understanding it then you cant be surprised barbara didnt think it was this bad the response silenced newton his last formal assessment with barbara spacey had been months ago just before the last seminar and until now he hadnt known grant received personal copies my recollection is that she had little to remark upon from our previous session he was sure thats what shed written easily aroused irritability a tendency to believe himself manipulated quoted grant i dont recollect that in my copy of her assessment protested newton his control faltering it was in my account stated grant simply you have started newton running out of words in his astonishment at the apparent disclosure that those seemingly pointless repetitive encounters with the tentattired psychologist were grants way literally to get inside selected peoples minds so youre not surprised he managed youre my vice president supervising everything thats ongoing in dubette research and development said grant is it likely that i am going to agree to your leaving taking with you everything that you know you dont have to remind me of the confidentiality agreement i had it all reexplained to me by my lawyer yesterday im not looking for another job with another pharmaceutical company im getting out of the business quitting like i told you youve discussed it with your lawyer grants voice rose for the first time although only slightly and my doctor i dont want you to go dwight wont allow you to go i want you to have a full medical at the centre at mclean talk to barbara again maybe and well get whatever seems to be the problem out of the way im going insisted newton sure his voice didnt betray the nervousness an encounter with the other man always engendered ive just told you ive talked with a lawyer his advice is that you cant legally hold me grant frowned i think my lawyers might disagree do you want to put that to the test in court newtons voice still gave no hint of his inward hollowing turmoil it was difficult to believe he was confronting grant like this i wasnt threatening dwight why dont you tell me what you want the edward c grant approach to any difficulty thought newton beat it into submission or buy it i told you what i want i want intend to leave the board have got to agree the surrender period of stock options said grant if we agree their immediate valuation youd lose a lot of money that is a threat recognized newton and you know what i dont give a damn im gone and you know something else theres nothing you can do about it he hesitated this worms turned and the moment he said it he wished he hadnt but it didnt matter only getting away from grant mattered and he was going to do it going to escape grant sniggered you sure as hell are upset arent you i dont ever remember calling you a worm but if thats what you think of yourself as he shrugged intentionally not continuing not as upset as you might be said newton desperate to recover parnell knows we havent got all the french stuff back he wants a public warning what exclaimed grant the carefully controlled anger exploding at last he wanted to come with me make the demand in person who told him hed done it thought newton triumphantly hed knocked edward c fucking grant off his selfsatisfied unassailable perch he talked to paris saby saby refused to say either way told him to talk to me or you and you confirmed it i told him it was being gotten back i dont intend causing dubette any more harm than its already suffered how about i refuse your resignation and fire you instead no pension no stockoption recovery how about i sue you for wrongful dismissal get everything discussed in open court or would that make driving dangerous for me before we got there brilliant that was absolutely brilliant and newton knew despite the lightheadedness that hed stopped the other man dead in his tracks grants face didnt redden the reverse it whitened almost unnaturally making him appear ghoulish i told you i know what you told me refused newton astonished at his own bravery and further emboldened by it just as i know theres no proof no way even of tracing the money it must have cost which was misspent anyway because its cost you double in lost stock value but dubette you personally couldnt withstand the accusation could you just as another fatal car accident any fatal accident would be too much of a coincidence dont worry im not going to make any accusations any more than you are going to fire me youre going to accept my resignation on grounds of ill health and you know what i think id like in addition id like a reference to it at the stockholders meeting some official regret at my departure and an acknowledgement appreciation for everything ive done after all i have done a lot havent i youre right said grant hoarsevoiced the worm has turned hasnt it more than knocked him off his perch newton thought euphorically hed done something hed never believed possible and emerged superior in a confrontation with edward c grant what youre looking at now is its ass ill tie you up in so many legal restrictions and restraints youll think youre a christmas turkey you force me ill contest them in court newton threatened back he had to get out soon he didnt think he could hold on much longer get out dont forget parnell wants an answer or what a problem he can be get out ill tell him to speak to you direct shall i and dont forget my official acknowledgement at the stockholders meeting grant sat unspeaking spectrelike behind his overpowering desk newton rose but didnt immediately turn this has almost made up for all the hell ive gone through working for you ed almost but not enough i dont think thered ever be enough get out yelled grant yet again newton thought there was a falter in the hoarseness of the other mans voice but wasnt sure perhaps he was hoping too much he had after all achieved more than hed ever imagined possible there was a water cooler in the vestibule and newton knew he couldnt wait until he got on the plane hurrying to it he gulped the third tranquillizer grateful there was a cab immediately outside on wall street because his eyes suddenly began to fog and his vision to ebb and flow richard parnell had been surprised and encouraged to learn from another attempt to talk to the man that newton was in new york less than fortyeight hours after their confrontation but within three hours of his arriving at mclean that morning there was a deflection from his most immediate concern with the smiling presence of ted lapidus at the now open office door we havent stopped killing mice but were slowing it down announced the greek im trying not to get excited parnell was greeted in the main laboratory by the rest of the dedicated research team all smiling as well lapidus said its seans show he should tell you the japaneseamerican said this could be premature a fluke im not ringing any bells and dont think we should for a long time yet but ive prolonged the life of six sarsinfected mice so far for seven days two weeks ago i had sameday mortality vaccination asked parnell immediately sato nodded there was no way or proper reason to imagine we could reduce the virulence it was far too fierce because of that i concentrated on killing the virus completely the rest of us tried the jenner approach to smallpox infecting with something closely allied but not fatal broke in lapidus predictably nothing worked i boiled a selection of samples of the sars virus in variously concentrated acids resumed sato the mice ive got still alive this morning were vaccinated by the virus sample killed by an acid ratio of twenty per cent whats their condition asked parnell theyre sick conceded sato at once theyre going to die but i think were going in the right direction how are you following it it could lead to a vaccine accepted parnell why he wondered hadnt beverley told him of the progress and immediately answered himself she was part of a team which he wasnt yet and hadnt allowed their personal involvement to influence her professionally which was the same rule that he and rebecca had so briefly tried to follow he reminded himself uncomfortably further minimal dilution said sato which i think some of us should switch over to said lapidus i agree decided parnell at once you tried dna colourtagging far too soon frowned sato this is the first time weve kept our mice alive for more than a day too impatient apologized parnell at once as ted said its exciting were taking blood samples though for dna mutations and matching for eventual colouring we will be from now on from our six survivors said lapidus were talking sars isolated parnell what about avian flu bev and i have been trying the same route said deke pulbrow the avian virus is a big bastard with muscles were not getting anywhere edward jenner virtually invented vaccination by preventing smallpox with the injection of the far less virulent cowpox over two hundred and fifty years ago said parnell speaking the thought aloud as it came to him weve been concentrating on the virus because the haemagglutinin has been discovered theres a lot of samples from the other two pandemics in and why dont we spend a little time following jenner obviously reducing toxicity but seeing what happens when we vaccinate with one of the previous outbreak viruses and then infecting with this latest one we havent tried it so far said beverley so why not were behind on sars according to the published papers reminded lapidus i thought wed decided were not in a race said parnell thered be more than enough room in the marketplace for two products if we came in second third even he was thinking like a commercially orientated scientist parnell realized surprised newton would be pleased what he was being told was exciting but it would be premature to talk about it to the research director this early at last weve got a focus for each set of experiments declared lapidus we hope its a focus qualified parnell i think its good well done lets see where it takes us parnell waited until midafternoon before approaching newtons office again the secretary told him the vice president had called to say he was sick and wouldnt be returning to the office that day he wasnt sure he would be in the following day either dingley and benton separately compared the transcript of the automatically recorded conversation between the metro dc controlroom dispatcher and the arresting squad car with their previous interview statements from harry johnson helen montgomery and peter bellamy benton looked up first and said the dispatcher didnt say anything about rebeccas car being forced over the edge of any gorge bellamy and the woman only said they thought it had been mentioned reminded dingley that they werent sure johnson was more definite argued benton its not a smoking gun insisted dingley something that might unsettle them along with johnsons thumb print and the internal investigation said benton we do them first or pay a visit to edward c grant wondered dingley them first proposed benton we might prompt another call from johnson to new york id like a damned sight more than that first conversation id like a damned sight more about anything complained dingley were not looking good on this old buddy in fact were looking downright fucking bad and i am no longer as glad as i was that we got a case this highprofile me neither agreed benton our problem is what to do with it now that weve got it i wish i knew said dingley i wish that very much indeed thirtythree it was david bentons idea to change the previous routine and arrange the interviews with harry johnson and the two metro dc officers to a tightly controlled schedule preventing any intervening exchange between the three the fbi agents ensured that each of the personal lawyers as well as the attorneys for dubette and metro dc police knew not just of the agenda but also its sequence in the hope of unsettling the security chief and the two police officers more successfully than they had previously johnson was first he wore the same crisply pressed suit as before but this time there was none of the bravado swagger he sat in the fieldoffice interview room between william clarkson and peter baldwin pointedly avoiding eye contact with either fbi agent deferring to clarkson to acknowledge the reminder that he had already been read his miranda rights against selfincrimination and also during the discussion about formal recording clarkson agreed to the tape procedure and waited until it started before stating that he was aware of the formal warning of a later court challenge from peter bellamys representative and placing on record the possibility of his entering a matching inadmissibility objection in the event of any charges being proffered against his client i also wish recorded that my client has fully cooperated whenever called upon to do so continued clarkson a cooperation which is noted and which is appreciated said dingley fact is continued benton weve come up with a few more things that puzzle us that photograph of you and helen and bellamy for instance i declined to allow my client to answer that question said clarkson i continue with that advice why is that said dingley it has no bearing on this enquiry whatsoever it has a very direct bearing on whether mr johnson knew or did not know officers montgomery and bellamy before they arrived at dubette inc on the day they arrested richard parnell said benton why demanded the lawyer the inconsistency between what officers montgomery and bellamy have told us that they knew your client and his assertion that he didnt know them i forgot burst in johnson shrugging off clarksons restraining hand its as simple as that i think that photograph was taken at my farewell party a whole bunch of metro dc police guys having a good time having a few drinks now ive seen the pictures of course i can remember them but only as people i saw around and i didnt recognize them the day they arrived at mclean to ask about rebecca lang tell us about edward grant suddenly asked dingley instantly there was the caughtinheadlights blink of the previous encounter clarkson looked enquiringly sideways but johnson didnt respond peter baldwin said as the attorney representing dubette id like an explanation of that question both agents ignored him still talking to the security chief dingley repeated tell us about edward grant what about him said johnson thats what were asking you said benton id like this explained baldwin continued to protest you friendly with him harry know him socially maybe this is ridiculous said baldwin sir said dingley turning to the company lawyer at last i think we could be very close to a criminal investigation being impeded he switched back to johnson whats the answer harry how well do you know the president of dubette inc of course i know of him said the bulging man because he is the president of the company you know him when you joined dubette way back in no even before you joined dubette when you were in metro dc police administration surrounded with all those computers and records and files this transcript will be challenged declared clarkson absolutely said baldwin supportively we got the court release harry of all those internal investigations said benton interesting reading you got a special relationship with the president harry picked up dingley i want started baldwin but johnson spoke over him i am the head of a division of course i know mr grant and he knows me its that sort of company somebody told us about that one big happy family remarked benton so how soon did you get to know edward grant after you joined dubette i dont remember not exactly a few months maybe even though he spends most of his time in new york said dingley he comes down often enough thats the only time you see him the only times you speak seized benton on the occasions when he comes down from new york the blinking had subsided replaced by the wariness which both agents recognized johnson said thereve been occasions when weve talked in new york pressed dingley the guardedness stayed but johnson shifted in his chair as if preparing himself i told you before that my section has to be alert for people drug dependants trying to enter the premises gain access in some way theres another sort of burglary nothing to do with addiction commercial stealing by competitors that in fact is far more serious than losing a few phials of tranquillizers or stimulants if a competitor got an informant inside mclean it could cost the company millions millions in wasted research expenditure and millions more if someone else got the product on to the market first thats how and why mr grant and i talk sometimes how you going to new york asked dingley or when he comes down to washington i dont go to new york when he comes down to washington sometimes by phone where is this taking us demanded baldwin once more the agents ignored the intervention benton said to baldwin mr grant obviously knows about your involvement in this case have you and he spoken about it i have been keeping new york informed of every aspect of the enquiry to the extent to which i know about it said baldwin has mr grant spoken to you about it asked dingley through dwight newton i know that he was and continues to be extremely distressed as does the rest of the board said the company lawyer mr grant ordered that every assistance be given to everyone involved he even offered to pay for rebeccas funeral and the reception afterwards the family declined the switch back to harry johnson was like a whip snap dingley said howd you think part of your left thumb print came to be on the flight number you said you didnt know anything about the only print in fact on that piece of paper found in rebeccas purse how began clarkson but this time it was johnson who put his arm sideways silencing the lawyer i think i know said johnson i didnt remember it still dont not in the way that helps but some time back a shipment from paris got lost i got involved looking for it so did rebecca coordinating shipments was a part of her job the actual flight number as being the one that got involved and cancelled in a terrorist alert didnt register with me but i think it was the one that the shipment was supposed to have been on how long was that before her death asked benton i dont know shrugged johnson weeks i guess was the shipment found yes said johnson at once it was a customs mixup at the french end so why did rebecca keep the number in her purse said benton johnson shrugged again i havent any idea i didnt even know it was there until you told me and even then couldnt account for it as you have now said dingley not trying to hide the disbelief its the best the only explanation i can give you said johnson no longer unsettled i realize my not being able to account for it until now might have caused some confusion misled you even im really very sorry about that it seems perfectly understandable to me said clarkson i see it as yet another example of my client doing everything he can to cooperate and help an ongoing criminal investigation once again the similarity between the answers of helen montgomery and peter bellamy indicated close rehearsal and once again the interviews were cluttered with interventions and objections by their respective lawyers there was no contradiction between the two officers as to who listed the contents of rebecca langs handbag the woman said she itemized everything for bellamy to create the inventory how exactly did you do that dingley asked helen montgomery did you take things out individually one at a time or what i think i tipped everything out on the table and separated them piece by piece for pete to write down separated them how asked benton the woman frowned i dont understand by hand prompted dingley maybe maybe with a pencil so that they wouldnt be marked and i kinda think i kept my driving gloves on you didnt get given that handbag until you got back to the station right said dingley right she agreed after youd left harry johnson back at mclean said benton yes howd you explain the piece of paper with the af flight number that you told us you found in rebecca langs purse having harry johnsons thumb print on it said dingley helen montgomery showed no uncertainty or surprise neither her personal lawyer donald sinclair nor the metro dc police attorney intervened ms montgomery pressed benton i cant said the woman calmly havent you asked harry instead of answering benton said did harry johnson give that flight number to you at mclean to put among rebecca langs belongings that started phillip brack the police attorney is not an improper or inappropriate question refused benton please answer it ms montgomery absolutely not the woman refused the indignation sounding genuine the first time i saw that piece of paper was when i emptied the purse on to the table i didnt even know guess it was a flight number until i opened it out so you did touch it demanded dingley handled it like i said i think i had my uniform gloves on and you didnt find it difficult clumsy to open a scrap of paper wearing thick leather gloves i guess not the metro dc dispatcher didnt say anything about ms langs car being forced over into a gorge when you got sent to mclean said benton we got the transcript i must have got that wrong said helen montgomery without any hesitation i think i told you before that i wasnt sure i must have been told when we got back to the station and got it mixed up in my mind as a police officer do you often get things mixed up in your mind asked benton officer montgomery declines to answer that question said brack on the instructions of us both added her lawyer peter bellamy was only slightly less assured than his partner most obviously when dingley disclosed johnsons thumb print and let his lawyer hilda jeffries reply for him that there was no way he could answer such a question which should be put to johnson she did not let him respond to the accusation that either he or helen montgomery had planted the paper after being handed it by johnson when they first arrived at mclean protesting that the suggestion was preposterous we got a chink to prise open insisted dingley it was a sandwich lunch again both men anxious to review the mornings work neither of them with any thought of celebrations on th street that big objected benton narrowing his thumb against his forefinger so closely that there was no visible gap its something insisted dingley and weve still got grant wholl meet us fully briefed by the company lawyer predicted benton he doesnt know about the telephone tap which hasnt produced anything worthwhile to put before a court refused benton so far we havent learned much more than that johnson likes telephone sex to jerk off to and pepperoni and chilli homedelivered pizza in italy pepperoni and chilli pizza is probably a crime pity it isnt a federal offence here theyre good all three of them reluctantly conceded dingley seriously too damned good which is how they got away with everything in you really think johnson was on dubettes payroll before he left the force id bet my pension on it if we cant prove that johnson is lying about the flight number if all weve got is his explanation then theres no terrorism link and if theres no terrorism link theres no grounds for fbi involvement said dingley if grant is in some way involved its conspiracy across state lines and thats us whether terrorism is in the mix or not contradicted benton according to ed pullinger the gods at the j edgar hoover building are pissed off up to here with the heat theyre getting from the department of homeland security and every media outlet as far away as outer mongolia wherever the hell that is said dingley and you and i aint got teflon asses you dont need to tell me that either said benton im not looking forward to new york as much as i was neither am i richard parnell had only ever been to manhattan twice both times before taking up the dubette genetics directorship tourist map in hand exhausted walking towards skyscraper landmarks he could see but which never appeared to get any closer like retreating mirages in a highrise desert beverley had promised to take him to the real parts hed never seen which served things other than hamburgers and hot dogs and as the shuttle turned over the bay into le guardia parnell resolved to take up the promise uncomfortably yet again remembering rebeccas mockery of his not knowing america beyond a milelong traffic lane into north virginia and a mile walk into georgetown parnell was surprised at the summons to dubette headquarters as he was by the continued absence from mclean of dwight newton whose personal assistant was now saying she had no idea when the research vice president would be medically allowed to return which concentrated parnells mind on why he was in new york no longer the tourist he was glad he was here in person not trusting newton as the warning intermediary how much how far could he trust edward c grant the big brother lookalike not an immediate consideration the immediate absolutely essential consideration was getting the assurance from the man in authority that every available warning was circulated as widely as possible throughout the african countries they distributed to about an unknown quantity of potentially fatal medicines and if he didnt get that assurance he needed to decide what he personally was going to do there was nothing really to decide he thought at once he supposed he should talk first to barry jackson although ethically the confidentiality restrictions didnt apply and it would be too late for dubette to invoke them anyway he had to find his own way to sound the alarm and as his taxi crossed the triboro bridge he looked down the east river to the united nations skyscraper and decided that would be a convenient start it was a magiccarpet ascent to the penthouse level when parnell identified himself at the groundfloor reception the door to edward grants panoramicview office already open in readiness for his arrival the smiling whitehaired man slightly back from the doorway to prevent his shortness being too obviously framed in the doorway grant only allowed the briefest of handshaking greetings before retreating behind his protective desk this meetings long overdue announced the company president and mines the fault for which i apologize what you did about france was outstanding and i should have personally thanked you long before now i told you at the seminar i was expecting great things i never imagined the proof would be so immediate the man allowed the break and i also want you to know how very very sorry i was about ms lang and what happened to you thank you said parnell i know you refused our legal representation your choice but the offer that was passed on to you remains anything dubette can do thats very generous and i appreciate it said parnell its france i want to talk about you spoken to dwight parnell shook his head not since he came here his office say hes ill on the very edge of a complete nervous breakdown according to his doctor and dubettes barbara spacey as well whom ive had see him i had no idea said parnell none of us did said grant hell get every treatment of course treatment queried parnell hospitalization said grant dwights seriously unwell its going to take a long time no one can predict how successful the recovery will be he collapsed apparently when he got back from seeing me a highway patrol found him talking to himself on a layby the car still running they thought at first he was drunk the mood switchbacks had always been unpredictable but parnell had never suspected newton to be seriously mentally unwell theres been nothing said no indication at mclean why parnell wondered had grant asked if hed spoken to newton if the man were as ill as this thered been warnings from his doctor thats what he came up to tell me and to resign as research vice president resign said parnell hed been with dubette for more than twenty years his contribution to the company is incalculable there was another hesitation can you believe as sick as he was coming up here to resign he still managed to tell me of your concern yes i can said parnell bringing himself back to the purpose and the determination of his being in new york i think it should be your concern too im not convinced the french mistakes have been cleared up i tried to find out when i spoke to henri saby he told me to talk to dwight or to you dwight said it was still being recovered obviously theres a lot still in circulation thousands of doses according to dwight theres got to be a public statement a warning if theres not and there are provable deaths dubette could be destroyed parnell checked himself hearing what he was saying the deaths dont have to be provable people children will die if they take the medicines dubettes french subsidiary has put out on the market i know said grant the simplicity of the answer and the admission deflated parnells carefully prepared argument whats being done newton said everything youve told me although perhaps not as well said grant as i told you im surprised that as ill as he was he managed to tell me anything ive already spoken to france theyre checking distribution in any country from which theres not been full recovery a warning has been issued through national governments to health authorities and quite separately through national and local media outlets nothings going to be allowed to remain unaccounted for you really mean that promise that said parnell do you have the presumption to question me demanded grant affronted its not presumption said parnell unintimidated its a very real and genuine concern which is precisely whats motivating me and why ive authorized the action that i have i said parnell seeking words thank you for the assurance and for doing thank you is it conceivable that i wouldnt no im still glad to know its been done youve proved yourself richard not in the way i expected but in a way for which dubette will be forever grateful i see it as one of the functions for which i am employed dwight wont be coming back said grant hes resigned as i told you hell hopefully recover hes going to get every care and treatment to ensure that he does but hell never be able to resume the responsibility of research director thats unfortunate sad said parnell at once aware of his own hypocrisy practically from his first day at dubette hed lost any respect for newton i want you to take the position announced the president youve more than proved your ability and your integrity here today i couldnt be more surprised parnell managed therell be a salary increase obviously and stock options the lawyers will have to work it out like they have to work everything out im thinking in the region of six hundred thousand dollars therell be travel opportunities too i dont want another debacle like paris part of your increased responsibilities will be to visit the overseas subsidiaries make sure none of them ever come up with such a halfassed idea ever again parnell shook his head as ive said im totally surprised astonished i need time to think i dont know why but of course said the dubette president at the stockholders meeting im going to announce dwights prematurely enforced retirement i want to announce your succession at the same time i dont want any vacuums you said to call what was it demanded grant forensics like i said my thumb print was on the flight number what did you tell them about the lost shipment not a problem then clarkson doesnt think so what about the other two clarkson wont let me speak to them direct hes spoken to their attorneys he says theyre standing up fine the fbi want to talk to me they asked me about you what did you tell them that we talked from time to time about security which we do yes newtons sick collapsed hes leaving the company what do you want me to do nothing barbaras seen him thinks the treatment will wipe his mind clean im giving the job to parnell there was a pause from washington that going to mean any changes we keep dealing direct you and i what about the surveillance lift it maybe we should talk after youve seen the fbi maybe as before the line went dead without any farewell thirtyfour the review preparation was for its later submission to fbi lawyers for their decision but it enabled dingley and benton to fly up to new york fully rehearsed for the meeting with edward c grant both men were subdued no more encouraged by the second intercepted conversation between grant and harry johnson than they were by the first trying to lift the despondency on their way in to manhattan from the airport dingley said we still havent heard back from paris or dulles airfreight you know how high my hopes are for either said benton once again narrowing his thumb and forefinger too closely for any chink of light i suppose we should call in on the guys at the broadway field office suggested dingley lets see how we feel after weve talked with grant said benton wakes depress me nothings dead yet dying by the minute insisted benton peter baldwin was the only person with the dubette president when they were shown into the penthouse office suite it was the company lawyer who made the introductions but grant who solicitously led them away from deskfocused formality to the flickering genuine fireplace around which were arranged leatherupholstered easy chairs and couches both agents refused grants offer of coffee accustomed to the legal assembly of the previous interviews dingley said are we waiting for others who frowned grant i thought said dingley discomfited youre surely not implying mr grant requires a criminal attorney said baldwin they seem to have featured a lot during the enquiry said benton trying to help his partner but no of course were not suggesting that it would have been mr grants right thats all i dont think theres any risk to my rights do you smiled the whitehaired man we appreciate your agreeing to help us said dingley their customary opening im not quite sure how i can but lets get on with it shall we said grant a busy man with a busy schedule there are some inconsistencies in what mr johnsons told us things we cant quite fit into the puzzle said benton you spoken directly to mr johnson since ms langs death yes said grant at once i think he believed it was his job to do so i agreed how many times asked dingley twice frowned grant as if he had difficulty in recalling yes twice did you speak about the flight number in ms langs purse which is the reason for fbi involvement there was another frown there was some mention i think i cant remember precisely what the context was his thumb print was on it said benton hed earlier told us he didnt know anything about a number or why it should have been in ms langs bag really remarked grant and stopped did you and harry johnson specifically discuss the flight number asked benton we might have done after it emerged in court i really cant remember were surprised at the direct communication between you and your security chief declared dingley why demanded the man youre the head of an international conglomerate harry johnson is head of security at mclean said dingley that seems quite a divide you a snob mr dingley i dont believe myself to be sir said the fbi man sounds like it to me said grant i run a different sort of organization than a lot of people than perhaps the fbi i want my chief executives and division heads to talk to me that way problems get solved before they become problems so its not unusual for you and harry to speak persisted dingley not at all how often would you say whenever its necessary shrugged grant how he come up here to report to you direct when youre in washington telephone whichevers convenient shrugged the president again i always make a point of speaking to every division head in dubette whenever im down there and theres the telephone did you know harry johnson before he joined dubette from metro dc police department asked benton before that was my question sir how could i have known him before we thought you might have done said dingley what reason do you have for thinking that came in baldwin just an impression said benton i thought the fbi worked on the basis of evidence and facts said grant i did not know harry johnson before he joined dubette how did that come about his joining dubette asked dingley the previous security chief was retiring recommended harry he seemed to fit the bill who employed him you personally or your personnel division pressed benton it would have been personnel obviously said grant eighty thousand dollars a year is a substantial salary he heads what is considered an important division dubette is noted throughout the industry as a substantial payer you seem well informed about how harry johnson came to be employed said benton im well informed about every senior employee at dubette said grant perhaps security more than most security is very important for a company like mine because of stealing and commercial theft and piracy anticipated benton precisely agreed grant you suffer a lot of it we take every precaution to ensure that we dont when was the last time asked dingley building up to what he and his partner hoped to be the puncturing question there was the now familiar shrug there was some warehouse pilfering about three months ago did you get the guys asked benton it was a delivery driver supplying pills to kids he drew a year id have liked it to have been more i know the danger of drugs as well as their benefits what about commercially said dingley last attempt was three years ago a competitor got an informant into mclean harry got him before there was any serious damage i cant imagine richard parnell would steal pills from a dubette warehouse said benton what exclaimed grant astonished we cant imagine richard parnell stealing pills from a warehouse echoed dingley why was he under surveillance mr grant grant looked first to baldwin then to the huge desk with its orderly bank of variously coloured telephones baldwin said wed like an explanation for that question wed like an answer to it said dingley we know of richard parnell being under surveillance and of harry johnson being aware of it its extremely relevant to our terrorism and murder enquiries and we need to know why are you bugging my telephones demanded grant looking back to his desk no replied benton honestly so its harrys said grant answering his own question for which i hope you have a court order said baldwin of course we do said dingley impatiently harry johnson has explained to you how his thumb print came to be on the flight number said the lawyer which youve doubtless told mr grant in detail anticipated benton what no ones explained to us yet is why parnell was under surveillance with harry johnsons knowledge and yours mr grant i would have thought that would have been obvious said the man not to us it isnt said dingley grant sighed all the condescending affability gone a valued member of my company was murdered an elaborate effort was made to frame a senior executive for that murder for which as i understand it you have no suspects i believed that parnell might remain in danger i felt it justified the setting up of some protective security having photographs taken even to see if parnell might be being watched by a person or a group of people its been pointless the man paused looking to the telephone bank again and as you obviously know ive spoken to harry about it told him to lift everything so you no longer fear richard parnell is in danger said dingley i think it would have happened some attempt would have been made by now said the dubette president i was being overprotective having parnell under surveillance wouldnt have actually prevented anything happening to him would it said benton it would if it had established he was being stalked these photographs said benton whos been taking them a private detective agency said grant wed like its name said dingley get it from harry snapped grant i dont know it im surprised that you dont as closely as you and harry liaise said dingley grant sighed again but didnt speak looking pointedly at the lawyer baldwin said is there anything else with which we can help you during your conversation with harry johnson you asked and i quote what about the other two what other two would that be mr grant said benton the two suspended metro dc police officers obviously said the man why were you curious about them pressed benton the suggestion is that they mistreated wrongly arrested a senior dubette executive isnt it and part of johnsons reply to your question and again i quote is he he being clarkson harry johnsons lawyer says theyre standing up fine what did you understand from that reply mr grant im not sure that i understood anything from it you asked about them johnson gives you a reply you dont understand and you dont ask him to explain it pressed dingley no i didnt said grant do you still find it difficult to understand now that were talking about it now that youve had time to think about it said benton yes said grant before johnson says that the two metro dc officers are standing up well he says and again i quote clarkson wont let me speak to them direct persisted benton weve got two police officers who are alleged to have mistreated wrongly arrested a senior member of dubettes staff and harry johnson wants to talk to them but then tells you theyre standing up fine you know how that looks to my partner and i mr grant it looks like there was collusion between the three wouldnt you say thats an interpretation i dont think mr grant can usefully speculate as you are speculating said the lawyer what i do think is that there is an obvious inference that if it is pursued could result in consideration of the sort of court action in which a quite separate claim has already been mounted which could seriously embarrass you two gentlemen personally and your already seriously embarrassed ineffective employer the fbi to a far greater degree the question was put to mr grant who has not answered said the unintimidated benton i think mr baldwin has already adequately answered on my behalf refused grant what i would say is that i think it is very fortunate for you both that i did not bother to include criminal lawyers in this interview which is concluded at this time declared baldwin if the federal bureau of investigation seeks to resume it it will be conducted in the different sort of circumstances that mr grant has indicated outside the dubette building on wall street dingley said you fancy calling in on the guys broadways only just up the road why dont we just get on back said benton yeah why dont we agreed dingley beverley jackson was the only one in the pharmacogenomics division to know of parnells visit to new york and then not in detail because he maintained his decision not to involve her or anyone else any further in the french neardisaster and there was in any case something far more immediate when he arrived back at mclean why are they dying again so quickly when theyre vaccinated by lesserstrength preparations parnell rhetorically asked sean sato it doesnt make sense the disappointment was palpable throughout the laboratory i said the six we kept alive could have been a fluke reminded sato ive gone back to the twenty per cent ratio what about blood from those that survived longer demanded parnell any specific molecular assault none said lapidus we cant attempt to colour match the new tests because we dont have a suspect dna host what about those that died subsequently nothing said deke pulbrow what about the brief survivors persisted parnell anything different about them from the others who subsequently died anything about their strain breed suppliers diet anything at all like that he was conscious of the anxiety in his own voice everything checked even their comparable weights and ages said beverley nothing we started yet with the twenty per cent ratio sato shook his head we waited to talk it through with you lets follow blood suggested parnell isolate the mice individually no urine or faeces contamination between any strictly measured and itemized food blood tests from all before infecting with sars and daily no halfdaily sampling after infecting for dna comparison between those treated and those untreated which assumes there will be a survival over a period of days commented lapidus well have an additional test parnell pointed out weve got the blood of the first survival group if we dont get a dna profile somewhere out of that lifes not fair my mother always told me that it wasnt said pulbrow and my mother was always right it was not until two nights later when they were eating once more at beverleys favourite midtown restaurant that parnell told her of dwight newtons breakdown and edward grants offer poor dwight was beverleys first reaction i hardly knew him and what i did know i didnt particularly like but to be too ill to work again is a rough call its not going to be announced until after the stockholders meeting warned parnell im not likely to tell anyone promised the woman what about you you going to take it i havent decided not yet vice president responsible for research and development in just under a year she said with faint mockery the upward rise of richard parnell continues if i take it of course youll take it well see you coming back tonight i thought youd never ask i was beginning to wonder if it was all over when they entered parnells apartment beverley went at once to the lidded laptop on the bureau and said hey whats this dubettes new vice president has got himself a new toy its convenient said parnell i can access anything i want at mclean and download it here if i want i should have thought of it before you know what they say about all work and no play its turned off isnt it said parnell uncomfortably reminded yet again of rebeccas similar remark if it wasnt id turn it off said beverley i want to play so its a nono demanded dingley when ed pullinger finished telling them the legal opinion on what youve got so far confirmed the lawyer after the shit we got following nineeleven were not going to move on anything we cant come out of with haloes and marching music everything here would be challenged discredited or ruled inadmissible and wed lose lose that is if the attorney general would even consider a grand jury let alone any court hearing you know what youve got here youve got a hell of a lot that could help barry jackson in his civil action diddly squat for a criminal prosecution and thats disappointing everyone at the j edgar hoover building because this is highprofile and all were getting is more shit you thought of talking to barry jackson parnell maybe asked benton and risk my pension smiled the lawyer who would ever know asked dingley barry jackson called parnell at mclean just before lunch the following day the lawyer said just got a call from the fbi might be an idea for you to come along thirtyfive so what have you got demanded barry jackson exasperated when the fbi lawyer finally stopped talking they had been for more than thirty minutes in barry jacksons office all the calls held neither jackson nor parnell had spoken throughout until now a conspiracy of some sort said ed pullinger its what sort to achieve what result that we dont know and dont at the moment think we can find out are you saying that johnson the two police officers and edward grant conspired to kill rebecca demanded parnell as incredulous as his lawyer no denied pullinger at once ive just told you we dont know havent got sufficient to prove anything against anyone but theres something there to prove very definitely something that isnt right the fingerprint on the flight number seized jackson johnson says hed given it to rebecca but forgotten about it some time ago forensically its possible to distinguish between old and new fingerprints we know that we also know that its new not something given to rebecca weeks ago so hes lying broke in parnell yes hes lying agreed the fbi attorney but why a consignment scheduled on that flight did go missing charles de gaulle airport confirm it and dulles airport confirm it and paris customs admit it was their fault there was a foulup over a shipment remembered parnell dullvoiced rebecca used it as an excuse to call paris direct to try to find out what the mystery was and it got found said pullinger if we had a case to bring if thered been a fibre match from the flick knife or if the paint in johnsons locker had matched your car the lie about the flight number being old would be something to introduce as it is its nothing except another question we cant answer rebecca never dealt with johnson as far as i know the only shipments he worried about were those addressed to the box number as far as you know echoed pullinger a lost consignment is the sort of thing a security man would get involved in a security man parnell echoed back not the head of security not according to grant refused pullinger he told our guys security is one of the most important divisions in a business like dubettes it would be an easy argument to make that johnson was involved without rebeccas knowledge howd johnson get over two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in his account demanded jackson he gets eighty thousand a year and says hes a lucky gambler hes quoted us winning horses and las vegas visits when weve challenged him on substantial cash deposits the horses did win and hotel reservations match the dates against the name harry johnson as well as the creditcard charges with his provable signature so johnson never loses said parnell in desperate cynicism and it doesnt look as if hes going to this time said pullinger grants explanation about surveillance is total bullshit decided the other lawyer what did the detective agency say they didnt know they were being engaged by dubette they identified johnson from a photograph dingley and benton showed them pullinger looked directly at parnell their brief was to watch your apartment and photograph anyone you left or entered with if anyone entered they had to time their departure discover who the person was and where they lived whod the photographs go to they had a cellphone number listed under a phoney name they called it and johnson came immediately to pick up what they had you got copies asked jackson pullinger looked at parnell again yes what who do they show its a little started pullinger awkwardly beverley anticipated parnell there would have been some photographs of beverley its not a secret ed dismissed jackson what about others there arent any others said pullinger and surveillance has been pulled off they were supposed to be looking for people stalking richard not richard himself or who went into his apartment said jackson grant lied like johnson lied yes agreed pullinger as immediately as before but about what lying to the fbi isnt a crime in itself if it was the entire state of texas would be concreted over for one great big federal penitentiary i cant believe this protested parnell i cant believe you can do nothing about all thats happened a murder for christs sake barry only saved me by by a good memory not a fluke completed the lawyer unoffended to pullinger he said if youve got to accept johnsons explanation about the flight number theres no cause any more for fbi involvement no not unless theres any evidence of conspiracy across state borders which you havent got said jackson who takes over the murder enquiry it cant be metro dc im suing the two arresting officers the entire department could come under investigation again just like in i cant work it out and im glad its the attorney generals headache not mine said pullinger wait a minute demanded parnell the bureau with all its facilities and expertise are at a dead end and it could easily be ruled its no longer an fbi investigation anyway the police department who would normally be responsible are disqualified you cant guess and the attorney general hasnt decided who should take over is that it thats it accepted pullinger but we havent been ruled out yet you going to disclose the flightnumber explanation to the department of homeland security and the attorney general asked jackson were mandated to do so said pullinger can you imagine what the bureau would be hit with if it was announced it was withdrawing from an investigation thats got as much media attention as this has in which it had no need to be in the first place wed be ankledeep in blood no ones going to be caught for rebeccas murder are they said parnell weakvoiced in acceptance at what he was being told no ones ever going to know why rebecca was murdered by whom theyre going to get away with it whoever killed rebecca and tried to get me convicted of it are going to get away scot free i said we hadnt been taken off the enquiry yet the thinking at the hoover building at the moment is that its better to take the heat we are getting for not making any progress than use johnsons flightnumber explanation as a way of getting out what are you more worried about concerned with justice or saving the fucking fbi any more embarrassment exploded parnell both equally said pullinger calmly if we could get the first wed achieve the second ive just tried to explain the difficulties we appreciate it thanked the more controlled jackson you got any hearing date preliminaries even asked pullinger jackson didnt immediately reply looking steadily at the other lawyer before saying were getting close to disclosures obviously nothing that ive told you today can be included said pullinger obviously acknowledged jackson have you ever heard of investigating fbi officers being called as supplementary witnesses after the emergence of evidence unknown at the time of disclosure dont think i ever have admitted pullinger anything in the fbi charter that would preclude it id need to check but nothing comes immediately to mind it was good of you to come ed fill us in on a few things thanked jackson again id welcome your letting us know if your guys get officially withdrawn youll know the moment i know promised the fbi attorney to parnell he said im sorry its worked out like this not as sorry as i am said parnell you sure theres no way the fbi could have intercepted the call demanded edward grant johnson smiled enjoying the other mans rarely betrayed worry i gave clarkson the callbox number in an envelope sealed in a way that could be recognized if you knew how which he didnt he gave it to pete bellamys dyke lawyer to pass on unopened when i rang pete from my call box i told him how to recognize the seal it hadnt been broken what if one of the lawyers tells the bureau lawyerclient confidentiality replied johnson easily grant smiled relieved thats good youre good thats what you employ me and pay me to be youll find out how grateful i am when this is all over which it will be promised johnson baldwin filled me in on your meeting and pete says he and helen havent given anything away nothing that helps any case against us anyway the hesitation was for effect theres still the civil case against them of course if they lose that it could cost them their jobs you got another callbox to callbox arrangement in a couple of days i told pete i was coming up to see you tell him and get him to tell the woman theyll be well looked after theyll appreciate that said johnson you dont think there could be a problem with your coming up here what problem im your head of security the bureau know we talk that i come here sometimes i flew up using my own name came in the front door and used the public elevator the curiosity would have been if i hadnt come up after they came here i didnt like that the fbi coming here questioning me like they did the small man flicked at his deepbrown suit as if dislodging some unwelcome speck and its showing all over your sweaty face thought the security chief this hasnt been good too much was done with insufficient thought and insufficient discussion baldwin told you what i said to them about putting parnell under surveillance johnson nodded they havent come back to me to check it out enjoying himself unsettling a man who so much enjoyed unsettling others he added something else that didnt have sufficient thought or discussion they sprang it on me for christs sake you should have guessed theyd tap your phones he should johnson supposed i didnt think theyd go that far believe they had enough to apply for the order in the end there was no damage if they had enough for the order perhaps theyve got enough to charge you suggested grant in fresh alarm with what forgetfulness jeered johnson ive been through it every which way with clarkson theyve got nothing what do we do now just that nothing we carry on doing our jobs and let their investigation run into the ground and from now on im king of the castle and youre a dirty old rascal he thought so stop worrying ed ok ok said grant without objecting to the familiarity the lovemaking over parnell and beverley lay side by side in the darkness of her apartment bedroom hand in hand you know whats creepy she said its learning that we were being watched photographed without knowing it its like being being violated and i was supposed to be taking extra care watching my own back all the time im sick to my stomach at the possibility of there being no prosecution for rebeccas murder im even sicker what are you going to do if there isnt a prosecution i havent decided what about immediately the vicepresident offer i thought you had to decide before the stockholders meeting i told grant today that ill take it beverley was silent for several moments im surprised im sure were going the right way with a sars vaccine and i dont want to give up on avian flu either im still surprised for surprised should i read disappointed yes after what the fbi lawyer told you she said bluntly we dont definitely know that there isnt going to be a prosecution if there is i have to be here if im definitely told nothings going to happen ill think some more about it beverley took her hand from his and turned away from him in the darkness thirtysix i knew youd accept said edward grant i needed to think said parnell of course you did patronized grant at the penthouse window looking out over the financial heart of the world and you came to the right decision i bought some shares to qualify for the stockholders meeting before you invited me then you bought in cheap got a good deal i hope it turns out that way the board have agreed the terms i offered you said grant turning back to a package on his desk theres your new contract setting out the salary and the stock options for your lawyer to look over ours already have all youve got to do if your guy agrees is to sign it its all happened very quickly weve only got one priority now restoring confidence your name your publicly being here is important in beginning that process and maintaining it you know ill do what i can theres going to be a media release to coincide with my announcement of your appointment not just here worldwide i spoke to wayne denny about dwight said parnell thought i might go out to see him wayne said he didnt think he was well enough he isnt said grant at once wont be for a long time ive got a lot to say about dwight later thats good youve been through a hell of a time too dick and come out well its dragging on you really sure about suing those two sons of bitches my lawyer thinks ive got a good case im doing it on his advice im thinking about dubette all the publicity itll stir up again i hadnt thought about it from that point of view think about it over the next little while urged the president you know what id like for us all id like an outofcourt settlement offer a public apology from the metro force and for that to be the end of it all forgotten in a week it would go a long way towards the healing process restoring the confidence i was talking about parnell shrugged the offer would have to come from the other side your attorney could suggest it to theirs thats how these things are done id really appreciate it dubette would really appreciate it ill talk it through with him tell him thats how you want it to be hes working for you remember ok let me know how it goes ok thats how itll be from now on you and i talking together direct ive got a lot to learn i wouldnt have offered you the position if i hadnt thought you could hack it i hope it doesnt cause any resentment at mclean youre the man there now complete control my complete confidence whatever you need to do to establish yourself do it you want some words of real wisdom please no one likes the man in charge because hes the man in charge and everyone else thinks they can do his job better never worry about not being loved enjoy being disliked and proving them all wrong ill remember that i thought about bringing you on stage when i make the announcement but i dont think that would be right i dont think so either agreed parnell particularly not in the circumstances dwight i mean but ive had a place kept near the front when i announce the appointment id like you to stand up be recognized therell be some media there good job im not wearing the yellow sweater parnell was in fact in a conservative blue ivyleague suit the first hed bought at brooks bros grants face clouded then cleared as the recollection came thats a long time ago a misunderstanding youre part of the family now part of the family echoed parnell theres an invitationonly reception after the meeting youre on the list of course ill see you there there are some people im looking forward to introducing you to im looking forward to meeting them said parnell it was a stopstart journey up a trafficclogged sixth avenue from wall street but parnell was still among the first to arrive the acceptance had been enormous because of the publicity and its effect upon the stock valuation of the company and the ballroom had been taken over parnell shuffled forward in the queue the formal admission ticket his stockholding allowed him in hand as soon as his name was recognized he was escorted to a reserved aisle seat in the fourth row from the front the noise increased as the room gradually filled behind him once parnell swivelled trying to estimate how many people there would be but gave up trying there was a central aisle against which he was sitting with two passages on either side of the seated area in each were already established men with cordless microphones for when the meeting was thrown open to questioning from the floor one was directly in front of the temporary stage beneath a podium parnell ignored the prepared reports awaiting him on his chair he considered opening his contract package but decided against that too three tiered rows of seats were set out on the stage and he guessed the rear two were for the members of the overseas subsidiary boards almost immediately confirmed when the raised area began to be occupied and he recognized henri saby from the washington seminar edward c grant led the parent board on to the dais looking expectantly out into the slowly silencing hall he did not sit but strode at once to the podiummounted microphone his prepared speech which was not among the already distributed papers in hand there was an abrupt blaze of camera and television lights and parnell was instantly reminded of his court appearance and the midtown press conference grant arranged his papers in front of him on the angled stand but made no attempt to start staring out into the room until it became totally quiet when it did he smiled and said good morning and thank you all for coming he did not look down to his speech appearing not to need it dubette had endured a turbulent year due to circumstances beyond anyones control a respected and admired member of staff had been savagely murdered another briefly wrongly accused about neither of which he could comment because of ongoing investigations and possibly impending court actions the adverse publicity had severely affected stock value which he understood to be the concern of everyone in the room there was no need for that concern dubette as an international pharmaceutical conglomerate remained as strong as it had ever been and he was confident it would recover its value in the coming year as an indication of that confidence the dividend this year would be an increase of five per cent upon the last the funds coming from their more than adequate reserves there were to be important changes within dubette it was with great personal as well as professional regret that he had to announce the premature retirement on health grounds of dwight newton who as vice president responsible for research and development had made an incalculable contribution to the commercial success of dubette inc over the past twenty years he was sure the meeting would join him in wishing newton a speedy recovery and contented retirement grant had spoken looking towards the rear of the room now he looked down directly to where he knew parnell was sitting at our annual meeting last year i announced the intention of establishing a pharmacogenomics division from media releases since that time you will all be aware that dubette were successful in recruiting the worldrenowned english geneticist professor richard parnell to head that division it is with great pleasure personal pride and expectation of an enormous contribution to the continuing success of dubette that i today announce that dwight newtons position as head of research and development has been offered to professor parnell grant stepped to the side of the podium gesturing for parnell to stand whom i am introducing to you today there was another glare of camera lights as parnell dutifully stood but moved immediately to the waiting man with the cordless microphone standing directly beneath grant turning back into the packed hall as he snatched the microphone from the startled man parnell said offered as a bribe for my not making public the fact that dubette is knowingly inflicting harm in some cases killing hundreds of people by not recalling badly manufactured medicines stop him get the microphone said grant from behind not realizing that he was still away from his own sound equipment and that the shout only reached the first few rows parnell was conscious of someone running from behind and thrust instinctively backwards pushing away the man whose microphone hed snatched retreating deeper into the room as he did so the live mike clutched in his other hand stop him get the microphone said grant again back at the podium his now hysterical voice amplified do you want me stopped or do you want the truth demanded parnell warding off the scrabbling attendant again there was a moment of silence and then a groundswell of noise began inaudible at first but forming into a recognizable chant of let him speak let him speak and parnell did thirtyseven richard parnell did not return to washington dc for a further three days because of the immediate and unpredicted effect which the new york post awarded the macabre headline fall out of his denunciation and the aftermath of a continuing backtoback series of meetings and interviews with us food and drug administration officials and their french counterparts specially flownin french intelligence officers officials from five west african countries at the united nations world health organization executives the familiar fbi duo and barry jackson jackson demanded to know why the fuck parnell hadnt told him what he intended to do to which parnell replied that the lawyer would have tried to prevent it on grounds of libel commercial slander and breach of confidentiality which jackson at once agreed was exactly what he would have done an admission that ended the argument parnell maintained telephone contact with the executive vice president administering dubettes affairs from new york and briefly with beverley and even more briefly with his mother in england but it was a full two weeks before he and beverley were alone together at her insistence at her dupont circle apartment when he arrived she gestured him away from her and said i want to make sure youre the same guy i used to know im not sure im the same guy that i used to know heros been used a lot then theres brave and courageous and whistleblower extraordinary and ive even cut out genius from newsweek take your choice i think ill pass on the lot christ ive missed you ive missed you too and been as worried as hell itll take time for things to settle but they are settling why didnt you tell me why did you let me think you were a lilylivered shit whod sold himself out i wasnt sure i could do it didnt know until i actually got into the room that there was going to be a microphone i could grab i was going to try to get on the stage grant could have stopped me then prevented it all coming out how did you know he hadnt kept his word about issuing the health warning about the french shit with what you called my toy from home on the laptop i accessed the united nations and the world health organization and the public websites of every west african country on the map there wasnt a warning on one of them and if there had been it would have been a media sensation anyway and there wasnt one the son of a bitch and all the other smaller sons of bitches thought they were god and little people didnt matter me included among the little people the papers and television said he ran there was incredible confusion he didnt actually run but he got out of the room before i finished talking couldnt be found in the hotel no one expected him to commit suicide of course me least of all would you have still done it if you had ive had meetings with government people from guineabissau monrovia sierra leone ghana and niger with more scheduled theres never going to be an established figure but a conservative estimate is that over a thousand people have died itll be even harder to put a number on those whove been permanently harmed of course i would have done it pushed the bastard out of his penthouse window from which he jumped if i could have done it was his favourite view according to what ive read stood there all the time when he wasnt fucking up peoples lives prying into peoples lives do you know the full extent of what he had on so many people asked beverley parnell shook his head in disbelief there was actually an entire room linked to his office to hold it all the fbi are still going through it theyve already found most of the computeraccessed stuff johnson supplied when he was in metro dc police seems he used police authority to get into every competitor system particularly any police records on any of its executives and theres the entire stolen evidence of edward grant being caught in a parked car getting a blow job from a hooker johnsons plea bargaining says hes got a lot to tell the bureau bellamy and montgomery are trying for a deal too and metro dc want an out of court settlement for wrongful arrest seems the idea was to discredit me get me thrown out of the country barry actually warned me it could have happened if id been convicted i need to ask it declared the woman you dont anticipated parnell all three deny knowing anything about rebeccas murder or who did it johnsons got some story about a truck stop in new jersey that the bureau are trying to check out so well never know whatever whoever grant organized it and hes dead is that enough its got to be what about you would you believe the emergency board have asked me still to be vice president in charge of research and development the stock is trading at little more than pennies and obviously they want to use the appointment for all its publicity value but having caused so much damage i figure i should try to repair some of it and i meant what i said about believing were close with sars and not wanting to give up on the flu research i was frightened dubette might have invoked the confidentiality clause and get even worse publicity they wouldnt have dared once id got it all out seems like some of the media descriptions fit there are some changes i want to make i dont see any reason to keep barbara spacey or russell benn theres some coverage of the womans special assessments for grant he had what amounted to a manual for a blackmailer or a control freak i guess he was a combination of both you know what barbara spaceys real psychological assessment was of me i was supremely arrogant unlikely ever to adjust to the dubette management and work system and someone likely to be a continuing unsettling influence at mclean aint that the truth said beverley when the fbi are through with all of it im going to have every single assessment destroyed if youre going to take the job youll be staying if youll have me that wasnt quite my question said beverley answer mine if youll have me you ever going to tell me what went wrong between you and barry no thats his business his problem not yours how do you know it wont happen with us we make love dont we
