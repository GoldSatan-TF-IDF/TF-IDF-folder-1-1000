robert jordan knife of dreams the sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams from fog and steel by madoc comadrin prologue embers falling on dry grass the sun climbing toward midmorning stretched galads shadow and those of his three armored companions ahead of them as they trotted their mounts down the road that ran straight through the forest dense with oak and leatherleaf pine and sourgum most showing the red of spring growth he tried to keep his mind empty still but small things kept intruding the day was silent save for the thud of their horses hooves no bird sang on a branch no squirrel chittered too quiet for the time of year as though the forest held its breath this had been a major trade route once long before amadicia and tarabon came into being and bits of ancient paving stone sometimes studded the hardpacked surface of yellowish clay a single farm cart far ahead behind a plodding ox was the only sign of human life now besides themselves trade had shifted far north farms and villages in the region dwindled and the fabled lost mines of aelgar remained lost in the tangled mountain ranges that began only a few miles to the south dark clouds massing in that direction promised rain by afternoon if their slow advance continued a redwinged hawk quartered back and forth along the border of the trees hunting the fringes as he himself was hunting but at the heart not on the fringes the manor house that the seanchan had given eamon valda came into view and he drew rein wishing he had a helmet strap to tighten for excuse instead he had to be content with rebuckling his sword belt pretending that it had been sitting wrong there had been no point to wearing armor if the morning went as he hoped he would have had to remove breastplate and mail in any case and if it went badly armor would have provided little more protection than his white coat formerly a deepcountry lodge of the king of amadicia the building was a huge blueroofed structure studded with redpainted balconies a wooden palace with wooden spires at the corners atop a stone foundation like a low steepsided hill the outbuildings stables and barns workmens small houses and craftsfolks workshops all hugged the ground in the wide clearing that surrounded the main house but they were nearly as resplendent in their blueandred paint a handful of men and women moved around them tiny figures yet at this distance and children were playing under their elders eyes an image of normality where nothing was normal his companions sat their saddles in their burnished helmets and breastplates watching him without expression their mounts stamped impatiently the animals morning freshness not yet worn off by the short ride from the camp its understandable if youre having second thoughts damodred trom said after a time its a harsh accusation bitter as gall but no second thoughts for me galad broke in his intentions had been fixed since yesterday he was grateful though trom had given him the opening he needed they had simply appeared as he rode out falling in with him without a word spoken there had seemed no place for words then but what about you three youre taking a risk coming here with me a risk you have no need to take however the day runs there will be marks against you this is my business and i give you leave to go about yours too stiffly said but he could not find words this morning or loosen his throat the stocky man shook his head the law is the law and i might as well make use of my new rank the three golden starshaped knots of a captain sat beneath the flaring sunburst on the breast of his white cloak there had been more than a few dead at jeramel including no fewer than three of the lords captain they had been fighting the seanchan then not allied with them ive done dark things in service to the light gauntfaced byar said grimly his deepset eyes glittering as though at a personal insult dark as moonless midnight and likely i will again but some things are too dark to be allowed he looked as if he might spit thats right young bornhald muttered scrubbing a gauntleted hand across his mouth galad always thought of him as young though the man lacked only a few years on him dains eyes were bloodshot he had been at the brandy again last night if youve done whats wrong even in service to the light then you have to do whats right to balance it byar grunted sourly likely that was not the point he had been making very well galad said but theres no fault to any man who turns back my business here is mine alone still when he heeled his bay gelding to a canter he was pleased to have them gallop to catch him and fall in alongside white cloaks billowing behind he would have gone on alone of course yet their presence might keep him from being arrested and hanged out of hand not that he expected to survive in any case what had to be done had to be done no matter the price the horses hooves clattered loudly on the stone ramp that climbed to the manor house so every man in the broad central courtyard turned to watch as they rode in fifty of the children in gleaming plateandmail and conical helmets most mounted with cringing darkcoated amadician grooms holding animals for the rest the inner balconies were empty except for a few servants who appeared to be watching while pretending to sweep six questioners big men with the scarlet shepherds crook upright behind the sunflare on their cloaks stood close around rhadam asunawa like a bodyguard away from the others the hand of the light always stood apart from the rest of the children a choice the rest of the children approved grayhaired asunawa his sorrowful face making byar look fully fleshed was the only child present not in armor and his snowy cloak carried just the brilliant red crook another way of standing apart but aside from marking who was present galad had eyes for only one man in the courtyard asunawa might have been involved in some waythat remained unclearyet only the lord captain commander could call the high inquisitor to account eamon valda was not a large man yet his dark hard face had the look of one who expected obedience as his due as the very least he was due standing with his booted feet apart and his head high command in every inch of him he wore the whiteandgold tabard of the lord captain commander over his gilded breast and backplates a silk tabard more richly embroidered than any pedron niall had worn his white cloak the flaring sun large on either breast in threadofgold was silk as well and his goldembroidered white coat the helmet beneath his arm was gilded and worked with the flaring sun on the brow and a heavy gold ring on his left hand worn outside his steelbacked gauntlet held a large yellow sapphire carved with the sunburst another mark of favor received from the seanchan valda frowned slightly as galad and his companions dismounted and offered their salutes arm across the chest obsequious grooms came running to take their reins why arent you on your way to nassad trom disapproval colored valdas words the other lords captain will be halfway there by now he himself always arrived late when meeting the seanchan perhaps to assert that some shred of independence remained to the childrenfinding him already preparing to depart was a surprise this meeting must be very importantbut he always made sure the other highranking officers arrived on time even when that required setting out before dawn apparently it was best not to press their new masters too far distrust of the children was always strong in the seanchan trom displayed none of the uncertainty that might have been expected from a man who had held his present rank barely a month an urgent matter my lord captain commander he said smoothly making a very precise bow neither a hair deeper nor higher than protocol demanded a child of my command charges another of the children with abusing a female relative of his and claims the right of trial beneath the light which by law you must grant or deny a strange request my son asunawa said tilting his head quizzically above clasped hands before valda could speak even the high inquisitors voice was doleful he sounded pained at troms ignorance his eyes seemed dark hot coals in a brazier it was usually the accused who asked to give the judgment to swords and i believe usually when he knew the evidence would convict him in any case trial beneath the light has not been invoked for nearly four hundred years give me the accuseds name and i will deal with the matter quietly his tone turned chill as a sunless cavern in winter though his eyes still burned we are among strangers and we cannot allow them to know that one of the children is capable of such a thing the request was directed to me asunawa valda snapped his glare might as well have been open hatred perhaps it was just dislike of the other mans breaking in flipping one side of his cloak over his shoulder to bare his ringquilloned sword he rested his hand on the long hilt and drew himself up always one for the grand gesture valda raised his voice so that even people inside probably heard him and declaimed rather than merely spoke i believe many of our old ways should be revived and that law still stands it will always stand as written of old the light grants justice because the light is justice inform your man he may issue his challenge trom and face the one he accuses swordtosword if that one tries to refuse i declare that he has acknowledged his guilt and order him hanged on the spot his belongings and rank forfeit to his accuser as the law states i have spoken that with another scowl for the high inquisitor maybe there really was hatred there trom bowed formally once more you have informed him yourself my lord captain commander damodred galad felt cold not the cold of fear but of emptiness when dain drunkenly let slip the confused rumors that had come to his ears when byar reluctantly confirmed they were more than rumors rage had filled galad a boneburning fire that nearly drove him insane he had been sure his head would explode if his heart did not burst first now he was ice drained of any emotion he also bowed formally much of what he had to say was set in the law yet he chose the rest with care to spare as much shame as possible to a memory he held dear eamon valda child of the light i call you to trial beneath the light for unlawful assault on the person of morgase trakand queen of andor and for her murder no one had been able to confirm that the woman he regarded as his mother was dead yet it must be so a dozen men were certain she had vanished from the fortress of the light before it fell to the seanchan and as many testified she had not been free to leave of her own will valda displayed no shock at the charge his smile might have been intended to show regret over galads folly in making such a claim yet contempt was mingled in it he opened his mouth but asunawa cut in once more this is ridiculous he said in tones more of sorrow than of anger take the fool and well find out what darkfriend plot to discredit the children he is part of he motioned and two of the hulking questioners took a step toward galad one with a cruel grin the other blankfaced a workman about his work only one step though a soft rasp repeated around the courtyard as children eased their swords in their scabbards at least a dozen men drew entirely letting their blades hang by their sides the amadician grooms hunched in on themselves trying to become invisible likely they would have run had they dared asunawa stared around him thick eyebrows climbing up his forehead in disbelief knotted fists gripping his cloak strangely even valda appeared startled for an instant surely he had not expected the children to allow an arrest after his own proclamation if he had he recovered quickly you see asunawa he said almost cheerfully the children follow my orders and the law not a questioners whims he held out his helmet to one side for someone to take i deny your preposterous charge young galad and throw your foul lie in your teeth for it is a lie or at best a mad acceptance of some malignant rumor started by darkfriends or others who wish the children ill either way you have defamed me in the vilest manner so i accept your challenge to trial beneath the light where i will kill you that barely squeezed into the ritual but he had denied the charge and accepted the challenge it would suffice realizing that he still held the helmet in an outstretched hand valda frowned at one of the dismounted children a lean saldaean named kashgar until the man stepped forward to relieve him of it kashgar was only an underlieutenant almost boyish despite a great hooked nose and thick mustaches like inverted horns yet he moved with open reluctance and valdas voice was darker and acrid as he went on unbuckling his sword belt and handing that over too take a care with that kashgar its a heronmark blade unpinning his silk cloak he let it fall to the paving stones followed by his tabard and his hands moved to the buckles of his armor it seemed that he was unwilling to see if others would be reluctant to help him his face was calm enough except that angry eyes promised retribution to more than galad your sister wants to become aes sedai i understand damodred perhaps i understand precisely where this originated there was a time i would have regretted your death but not today i may send your head to the white tower so the witches can see the fruit of their scheme worry creasing his face dain took galads cloak and sword belt and stood shifting his feet as though uncertain he was doing the right thing well he had been given his chance and it was too late to change his mind now byar put a gauntleted hand on galads shoulder and leaned close he likes to strike at the arms and legs he said in a low voice casting glances over his shoulder at valda from the way he glared some matter stood between them of course that scowl differed little from his normal expression he likes to bleed an opponent until the man cant take a step or raise his sword before he moves for the kill hes quicker than a viper too but hell strike at your left most often and expect it from you galad nodded many righthanded men found it easier to strike so but it seemed an odd weakness in a blademaster gareth bryne and henre haslin had made him practice alternating which hand was uppermost on the hilt so he would not fall into that strange that valda wanted to prolong a fight too he himself had been taught to end matters as quickly and cleanly as possible my thanks he said and the hollowcheeked man made a dour grimace byar was far from likable and he himself seemed to like no one save young bornhald of the three his presence was the biggest surprise but he was there and that counted in his favor standing in the middle of the courtyard in his goldworked white coat with his fists on his hips valda turned in a tight circle everyone move back against the walls he commanded loudly horseshoes rang on the paving stones as the children and the grooms obeyed asunawa and his questioners snatched their animals reins the high inquisitor wearing a face of cold fury keep the middle clear young damodred and i will meet here forgive me my lord captain commander trom said with a slight bow but since you are a participant in the trial you cannot be arbiter aside from the high inquisitor who by law may not take part i hold the highest rank here after you so with your permission valda glared at him then stalked over to stand beside kashgar arms folded across his chest ostentatiously he tapped his foot impatient for matters to proceed galad sighed if the day went against him as seemed all but certain his friend would have the most powerful man in the children as his enemy likely trom would have had in any event but more so now keep an eye on them he told bornhald nodding toward the questioners clustered on their horses near the gate asunawas underlings still ringed him like bodyguards every man with a hand on his sword hilt why even asunawa cant interfere now that would be against the law it was very hard not to sigh again young dain had been a child far longer than he and his father had served his entire life but the man seemed to know less of the children than he himself had learned to questioners the law was what they said it was just watch them trom stood in the center of the courtyard with his bared sword raised overhead blade parallel to the ground and unlike valda he spoke the words exactly as they were written under the light we are gathered to witness trial beneath the light a sacred right of any child of the light the light shines on truth and here the light shall illuminate justice let no man speak save he who has legal right and let any who seek to intervene be cut down summarily here justice will be found under the light by a man who pledges his life beneath the light by the force of his arm and the will of the light the combatants will meet unarmed where i now stand he continued lowering the sword to his side and speak privately for their own ears alone may the light help them find words to end this short of bloodshed for if they do not one of the children must die this day his name stricken from our rolls and anathema declared on his memory under the light it will be so as trom strode to the side of the courtyard valda moved toward the center in the walking stance called cat crosses the courtyard an arrogant saunter he knew there were no words to stop blood being shed to him the fight had already begun galad merely walked out to meet him he was nearly a head taller than valda but the other man held himself as though he were the larger and confident of victory his smile was all contempt this time nothing to say boy small wonder considering that a blademaster is going to cut your head off in about one minute i want one thing straight in your mind before i kill you though the wench was hale the last i saw her and if shes dead now ill regret it that smile deepened both in humor and disdain she was the best ride i ever had and i hope to ride her again one day redhot searing fury fountained inside galad but with an effort he managed to turn his back on valda and walk away already feeding his rage into an imagined flame as his two teachers had taught him a man who fought in a rage died in a rage by the time he reached young bornhald he had achieved what gareth and henre had called the oneness floating in emptiness he drew his sword from the scabbard bornhald proffered and the slightly curved blade became a part of him what did he say dain asked for a moment there your face was murderous byar gripped dains arm dont distract him he muttered galad was not distracted every creak of saddle leather was clear and distinct every ringing stamp of hoof on paving stone he could hear flies buzzing ten feet away as though they were at his ear he almost thought he could see the movements of their wings he was one with the flies with the courtyard with the two men they were all part of him and he could not be distracted by himself valda waited until he turned before drawing his own weapon on the other side of the courtyard a flashy move the sword blurring as it spun in his left hand leaping to his right hand to make another blurred wheel in the air before settling upright and rocksteady before him in both hands he started forward once more in cat crosses the courtyard raising his own sword galad moved to meet him without thought assuming a walking stance perhaps influenced by his state of mind emptiness it was called and only a trained eye would know that he was not simply walking only a trained eye would see that he was in perfect balance every heartbeat valda had not gained that heronmark sword by favoritism five blademasters had sat in judgment of his skills and voted unanimously to grant him the title the vote always had to be unanimous the only other way was to kill the bearer of a heronmark blade in fair combat one on one valda had been younger then than galad was now it did not matter he was not focused on valdas death he focused on nothing but he intended valdas death if he had to sheathe the sword willingly welcoming that heronmark blade in his flesh to achieve it he accepted that it might come to that valda wasted no time with maneuvering the instant he was within range plucking the lowhanging apple flashed toward galads neck like lightning as though the man truly did intend to have his head in the first minute there were several possible responses all made instinct by hard training but byars warnings floated in the dim recesses of his mind and also the fact that valda had warned him of this very thing warned him twice without conscious thought he chose another way stepping sideways and forward just as plucking the lowhanging apple became the leopards caress valdas eyes widened in surprise as his stroke missed galads left thigh by inches widened more as parting the silk laid a gash down his right forearm but he immediately launched into the dove takes flight so fast that galad had to dance back before his blade could bite deeply barely fending off the attack with kingfisher circles the pond back and forth they danced the forms gliding this way then that across the stone paving lizard in the thornbush met lightning of three prongs leaf on the breeze countered eel among the lily pads and two hares leaping met the hummingbird kisses the honeyrose back and forth as smoothly as a demonstration of the forms galad tried attack after attack but valda was as fast as a viper the wood grouse dances cost him a shallow gash on his left shoulder and the red hawk takes a dove another on the left arm slightly deeper river of light might have taken the arm completely had he not met the drawcut with a desperately quick rain in high wind back and forth blades flashing continuously filling the air with the clash of steel on steel how long they fought he could not have said there was no time only the moment it seemed that he and valda moved like men under water their motions slowed by the drag of the sea sweat appeared on valdas face but he smiled with selfassurance seemingly untroubled by the slash on his forearm still the only injury he had taken galad could feel the sweat rolling down his own face too stinging his eyes and the blood trickling down his arm those wounds would slow him eventually perhaps already had but he had taken two on his left thigh and both were more serious his foot was wet in his boot from those and he could not avoid a slight limp that would grow worse with time if valda was to die it must be soon deliberately he drew a deep breath then another through his mouth another let valda think him becoming winded his blade lanced out in threading the needle aimed at valdas left shoulder and not quite as fast it could have been the other man countered easily with the swallow takes flight sliding immediately into the lion springs that took a third bite in his thigh he dared not be faster in defense than in attack again he launched threading the needle at valdas shoulder and again again all the while gulping air through his mouth only luck kept him from taking more wounds in those exchanges or perhaps the light really did shine on this fight valdas smile widened the man believed him on the edge of his strength exhausted and fixated as galad began threading the needle too slowly for the fifth time the other mans sword started the swallow takes flight in an almost perfunctory manner summoning all the quickness that remained to him galad altered his stroke and reaping the barley sliced across valda just beneath his rib cage for a moment it seemed that the man was unaware he had been hit he took a step began what might have been stones falling from the cliff then his eyes widened and he staggered the sword falling from his grip to clatter on the paving stones as he sank to his knees his hands went to the huge gash across his body as though trying to hold his insides within him and his mouth opened glassy eyes fixed on galads face whatever he intended to say it was blood that poured out over his chin he toppled onto his face and lay still automatically galad gave his blade a rapid twist to shake off the blood staining its last inch then bent slowly to wipe the last drops onto valdas white coat the pain he had ignored now flared his left shoulder and arm burned his thigh seemed to be on fire straightening took effort perhaps he was nearer exhaustion than he had thought how long had they fought he had thought he would feel satisfaction that his mother had been avenged but all he felt was emptiness valdas death was not enough nothing except morgase trakand alive again could be enough suddenly he became aware of a rhythmic clapping and looked up to see the children each man slapping his own armored shoulder in approval every man except asunawa and the questioners they were nowhere to be seen byar hurried up carrying a small leather sack and carefully parted the slashes in galads coatsleeve those will need sewing he muttered but they can wait kneeling beside galad he took rolled bandages from the sack and began winding them around the gashes in his thigh these need sewing too but this will keep you from bleeding to death before you can get it others began gathering around offering congratulations men afoot in front those still mounted behind none gave the corpse a glance except for kashgar who cleaned valdas sword on that already bloodstained coat before sheathing it where did asunawa go galad asked he left as soon as you cut valda the last time dain replied uneasily hell be heading for the camp to bring back questioners he rode the other way toward the border someone put in nassad lay just over the border the lords captain galad said and trom nodded no child would let the questioners arrest you for what happened here damodred unless his captain ordered it some of them would order it i think angry muttering began men denying they would stand for such a thing but trom quieted them somewhat with raised hands you know its true he said loudly anything else would be mutiny that brought dead silence there had never been a mutiny in the children it was possible that nothing before had come as close as their own earlier display ill write out your release from the children galad someone may still order your arrest but theyll have to find you and youll have a good start it will take half the day for asunawa to catch the other lords captain and whoever falls in with him cant be back before nightfall galad shook his head angrily trom was right but it was all wrong too much was wrong will you write releases for these other men you know asunawa will find a way to accuse them too will you write releases for the children who dont want to help the seanchan take our lands in the name of a man dead more than a thousand years several taraboners exchanged glances and nodded and so did other men not all of them amadician what about the men who defended the fortress of the light will any release get their chains struck off or make the seanchan stop working them like animals more angry growls those prisoners were a sore point to all of the children arms folded across his chest trom studied him as though seeing him for the first time what would you do then have the children find someone anyone who is fighting the seanchan and ally with them make sure that the children of the light ride in the last battle instead of helping the seanchan hunt aiel and steal our nations anyone a cairhienin named doirellin said in a highpitched voice no one ever made fun of doirellins voice though short he was nearly as wide as he was tall there was barely an ounce of fat on him and he could put walnuts between all of his fingers and crack them by clenching his fists that could mean aes sedai if you intend to be at tarmon gaidon then you will have to fight alongside aes sedai galad said quietly young bornhald grimaced in strong distaste and he was not the only one byar halfstraightened before bending back to his task but no one voiced dissent doirellin nodded slowly as if he had never before considered the matter i dont hold with the witches any more than any other man byar said finally without raising his head from his work blood was seeping through the bandages even as he wrapped but the precepts say to fight the raven you may make alliance with the serpent until the battle is done a ripple of nods ran through the men the raven meant the shadow but everyone knew it was also the seanchan imperial sigil ill fight beside the witches a lanky taraboner said or even these ashaman we keep hearing about if they fight the seanchan or at the last battle and ill fight any man who says im wrong he glared as though ready to begin then and there it seems matters will play out as you wish my lord captain commander trom said making a much deeper bow than he had for valda to a degree at least who can say what the next hour will bring much less tomorrow galad surprised himself by laughing since yesterday he had been sure he would never laugh again thats a poor joke trom it is how the law is written and valda did make his proclamation besides you had the courage to say what many have thought while holding their tongues myself among them yours is a better plan for the children than any ive heard since pedron niall died its still a poor joke whatever the law said that part had been ignored since the end of the war of the hundred years well see what the children have to say on the matter trom replied grinning widely when you ask them to follow us to tarmon gaidon to fight alongside the witches men began slapping their shoulders again harder than they had for his victory at first it was only a few then more joined in until every man including trom was signaling approval every man but kashgar that was making a deep bow the saldaean held out the scabbarded heronmark blade with both hands this is yours now my lord captain commander galad sighed he hoped this nonsense would fade away before they reached the camp returning there was foolish enough without adding in a claim of that sort most likely they would be pulled down and thrown in chains if not beaten to death even without it but he had to go it was the right thing to do daylight began to grow on this cool spring morning though the sun had yet to show even a sliver above the horizon and rodel ituralde raised his goldbanded looking glass to study the village below the hill where he sat his roan gelding deep in the heart of tarabon he did hate waiting for enough light to see careful of a glint off the lens he held the end of the long tube on his thumb and shaded it with a cupped hand at this hour sentries were at their least watchful relieved that the darkness where an enemy might sneak close was departing yet since crossing from almoth plain he had heard tales of aiel raids inside tarabon were he a sentry with aiel perhaps about he would grow extra eyes peculiar that the country was not milling like a kicked antheap over those aiel peculiar and perhaps ominous there were plenty of armed men to be found seanchan and taraboners sworn to them and hordes of seanchan building farms and even villages but reaching this far had been almost too easy today the easiness ended behind him among the trees horses stamped impatiently the hundred domani with him were quiet except for an occasional creak of saddle leather as a man shifted his seat but he could feel their tension he wished he had twice as many five times in the beginning it had seemed a gesture of good faith that he himself would ride with a force mainly composed of taraboners he was no longer certain that had been the right decision it was too late for recriminations in any event halfway between elmora and the amadician border serana sat in a flat grassy valley among forested hills with at least a mile to the trees in any direction save his and a small reedfringed lake fed by two wide streams lay between him and the village not a place that could be surprised by daylight it had been sizable before the seanchan came a stopping point for the merchant trains heading east with over a dozen inns and nearly as many streets village folk were already getting about their days tasks women balancing baskets on their heads as they glided down the village streets and others starting the fires under laundry kettles behind their houses men striding along toward their workplaces sometimes pausing to exchange a few words a normal morning with children already running and playing rolling hoops and tossing beanbags among the throng the clang of a smithy rose dim with the distance the smoke from breakfast fires was fading at the chimneys as far as he could see no one in serana gave a second glance to the three pairs of sentries with bright stripes painted across their breastplates walking their horses back and forth perhaps a quarter of a mile out the lake considerably wider than the village shielded the fourth side effectively it seemed the sentries were an accepted matter of every day and so was the seanchan camp that had swollen serana to more than twice its former size ituralde shook his head slightly he would not have placed the camp cheekbyjowl with the village that way the rooftops of serana were all tile red or green or blue but the buildings themselves were wooden a fire in the town could spread all too easily into the camp where canvas storetents the size of large houses far outnumbered the smaller tents where men slept and great stacks of barrels and casks and crates covered twice as much ground as all the tents combined keeping lightfingered villagers out would be all but impossible every town had a few tickbirds who picked up anything they thought they could get away with and even somewhat more honest men might be tempted by the proximity the location did mean a shorter distance to haul water from the lake and a shorter distance for soldiers to walk to reach the ale and wine in the village when offduty but it suggested a commander who kept slack discipline slack discipline or not there was activity in the camp too soldiers hours made farmers hours seem restful men were checking the animals on the long horselines bannermen checking soldiers standing in ranks hundreds of laborers loading or unloading wagons grooms harnessing teams every day trains of wagons came down the road into this camp from east and west and others departed he admired the seanchan efficiency at making sure their soldiers had what they needed when and where it was needed dragonsworn here in tarabon most sourfaced men who believed their dream snuffed out by the seanchan had been willing to tell what they knew if not to ride with him that camp contained everything from boots to swords arrows to horseshoes to waterflasks enough to outfit thousands of men from the ground up they would feel its loss he lowered the looking glass to brush a buzzing green fly away from his face two replaced it almost at once tarabon teemed with flies did they always come so early here they would just have begun hatching at home by the time he reached arad doman again if he did no no ill thoughts when he did tamsin would be displeased otherwise and it was seldom wise to displease her too far most of the men down there were hired workmen not soldiers and only a hundred or so of those seanchan still a company of three hundred taraboners in stripepainted armor had ridden in at noon the day before more than doubling their numbers and requiring him to change his plans another party of taraboners as large had entered the camp at sunset just in time to eat and bed down wherever they could lay their blankets candles and lamp oil were luxuries for soldiers there was one of those leashed women a damane in the camp too he wished he could have waited until she leftthey must have been taking her elsewhere what use for a damane at a supply campbut today was the appointed day and he could not afford to give the taraboners reason to claim he was holding back some would snatch at any reason to go their own way he knew they would not follow him much longer yet he needed to hold as many as he could for a few days more shifting his gaze to the west he did not bother with the looking glass now he whispered and as though at his command two hundred men with mail veils across their faces galloped out of the trees and immediately halted cavorting and jockeying for place brandishing steeltipped lances while their leader raced up and down before them gesturing wildly in an obvious effort to establish some semblance of order at this distance ituralde could not have made out faces even with the glass but he could imagine the fury on tornay lanasiets features at playing out this charade the stocky dragonsworn burned to close with seanchan any seanchan it had been difficult to dissuade him from striking the day they crossed the border yesterday he had been visibly overjoyed finally to scrape the hated stripes indicating loyalty to the seanchan from his breastplate no matter so far he was obeying his orders to the letter as the sentries nearest lanasiet turned their mounts to speed toward the village and the seanchan camp ituralde swung his attention there and raised his looking glass once more the sentries would find their warning superfluous motion had ceased some men were pointing toward the horsemen on the other side of the village while the rest seemed to be staring soldiers and workmen alike the last thing they expected was raiders aiel raids or no aiel raids the seanchan considered tarabon theirs and safely so a quick glance at the village showed people standing in the streets staring toward the strange riders they had not expected raiders either he thought the seanchan were right an opinion he would not share with any taraboner in the foreseeable future with welltrained men shock could last only so long however in the camp soldiers began racing toward their horses many still unsaddled though grooms had started working as fast as they could eightyodd seanchan footmen archers formed into ranks and set off running through serana at that evidence that there truly was a threat people began snatching up the smaller children and herding the older toward the hopedfor safety of the houses in moments the streets were empty save for the hurrying archers in their lacquered armor and peculiar helmets ituralde turned the glass toward lanasiet and found the man galloping his line of horsemen forward wait for it he growled wait for it again it seemed the taraboner heard his command finally raising a hand to halt his men at least they were still a halfmile or more from the village the hotheaded fool was supposed to be near a mile away on the edge of the trees and still in seeming disorder and easily swept away but half would have to suffice he suppressed the urge to finger the ruby in his left ear the battle had begun now and in battle you had to make those following you believe that you were utterly cool completely unaffected not wanting to knock down a putative ally emotion seemed to leak from a commander into his men and angry men behaved stupidly getting themselves killed and losing battles touching the halfmoonshaped beauty patch on his cheeka man should look his best on a day like todayhe took slow measured breaths until certain that he was as cool inside as his outward display then returned his attention to the camp most of the taraboners there were mounted now but they waited for twenty or so seanchan led by a tall fellow with a single thin plume on his curious helmet to gallop into the village before falling in behind yesterdays latecomers trailing at the rear ituralde studied the figure leading the column viewing him through the gaps between houses a single plume would mark a lieutenant or maybe an underlieutenant which might mean a beardless boy on his first command or a grizzled veteran who could take your head if you made one mistake strangely the damane marked by the shining silvery leash that connected her to a woman on a another horse galloped her animal as hard as anyone everything he had heard said damane were prisoners yet she appeared as eager as the other woman the suldam perhaps abruptly his breath caught in his throat and all thought of damane fled there were people still in the street seven or eight men and women walking in a cluster and right ahead of the racing column that they seemed not to hear thundering up behind them there was no time for the seanchan to stop if they wanted to and good reason not to try with an enemy ahead but it looked as though the tall fellows hand never twitched on his reins as he and the rest rode the people down a veteran then murmuring a prayer for the dead ituralde lowered the glass what came next was best seen without it two hundred paces beyond the village the officer started forming his command where the archers had already stopped and were waiting with nocked arrows waving directions to the taraboners behind he turned to peer at lanasiet through a looking glass sunlight glinted off the tubes banding the sun was rising now the taraboners began dividing smoothly lance heads glittering and all slanted at the same angle disciplined men falling into ordered ranks to either side of the archers the officer leaned over to converse with the suldam if he turned her and the damane loose now this could still turn into a disaster of course it could if he did not too the last of the taraboners those who had arrived late began stretching out in a line fifty paces behind the others driving their lances pointdown into the ground and pulling their horsebows from the cases fastened behind their saddles lanasiet curse the man was galloping his men forward turning his head for a moment ituralde spoke loudly enough for the men behind him to hear be ready saddle leather creaked as men gathered their reins then he murmured another prayer for the dead and whispered now as one man the three hundred taraboners in the long line his taraboners raised their bows and loosed he did not need the looking glass to see the suldam and damane and the officer suddenly sprout arrows they were all but swept from their saddles by near a dozen striking each of them at once ordering that had given him a pang but the women were the most dangerous people on that field the rest of that volley cut down most of the archers and cleared saddles and even as men struck the ground a second volley lanced out knocking down the last archers and emptying more saddles caught by surprise the seanchanloyal taraboners tried to fight among those still mounted some wheeled about and lowered lances to charge their attackers others perhaps seized by the irrationality that could take men in battle dropped their lances and tried to uncase their own horsebows but a third volley lashed them pileheaded arrows driving through breastplates at that range and suddenly the survivors seemed to realize that they were survivors most of their fellows lay still on the ground or struggled to stand though pierced by two or three shafts those still mounted were now outnumbered by their opponents a few men reined their horses around and in a flash the lot of them were running south pursued by one final rain of bowshot that toppled more hold ituralde murmured hold where you are a handful of the mounted archers fired again but the rest wisely refrained they could kill a few more before the enemy was beyond range but this group was beaten and before long they would be counting every arrow best of all none of them went racing in pursuit the same could not be said of lanasiet cloaks streaming he and his two hundred raced after the fleeing men ituralde imagined he could hear them yelping hunters on the trail of running prey i think weve seen the last of lanasiet my lord jaalam said reining his gray up beside ituralde who shrugged slightly perhaps my young friend he may come to his senses in any case i never thought the taraboners would return to arad doman with us did you no my lord the taller man replied but i thought his honor would hold through the first fight ituralde lifted his glass to look at lanasiet still galloping hard the man was gone and unlikely to come to senses he did not possess a third of his force gone as surely as if that damane had killed them he had counted on a few more days he would need to change plans again perhaps change his next target dismissing lanasiet from his thoughts he swung the glass to glance at where those people had been ridden down and grunted in surprise there were no trampled bodies friends and neighbors must have come out to carry them away though with a battle on the edge of the village that seemed about as likely as them getting up and walking away after the horses passed its time to go burn all those lovely seanchan stores he said shoving the looking glass into the leather case tied to his saddle he donned his helmet and heeled steady down the hill followed by jaalam and the others in a column of twos ruts from farm wagons and brokendown banks indicated a ford in the eastern stream and jaalam tell a few men to warn the villagers to start moving what they want to save tell them to begin with the houses nearest the camp where fire could spread one way it could the other too and likely would in truth he had already set the important blaze breathed on the first embers at least if the light shone on him if no one had been overcome by eagerness or given in to despair at the hold the seanchan had on tarabon if no one had fallen afoul of the mishaps that could ruin the bestlaid plan then all across tarabon above twenty thousand men had struck blows like this or would before the day was out and tomorrow they would do it again now all he had to do was raid his way back across better than four hundred miles of tarabon shedding taraboner dragonsworn and gathering in his own men then recross almoth plain if the light shone on him that blaze would singe the seanchan enough to bring them chasing after him full of fury a great deal of fury he hoped that way they would run headlong into the trap he had laid before they ever knew it was there if they failed to follow then at least he had rid his homeland of the taraboners and bound the domani dragonsworn to fight for the king instead of against him and if they saw the trap riding down the hillside ituralde smiled if they saw the trap then he had another plan already laid and another behind that he always looked ahead and always planned for every eventuality he could imagine short of the dragon reborn himself suddenly appearing in front of him he thought the plans he had would suffice for the moment the high lady suroth sabelle meldarath lay awake on her bed staring up at the ceiling the moon was down and the triplearched windows that overlooked a palace garden were dark but her eyes had adjusted so that she could make out at least the outlines of the ornate painted plasterwork dawn was no more than an hour or two off yet she had not slept she had lain awake most nights since tuon vanished sleeping only when exhaustion closed her eyes however hard she tried to keep them open sleep brought nightmares she wished she could forget ebou dar was never truly cold but the night held a little coolness enough to help keep her awake lying beneath only a thin silk sheet the question that tainted her dreams was simple and stark was tuon alive or dead the escape of the athaan miere damane and queen tylins murder spoke in favor of her death three events of that magnitude happening on one night by chance was pressing coincidence too far and the first two were horrifying enough in themselves to indicate the worst for tuon someone was trying to sow fear among the rhyagelle those who come home perhaps to disrupt the entire return how better to achieve that than to assassinate tuon worse it had to be one of their own because she had landed under the veil no local knew who tuon was tylin had surely been killed with the one power by a suldam and her damane suroth had leaped at the suggestion that aes sedai were to blame yet eventually someone who mattered would question how one of those women could enter a palace full of damane in a city full of damane and escape detection at least one suldam had been necessary to uncollar the sea folk damane and two of her own suldam had disappeared at almost the same time in any case they had been noticed as missing two days later and no one had seen them since the night tuon vanished she did not believe they were involved though they had been in the kennels for one thing she could not imagine renna or seta uncollaring a damane they certainly had reasons enough to sneak away and seek employment far off with someone ignorant of their filthy secret someone like this egeanin tamarath who had stolen a pair of a damane strange that for one newly raised to the blood strange but unimportant she could see no way to tie it to the rest likely the woman had found the stresses and complexities of nobility too much for a simple sailor well she would be found and arrested eventually the important fact the potentially deadly fact was that renna and seta were gone and no one could say exactly when they had left if the wrong person noted their departure so close to the critical time and made the wrong calculation she pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes and exhaled softly very near to a groan even should she escape suspicion of murdering tuon if the woman was dead then she herself would be required to apologize to the empress might she live forever for the death of the acknowledged heir to the crystal throne her apology would be protracted and as painful as it was humiliating it might end with her execution or much worse with being sent to the block as property not that it would actually come to that though in her nightmares it often did her hand slid beneath the pillows to touch the unsheathed dagger there the blade was little longer than her hand yet more than sharp enough to open her veins preferably in a warm bath if time came for an apology she would not live to reach seandar the dishonor to her name might even be lessened a little if enough people believed the act was itself an apology she would leave a letter explaining it so that might help still there was a chance tuon remained alive and suroth clung to it killing her and spiriting the body away might be a deep move ordered from seanchan by one of her surviving sisters who coveted the throne yet tuon had arranged her own disappearance more than once in support of the notion tuons dersuldam had taken all of her suldam and damane into the country for exercise nine days ago and they had not been seen since exercising damane did not require nine days and just todayno yesterday now by a good few hourssuroth had learned that the captain of tuons bodyguard also had left the city nine days ago with a sizable contingent of his men and not returned that was too much for coincidence and very nearly proof near enough for hope at least each of those previous disappearances however had been part of tuons campaign to win the approval of the empress might she live forever and be named heir each time some competitor among her sisters had been forced or emboldened to acts that lowered her when tuon reappeared what need had she of such stratagems now here rack her brains how she would suroth could not find a worthy target outside seanchan she had considered the possibility that she herself was the mark but only briefly and only because she could think of no one else tuon could have stripped her of her position in the return with three words all she needed to do was remove the veil here the daughter of the nine moons in command of the return spoke with the voice of the empire bare suspicion that suroth was athaan shadar what those this side of the aryth ocean called a darkfriend might have been enough for tuon to have handed her over to the seekers for questioning no tuon was aiming at someone else or something else if she did still live but she had to suroth did not want to die she fingered the blade who or what else did not matter except as a clue to where tuon might be but that was very important immensely so already despite the announcement of an extended inspection trip whispers floated among the blood that she was dead the longer she remained missing the more those whispers would grow and with them the pressure for suroth to return to seandar and make that apology she could only resist so long before she would be adjudged seimosiev so deeply that only her own servants and property would obey her her eyes would be ground into the dirt low blood as well as high perhaps even commoners would refuse to speak to her soon after that she would find herself on a ship whatever her wishes without doubt tuon would be displeased at being found yet it seemed unlikely her displeasure would extend so far as suroth being dishonored and forced to slit her wrists therefore tuon must be found every seeker in altara was searching for herthose suroth knew of at least tuons own seekers were not among the known yet they must be hunting twice as hard as any others unless they had been taken into her confidence but in seventeen days all that had been uncovered was that ridiculous story of tuon extorting jewelry from goldsmiths and that was known to every common soldier perhaps the arched door to the anteroom began to open slowly and suroth snapped her right eye shut to protect her night vision against the light of the outer room as soon as the gap was wide enough a palehaired woman in the diaphanous robes of a dacovale slipped into the bedchamber and softly closed the door behind her plunging the room into pitch blackness until suroth opened her eye again and made out a shadowy form creeping toward her bed and another shadow huge suddenly looming in a corner of the room as almandaragal rose noiselessly to his feet the lopar could cross the room and snap the fool womans neck in a heartbeat but suroth still gripped the hilt of her dagger it was wise to have a second line of defense even when the first seemed impregnable a pace short of the bed the dacovale stopped her anxious breathing sounded loud in the silence working up your courage liandrin suroth said harshly that honeycolored hair worked in thin braids had been enough to name her with a squeak the dacovale dropped to her knees and bent to press her face to the carpet she had learned that much at least i would not harm you high lady she lied you know i would not her voice was rushed in a breathy panic learning when to speak and when not seemed as far beyond her as learning how to speak with proper respect we are both bound to serve the great lord high lady have i not proven i can be useful i removed alwhin for you yes you said you wished her dead high lady and i removed her suroth grimaced and sat up in the dark the sheet sliding down to her lap it was so easy to forget dacovale were there even this dacovale and then you let slip things you should not have alwhin had not been dangerous merely a nuisance awkward in her place as suroths voice she had achieved all she had ever wanted in reaching that and the likelihood of her risking it by so much as the smallest betrayal had been tiny true had she broken her neck falling down a flight of stairs suroth would have felt some small relief from an irritant but poison that left the woman with bulging eyes and a blue face was another matter even with the search for tuon that had brought the seekers eyes to suroths household she had been forced to insist on it for the murder of her voice that there were listeners in her household she accepted every household had its share of listeners seekers did more than listen though and they might uncover what must remain hidden masking her anger required surprising effort and her tone was colder than she wanted i hope you did not wake me merely to plead again liandrin no no the fool raised her head and actually looked straight at her an officer came from general galgan high lady he is waiting to take you to the general suroths head throbbed with irritation the woman delayed delivering a message from galgan and looked her in the eyes in the dark to be sure yet an urge swept over her to strangle liandrin with her bare hands a second death hard on the heels of the first would intensify the seekers interest in her household if they learned of it but elbar could dispose of the body easily he was clever in such tasks except she enjoyed owning the former aes sedai who once had been so haughty with her making her a perfect dacovale in every way would be a great pleasure it was time to have the woman collared however already irritating rumors buzzed of an uncollared marathdamane among her servants it would be a twelveday wonder when the suldam discovered she was shielded in some way so she could not channel yet that would help answer the question of why she had not been leashed before elbar would need to find some athaan shadar among the suldam though that was never an easy taskrelatively few suldam turned to the great lord oddlyand she no longer really trusted any suldam but perhaps athaan shadar could be trusted more than the rest light two lamps then bring me a robe and slippers she said swinging her legs over the side of the bed liandrin scrambled to the table that held the lidded sand bowl on its gilded tripod and hissed when she found it with a careless hand but she quickly used the tongs to lift out a hot coal puffed it to a glow and lit two of the silvered lamps adjusting the wicks so the flames held steady and did not smoke her tongue might suggest that she felt herself suroths equal rather than a possession yet the strap had taught her to obey commands with alacrity turning with one of the lamps in her hand she gave a start and a choked cry at the sight of almandaragal looming in the corner his dark ridgeringed eyes focused on her you would think she had never seen him before yet he was a fearsome sight ten feet tall and near two thousand pounds his hairless skin like reddish brown leather flexing his six toed forepaws so his claws extended and retracted extended and retracted be at ease suroth told the lopar a familiar command but he stretched his mouth wide showing sharp teeth before settling back to the floor and resting his huge round head on his paws like a hound he did not close his eyes again either lopar were quite intelligent and plainly he trusted liandrin no more than she did despite fearful glances at almandaragal the dacovale was quick enough to fetch blue velvet slippers and a white silk robe intricately embroidered in green red and blue from the tall carved wardrobe and she held the robe for suroth to thrust her arms into the sleeves but suroth had to tie the long sash herself and to thrust out a foot before the woman remembered to kneel and fit the slippers on her eyes but the woman was incompetent by the dim light suroth examined herself in the gilded standmirror against the wall her eyes were hollow and shadowed with weariness the tail of her crest hung down her back in a loose braid for sleeping and doubtless her scalp required a razor very well galgans messenger would think her griefstricken over tuon and that was true enough before learning the generals message though she had one small matter to take care of run to rosala and beg her to beat you soundly liandrin she said the dacovales tight little mouth dropped open and her eyes widened in shock but why she whined me i have done nothing suroth busied her hands with knotting the sash tighter to keep from striking the woman her eyes would be lowered for a month if it was learned that she had struck a dacovale herself she certainly owed no explanations to property yet once liandrin did become completely trained she would miss these opportunities to grind the womans face in how far she had fallen because you delayed telling me of the generals messenger because you still call yourself i rather than liandrin because you meet my eyes she could not help hissing that liandrin had huddled in on herself with every word and now she directed her eyes to the floor as if that would mitigate her offense because you questioned my orders instead of obeying and lastlast but most importantly to youbecause i wish you beaten now run and tell rosala each of these reasons so she will beat you well liandrin hears and obeys high lady the dacovale whimpered at last getting something right and flung herself at the door so fast that she lost one of her white slippers too terrified to turn back for it or perhaps even to noticeand well for her that she wasshe clawed the door open and ran sending property for discipline should not bring a sense of satisfaction but it did oh yes it did suroth took a moment to control her breathing to appear to be grieving was one thing to appear to be agitated quite another she was filled with annoyance at liandrin jolting memories of her nightmares fears for tuons fate and even more so her own but not until the face in the mirror displayed utter calm did she follow the dacovale the anteroom to her bedchamber was decorated in the garish ebou dari fashion a cloudpainted blue ceiling yellow walls and green and yellow floor tiles even replacing the furnishings with her own tall screens all save two painted by the finest artists with birds or flowers did little to relieve the gaudiness she growled faintly in her throat at sight of the outer door apparently left open by liandrin in her flight but she dismissed the dacovale from her mind for the moment and concentrated on the man who stood there examining the screen that held the image of a kori a huge spotted cat from the sen tjore lanky and graying in armor striped blueandyellow he pivoted smoothly at the soft sound of her footsteps and went to one knee though he was a commoner the helmet beneath his arm bore three slender blue plumes so the message must be important of course it must be important to disturb her at this hour she would give him dispensation this once bannergeneral mikhel najirah high lady captaingeneral galgans compliments and he has received communications from tarabon suroths eyebrows climbed in spite of herself tarabon tarabon was as secure as seandar automatically her fingers twitched but she had not yet found a replacement for alwhin she must speak to the man herself irritation over that hardened her voice and she made no effort to soften it kneeling instead of prostrate what communications if i have been wakened for news of aiel i will not be pleased bannergeneral her tone failed to intimidate the man he even raised his eyes almost to meet hers not aiel high lady he said calmly captaingeneral galgan wishes to tell you himself so you can hear every detail correctly suroths breath caught for an instant whether najirah was just reluctant to tell her the contents of these communications or had been ordered not to this sounded ill lead on she commanded then swept out of the room without waiting for him ignoring as best she could the pair of deathwatch guards standing like statues in the hallway to either side of the door the honor of being guarded by those men in redandgreen armor made her skin crawl since tuons disappearance she tried not to see them at all the corridor lined with gilded standlamps whose flames flickered in errant drafts that stirred tapestries of ships and the sea was empty except for a few liveried palace servants scurrying on early tasks who thought deep bows and curtsies sufficient and they always looked right at her perhaps a word with beslan no the new king of tarabon was her equal now in law at any rate and she doubted that he would make his servants behave properly she stared straight ahead as she walked that way she did not have to see the servants insults najirah caught up to her quickly his boots ringing on the toobright blue floor tiles and fell in at her side in truth she needed no guide she knew where galgan must be the room had begun as a chamber for dancing a square thirty paces on a side its ceiling painted with fanciful fish and birds frolicking in often confusing fashion among clouds and waves only the ceiling remained to recall the rooms beginnings now mirrored standlamps and shelves full of filed reports in leather folders lined the pale red walls browncoated clerks scurried along the aisles between the long mapstrewn tables that covered the greentiled dancingfloor a young officer an underlieutenant with no plume on her redandyellow helmet raced past suroth without so much as a move to prostrate herself clerks merely squeezed themselves out of her path galgan gave his people too much leeway he claimed that what he called excessive ceremony at the wrong time hindered efficiency she called it effrontery lunal galgan a tall man in a red robe richly worked with brightfeathered birds the hair of his crest snow white and its tail plaited in a tight but untidy queue that hung to his shoulders stood at a table near the center of the room with a knot of other highranking officers some in breastplates others in robes and nearly as disheveled as she it seemed she was not the first to whom he had sent a messenger she struggled to keep anger from her face galgan had come with tuon and the return and thus she knew little of him beyond that his ancestors had been among the first to throw their support to luthair paendrag and that he owned a high reputation as a soldier and a general well reputation and truth were sometimes the same she disliked him entirely for himself he turned at her approach and formally laid his hands on her shoulders kissing her on either cheek so she was forced to return the greeting while trying not to wrinkle her nose at the strong musky scent he favored galgans face was as smooth as his creases would allow but she thought she detected a hint of worry in his blue eyes a number of the men and women behind him mainly low blood and commoners wore open frowns the large map of tarabon spread out on the table in front of her and held flat by four lamps gave reason enough for worry markers covered it red wedges for seanchan forces on the move and red stars for forces holding in place each supporting a small paper banner inked with their numbers and composition scattered across the map across the entire map lay black discs marking engagements and even more white discs for enemy forces many of those without the banners how could there be any enemies in tarabon it was as secure as what happened she demanded raken began arriving with reports from lieutenantgeneral turan about three hours ago galgan began in conversational tones pointedly not making a report himself he studied the map as he talked never glancing in her direction they arent completeeach new one adds to the lists and i expect that wont change for a whilebut what ive seen runs this way since dawn yesterday seven major supply camps overrun and burned along with more than two dozen smaller camps twenty supply trains attacked the wagons and their contents put to the torch seventeen small outposts have been wiped out eleven patrols have failed to report in and there have been an additional fifteen skirmishes also a few attacks against our settlers only a handful of fatalities mostly men who tried to defend their belongings but a good many wagons and stores burned along with some halfbuilt houses and the same message delivered everywhere leave tarabon all this was done by bands of between two and perhaps five hundred men estimates are a minimum of ten thousand and perhaps twice that nearly all taraboners oh yes he finished casually and most of them are wearing armor painted with stripes she wanted to grind her teeth galgan commanded the soldiers of the return yet she commanded the corenne the forerunners and as such she possessed the higher rank in spite of his crest and redlacquered fingernails she suspected the only reason he did not claim that the forerunners had been absorbed into the return by its very arrival was that supplanting her meant assuming responsibility for tuons safety and for that apology should it become necessary dislike was too mild a word she loathed galgan a mutiny she said proud of the coolness of her voice inside she had begun to burn galgans white queue swung slowly as he shook his head no all reports say our taraboners have fought well and weve had a few successes taken a few prisoners not one of them can be found on the rosters of loyal taraboners several have been identified as dragonsworn believed to be up in arad doman and the name rodel ituralde has been mentioned a number of times as the brain behind it all and the leader a domani hes supposed to be one of the best generals this side of the ocean and if he planned and carried out all this he swept a hand over the map then i believe it the fool sounded admiring not a mutiny a raid on a grand scale but he wont get out with nearly as many men as he brought in dragonsworn the word was like a fist clutching suroths throat are there ashaman those fellows who can channel galgan grimaced and made a sign against evil apparently unconscious of doing so there was no mention of them he said dryly and i rather think there would have been redhot anger needed to erupt at galgan but screaming at another of the high blood would lower her eyes and as bad gain nothing still it had to be directed somewhere it had to come out she was proud of what she had done in tarabon and now the country appeared to be halfway back to the chaos she found when she first landed there and one man was to blame this ituralde her tone was ice i want his head never fear galgan murmured folding his hands behind his back and bending to examine some of the small banners it wont be long before turan chases him back to arad doman with his tail between his legs and with luck hell be with one of the bands we snap up luck she snapped i dont trust to luck her anger was open now and she did not consider trying to suppress it again her eyes scanned the map as though she could find ituralde that way if turan is hunting a hundred bands as you suggest hell need more scouts to run them down and i want them run down every last one of them especially ituralde general yulan i want four in every fiveno nine in every tenraken in altara and amadicia moved to tarabon if turan cant find them all with that then he can see if his own head will appease me yulan a dark little man in a blue robe embroidered with blackcrested eagles must have dressed in too great a hurry to apply the gum that normally held his wig in place because he was constantly touching the thing to make sure it was straight he was captain of the air for the forerunners but the returns captain of the air was only a bannergeneral a more senior man having died on the voyage yulan would have no trouble with him a wise move high lady he said frowning at the map but may i suggest leaving the raken in amadicia and those assigned to bannergeneral khirgan raken are the best way we have to locate aiel and in two days we still havent found those whitecloaks that will still give general turan the aiel are less of a problem every day she told him firmly and a few deserters are nothing he inclined his head in assent one hand keeping his wig in place he was only low blood after all i hardly call seven thousand men a few deserters galgan murmured dryly it shall be as i command she snapped curse those socalled children of the light she still had not decided whether to make asunawa and the few thousand who had remained dacovale they had remained yet how long before they offered betrayal too and asunawa seemed to hate damane of all things the man was unbalanced galgan shrugged utterly unperturbed a redlacquered fingernail traced lines on the map as though he were planning movements of soldiers so long as you dont want the toraken too i raise no objections that plan must go forward altara is falling into our hands with barely a struggle im not ready to move on illian yet and we need to pacify tarabon again quickly the people will turn against us if we cant give them safety suroth began to regret letting her anger show he would raise no objections he was not ready for illian yet he was all but saying that he did not have to follow her orders only not openly not so he had to take her responsibility along with her authority i expect this message to be sent to turan general galgan her voice was steady kept so by will alone he is to send me rodel ituraldes head if he has to hound the man across arad doman and into the blight and if he fails to send me that head i will take his galgans mouth tightened briefly and he frowned down at the map turan sometimes needs a fire lit under him he muttered and arad doman has always been next for him very well your message will be sent suroth she could stay no longer in the same room with him without a word she left had she spoken she would have screamed she stalked all the way back to her rooms without bothering to mask her fury the deathwatch guards took no notice of course they might as well have been carved of stone which made her slam the anteroom door behind her with a crash perhaps they noticed that padding toward her bed she kicked off her slippers let the robe and sash fall to the floor she must find tuon she had to if only she could puzzle out tuons target puzzle out where she was if only suddenly the walls of her bedchamber the ceiling even the floor began to glow with a silvery light those surfaces seemed to have become light gaping in shock she turned slowly staring at the box of light that surrounded her and found herself looking at a woman made of roiling flames clothed in roiling flames almandaragal was on his feet awaiting his owners command to attack i am semirhage the woman of fire said in a voice like a tolling funeral gong belly almandaragal that command taught as a child because it amused her to have the lopar prostrate himself before her ended with a grunt because she obeyed it herself even as she gave it kissing the redandgreenpatterned carpet she said i live to serve and obey great mistress there was no doubt in her mind that this woman was who she said who would dare claim that name falsely or could appear as living fire i think you would also like to rule the tolling gong sounded faintly amused but then it hardened look at me i dislike the way you seanchan avoid meeting my eyes it makes me believe you are hiding something you dont want to try hiding anything from me suroth of course not great mistress suroth said pushing herself up to sit on her heels never great mistress she raised her gaze as far as the other womans mouth but she could not make herself raise it higher surely that would be enough better semirhage murmured now how would you like to rule in these lands a handful of deathsgalgan and a few othersand you could manage to name yourself empress with my help its hardly important but circumstances provide the opportunity and you would certainly be more amenable than the current empress has been so far suroths stomach clenched she feared she might vomit great mistress she said dully the penalty for that is to be taken before the true empress may she live forever and have your entire skin removed great care being taken to keep you alive after that inventive if primitive semirhage broke in wryly but of no account the empress radhanan is dead remarkable how much blood there is in a human body enough to cover the whole crystal throne take the offer suroth i will not make it again you will make certain matters slightly more convenient but not enough for me to put myself out a second time suroth had to make herself breathe then tuon is the empress may she live tuon would take a new name rarely to be spoken outside the imperial family the empress was the empress might she live forever wrapping her arms around herself suroth began to sob shaking beyond her ability to stop almandaragal lifted his head and whined at her interrogatively semirhage laughed the music of deep gongs grief for radhanan suroth or is your dislike of tuon becoming empress so deep haltingly in spurts of three or four words broken by unmanageable weeping suroth explained as the proclaimed heir tuon had become empress the moment her mother died except if her mother had been assassinated then it must have been arranged by one of her sisters which meant that tuon herself was surely dead and none of that made the slightest difference the forms would be carried out she would have to return to seandar and apologize for tuons death for the death of an empress now to the very woman who had arranged it who would of course not take the throne until tuons death was announced she could not bring herself to admit that she would kill herself first it was too shaming to say aloud words died as howling sobs racked her she did not want to die she had been promised she would live forever this time semirhages laughter was so shocking that it shut off suroths tears that head of fire was thrown back emitting great peals of mirth at last she regained control wiping away tears of flame with fiery fingers i see i didnt make myself clear radhanan is dead and her daughters and her sons and half the imperial court as well there is no imperial family except for tuon there is no empire seandar is in the hands of rioters and looters and so are a dozen other cities at least fifty nobles are contending for the throne with armies in the field there is war from the aldael mountains to salaking which is why you will be perfectly safe in disposing of tuon and proclaiming yourself empress ive even arranged for a ship which should arrive soon to bring word of the disaster she laughed again and said something strange let the lord of chaos rule suroth gaped at the other woman in spite of herself the empiredestroyed semirhage had killed the assassination was not unknown among the blood high or low nor within the imperial family yet for anyone else to reach inside the imperial family in that way was horrifying unthinkable even one of the daconcion the chosen ones but to become empress herself even here she felt dizzy with a hysterical desire to laugh she could complete the cycle conquering these lands and then send armies to reclaim seanchan with an effort she managed to regain possession of herself great mistress if tuon really is alive thenthen killing her will be difficult she had to force those words out to kill the empress even thinking it was difficult to become empress her head felt as if it might float off her shoulders she will have her suldam and damane with her and some of her deathwatch guards difficult killing her would be impossible in those circumstances unless semirhage could be induced to do it herself six damane might well be dangerous even to her besides there was a saying among commoners the mighty tell the lesser to dig in the mud and keep their own hands clean she had heard it by chance and punished the man who spoke it but it was true think suroth the gongs rang strong imperative captain musenge and the others would have gone the same night tuon and her maid left if they had had any inkling of what she was about they are looking for her you must put every effort into finding her first but if that fails her deathwatch guards will be less protection than they seem every soldier in your army has heard that at least some of the guards are involved with an impostor the general feeling seems to be that the impostor and anyone connected to her should be torn apart bodily and the pieces buried in a dungheap quietly lips of fire curled in a small amused smile to avoid the shame to the empire it might be possible a party of deathwatch guards would be easy to locate she would need to find out exactly how many musenge had taken with him and send elbar with fifty for every one no a hundred to account for the damane and then great mistress you understand i am reluctant to proclaim anything until i am certain tuon is dead of course semirhage said the gongs were amused once more but remember if tuon manages to return safely it will matter little to me so dont dally i will not great mistress i intend to become empress and for that i must kill the empress this time saying it was not very hard at all in pevaras estimation tsutama raths rooms were flamboyant beyond the point of extravagance and her own beginnings as a butchers daughter played no part in her opinion the sitting room simply put her on edge beneath a cornice carved with swallows in flight and gilded the walls held two large silk tapestries one displaying bright red bloodroses the other a calma bush covered in scarlet blossoms larger than her two hands together the tables and chairs were delicate pieces if you ignored sufficient carving and gilding for any throne the standlamps were heavily gilded too and the mantel worked with running horses above the redstreaked marble fireplace several of the tables held red sea folk porcelain the rarest four vases and six bowls a small fortune in themselves as well as any number of jade or ivory carvings none small and one figure of a dancing woman a hand tall that appeared be carved from a ruby a gratuitous display of wealth and she knew for a fact that aside from the gilded barrelclock on the mantel there was another in tsutamas bedroom and even one in her dressing room three clocks that went far beyond flamboyant never mind gilding or rubies and yet the room suited the woman seated across from her and javindhra flamboyant was exactly the word for her appearance tsutama was a strikingly beautiful woman her hair caught in a fine golden net with firedrops thick at her throat and ears and dressed as always in crimson silk that molded her full bosom today with golden scrollwork embroidery to increase the emphasis you might almost think she wanted to attract men if you did not know her tsutama had made her dislike of men well known long before being sent into exile she would have given mercy to a rabid dog before a man back then she had been hammerhard yet many had thought her a broken reed when she returned to the tower for a while they had then everyone who spent any time near her realized that those shifting eyes were far from nervous exile had changed her only not toward softness those eyes belonged on a hunting cat searching for enemies or prey the rest of tsutamas face was not so much serene as it was still an unreadable mask unless you pushed her to open anger at least even then her voice would remain as calm as smooth ice though an unnerving combination i heard disturbing rumors this morning about the battle at dumais wells she said abruptly bloody disturbing she had the habits now of long silences no small talk and sudden unexpected statements exile had coarsened her language too the isolated farm she had been confined to must have beenvivid including that three of the dead sisters were from our ajah mothers milk in a cup all delivered in the most even tones but her eyes stabbed at them accusingly pevara took that gaze in stride any direct look from tsutama seemed accusing and on edge or not pevara knew better than to let the highest see it the woman swooped on weakness like a falcon i cant see why katerine would disobey your orders to keep her knowledge to herself and you cannot believe tarna is likely to put discredit on elaida not publicly at any rate tarna guarded her feelings on elaida as carefully as a cat guarded a mousehole but sisters do get reports from their eyesandears we cant stop them learning what happened im surprised its taken this long thats so javindhra added smoothing her skirts the angular woman wore no jewelry aside from the great serpent ring and her dress was unadorned and a red deep enough to appear near black sooner or later the facts will all come out if we work till our fingers bleed her mouth was so tight she seemed to be biting something yet she sounded almost satisfied odd that she was elaidas lapdog tsutamas stare focused on her and after a moment a flush grew on javindhras cheeks perhaps as an excuse to break eye contact she took a long drink of her tea from a cup of beaten gold worked with leopards and deer of course tsutama being as she now was the highest continued to stare silently but whether at javindhra or something beyond her pevara could no longer say when katerine brought word that galina was among the dead at dumais wells tsutama had been raised to replace her by near acclamation she had possessed a very good reputation as a sitter at least before her involvement in the disgusting events that led to her downfall and many in the red believed the times called for as hard a highest as could be found galinas death had lifted a great weight from pevaras shouldersthe highest a darkfriend oh that had been agonyyet she was uncertain about tsutama there was somethingwildabout her now something unpredictable was she entirely sane but then the same question could be asked regarding the whole white tower how many of the sisters were entirely sane now as if sensing her thoughts tsutama shifted that unblinking gaze to her it did not make pevara color or start as it did so many besides javindhra but she did find herself wishing duhara were there just to give the highest a third sitter to stare at just to share them out she wished she knew where the woman had gone and why with a rebel army camped outside tar valon over a week ago duhara had simply taken ship without a word to anyone so far as pevara was aware and no one seemed to know whether she had gone north or south these days pevara was suspicious of everyone and nearly everything did you call us here because of something in that letter highest she said at last she met that unsettling stare levelly yet she was beginning to want a long pull from her own ornate cup and she wished it held wine rather than tea deliberately she rested the cup on the narrow arm of her chair the other womans gaze made her feel as though spiders were crawling on her skin after a very long moment tsutamas eyes dropped to the folded letter in her lap only her hand held it from rolling up into a little cylinder it was on the very thin paper used for messages sent by pigeon and the small inked letters clearly visible through the page appeared to cover it densely this is from sashalle anderly she said bringing a wince of pity from pevara and a grunt that might have been anything from javindhra poor sashalle tsutama continued without any outward sign of sympathy though the bloody woman believes galina escaped because it is addressed to her much of what she writes merely confirms what we already know from other sources including toveine but without naming them she bloody well says that she is in charge of most of the sisters in the city of cairhien how can sashalle be in charge of any sisters javindhra shook her head her expression denying the possibility could she have gone insane pevara held her silence tsutama gave answers when she wished rarely when you asked toveines earlier letter also addressed to galina had not mentioned sashalle at all or the other two but of course she would have found the entire subject beyond distasteful even thinking of it was like eating rotten plums most of her words had been devoted to laying the whole blame for events at elaidas feet however indirectly tsutamas eyes flickered toward javindhra like dagger thrusts but she went on without pausing sashalle recounts toveines bloody visit to cairhien with the other sisters and the flaming ashaman though she clearly doesnt know about the bloody bonding she found it all very strange sisters mingling with those goatkissing men on tense yet often friendly terms blood and bloody ashes that is how she puts it burn me tsutamas tone suitable for discussing the price of lace in strong contrast to the intensity of her eyes and her language gave no hint of what she felt on the subject sashalle says that when they left they took flaming warders belonging to sisters she believes are with the boy so it seems bloody certain they were looking for him and likely have found him by now she has no idea why but she confirms what toveine claimed concerning logain apparently the goatspawned man is no longer gentled impossible javindhra muttered into her teacup but softly tsutama disliked having her statements challenged pevara kept her opinions to herself and sipped from her own cup so far there seemed nothing in the letter worthy of discussion except how sashalle could be in charge of anything and she would rather think of anything other than sashalles fate the tea tasted of blueberries how had tsutama obtained blueberries this early in the spring perhaps they had been dried i will read the rest to you tsutama said unfolding the page and scanning almost to the bottom before beginning apparently sashalle had been very detailed what was the highest not sharing so many suspicions i have been so long without communicating because i could not work out how to say what i must but now i see that simply telling the facts is the only way along with a number of other sisters who i will leave to decide for themselves whether to reveal what i am about to i have sworn an oath of fealty to the dragon reborn which is to last until tarmon gaidon has been fought javindhra gasped loudly her eyes popping but pevara merely whispered taveren it must be that taveren had always been her explanation for most of the disturbing rumors out of cairhien tsutama read on right over them what i do i do for the good of the red ajah and the good of the tower should you disagree i will surrender myself for your discipline after tarmon gaidon as you may have heard irgain fatamed ronaille vevanios and i were all stilled when the dragon reborn escaped at dumais wells we have been healed however by a man named damer flinn one of the ashaman and we all seem to be restored fully unlikely as this seems i swear beneath the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth that it is true i look forward to my eventual return to the tower where i will retake the three oaths to reaffirm my dedication to my ajah and to the tower folding the letter again she gave her head a small shake theres more but its all more bloody pleading that what shes doing is for the ajah and the tower a glitter in her eyes suggested that sashalle might come to regret surviving the last battle if sashalle truly has been healed pevara began and could not go on she wet her lips with tea then raised the cup again and took a mouthful the possibility seemed too wonderful to hope for a snowflake that might melt at a touch this is impossible javindhra growled though not very strongly even so she directed the comment to pevara lest the highest think it meant for her a deep scowl made her face harsher gentling cannot be healed stilling cannot be healed sheep will fly first sashalle must be delusional toveine might be mistaken tsutama said in a very strong voice though if she is i cant see why these flaming ashaman would let logain be one of them much less command but i hardly think sashalle could be bloody mistaken about herself and she doesnt write like a woman having flaming delusions sometimes what is bloody impossible is only bloody impossible until the first woman does it so stilling has been healed by a man those toadspawned seanchan locusts are chaining every woman they find who can channel apparently including a number of sisters twelve days past well you know what happened as bloody well as i the world has become a more dangerous place than at any time since the trolloc wars perhaps since the breaking itself therefore ive decided we will move forward with your scheme for these flaming ashaman pevara distasteful and hazardous yet burn me there is no bloody choice you and javindhra will arrange it together pevara winced not for the seanchan they were human whatever strange terangreal they possessed and they would be defeated eventually mention of what the forsaken had done twelve days ago brought a grimace though despite her efforts at keeping a smooth face so much of the power wielded in one place could have been no one else to the extent she could she avoided thinking about that or what they might have been trying to accomplish or worse what they might have accomplished a second wince came at hearing the proposal to bond ashaman named as hers but that had been inevitable from the moment she presented tarnas suggestion to tsutama while holding her breath against the eruption she was sure would come she had even used the argument of increasing the size of linked circles by including men against that monstrous display of the power surprisingly there had been no eruption and small reaction of any kind tsutama merely said she would think on it and insisted on having the relevant papers about men and circles delivered to her from the library the third wince the largest was for having to work with javindhra for being saddled with the job at all she had more than enough on her plate at the moment besides which working with javindhra was always painful the woman argued against anything put forward by anyone save herself nearly anything javindhra had been vehemently against bonding ashaman horrified at the notion of red sisters bonding anyone almost as much as at bonding men who could channel yet now that the highest had commanded it she was stymied still she found a way to argue against elaida will never allow it she muttered tsutamas glittering eyes caught her gaze and held it the bony woman swallowed audibly elaida will not know until it is too late javindhra i hide her secretsthe disaster against the black tower dumais wellsas best i can because she was raised from the red but she is the amyrlin seat of all ajahs and none that means she is no longer red and this is ajah business not hers a dangerous tone entered her voice and she had not cursed once that meant she was on the edge of open fury do you disagree with me on this do you intend to inform elaida despite my express wishes no highest javindhra replied quickly then buried her face in her cup strangely she seemed to be hiding a smile pevara contented herself with shaking her head if it had to be done and she was certain it must then clearly elaida had to be kept in the dark what did javindhra have to smile about too many suspicions im very glad that you both agree with me tsutama said dryly leaning back in her chair now leave me they paused only to set down their cups and curtsy in the red when the highest spoke everyone obeyed including sitters the sole exception by ajah law was voting in the hall though some women who held the title had managed to ensure that any vote near to their hearts went as they wished pevara was certain tsutama intended to be one such the struggle was going to be distinctly unpleasant she only hoped she could give as good as she got in the corridor outside javindhra muttered something about correspondence and rushed off down the white floor tiles marked with the red flame of tar valon before pevara could say a word not that she had intended to say anything but surely as peaches were poison the woman was going to drag her heels in this and leave the whole matter in her lap light but this was the last thing she needed at the worst possible time pausing at her own rooms only long enough to gather her longfringed shawl and check the houra quarter of an hour to noon she was almost disappointed that her one clock agreed with tsutamas clocks frequently did notshe left the red quarters and hurried deeper into the tower down into the common areas below the quarters the wide hallways were well lighted with mirrored standlamps but almost empty of people which made them seem cavernous and the friezebanded white walls stark the occasional rippling of a bright tapestry in a draft had an eerie feel as though the silk or wool had taken on life the few people she saw were serving men and women with the flame of tar valon on their chests scurrying along about their chores and barely pausing long enough to offer hurried courtesies they kept their eyes lowered with the ajahs separated into all but warring camps fetid tension and antagonism filled the tower and the mood had infected the servants frightened them at least she could not be sure but she thought fewer than two hundred sisters remained in the tower most keeping to their ajah quarters except for necessity so she really did not expect to see another sister strolling when adelorna bastine glided up the short stairs from a crossing corridor almost right in front of her she was so surprised she gave a start adelorna who made slimness appear stately despite her lack of height walked on without acknowledging pevara in any way the saldaean woman wore her shawl toono sister was seen outside her ajah quarters without her shawl nowand was followed by her three warders short and tall wide and lean they wore their swords and their eyes never ceased moving warders wearing swords and plainly guarding their aes sedais back in the tower that was all too common yet pevara could have wept at it only there were too many reasons for weeping to settle on one instead she set about solving what she could tsutama could command reds to bond ashaman command them not to go running to elaida but it seemed best to begin with sisters who might be willing to entertain the notion without being ordered especially with rumors spreading of three red sisters dead at ashaman hands tarna feir had already entertained it so a very private conversation with her was in order she might know others of a like mind the greatest difficulty would be approaching the ashaman with the idea they were very unlikely to agree just because they themselves had already bonded fiftyone sisters light of the world fiftyone broaching the subject would require a sister who possessed diplomacy and a way with words and iron nerve she was still mulling over names when she saw the woman she had come to meet already at the appointed place apparently studying a tall tapestry tiny and willowy and regal in her pale silver silk with a slightly darker lace at her neck and wrists yukiri appeared throughly engrossed in the tapestry and quite at her ease pevara could only recall seeing her the slightest bit flustered on one occasion and putting talene to the question had been nerveracking for everyone there yukiri was alone of course though of late she had been heard to say she was thinking of taking a warder again doubtless that was equal parts the current times and their own present situation pevara could have done with a warder or two herself is there any truth in this or is it all the weavers fancy she asked joining the smaller woman the tapestry showed a longago battle against trollocs or was purported to most such things were made long after the fact and the weavers usually went by hearsay this one was old enough to need the protection of a warding to keep it from falling apart i know as much about tapestries as a pig knows about blacksmithing pevara for all her elegance yukiri seldom let long pass without revealing her country origins the silvery gray fringe of her shawl swung as she gathered it around her youre late so lets be brief i feel like a hen being watched by a fox marris broke this morning and i gave her the oath of obedience myself but as with the others her one other is out of the tower with the rebels i think she fell silent as a pair of serving women approached up the hallway carrying a large wicker laundry basket with neatly folded bed linens bulging from the top pevara sighed it had seemed so encouraging at the start terrifying and nearly overwhelming too yet they had appeared to be making a good beginning talene had only known the name of one other black sister actually in the tower at present but once atuan had been kidnappedpevara would have liked to think of it as an arrest yet she could not when they seemed to be violating half of tower law and a good many strong customs besidesonce atuan was safely in hand she had soon been induced to surrender the names of her heart karale sanghir a domani gray and marris thornhill an andoran brown only karale among them had a warder though he had turned out to be a darkfriend too luckily soon after learning that his aes sedai had betrayed him he had managed to take poison in the basement room where he had been confined while karale was questioned strange to think of that as lucky but the oath rod only worked on those who could channel and they were too few to guard and tend prisoners it had been such a bright beginning however fraught and now they were at an impasse unless one of the others returned to the tower back to searching for discrepancies between what sisters claimed to have done and what it could be proven they actually had something made harder by the inclination of most sisters to be oblique in nearly everything of course talene and the other three would pass along whatever they knew whatever came into their handsthe oath of obedience took care of thatbut any message very much more important than take this and put it in that place would be in a cipher known only to the woman who sent it and the woman it was directed to some were protected by a weave that made the ink vanish if the wrong hand broke the seal that could be done with so little of the power it might go unnoticed unless you were looking for it and there appeared to be no way to circumvent the ward if they were not at an impasse then their flow of success was reduced to a creeping trickle and always there was the danger that the hunted would learn of them and become the hunters invisible hunters for all practical purposes just as they now seemed invisible prey still they had four names plus four sisters in hand who would admit they were darkfriends though likely marris would be as quick as the other three to claim she now rejected the shadow repented of her sins and embraced the light once more enough to convince anyone supposedly the black ajah knew everything that passed in elaidas study yet it might be worth the risk pevara refused to believe talenes claim that elaida was a darkfriend after all she had initiated the hunt the amyrlin seat could rouse the entire tower perhaps a revelation that the black ajah truly existed might do what the appearance of the rebels with an army had failed to stop the ajahs from hissing at one another like strange cats and bind them back together the towers wounds called for desperate remedies the serving women passed beyond earshot and pevara was about to bring up the suggestion when yukiri spoke again last night talene received an order to appear tonight before their supreme council her mouth twisted around the words in distaste it seems that happens only if youre being honored or given a very very important assignment or if youre to be put to the question her lips almost writhed what they had learned about the black ajahs means of putting someone to the question was as nauseating as it was incredible forcing a woman into a circle against her will guiding a circle to inflict pain pevara felt her stomach writhing talene doesnt think shes to be honored or given an assignment yukiri went on so she begged to be hidden away saerin put her in a room in the lowest basement talene may be wrong but i agree with saerin risking it would be letting a dog into the chicken yard and hoping for the best pevara stared up at the tapestry stretching well above their heads armored men swung swords and axes stabbed spears and halberds at huge manlike shapes with boars snouts and wolves snouts with goats horns and rams horns the weaver had seen trollocs or accurate drawings men fought alongside the trollocs too darkfriends sometimes fighting the shadow required spilling blood and desperate remedies let talene go to this meeting she said well all go they wont expect us we can kill or capture them and decapitate the black at a stroke this supreme council must know the names of all of them we can destroy the whole black ajah lifting an edge of the fringe on pevaras shawl with a slim hand yukiri frowned at it ostentatiously yes red i thought it might have turned green when i wasnt looking there will be thirteen of them you know even if some of this council are out of the tower the rest will bring in sisters to make up the number i know pevara replied impatiently talene had been a fount of information most of it useless and much of it horrifying almost more than they could take in we take everyone we can order zerah and the others to fight alongside us and even talene and that lot theyll do as theyre told in the beginning she had been uneasy about that oath of obedience but over time you could become accustomed to anything so nineteen of us against thirteen of them yukiri mused sounding much too patient even the way she adjusted her shawl radiated patience plus whoever they have watching to make sure their meeting isnt disturbed thieves are always the most careful of their purses that had the irritating sound of an old saying best to call the numbers even at best and probably favoring them how many of us die in return for killing or capturing how many of them more importantly how many of them escape remember they meet hooded if just one escapes then we wont know who she is but shell know us and soon enough the whole black ajah will know too it sounds to me less like chopping off a chickens head than like trying to wrestle a leopard in the dark pevara opened her mouth then closed it without speaking yukiri was right she should have tallied the numbers and reached the same conclusion herself but she wanted to strike out at something at anything and small wonder the head of her ajah might be insane she was tasked with arranging for reds who by ancient custom bonded no one to bond not just any men but ashaman and the hunt for darkfriends in the tower had reached a stone wall strike out she wanted to bite holes through bricks she thought their meeting was at an endshe had come only to learn how matters progressed with marris and a bitter harvest that had turned outbut yukiri touched her arm walk with me awhile weve been here too long and i want to ask you something nowadays sitters of different ajahs standing together too long made rumors of plots sprout like mushrooms after rain for some reason talking while walking seemed to cause many fewer it made no sense but there it was yukiri took her time getting to her question the floor tiles turned from greenandblue to yellowandbrown as they walked along one of the main corridors that spiraled gently through the tower down five floors without seeing anyone else before she spoke has the red heard from anyone who went with toveine pevara almost tripped over her own slippers she should have expected it though toveine would not have been the only one to write from cairhien from toveine herself she said and told almost everything that had been in toveines letter under the circumstances there was nothing else she could do she did hold back the accusations against elaida and also how long ago the letter had arrived the one was still ajah business she hoped while the other might require awkward explanations we heard from akoure vayet yukiri walked a few paces in silence then muttered blood and bloody ashes pevaras eyebrows rose in shock yukiri was often earthy but never vulgar before this she noted that the other woman had not said when akoures letter arrived either had the gray received other letters from cairhien from sisters who had sworn to the dragon reborn she could not ask they trusted one another with their lives in this hunt and still ajah business was ajah business what do you intend doing with the information we will keep silent for the good of the tower only the sitters and the head of our ajah know evanellein is for pulling elaida down because of this but that cant be allowed now with the tower to mend and the seanchan and ashaman to be dealt with perhaps never she did not sound happy over that pevara stifled her irritation she could not like elaida yet you did not have to like the amyrlin seat any number of very unlikeable women had worn the stole and done well for the tower but could sending fiftyone sisters into captivity be called doing well could dumais wells with four sisters dead and more than twenty delivered into another sort of captivity to a taveren no matter elaida was redhad been redand far too long had passed since a red gained the stole and staff all the rash actions and illconsidered decisions seemed things of the past since the rebels appeared and saving the tower from the black ajah would redeem her failures that was not how she put it of course she began the hunt yukiri she deserves to finish it light everything weve uncovered so far has come by chance and we are at a full stop we need the authority of the amyrlin seat behind us if were to get any further i dont know the other woman said wavering all four of them say the black knows everything that happens in elaidas study she bit at her lip and shrugged uncomfortably perhaps if we can meet her alone away from her study there you are ive been looking everywhere pevara turned calmly at the sudden voice behind them but yukiri gave a start and muttered something pungent almost under her breath if she kept this up she would be as bad as doesine or tsutama seaine hurried down to them with the fringe of her shawl swinging and her thick black eyebrows rising in surprise at yukiris glare how like a white logical in everything and often blind to the world around them half the time seaine seemed unaware they were in any danger at all you were looking for us yukiri almost growled planting her fists on her hips despite her diminutive size she gave a good impression of fierce looming doubtless part of that was for being startled but she still believed seaine should be guarded closely for her own protection no matter what saerin had decided and here the woman was out and about alone for you for saerin for anyone seaine replied calmly her earlier fears that the black ajah might know what work elaida had assigned her were quite gone her blue eyes held warmth yet otherwise she was back to being the prototypical white a woman of icy serenity i have urgent news she said as though it were anything but the lesser is this this morning i saw a letter from ayako norsoni that arrived several days ago from cairhien she and toveine and all the others have been captured by the ashaman and tilting her head to one side she studied them in turn you arent surprised in the slightest of course youve seen letters too well theres nothing to be done about it now anyway pevara exchanged looks with yukiri then said this is the less urgent seaine the white sitters composure faded into worry tightening her mouth and creasing the corners of her eyes her hands tightened into fists gripping her shawl for us it is ive just come from answering a summons to elaida she wanted to know how i was getting on seaine took a deep breath with discovering proof that alviarin entered a treasonous correspondence with the dragon reborn really she was so circumspect in the beginning so indirect its no wonder i misunderstood what she wanted i think that fox is walking on my grave yukiri murmured pevara nodded the notion of approaching elaida had vanished like summer dew their one assurance that elaida was not herself black ajah had been that she instigated the hunt for them but since she had done no such thing at least the black ajah remained in ignorance of them at least they had that still but for how much longer on mine too she said softly alviarin glided along the corridors of the lower tower with an outward air of serenity that she held on to hard night seemed to cling to the walls despite the mirrored standlamps the ghosts of shadows dancing where none should be imagination surely yet they danced on the edges of vision the hallways were very nearly empty though the second sitting of supper had just ended most sisters preferred to have food brought up to their rooms these days but the hardier and the more defiant ventured to the dining halls from time to time and a handful still took many of their meals below she would not risk sisters seeing her appear flustered or hurried she refused to let them believe she was scuttling about furtively in truth she disliked anyone looking at her at all outwardly calm she seethed inside abruptly she realized that she was fingering the spot on her forehead where shaidar haran had touched her where the great lord himself had marked her as his hysteria bubbled almost to the surface with that thought but she maintained a smooth face by sheer will and gathered her white silk skirts slightly that should keep her hands occupied the great lord had marked her best not to think on that but how to avoid it the great lord on the outside she displayed absolute composure but within was a swirling tangle of mortification and hatred and very near to gibbering terror the external calm was what mattered though and there was a seed of hope that mattered too an odd thing to think of as hopeful yet she would hang on to anything that might keep her alive stopping in front of a tapestry that showed a woman wearing an elaborate crown kneeling to some longago amyrlin she pretended to examine it while glancing quickly to left and right aside from her the corridor remained as barren of life as an abandoned tomb her hand darted behind the edge of the tapestry and in an instant she was walking on again clutching a folded message a miracle that it had reached her so quickly the paper seemed to burn her palm but she could not read it here at a measured pace she climbed reluctantly to the white ajah quarters calm and unfazed by anything on the outside the great lord had marked her other sisters were going to look at her the white was the smallest of the ajahs and barely more than twenty of its sisters were in the tower at present yet it seemed that nearly all of them were out in the main hallway the walk along the plain white floor tiles seemed like running a gauntlet seaine and ferane were heading out despite the hour shawls draped along their arms and seaine gave her a small smile of commiseration which made her want to kill the sitter always thrusting her sharp nose in where it was unwanted ferane held no sympathy she scowled with more open fury than any sister should have allowed herself to show all alviarin could do was try to ignore the copperskinned woman without being obvious short and stout with her usually mild round face and an ink smudge on her nose ferane was no ones image of a domani but the first reasoner possessed a fierce domani temper she was quite capable of handing down a penance for any slight especially to a sister who had disgraced both herself and the white the ajah felt keenly the shame of her having been stripped of the keepers stole most felt anger at the loss of influence as well there were far too many glares some from sisters who stood far enough below her that they should leap to obey if she gave a command others deliberately turned their backs she made her way through those frowns and snubs at a steady pace unhurried yet she felt her cheeks beginning to heat she tried to immerse herself in the soothing nature of the white quarters the plain white walls lined with silvered standmirrors held only a few simple tapestries images of snowcapped mountains shady forests stands of bamboo with sunlight slanting through them ever since attaining the shawl she had used those images to help her find serenity in times of stress the great lord had marked her she clutched her skirts in fists to hold her hands at her sides the message seemed to burn her hand a steady measured pace two of the sisters she passed ignored her simply because they did not see her astrelle and tesan were discussing food spoilage arguing rather faces smooth but eyes heated and voices on the brink of heat they were arithmetists of all things as if logic could be reduced to numbers and they seemed to be disagreeing on how those numbers were used calculating with raduns standard of deviation the rate is eleven times what it should be astrelle said in tight tones furthermore this must indicate the intervention of the shadow tesan cut her off beaded braids clicking as she shook her head the shadow yes but raduns standard it is outdated you must use covanens first rule of medians and calculate separately for rotting meat or rotten the correct answers as i said are thirteen and nine i have not yet applied it to the flour or the beans and the lentils but it seems intuitively obvious astrelle swelled up and since she was a plump woman with a formidable bosom she could swell impressively covanens first rule she practically spluttered breaking in that hasnt been properly proven yet correct and proven methods are always preferable to slipshod alviarin very nearly smiled as she moved on so someone had finally noticed that the great lord had laid his hand on the tower but knowing would not help them change matters perhaps she had smiled but if so she crushed it as someone spoke youd grimace too ramesa if you were being strapped every morning before breakfast norine said much too loudly and plainly meaning for alviarin to hear ramesa a tall slender woman with silver bells sewn down the sleeves of her whiteembroidered dress looked startled at being addressed and likely she was norine had few friends perhaps none she went on cutting her eyes toward alviarin to see whether she had noticed it is irrational to call a penance private and pretend nothing is happening when the amyrlin seat has imposed it but then her rationality has always been overrated in my opinion fortunately alviarin had only a short way further to reach her rooms carefully she closed the outer door and latched the latch not that anyone would disturb her but she had not survived by taking chances except where she had to the lamps were lit and a small fire burned on the white marble hearth against the cool of an early spring evening at least the servants still performed their duties but even the servants knew silent tears of humiliation began to stream down her cheeks she wanted to kill silviana yet that would only mean a new mistress of novices laying the strap across her every morning until elaida relented except that elaida would never relent killing her would be more to the point yet such killings had to be carefully rationed too many unexpected deaths would cause questions perhaps dangerous questions still she had done what she could against elaida katerines news of this battle was spreading through the black ajah and beyond it already she had overheard sisters who were not black talking of dumais wells in detail and if the details had grown in the telling so much the better soon the news from the black tower would have diffused through the white tower too likely expanding in the same way a pity that neither would be sufficient to see elaida disgraced and deposed with those cursed rebels practically on the bridges yet dumais wells and the disaster in andor hanging over her head would keep her from undoing what alviarin had done break the white tower from within she had been ordered plant discord and chaos in every corner of the tower part of her had felt pain at that command a part of her still did yet her greater loyalty was to the great lord elaida herself had made the first break in the tower but she had shattered half of it beyond mending abruptly she realized that she was touching her forehead again and snatched her hand down there was no mark there nothing to feel or see every time she glanced into a mirror she checked in spite of herself and yet sometimes she thought people were looking at her forehead seeing something that escaped her own eyes that was impossible irrational yet the thought crept in no matter how often she chased it away dashing tears from her face with the hand holding the message from the tapestry she pulled the other two she had retrieved out of her belt pouch and went to the writing table standing against the wall it was a plain table and unadorned like all of her furnishings some of which she suspected might be of indifferent workmanship a trivial matter so long as furniture did what it was supposed to do nothing more mattered dropping the three messages on the table beside a small beaten copper bowl she produced a key from her pouch unlocked a brassbanded chest sitting on the floor beside the table and sorted through the small leatherbound books inside until she found the three she needed each protected so that the ink on the pages would vanish if any hand but hers touched them there were far too many ciphers in use for her to keep them in memory losing these books would be a painful trial replacing them arduous hence the stout chest and the lock a very good lock good locks were not trivialities quickly she stripped off the thin strips of paper wrapping the message recovered from behind the tapestry held them to a lamp flame and dropped them into the bowl to burn they were only directions as to where the message was to be left one meant for each woman in the chain the extra strips merely a way of disguising how many links the message had to go through to reach its recipient too many precautions were an impossibility even the sisters of her own heart believed her no more than they only three on the supreme council knew who she was and she would have avoided that had it been possible there could never be too many precautions especially now the message once she worked it out bending to write on another sheet was much as she had expected since the previous night when talene failed to appear the woman had left the green quarters early yesterday carrying fat saddlebags and a small chest not having a servant carry them she had performed the task herself no one seemed to know where she had gone the question was had she panicked on receiving her summons to the supreme council or was there something more something more alviarin decided talene had looked to yukiri and doesine as though seekingguidance perhaps she was sure she had not imagined it could she have a very small seed of hope there must be something more she needed a threat to the black or the great lord would withdraw his protection angrily she pulled her hand away from her forehead she never considered using the small terangreal she had hidden away to call mesaana for one thing one very important thing the woman surely intended to kill her very likely despite the great lords protection on the instant if that protection were lost she had seen mesaanas face knew of her humiliation no woman would let that pass especially not one of the chosen every night she dreamed of killing mesaana often daydreamed of how to manage it successfully yet that must wait on finding her without the woman knowing herself found in the meanwhile she needed more proof it was possible that neither mesaana nor shaidar haran would see talene as verification of anything sisters had panicked and run in the past if rarely and assuming mesaana and the great lord were ignorant of that would be dangerous in turn she touched the ciphered message and the clear copy to the lamp flame and held each by a corner until they had burned nearly to her fingers before dropping them atop the ashes in the bowl with a smooth black stone that she kept as a paperweight she crushed the ashes and stirred them about she doubted that anyone could reconstitute words from ash but even so still standing she deciphered the other two messages and learned that yukiri and doesine both slept in rooms warded against intrusion that was unsurprisinghardly a sister in the tower slept without warding these daysbut it meant kidnapping either would be difficult that was always easiest when carried out in the depths of the night by sisters of the womans own ajah it might yet turn out those glances were happenstance or imagination she needed to consider the possibility with a sigh she gathered more of the small books from the chest and gently eased herself onto the goosedown cushion on the chair at the writing table not gently enough to stop a wince as her weight settled though she barely stifled a whimper at first she had thought the humiliation of silvianas strap far worse than the pain but the pain no longer really faded her bottom was a mass of bruises and tomorrow the mistress of novices would add to them and the day after that and the day after a bleak vision of endless days howling under silvianas strap of fighting to meet the eyes of sisters who knew all about the visits to silvianas study trying to chase those thoughts away she dipped a good steelnibbed pen and began to write out ciphered orders on thin sheets of paper talene must be found and brought back of course for punishment and execution if she had simply panicked and if she had not if she had somehow found a way to betray her oaths alviarin clung to that hope while she commanded a close watch put on yukiri and doesine a way had to be found to take them and if they were caught up in chance and imagination something could still be manufactured from whatever they said she would guide the flows in the circle something could be made she wrote furiously unaware that her free hand had risen to her forehead searching for the mark afternoon sunlight slanted through the tall trees on the ridge above the vast shaido encampment dappling the air and songbirds trilled on the branches overhead redbirds and bluejays flashed by slashes of color and galina smiled heavy rain had fallen in the morning and the air still held a touch of coolness beneath sparse slowly drifting white clouds likely her gray mare with its arched neck and lively step had been the property of a noblewoman or at the least a wealthy merchant no one else but a sister could have afforded such a fine animal she enjoyed these rides on the horse she had named swift because one day it would carry her swiftly to freedom just as she enjoyed this time alone to dwell on what she would do once she had her freedom she had plans for repaying those who had failed her beginning with elaida thinking about those plans about their eventual fruition was most enjoyable at least she enjoyed her rides so long as she managed to forget that the privilege was as much a mark of how thoroughly therava owned her as were the thick white silk robe she wore and her firedropstudded belt and collar her smile faded into a grimace adornments for a pet that was allowed to amuse itself when not required to amuse its owner and she could not remove those jeweled markers even out here someone might see she rode here to get away from the aiel yet they could be encountered in the forest too therava might learn of it difficult as it was to admit to herself she feared the hawkeyed wise one to her bones therava filled her dreams and they were never pleasant often she woke sweatsoaked and weeping waking from those nightmares was always a relief whether or not she managed to get any sleep for the rest of the night there was never any order against escape on these rides an order she would have had to obey and that lack produced its own bitterness therava knew she would return no matter how she was mistreated in the hope that some day the wise one might remove that cursed oath of obedience she would be able to channel again when and as she wished sevanna sometimes made her channel to perform menial tasks or just to demonstrate that she could command it but that occurred so seldom that she hungered for even that chance to embrace saidar therava refused to let her so much as touch the power unless she begged and groveled but then refused her permission to channel a thread and she had groveled abased herself completely just to be granted that scrap she realized that she was grinding her teeth and forced herself to stop perhaps the oath rod in the tower could lift that oath from her as well as the nearly identical rod in theravas possession yet she could not be sure the two were not identical it was only a difference in marking yet what if that indicated that an oath sworn on one was particular to that rod she dared not leave without theravas rod the wise one often left it lying in the open in her tent but you will never pick that up she had said oh galina could touch that wristthick white rod stroke its smooth surface yet however hard she strained she could not make her hand close on it not unless someone handed it to her at least she hoped that would not count as picking the thing up it had to be so just the thought that it might not be filled her with bleakness the yearning in her eyes when she gazed at the rod brought theravas rare smiles does my little lina want to be free of her oath she would say mockingly then lina must be a very good pet because the only way i will consider freeing you is for you to convince me that you will remain my pet even then a lifetime of being theravas plaything and the target for her temper a surrogate to be beaten whenever therava raged against sevanna bleakness was not strong enough to describe her feelings on that horror was more like it she feared she might go mad if that happened and equally she feared there might be no escape into madness mood thoroughly soured she shaded her eyes to check the height of the sun therava had merely said that she would like her back before dark and a good two hours of daylight remained but she sighed with regret and immediately turned swift downslope through the trees toward the camp the wise one enjoyed finding ways to enforce obedience without direct commands a thousand ways to make her crawl for safety the womans slightest suggestion must be taken as a command being a few minutes late brought punishments that made galina cringe at the memories cringe and heel the mare to a faster pace through the trees therava accepted no excuses abruptly an aielman stepped out in front of her from behind a thick tree a very tall man in cadinsor with his spears thrust through the harness that held his bowcase on his back and his veil hanging on his chest without speaking he seized her bridle for an instant she gaped at him then drew herself up indignantly fool she snapped you must know me by now release my horse or sevanna and therava will take turns removing your skin these aiel usually showed little on their faces yet she thought his green eyes widened slightly and then she screamed as he seized the front of her robe in a huge fist and jerked her from the saddle be silent gaishain he said but as though he cared nothing for whether she obeyed at one time she would have had to but once they realized that she obeyed any order from anyone there had been too many who enjoyed sending her on foolish errands that kept her occupied when therava or sevanna wanted her now she need obey only certain wise ones and sevanna so she kicked and flailed and screamed in desperate hope of attracting someone who knew she belonged to therava if only she were allowed to carry a knife even that would have been a help how could this man not recognize her or at least know what her jeweled belt and collar meant the encampment was immense as filled with people as many large cities yet it seemed that everyone could point out theravas pet wetlander the woman would have this fellow skinned and galina meant to enjoy every minute of watching all too quickly it became apparent that a knife would have been no use at all despite her struggles the brute handled her easily pulling her cowl down over her head blinding her then stuffing as much of it as he could into her mouth before binding it there then he flipped her face down and bound her wrists and ankles tightly as easily as if she had been a child she still thrashed but it was wasted effort he wanted some gaishain that arent aiel gaul but a gaishain in silk and jewels and out riding a man said and therava stiffened that was no aielman those were the accents of murandy sure and thats none of your ways is it shaido the word was spat out like a curse well we still need to find a few more if hes to learn anything useful maybe more than a few there are tens of thousands of folks in white down there and she could be anywhere among them i think maybe this one can tell perrin aybara what he needs to know fager neald if she had stiffened before now she froze ice seemed to form in her stomach and in her heart perrin aybara had sent these men if he attacked the shaido trying to rescue his wife he would be killed destroying her leverage with faile the woman would not care what was revealed with her man dead and the others had no secrets they feared having known in horror galina saw her hopes of obtaining the rod melting away she had to stop him but how and why would be you thinking that gaul she is aes sedai and a friend of sevanna it seems is she now the murandian said in a thoughtful tone is she that strangely neither man sounded the least uneasy over laying hands on an aes sedai and the aielman apparently had done so fully aware of what she was even if he was a renegade shaido he had to be ignorant of the fact that she could not channel without permission only sevanna and a handful of the wise ones knew that this was all growing more confusing by the moment suddenly she was lifted into the air and laid on her belly across her own saddle she realized and the next moment she was bouncing on the hard leather one of the men using a hand to keep her from falling as the mare began to trot let us go to where you can make us one of your holes fager neald just the other side of the slope gaul why ive been here so often i can make a gateway nearly anywhere at all do you aiel run everywhere a gateway what was the man blathering about dismissing his nonsense she considered her options and found none good bound like a lamb for market gagged so she would not be heard ten paces away if she shrieked her lungs out her chances of escape were nonexistent unless some of the shaido sentries intercepted her captors but did she want them to unless she reached aybara she had no way to stop him from ruining everything on the other hand how many days off did his camp lie he could not be very near or the shaido would have found him by now she knew scouts had been making sweeps as far as ten miles from the camp however many days were required to reach him it would take as many to return not merely minutes late but days late therava would not kill her for it just make her wish she were dead she could explain a tale of being captured by brigands no just a pair it was hard enough to believe two men had gotten this near the encampment much less a band of brigands unable to channel she had needed time to escape she could make the tale convincing it might persuade therava if she said it was useless the first time therava had punished her for being late it had been because her cinch broke and she had had to walk back leading her horse the woman had not accepted that excuse and she would not accept being kidnapped either galina wanted to weep in fact she realized that she was weeping hopeless tears she was helpless to stop the horse halted and before she could think she convulsed wildly trying to fling herself off the saddle screaming as loudly as her gag permitted they had to be trying to avoid sentries surely therava would understand if the sentries returned with her and her captors even if she was late surely she could find a way to handle faile even with her husband dead a hard hand smacked her rudely be silent the aielman said and they began to trot again her tears began again too and the silk cowl covering her face grew damp therava was going to make her howl but even while she wept she began to work on what she would say to aybara at least she could salvage her chances of obtaining the rod therava was going to no no she needed to concentrate on what she could do images of the crueleyed wise one holding a switch or a strap or binding cords reared in her mind but every time she forced them down while she went over every question aybara might ask and what answers she would give him on what she would say to make him leave his wifes safety in her hands in none of her calculations had she expected to be lifted down and stood upright no more than an hour after being captured unsaddle her horse noren and picket it with the others the murandian said right away master neald came a reply in a cairhienin accent the bonds around her ankles fell away a knife blade slid between her wrists severing those cords and then whatever held her gag in place was untied she spat out silk sodden with her own saliva and jerked the cowl back a short man in a dark coat was leading swift away through a straggle of large patched brown tents and small crude huts that seemed made from tree branches including pine boughs with brown needles how long for pine to turn brown days surely perhaps weeks the sixty or seventy men tending cookfires or sitting on wooden stools looked like farmers in their rough coats but some were sharpening swords and spears and halberds and other polearms stood stacked in a dozen places through the gaps between the tents and huts she could see more men moving about to either side a number of them in helmets and breastplates mounted and carrying long streamered lances soldiers riding out on patrol how many more lay beyond her sight no matter what was in front of her eyes was impossible the shaido had sentries further from their camp than this she was certain they did if the face wasnt enough neald murmured that cool calculating study would convince me like shes examining worms under a rock shes turned over a weedy fellow in a black coat he knuckled his waxed mustaches in an amused way careful not to spoil the points he wore a sword but he certainly had no look of soldier or armsman about him well come along then aes sedai he said clasping her upper arm lord perrin will be wanting to ask you some questions she jerked free and he calmly took a firmer grip none of that now the huge aielman gaul took her other arm and she could go with them or be dragged she walked with her head high pretending they were merely an escort but anyone who saw how they held her arms would know differently staring straight ahead she was still aware of armed farmboysmost were youngstaring at her not gaping in astonishment just watching considering how could they be so highhanded with an aes sedai some of the wise ones who were unaware of the oath holding her had begun expressing doubt that she was aes sedai because she obeyed so readily and truckled so for therava but these two knew what she was and did not care she suspected those farmers knew too and yet none displayed any surprise at how she was being treated it made the back of her neck prickle as they approached a large redandwhite striped tent with the doorflaps tied back she overheard voices from inside said he was ready to come right now a man was saying i cant afford to feed one more mouth when i dont know for how long another man replied blood and ashes how long does it take to arrange a meeting with these people gaul had to duck into the tent but galina strode in as though entering her own rooms in the tower a prisoner she might be yet she was aes sedai and that simple fact was a powerful tool and weapon who was he trying to arrange a meeting with not sevanna surely let it be anyone but sevanna in stark contrast to the ramshackle camp outside there was a good flowered carpet for a floor here and two silk hangings embroidered with flowers and birds in a cairhienin fashion hung from the roof poles she focused on a tall broadshouldered man in his shirtsleeves with his back to her leaning on his fists against a slenderlegged table that was decorated with lines of gilding and covered with maps and sheets of paper she had only glimpsed aybara at a distance in cairhien yet she was sure this was the farmboy from rand althors home village in spite of the silk shirt and wellpolished boots even the turndowns were polished if nothing else everyone in the tent seemed to be looking to him as she walked into the tent a tall woman in highnecked green silk with small touches of lace at her throat and wrists black hair falling in waves to her shoulders laid a hand on aybaras arm in a familiar manner galina recognized her she seems cautious perrin berelain said wary of a trap in my estimation lord perrin put in a graying hardbitten man in an ornate breastplate worn over a scarlet coat a ghealdanin galina thought at least he and berelain explained the presence of soldiers if not how they could be where they could not possibly be galina was very glad she had not encountered the woman in cairhien that would have made matters now more than merely awkward she wished her hands were free to wipe the residue of tears from her face but the two men held onto her arms firmly there was nothing to be done about it she was aes sedai that was all that mattered that was all she would allow to matter she opened her mouth to take command of the situation aybara suddenly looked over his shoulder at her as though he had sensed her presence in some way and his golden eyes froze her tongue she had dismissed tales that the man had a wolfs eyes but he did a wolfs hard eyes in a stonehard face he made the ghealdanin look almost soft a sad face behind that closecropped beard as well over his wife no doubt she could make use of that an aes sedai wearing gaishain white he said flatly turning to face her he was a large man if not nearly so large as the aielman and he loomed just by standing there those golden eyes taking in everything and a prisoner it seems she didnt want to come she thrashed like a trout on the riverbank while gaul was tying her up my lord neald replied myself i had nothing to do but stand and watch a strange thing to say and in such a significant tone what could he have abruptly she became aware of another man in a black coat a stocky weathered fellow with a silver pin in the shape of a sword fastened to his high collar and she remembered where she had last seen men in black coats leaping out of holes in the air just before everything turned to utter disaster at dumais wells neald and his holes his gateways these men could channel it took everything she could summon not to try jerking free of the murandians clasp not to edge away just being this close to him made her stomach writhe being touched by him she wanted to whimper and that surprised her surely she was tougher than that she concentrated on maintaining an appearance of calm while trying to work moisture back into her suddenly dry mouth she claims friendship with sevanna gaul added a friend of sevanna aybara said frowning but wearing a gaishain robe a silk robe and jewels but still you didnt want to come but you didnt channel to try stopping gaul and neald from bringing you and youre terrified he shook his head how did he know she was afraid im surprised to see an aes sedai with the shaido after dumais wells or dont you know about that let her go let her go i doubt shell take off running since she let you bring her this far dumais wells does not matter she said coldly as the mens hands fell away the pair remained on either side of her like guards though and she was proud of the steadiness of her voice a man who could channel two of them and she was alone alone and unable to channel a thread she stood straight head erect she was aes sedai and they must see her every inch an aes sedai how could he know she was afraid not a shred of fear tinged her words her face might as well been carved of stone for all she let show the white tower has purposes none but aes sedai can know or understand i am about white tower business and you are interfering an unwise choice for any man the ghealdanin nodded ruefully as though he had learned that lesson personally aybara merely looked at her expressionless hearing your name was the only reason i didnt do something drastic to these two she continued if the murandian or the aielmen brought up how long that had taken she was ready to claim that she had been stunned at first but they held silent and she spoke quickly and forcefully your wife faile is under my protection as well as queen alliandre and when my business with sevanna is done i will take them to safety with me and help them reach wherever they wish to go in the meanwhile however your presence here endangers my business white tower business which i cannot allow it also endangers you and your wife and alliandre there are tens of thousands of aiel in that camp many tens of thousands if they descend on you and their scouts will find you soon if they havent already they will wipe all of you from the face of the earth they may harm your wife and alliandre for it as well i may not be able to stop sevanna she is a harsh woman and many of her wise ones can channel nearly four hundred of them all willing to use the power to do violence while i am one aes sedai and constrained by my oaths if you wish to protect your wife and the queen turn away from their camp and ride as hard as you can they may not attack you if you are obviously retreating that is the only hope you or your wife have there if only a few of the seeds she had planted took root they should be enough to turn him back if alliandre is in danger lord perrin the ghealdanin began but aybara stopped him with a raised hand that was all it took the soldiers jaw tightened till she thought she might hear it creak yet he remained silent youve seen faile the young man said excitement touching his voice shes well she hasnt been harmed the fool seemed not to have a word she said beyond mention of his wife well and under my protection lord perrin if this jumpedup country boy wanted to call himself a lord she would tolerate it for the moment she and alliandre both the soldier glowered at aybara but he did not take the opportunity to speak you must listen to me the shaido will kill you come here and look at this aybara broke in turning to the table and drawing a large page toward him you must forgive his lack of manners aes sedai berelain murmured handing her a worked silver cup of dark wine he is under considerable strain as you might understand in the circumstances i havent introduced myself i am berelain the first of mayene i know you may call me alyse the other woman smiled as though she knew that was a false name yet accepting it the first of mayene was far from unsophisticated a pity she had to deal with the boy instead sophisticated people who thought they could dance with aes sedai were easily led country folk could prove stubborn out of ignorance but the fellow should know something of aes sedai by now perhaps ignoring him would give him reason to think on who and what she was the wine tasted like flowers on her tongue this is very good she said with genuine gratitude she had not tasted decent wine for weeks therava would not permit her a pleasure the wise one denied herself if the woman learned that she had found several barrels in malden she would not even have mediocre wine and surely would be beaten as well there are other sisters in the camp alyse sedai masuri sokawa and seonid traighan and my own advisor annoura larisen would you like to speak to them after you finish with perrin with feigned casualness galina drew up her cowl till her face was shadowed and took another swallow of wine for time to think annouras presence was understandable given berelains but what were the other two doing there they had been among those who fled the tower after siuan was deposed and elaida raised true none of them would know of her involvement in kidnapping the althor boy for elaida but still i think not she murmured their business is theirs and mine is mine she would have given a great deal to know their business but not at the cost of being recognized any friend of the dragon reborn might havenotionsabout a red help me convince aybara berelain your winged guards are no match for what the shaido will send against them whatever ghealdanin you have with you wont make a difference an army will make no difference the shaido are too many and they have hundreds of wise ones ready to use the one power as a weapon i have seen them do it you may die too and even if you are captured i cant promise i can make sevanna release you when i leave berelain laughed as though thousands of shaido and hundreds of wise ones who could channel were of no account oh have no fear they will find us their camp lies a good threeday ride from here perhaps four the terrain turns rough not far from where we are three days perhaps four galina shivered she should have put it together before this three or four days of ground covered in less than an hour through a hole in the air created with the male half of the power she had been near enough for saidin to touch her she kept her voice steady though even so you must help me convince him not to attack it would be disastrous for him for his wife for everyone involved beyond that what i am doing is important to the tower you have always been a strong supporter of the tower flattery for the ruler of a single city and a few hides of land but flattery oiled the insignificant as well as it did the mighty perrin is stubborn alyse sedai i doubt youll change his mind that isnt easy to do once he has it set for some reason the young woman smiled a smile mysterious enough to credit a sister berelain could you have your talk later aybara said impatiently and it was not a suggestion he tapped the sheet of paper with a thick finger alyse would you look at this that was not a suggestion either who did the man think he was ordering an aes sedai still moving to the table took her a little way from neald it brought her nearer the other one who was studying her intently but he was on the other side of the table a feeble barrier yet she could ignore him by looking at the sheet of paper under aybaras finger keeping her eyebrows from rising was difficult the town of malden was outlined there complete with the aqueduct that brought water from a lake five miles away and also a rough outline of the shaido camp surrounding the city the real surprise was that markings seemed to indicate the arrival of septs since the shaido reached malden and the number of those meant his men had been observing the camp for some time another map roughly sketched seemed to show the city itself in some detail i see you have learned how large their camp is she said you must know rescuing her is hopeless even if you have a hundred of those men speaking of them was not easy and she could not entirely keep the contempt from her voice it isnt enough those wise ones will fight back hundreds of them it would be a slaughter thousands dead your wife perhaps among them i have told you she and alliandre are under my protection when my business is finished i will take them to safety you have heard me say it so by the three oaths you know it is true dont make the mistake of thinking that your connection to rand althor will protect you if you interfere in what the white tower is doing yes i know who you are did you think your wife wouldnt tell me she trusts me and if you want to keep her safe you must trust me too the idiot looked at her as though her words had flown over his head without touching his ears those eyes were truly unsettling where does she sleep her and everyone else who was captured with her show me i cannot she replied levelly gaishain seldom sleep in the same place two nights running with that lie vanished the last chance that she could leave faile and the others alive oh she had never intended to increase the risk of her own escape by aiding them but that could always have been explained later by some change in circumstances she could not hazard the possibility that they might actually escape one day and uncover her direct lie however i will get her free he growled almost too softly for her to hear whatever it takes her thoughts raced there seemed no way to divert him from it but perhaps she could delay him she had to do at least that will you at least hold off your attack i may be able to conclude my affairs in a few more days perhaps a week a deadline should sharpen failes efforts before it would have been dangerous a threat not carried out lost all force and the chance had been too great that the woman might be unable to get the rod in time now the chance became necessary if i can do that and bring your wife and others out there will be no reason for you to die needlessly one week frustration painting his face aybara thumped his fist on the table hard enough to make it bounce you can have a few days he growled maybe even a week or more if he bit off whatever he had been about to say those strange eyes centered on her face but i cant promise how many days he went on if i had my druthers id be attacking now i wont leave faile a prisoner a day longer than i have to while i wait on aes sedai schemes for the shaido to bear fruit you say shes under your protection but how great a protection can you really give wearing that robe there are signs of drunkenness in the camp even some of their sentries drink are the wise ones given to it as well the sudden shift nearly made her blink the wise ones drink only water so you neednt think you can find them all in a stupor she told him dryly and quite truthfully it always amused her when the truth served her purposes not that the wise ones example was bearing much fruit drunkenness was rife among the shaido every raid brought back all the wine that could be found dozens and dozens of small stills produced vile brews from grains and every time the wise ones destroyed a still two sprang up in its place letting him know that would only encourage him though as for the others i have been with armies before this and seen more drinking than i have among the shaido if a hundred are drunk among tens of thousands what gain is there for you really it will be better if you promise me a week two would be better still his eyes flashed to the map and his right hand made a fist again but there was no anger in his voice do the shaido go inside the town walls very often she set the winecup down on the table and drew herself up meeting that yelloweyed gaze required effort yet she managed without a falter i think its past time you showed proper respect i am an aes sedai not a servant do the shaido go inside the town walls very often he repeated in exactly the same even tone she wanted to grind her teeth no she snapped theyve looted everything worth stealing and some things that arent she regretted the words as soon as they left her tongue they had seemed safe until she remembered men who could leap through holes in the air that isnt to say they never enter most days a few go in there might be twenty or thirty at any time more on occasion in groups of two or three did he have the wit to see what that would mean best to make sure he saw you could not secure them all inevitably some will escape to warn the camp aybara only nodded when you see faile tell her that on the day she sees fog on the ridges and hears wolves howl by daylight she and the others must go to lady cairens fortress at the north end of the city and hide there tell her i love her tell her im coming for her wolves was the man demented how could he ensure that wolves would suddenly with those wolfs eyes on her she was not sure she wanted to know i will tell her she lied perhaps he only meant to use the men in black coats to grab his wife but why wait at all in that case those yellow eyes hid secrets she wished she knew who was he trying to meet clearly not sevanna she would have thanked the light for that if she had not abandoned that foolishness long since who was ready to come to him right away one man had been mentioned but that might mean a king with an army or althor himself him she prayed never to see again her promise seemed to release something in the young man he exhaled slowly and a tension she had not noticed left his face the trouble with a blacksmiths puzzle he said softly tapping the outline of malden is always getting the key piece into place well thats done or soon will be will you stay for supper berelain asked the hour is near the light was dimming in the open doorway a lean serving woman in dark wool her white hair in a bun on the back of her head entered and began lighting the lamps will you promise me at least a week galina demanded but aybara shook his head in that case every hour is important she had never intended staying a moment longer than necessary but she had to force her next words out will you have one of yourmentake me back to as near the camp as possible do it neald aybara commanded and at least try to be polite he said that she drew a deep breath and pushed her cowl back i want you to hit me here she touched her cheek hard enough to bruise finally she had said something that got through to the man those yellow eyes widened and he tucked his thumbs behind his belt as though securing his hands i will not he said sounding as though she were insane the ghealdanins mouth hung open and the serving woman was staring at her the burning taper in her hand hanging dangerously near her skirts i require it galina said firmly she would need every scrap of verisimilitude she could find with therava do it i dont believe he will berelain said gliding forward with her skirts gathered he has very country ways if you will permit me galina nodded impatiently there was nothing for it though the woman likely would not leave a very convincing her vision went dark and when she could see again she was swaying slightly she could taste blood her hand went to her cheek and she winced too hard berelain inquired anxiously no galina mumbled fighting to keep her face smooth had she been able to channel she would have torn the womans head off of course if she could have channeled none of this would be necessary now the other cheek and have someone fetch my horse she rode into the forest with the murandian to a place where several of the huge trees lay toppled and oddly slashed sure it would be difficult for her to use his hole in the air but when the man produced a vertical silverblue slash that widened into a view of steeply climbing land she did not think of tainted saidin at all as she heeled swift through the opening never a thought except of therava she almost howled when she realized she was on the opposite side of the ridge from the encampment frantically she raced the sinking sun and lost she had been right unfortunately therava did not accept excuses she was particularly upset over the bruises she herself never marred galinas face what followed easily equaled her nightmares and it lasted much longer at times when she was screaming her loudest she almost forgot her desperate need to get the rod but she clung to that obtain the rod kill faile and her friends and she would be free egwene regained awareness slowly and muzzy as she was barely had the presence of mind to keep her eyes closed pretending still to be unconscious was all too easy her head lay slumped on a womans shoulder and she could not have lifted it had she tried an aes sedais shoulder she could sense the womans ability her brain felt stuffed with wool her thoughts were slow and veering her limbs all but numb her wool riding dress and cloak were dry she realized despite the soaking she had received in the river well that was easily managed with the power small chance they had channeled the water from her garments for her comfort though she was seated wedged in between two sisters one of whom wore a flowery perfume each using a hand to keep her more or less upright they were in a coach by the way they all swayed and the clatter of a trotting teams horseshoes on paving stones carefully she opened her eyes to narrow slits the coachs side curtains were tied back though the stink of rotting garbage made her think it would have been better to pull them shut garbage rotting how could tar valon have come to that such neglect of the city was reason enough by itself for elaida to be removed the windows let in enough moonlight for her to dimly make out three aes sedai seated facing her in the rear of the coach even had she not known they could channel their fringed shawls would have made it certain in tar valon wearing a shawl with fringe could result in unpleasantness for a woman who was not aes sedai oddly the sister on the left appeared to be huddling against the side of the coach away from the other two and if they were not exactly huddling at least they were sitting very close together as though avoiding contact with the third aes sedai very odd abruptly it came to her that she was not shielded muddled she might be but that made no sense at all they could feel her strength as she could theirs and while none was weak she thought she could overcome all five if she were quick enough the true source was a vast sun just beyond the edge of sight calling to her the first question was did she dare try yet in the state her head was thought wading through kneedeep mud whether she could actually embrace saidar was uncertain and succeed or fail they would know once she tried best to try recovering a little beforehand the second question was how long did she dare wait they would not let her go unshielded forever experimentally she tried wiggling her toes inside her stout leather shoes and was delighted when they moved obediently life seemed to be returning slowly to her arms and legs she thought she might be able to raise her head now if unsteadily whatever they had given her was wearing off how long events were taken out of her hands by the darkhaired sister sitting in the middle of the rear seat who leaned forward and slapped her so hard that she toppled onto the lap of the woman she had been leaning against her hand went to her stinging cheek on its own volition so much for pretending unconsciousness there was no need for that katerine a raspy voice said above her as its owner lifted her upright again she could hold her head up just it turned out katerine that would be katerine alruddin a red it seemed important to identify her captors for some reason though she knew nothing of katerine beyond her name and ajah the sister she had fallen onto was yellowhaired but her moonshadowed face belonged to a stranger i think you gave her too much of the forkroot the woman went on a chill flashed through her so that was what she had been fed she racked her brain for everything nynaeve had told her about that vile tea but her thoughts were still slow better though it seemed she was sure nynaeve had said the effects took some time to go away completely i gave her the exact dose felaana the sister who had slapped her replied dryly and as you can see it is leaving her precisely as it should i want her able to walk by the time we reach the tower i certainly dont intend to help carry her again she finished with a glare for the sister seated to egwenes left who shook her head beaded braids clicking faintly that was pritalle nerbaijan a yellow who had done her best to avoid teaching novices or accepted and made little secret of her dislike for the task when forced to it to have my harril carry her it would have been improper yes she said coldly in fact icily myself i will be glad if she can walk but if not so be it in any case i look forward to handing her over to others if you do not want to carry her again katerine i do not want to stand guard over her half the night in the cells katerine gave a dismissive toss of her head the cells of course she was bound for one of those small dark rooms on the first level of the towers basement elaida would charge her with falsely claiming to be the amyrlin seat the penalty for that was death strangely that brought no fear perhaps it was the herb working on her would romanda or lelaine give way agreeing to raise amyrlin after she was dead or would they continue to struggle with one another until the entire rebellion faltered and failed and the sisters straggled back to elaida a sad thought that bonedeep sad but if she could feel sorrow the forkroot was not quenching her emotions so why was she not afraid she thumbed her great serpent ring at least she tried to and discovered it gone anger flared whitehot they might kill her but they would not deny she was aes sedai who betrayed me she asked pleased that her tone was even and cool it cant hurt to tell me since im your prisoner the sisters stared at her as though surprised she had a voice katerine leaned forward casually raising her hand the reds eyes tightened when palehaired felaana lunged to catch the slap before it could land on egwene she will no doubt be executed the raspyvoiced woman said firmly but she is an initiate of the tower and none of us has the right to beat her take your hand off me brown katerine snarled and shockingly the light of saidar enveloped her in an instant the glow surrounded every woman in the coach except egwene they eyed one another like strange cats on the brink of hissing on the brink of lashing out with claws no not everyone katerine and the taller sister seated against her flank never glanced at one another but they had glares aplenty for the rest what under the light was going on the mutual hostility was so thick in the air she could have sliced it like bread after a moment felaana released katerines wrist and leaned back yet no one released the source egwene suddenly suspected that no one was willing to be the first their faces were all serene in the pale moonlight but the browns hands were knotted in her shawl and the sister leaning away from katerine was smoothing her skirts repeatedly about time for this i think katerine said weaving a shield we wouldnt want you to try anythingfutile her smile was vicious egwene merely sighed as the weave settled on her she doubted she could have embraced saidar yet in any case and against five already full of the power success would have lasted moments at most her mild reaction appeared to disappoint the red this may be your last night in the world she went on it wouldnt surprise me in the slightest if elaida had you stilled and beheaded tomorrow or even tonight her lanky companion added nodding i think elaida may be that eager to see the end of you unlike katerine she was merely stating a fact but she was surely another red and watching the other sisters as though she suspected one of them might try something this was very strange egwene held on to her composure denying them the response they wanted the response katerine wanted at least she was determined to maintain her dignity right to the headsmans block whether or not she had managed to do well as amyrlin she would die in a manner fitting for the amyrlin seat the woman huddling away from the two reds spoke and her voice full of arafel allowed egwene to put a name to the hard narrow face dimly seen by moonlight berisha terakuni a gray with a reputation for the strictest and often harshest interpretation of the law always to the letter of course but never with any sense of mercy not tonight or tomorrow barasine not unless elaida is willing to summon the sitters in the middle of the night and theyre willing to answer this requires a high court no thing of minutes or even hours and the hall seems less eager to please elaida than she might wish small wonder the girl will be tried but the hall will sit in the matter when they choose i think the hall will come when elaida calls or shell hand them all penances that will make them wish they had katerine sneered the way jala and merym galloped off when we saw who wed caught she knows by now and ill wager that for this one elaida will drag sitters from their beds with her own hands if she must her voice grew smug and cutting at the same time perhaps she will name you to the chair of pardon would you enjoy that berisha drew herself up indignantly shifting her shawl on her arms in some instances the chair of pardon faced the same penalty as the one she defended perhaps this charge required it despite siuans best efforts to complete her education egwene did not know what i want to hear the gray said after a moment ostentatiously ignoring the women on the seat with her is what did you do to the harbor chain how can it be undone it cant be undone egwene replied you must know that its cuendillar now even the power wont break it only strengthen it i suppose you could sell it if you tear down enough of the harbor wall to remove it if anyone can afford a piece of cuendillar that big or would want such a thing this time no one tried to stop katerine from slapping her and very hard too hold your tongue the red snapped that seemed good advice unless she wanted to be slapped silly she could taste blood in her mouth already so egwene held her tongue and silence descended on the rolling coach the others all glowing with saidar and watching each other suspiciously it was incredible why had elaida ever chosen women who clearly detested one another for tonights task as a demonstration of her power just because she could no matter if elaida allowed her to live through the night at least she could let siuan know what had happened to herand likely to leane as well she could let siuan know they had been betrayed and pray that siuan could track down the betrayer pray that the rebellion would not collapse she offered a small prayer for that on the spot it was much more important than the other by the time the coachman reined in the team she had recovered enough to follow katerine and pritalle from the coach unaided though her head still felt a trifle thick she could stand but she doubted she had the strength to run far not that trying would achieve anything beyond being halted after a few steps so she stood calmly beside the darklacquered coach and waited as patiently as the fourhorse team in their harness after all she was harnessed too in a manner of speaking the white tower loomed over them a thick pale shaft rearing into the night few of its windows were alight but some of those were near the very top perhaps in the rooms elaida occupied it was very strange she was a prisoner and unlikely to live much longer yet she felt she had come home the tower seemed to renew her vigor two towerliveried backriders the flame of tar valon on their chests had dismounted from the rear of the coach to unfold the steps and they stood offering a whitegloved hand to each woman who dismounted but only berisha availed herself and only because it let her reach the paving stones quickly while eyeing the other sisters egwene suspected barasine gave the fellows such looks that one gulped audibly and the others face grew pale felaana busy trying to watch the others merely waved the men away irritably all five still held saidar even here they were at the main rear entrance stonerailed marble stairs descending from the second level beneath four massive bronze lanterns that cast a wide pool of flickering light and to her surprise a single novice stood alone at the foot of the stairs clutching her white cloak against a slight chill in the air she had more than halfexpected elaida to meet them in person to gloat over her capture with a retinue of sycophants that the novice was nicola treehill was a second surprise the last place she would have thought to find the runaway was inside the white tower itself by the way nicolas eyes widened when egwene emerged from the coach the novice was more startled than herself but she dropped a neat if hasty curtsey to the sisters the amyrlin says sheshe is to be handed over to the mistress of novices katerine sedai she says that silviana sedai has her instructions so it seems youll be birched tonight at least katerine murmured with a smile egwene wondered whether the woman hated her personally or for what she represented or simply hated everyone birched she had never seen it done but she had heard a description it sounded extremely painful she met katerines gaze levelly and after a moment the smile faded the woman looked about to strike her again the aiel had a way of dealing with pain they embraced it gave themselves over to it without fighting or even trying to hold back screams perhaps that would help the wise ones said that way the pain could be cast off without keeping its hold on you if elaida means to drag this out unnecessarily ill have no more part in it tonight felaana announced frowning at everyone in sight including nicola if the girl is to be stilled and executed that should be sufficient gathering her skirts the yellowhaired sister darted past nicola up the stairs actually running the glow of saidar still surrounded her as she vanished inside i agree pritalle said coolly harril i think ill walk with you while you stable bloodlance a dark stocky man who had come out of the darkness leading a tall bay bowed to her stonefaced he wore a warders chameleon cloak that made most of him seem not to be there when he stood still and rippled with colors when he moved silently he followed pritalle off into the night but watching over his shoulder guarding pritalles back the light remained around her too there was something here that egwene was missing suddenly nicola spread her skirts in another curtsy deeper this time and words burst out of her in a rush im sorry i ran away mother i thought theyd let me go faster here areina and i thought dont call her that katerine barked and a switch of air caught the novice across the bottom hard enough to make her squeal and jump if youre attending the amyrlin seat tonight child get back to her and tell her i said her orders will be carried out now run with one last frantic glance at egwene nicola gathered her cloak and her skirts and went scrambling up the stairs so fast that twice she stumbled and nearly fell poor nicola her hopes had surely been disappointed and if the tower discovered her age she must have lied about that to betaken in lying was one of her several bad habits egwene dismissed the girl from her mind nicola was no longer her concern there was no need to frighten the child out of her wits berisha said surprisingly novices need to be guided not bludgeoned a far cry from her views on the law katerine and barasine rounded on the gray together staring at her intently only two cats now but rather than another cat they saw a mouse do you mean to come with us to silviana alone katerine asked with a decidedly unpleasant smile twisting her lips arent you afraid gray barasine said a touch of mockery in her voice for some reason she swung one arm a little so the long fringe of her shawl swayed just the one of you and two of us the two backriders stood like statues like men who desired heartily to be anywhere else and hoped to remain unnoticed if sufficiently still berisha was no taller than egwene but she drew herself up and clutched her shawl around her threats are specifically prohibited by tower did barasine threaten you katerine cut in softly softly yet with sharp steel wrapped in it she just asked whether you are afraid should you be berisha licked her lips uneasily her face was bloodless and her eyes grew wider and wider as though she saw things she had no wish to see ii think i will take a walk in the grounds she said at last in a strangled voice and sidled away without ever taking her eyes from the two reds katerine gave a small satisfied laugh this was absolute madness even sisters who hated one another to the toenails did not behave in this fashion no woman who gave in to fear as easily as berisha had could ever have become aes sedai in the first place something was wrong in the tower very wrong bring her katerine said starting up the stairs at last releasing saidar barasine gripped egwenes arm tightly and followed there was no choice save to gather her divided skirts and go along without a struggle yet her spirits were oddly buoyant entering the tower truly did feel like returning home the white walls with their friezes and tapestries the brightly colored floor tiles seemed as familiar as her mothers kitchen more so in a way it had been far longer since she saw her mothers kitchen than these hallways she took in the strength of home with every breath but there was strangeness too the standlamps were all alight and the hour could not be all that late yet she saw no one there were always a few sisters gliding along the corridors even in the dead of night she remembered that vividly catching sight of some sister while running on an errand in the small hours and despairing that she would ever be so graceful so queenly aes sedai kept their own hours and some browns hardly liked being awake during daylight at all night held fewer distractions from their studies fewer interruptions to their reading but there was no one neither katerine nor barasine made any comment as they walked along hallways lifeless except for the three of them apparently this silent emptiness was a matter of course now as they reached pale stone stairs set in an alcove another sister finally appeared climbing from below a plump woman in a redslashed riding dress with a mouth that looked ready to smile she wore her shawl edged with long red silk fringe draped along her arms katerine and the others might well have worn theirs to mark them out clearly at the docksno one in tar valon would bother a woman wearing a fringed shawl and most kept clear if they could particularly menbut why here the newcomers thick black eyebrows raised over bright blue eyes at the sight of egwene and she planted her fists on ample hips letting her shawl slide to her elbows egwene did not think she had ever seen the woman before but apparently the reverse was not true why thats the alvere girl they sent her to southharbor elaida will give you a pretty for this nights work yes she will but look at her look at how she stands so youd think the pair of you were an honor guard for escort id have thought shed be weeping and wailing for mercy i believe the herb is still dulling her senses katerine muttered with a sidelong scowl for egwene she doesnt seem to realize her situation barasine still holding egwenes arm gave her a vigorous shake but after a small stagger she managed to catch her balance and kept her face smooth ignoring the taller womans glares in shock the plump red said nodding she did not sound exactly sympathetic but after katerine she was near enough ive seen that before how did matters go at northharbor melare barasine asked not so well as with you it seems with everyone else squealing to themselves like shoats caught under a fence over there being two of us i was afraid wed scare off who we were trying to catch its a good thing there were two of us who would talk to one another as it was all we caught was a wilder and not before she turned half the harbor chain to cuendillar we ended up near killing the coachhorses by galloping back like well like wed caught your prize zanica insisted even put her warder up in place of the coachman a wilder katerine said contemptuously only half relief stood out clearly in barasines voice then northharbor isnt blocked melares eyebrows climbed again as the implications sank in well see how clear it is in the morning she said slowly when they let down the half thats still iron the rest of it stands out stiff like well like a bar of cuendillar myself i doubt any but smaller vessels will be able to cross she shook her head with a puzzled expression there was something strange though more than strange we couldnt find the wilder at first we couldnt feel her channeling there was no glow around her and we couldnt see her weaves the chain just started turning white if arebiss warder hadnt spotted the boat she might have finished and gotten away clever leane egwene murmured for an instant she squeezed her eyes shut leane had prepared everything in advance before coming in sight of the harbor all inverted and her ability masked if she herself had been as clever she likely would have escaped cleanly but then hindsight always saw furthest thats the name she gave melare said frowning the womans eyebrows like dark caterpillars were very expressive leane sharif of the green ajah two very stupid lies desala is striping her from top to bottom down there but she wont budge i had to come up for a breath i never liked flogging even for one like that do you know this trick of hers child how to hide your weaves oh light they thought leane was a wilder pretending to be aes sedai shes telling the truth stilling cost her the ageless look and made her appear younger she was healed by nynaeve almeara and since she was no longer of the blue she chose a new ajah ask her questions only leane sharif could know the answers speech ended for her as a ball of air filled her mouth forcing her jaws wide till they creaked we dont have to listen to this nonsense katerine growled melare stared into egwenes eyes though it sounds senseless to be sure she said after a moment but i suppose it wouldnt hurt to ask a few questions besides what is your name at worse itll cut the tedium of the womans answers shall we take her down to the cells katerine i dont dare leave desala alone with the other one for long she despises wilders and she purely hates women who claim to be aes sedai shes not going to the cells yet katerine replied elaida wants her taken to silviana well as long as i learn that trick from this child or the other one hitching her shawl up onto her shoulders melare took a deep breath and headed back down the stairs a woman with labor ahead of her she was not looking forward to she gave egwene hope for leane though leane was the other one now no longer the wilder katerine set off down the corridor walking quickly and in silence but barasine pushed egwene ahead of her after the other red muttering half under her breath about how ridiculous it was to think that a sister could learn anything from a wilder or from a jumpedup accepted who told outlandish lies maintaining some shreds of dignity was difficult to say the least while being shoved down a hallway by a longlegged woman with your mouth gaping open as wide as it would go and drool leaking down your chin but she managed as best she could in truth she hardly thought about it melare had given her too much to think on melare added to the sisters in the coach it could hardly mean what it seemed to but if it did soon the blueandwhite floor tiles became redandgreen and they approached an unmarked wooden door between two tapestries of flowered trees and stoutbeaked birds so colorful they seemed unlikely to be real unmarked but bright with polish and known to every initiate of the tower katerine rapped on the door with what might almost have been a display of diffidence and when a strong voice inside called come she drew a deep breath before pushing the door open did she have bad memories of entering here as novice or accepted or was it the woman who awaited them who made her hesitant the study of the mistress of novices was exactly as egwene recalled a small darkpaneled room with plain sturdy furnishings a narrow table by the doorway was lightly carved in a peculiar pattern and bits of gilt clung to the carved frame of the mirror on one wall but nothing else was decorated in any way the standlamps and the pair of lamps on the writing table were unadorned brass though of six different patterns the woman who held the office usually changed when a new amyrlin was raised yet egwene was ready to wager that a woman who had come to this room as a novice two hundred years ago would recognize nearly every stick and perhaps everything the current mistress of novicesin the tower at leastwas on her feet when they entered a stocky woman nearly as tall as barasine with a dark bun on the back of her head and a square determined chin there was an air of brooking no nonsense about silviana brehon she was a red and her charcoalcolored skirts had discreet red slashes but her shawl lay draped across the back of the chair behind the writing table her large eyes were unsettling however they seemed to take in everything about egwene in a glance as though the woman not only knew every thought in her head but also what she would think tomorrow leave her with me and wait outside silviana said in a low firm voice leave her katerine said incredulously which words did you not understand katerine need i repeat myself apparently she did not katerine flushed but she said no more the glow of saidar surrounded silviana and she took over the shield smoothly without giving any opening when egwene might have embraced the power herself she was certain that she could now except that silviana was far from weak there was no hope she could break the womans shield the gag of air disappeared at the same time and she contented herself with digging a handkerchief from her belt pouch and calmly wiping her chin the pouch had been searchedshe always kept the handkerchief on top not beneath everything elsebut learning whether anything besides her ring had been taken would have to wait there had not been anything of much use to a prisoner in any case a comb a packet of needles some small scissors odds and ends the amyrlins stole what sort of dignity she could maintain while being birched was beyond her but that was the future this was now silviana studied her arms folded beneath her breasts until the door closed behind the other two reds you arent hysterical at least she said then that makes matters easier but why arent you hysterical would it do any good egwene replied returning the handkerchief to her pouch i cant see how silviana strode to the writing table and stood reading from a sheet of paper there occasionally glancing up her expression was a perfect mask of aes sedai serenity unreadable egwene waited patiently hands folded at her waist even upside down she could recognize elaidas distinctive hand on that page if not read what it said the woman need not think she would grow nervous at waiting patience was one of the few weapons left to her at present it seems the amyrlin has been mulling over what to do about you for some time silviana said finally if she had expected egwene to begin shifting her feet or wringing her hands she gave no sign of disappointment she has a very complete plan ready she doesnt want the tower to lose you nor do i elaida has decided that you have been used as a dupe by others and should not be held accountable so you will not be charged with claiming to be amyrlin she has stricken your name from the roll of the accepted and entered it in the novice book again i agree with that decision frankly though its never been done before whatever your ability with the power you missed almost everything else you should have learned as a novice you neednt fear that youll have to take the test again though i wouldnt force anyone to go through that twice i am aes sedai by virtue of having been raised to the amyrlin seat egwene replied calmly there was no incongruity in fighting for a title when claiming it might still lead to her death acquiescence would be as sharp a blow to the rebellion as her execution maybe sharper a novice again that was laughable i can cite the relevant passages in the law if you wish silviana arched an eyebrow and sat down to open a large leather bound book the punishments book dipping her pen in the simple glass ink jar she made a notation youve just earned your first visit to me ill give you the night to think about it rather than putting you over my knee now lets hope contemplation increases the salubrious effect do you think you can make me deny who i am with a spanking egwene was hard put to keep incredulity from her voice she was not sure she succeeded there are spankings and spankings the other woman replied wiping the nib clean on a scrap she replaced the pen in its glass holder and considered egwene youre accustomed to sheriam bayanar as mistress of novices silviana shook her head disparagingly ive browsed her punishments book she let the girls get away with too much and was far too lenient with her favorites as a result she was forced to deal out correction much more often that she should have had to i record a third of the punishments in a month that sheriam did because i make sure that everyone i punish leaves here wishing above all things never to be sent to me again whatever you do youll never make me deny who i am egwene said firmly how can you possibly think you can make this work am i to be escorted to classes shielded all the while silviana leaned back against her shawl resting her hands on the edge of the table you mean to resist as long as you can do you i will do what i must and i will do what i must during the day you will not be shielded at all but every hour you will be given a mild tincture of forkroot silvianas mouth twisted on the word she picked up the sheet that contained elaidas notes as if to read then let it drop back onto the tabletop rubbing her fingertips as though something noxious clung to them i cannot like the stuff it seems aimed directly at aes sedai someone who cannot channel can drink five times the amount that makes a sister pass out and barely grow dizzy from it a disgusting brew yet useful it seems perhaps it can be used on those ashaman the tincture wont make you dizzy but you wont be able to channel enough to cause any problems only trickles refuse to drink and it will be poured down your throat anyway youll be closely watched as well so you dont try to slip away afoot at night you will be shielded since giving you enough forkroot to make you sleep through the night would leave you doubled up with stomach cramps the next day you are a novice egwene and you will be a novice many sisters still consider you a runaway no matter what orders siuan sanche gave and others doubtless will think elaida wrong not to have you beheaded theyll watch for every infraction every fault you may sneer at a spanking now before youve received it but when youre being sent to me for five six seven every day well see how long it takes you to change your mind egwene surprised herself by giving a small laugh and silvianas eyebrows shot up her hand twitched as though to reach for her pen did i say something funny child not at all egwene replied truthfully it had occurred to her that she could deal with the pain by embracing it in the aiel manner she hoped it worked but there went all hope for dignity while she was being punished at least for the rest she could only do what she could silviana glanced at her pen but finally stood without touching it then i am done with you for tonight i will see you before breakfast however come with me she started for the door confident that egwene would follow and egwene did attacking the other woman physically would achieve no more than another entry in the book forkroot well she would find a way around that somehow if not she refused to think about that katerine and barasine were startled to say the least at hearing elaidas plans for egwene and not best pleased to learn that they would be watching her and shielding her while she slept although silviana told them she would arrange for other sisters to come after an hour or two why both of us katerine wanted to know which earned her a wry glance from barasine if only one were sent it surely would not be katerine who stood higher firstly because i said so silviana waited until the other two reds nodded in acceptance they did so with obvious reluctance but not enough to make her wait long she had not put on her shawl to come into the hallway and in some odd fashion she seemed the one out of place and secondly because this child is tricky i think i want her watched carefully awake or asleep which of you has her ring after a moment barasine produced the circle of gold from her belt pouch muttering i only thought to keep it as a memento of the rebels being brought to heel theyre finished now for sure a memento it was stealing was what it was egwene reached for the ring but silvianas hand got there first and it was into her pouch that the ring went ill keep this until you have the right to wear it again child now take her to the novice quarters and settle her in a room should have been prepared by now katerine resumed the shield and barasine reached for egwenes arm again but egwene stretched out a hand toward silviana wait theres something i must tell you she had agonized over this it would be all too easy to reveal far more than she wanted but she had to do it i have the talent of dreaming ive learned to tell the true dreams and to interpret some of them i dreamt of a glass lamp that burned with a white flame two ravens flew out of mist struck the lamp and flew on the lamp wobbled flinging off droplets of flaming oil some of those burned up in midair other landed scattered about and the lamp still wobbled on the edge of falling it means the seanchan will attack the white tower and do great harm barasine sniffed katerine gave a derisive snort a dreamer silviana said flatly is there anyone who can back up your claim and if there is how can be sure your dream means the seanchan ravens would indicate the shadow to me im a dreamer and when a dreamer knows she knows not the shadow the seanchan as for who knows what i can do egwene shrugged the only one you can reach is leane sharif whos being held in the cells below she saw no way to bring the wise ones into this not without revealing entirely too much that woman is a wilder not b katerine began angrily but her mouth snapped shut when silviana raised a peremptory hand the mistress of novices studied egwene carefully her face still an unreadable mask of calmness you truly believe you are what you say she said finally i do hope your dreaming wont cause as many problems as young nicolas foretelling if you truly can dream well i will pass along your warning i cant see how the seanchan could strike at us here in tar valon but watchfulness never hurts and ill question this woman being held below carefully and if she fails to back up your tale then your visit to me in the morning will be even more memorable for you she waved her hand at katerine take her away before she hands me another nugget and keeps me from getting any sleep at all tonight this time katerine muttered as much as barasine but they both waited until they were beyond earshot of silviana that woman was going to be a formidable opponent egwene hoped embracing pain worked as well as the wise ones claimed otherwise otherwise did not bear thinking about a lean grayhaired serving woman gave them directions to the room she had just finished making up on the third gallery of the novice quarters and hurried on after brief curtsies to the two reds she never so much as glanced at egwene what was another novice to her it tightened egwenes jaw she was going to have to make people not see her as just another novice look at her face barasine said i think its finally settling in on her i am who i am egwene replied calmly barasine pushed her toward the stairs that rose through the hollow column of railed galleries lit by the fat waning moon a breeze sighed through the only sound it all seemed so peaceful there was no light showing around any door the novices would be asleep by now except for those who had late chores or tasks it was peaceful for them not for egwene though the tiny windowless room might almost have been the one she had occupied when she first came to the tower with its narrow bed built against the wall and a small fire burning on the little brick hearth the lamp on the small table was lit but it lighted little more than the tabletop and the oil must have gone bad because it gave off a faint unpleasant stink a washstand completed the furnishings except for a threelegged stool onto which katerine promptly lowered herself adjusting her skirts as through on a throne realizing there was nowhere for her to sit barasine crossed her arms beneath her breasts and frowned at egwene the room was quite crowded with three women in it but egwene pretended the other two did not exist as she readied herself for bed hanging her cloak and belt and dress on three of the pegs set along one roughplastered white wall she did not ask for help with her buttons by the time she laid her neatly rolled stockings atop her shoes barasine had settled herself crosslegged on the floor and was immersed in a small leatherbound book that she must have carried in her belt pouch katerine kept her eyes on egwene as though she expected her to make a break for the door crawling beneath the light woolen blanket in her shift egwene settled her head on the small pillownot a goosedown pillow that was for sureand went through the exercises relaxing her body one part at a time that would put her to sleep she had done that so often that it seemed no sooner had she begun than she was asleep and floating formless in a darkness that lay between the waking world and telaranrhiod the narrow gap between dream and reality a vast void filled with a myriad of twinkling specks of light that were all the dreams of all the sleepers in the world they floated around her in this place with no up or down as far as the eye could see flickering out as a dream ended springing alight as one began she could recognize some at sight put a name to the dreamer but she did not see the one she sought it was to siuan she needed to speak siuan who likely knew by now that disaster had struck who might be unable to sleep until exhaustion took her under she settled herself to wait there was no sense of time here she would not grow bored with waiting but she had to work out what to say so much had changed since she wakened she had learned so much then she had been sure she would die soon sure the sisters inside the tower were a solid army behind elaida now elaida thought her safely imprisoned no matter this talk of making her a novice again even if elaida really believed it egwene alvere did not she did not consider herself a prisoner either she was carrying the battle into the heart of the tower itself if she had had lips there she would have smiled chapter one when last sounds the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose above the broken mountain named dragonmount the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was a beginning born beneath the glow of a fat sinking moon at an altitude where men could not breathe born among writhing currents heated by the fires inside the ragged peak the wind was a zephyr in the beginning yet it gained in strength as it rushed down the steep rugged slope carrying ash and the stench of burning sulfur from the heights the wind roared across the sudden snowy hills that reared from the plain surrounding the impossible height of dragonmount roared and tossed trees in the night eastward out of the hills the wind howled across a large pasture encampment a considerable village of tents and wooden walkways lining streets of frozen ruts soon enough the ruts would melt and the last of the snow vanish replaced by spring rains and mud if the encampment remained that long despite the hour many among the aessedai were awake gathered in small groups warded against eavesdropping discussing what had transpired this night no few of those discussions were quite animated little short of argument and some held undeniable heat fists might have been shaken or worse had they not belonged to aes sedai what to do next was the question every sister knew the news from the riverbank by now if the details remained sketchy the amyrlin herself had gone in secret to seal northharbor and her boat had been found overturned and caught in the reeds survival in the swift icy currents of the erinin was unlikely and hour by hour it had become more so until certainty hardened the amyrlin seat was dead every sister in the camp knew that her future and perhaps her life hung by a thread not to mention the future of the white tower itself what to do now yet voices fell silent and heads came up as the fierce blast struck the camp fluttering tent canvas like flags pelting it with clods of snow the sudden stink of burning sulphur hung heavy in the air announcing where that wind had come from and more than one aes sedai offered a silent prayer against evil in moments though the wind had passed and the sisters bent back to their deliberations on a future bleak enough to fit the sharp fading stench left behind on the wind roared toward tar valon gaining strength as it went shrieking over military camps near the river where soldiers and camp followers sleeping on the ground suddenly had their blankets stripped off and those in tents awoke to canvas jerking and sometimes whipping away into the darkness as tent pegs gave way or guy ropes snapped laden wagons rocked and toppled and banners stood out stiff before they were uprooted their hurtling staffs now spears that pierced whatever lay in their path leaning against the gale men struggled to the horselines to calm animals that reared and screamed in fear none knew what the aes sedai knew yet the biting sulphurous smell that filled the chill night air seemed an ill omen and hardened men offered their prayers aloud as fervently as the beardless boys camp followers added their own and loudly armorers and farriers and fletchers wives and laundresses and seamstresses all clutched by the sudden fear that something darker than blackness stalked the night the fierce flutter of canvas overhead near to ripping the babble of voices and the screams of horses loud enough to cut through the wailing wind helped siuan sanche struggle awake for the second time the abrupt stink of burning sulphur made her eyes water and she was grateful for it egwene might be able to don and doff sleep like a pair of stockings but the same was not true for her sleep had been hard enough to come by after she finally made herself lie down once the news had reached her from the riverbank she had been sure she never would sleep short of utter exhaustion she had offered prayers for leane but all of their hopes rested on egwenes shoulders and all of their hopes seemed gutted and hung up to dry well she had exhausted herself with nerves and worry and pacing now there was hope again and she did not dare let her leaden eyelids close for fear she would sink back into slumber and not wake till midday if then the ferocious wind abated but peoples shouts and horses cries did not wearily she tossed aside her blankets and stood up unsteadily her bedding was hardly comfortable laid out on the canvas groundcloth in a corner of the notverylarge square tent yet she had come here though it meant riding of course she had been near falling down by then and likely not in her right mind from grief she touched the twisted ring terangreal hanging from a leather cord around her neck her first waking every bit as hard as this one had been to fetch that from her belt pouch well the grief was vanquished now and that was adequate to keep her moving a sudden yawn made her jaws creak like rusty oarlocks barely adequate you would have thought egwenes message the fact that egwene was alive to send a message would be enough to banish boneweariness not so it appeared channeling a globe of light long enough to see the boxlantern on the main tent pole she lit it with a thread of fire the single flame gave a very pale flickering illumination there were other lamps and lanterns but gareth went on so about how little lamp oil there was in stock the brazier she left unlit gareth was not so parsimonious with charcoal as oilcharcoal was easier to come bybut she was barely aware of the frigid air she frowned at his bedding still lying untouched on the other side of the tent he surely was aware of the boats discovery and who it had carried the sisters did their best to keep secrets from him but somehow they succeeded less often than most believed more than once he had startled her with what he knew was he out there in the night organizing his soldiers for whatever the hall decided or had he already departed leaving a lost cause no longer lost yet he must be unaware of that no she muttered feeling an odd sense of treachery that she had cast doubt on the man even in her own mind he would still be there at sunrise and for every sunrise until the hall commanded him to leave maybe longer she did not believe he would abandon egwene whatever the hall commanded he was too stubborn proud no it was not that gareth brynes word was his honor once given he would not take it back unless released whatever the cost to himself and maybe just maybe he had other reasons to stay she refused to think of that putting gareth out of her mindwhy had she come to his tent it would have been so much easier to lie down in her own in the sisters camp cramped as it was or even to have kept the weeping chesa company though on second thought that last might have been beyond her she could not abide weeping and egwenes maid would not stop putting gareth firmly out of her head she ran a hasty brush through her hair changed her shift for a fresh one and dressed as quickly as she could in the dim light her plain blue wool riding dress was rumpled and spotted with mud on the hem besidesshe had gone down to see the boat for herselfbut she did not take the time to clean and press it with the power she had to hurry the tent was far from the spacious affair you would have expected of a general so hurrying meant bumping her hip against a corner of the writing table hard enough that one of the legs almost folded before she could catch it nearly tripping over the camp stool the only thing approaching a chair and barking her shins on the brassbound chests that lay scattered about that brought a curse that would have singed any listeners ears the things served double duty seats as well as storage and one with a flat top did for a makeshift washstand with a white pitcher and bowl in truth they were arrayed in a neat enough fashion but one peculiar to him he could find his way through that maze in pitch dark anyone else would break a leg trying to reach his bedding she supposed he must have a concern for assassins though he had never voiced it gathering her dark cloak from atop one of the chests and folding it over her arm she paused on the point of snuffing the lantern with a flow of air for a moment she stared at gareths second pair of boots standing at the foot of his bedding channeling another small sphere of light she moved it close to the boots as she had thought freshly blacked the bloody man insisted she work off her debt then sneaked in behind her backor worse under her nose while she sleptand blacked his own bloody boots gareth bloody bryne treated her like a maidservant never so much as tried to kiss her she jerked upright her mouth going taut as a mooring rope now where had that thought come from no matter what egwene claimed she was not in love with gareth bloody bryne she was not she had too much work in front of her to get caught in that kind of foolishness thats why you stopped wearing embroidery i suppose a small voice whispered in the back of her head all those pretty things stuffed into chests because youre afraid afraid burn her if she was afraid of him or any man carefully channeling earth fire and air just so she laid the weave on the boots every last bit of the blacking and most of the dye as well came away and formed into a neat glistening sphere that floated in the air leaving the leather decidedly gray for a moment she contemplated depositing the ball among his blankets that would be a suitable surprise for him when he finally lay down with a sigh she pushed open the doorflap and took the ball outside into the darkness to let it splash onto the ground the man had a short and extremely disrespectful way when she let her temper carry her too far as she had discovered the first time she hit him over the head with the boots she was cleaning and when he made her so angry she put salt in his tea quite a lot of salt but it had not been her fault he was hurried enough to drain the cup in a gulp to try to at any rate oh he never seemed to mind when she shouted and sometimes he shouted backsometimes he just smiled which was purely infuriatingyet he had his limits she could have stopped him with a simple weave of air of course but she had her honor as much as he had his burn him anyway she had to stay close to him min said so and the girl seemed infallible that was the only reason she had not stuffed a fistful of gold down gareth brynes throat and told him he was paid and be burned the only reason besides her own honor of course yawning she left the dark puddle shining in the cold moonlight if he stepped in it before it dried and tracked the mess inside the blame would be his own and none of hers at least the sulphur smell had faded a little her eyes had stopped overflowing though what she could see was turmoil this sprawling nightshrouded camp had never had much order the rutted streets were straight enough true and wide for moving soldiers but for the rest it had always seemed a haphazard array of tents and rough shelters and stonelined pits for cook fires now it looked much as if it had been under attack collapsed tents lay everywhere some tossed atop others that still stood though a good many of those stood askew and dozens of wagons and carts lay on their sides or upside down voices on every side called for help with the injured of whom there appeared to be a fair number men limped along the street in front of gareths tent supported by other men while several small groups hurried by carrying blankets being used as stretchers farther away she could see four blanketcovered shapes on the ground three attended by kneeling women who rocked back and forth as they keened she could do nothing for the dead but she could offer her ability with healing to the others that was hardly her greatest skill not very strong at all though it seemed to have returned to her fully when nynaeve healed her yet she doubted there was another sister anywhere in the camp they did avoid the soldiers most of them her ability would be better than none she could except for the news she carried it was urgent that it reach the right people as soon as possible so she closed her ears to the groans and the keens alike ignored dangling arms and rags clutched to bleeding heads and hurried to the horselines on the edge of the camp where the oddly sweet smell of horse dung was beginning to win over the sulphur a rawboned unshaven fellow with a haggard glare on his dark face tried to rush past her but she caught his rough coatsleeve saddle me the mildest horse you can find she told him and do it right now bela would have done nicely but she had no notion where among all those animals the stout mare was tied and no intention of waiting for her to be found you want to go riding he said incredulously jerking his sleeve free if you own a horse then saddle it yourself if youre fool enough to me ive the rest of the night ahead of me in the cold tending the ones whats hurt themselves and lucky if at least one dont die siuan ground her teeth the imbecile took her for one of the seamstresses or one of the wives for some reason that seemed worse she stuck her right fist in front of his face so quickly that he stepped back with a curse but she shoved her hand close enough to his nose that her great serpent ring had to be only thing he could see his eyes crossed staring at it the mildest mount you can find she said in a flat voice but quickly the ring did the trick he swallowed then scratched his head and stared along the horselines where every animal seemed be either stamping or shivering mild he muttered ill see what i can do aes sedai mild touching a knuckle to his forehead he hurried off down the rows of horses still muttering to himself siuan did a little muttering herself as she paced three strides this way and three that snow trampled to slush and frozen again crunched under her stout shoes from what she could see it might take him hours to find anything that would not pitch her off if it heard a grunter jump swinging her cloak around her shoulders she shoved the small silver circle pin in place with an impatient jab nearly stabbing her own thumb afraid was she she would show gareth bloody bloody bryne back and forth back and forth perhaps she should walk the whole long way it would be unpleasant but better than being dumped from the saddle and maybe breaking bones in the bargain she never mounted a horse including bela without thinking of broken bones but the fellow returned with a dark mare bearing a highcantled saddle shes mild siuan demanded skeptically the animal was stepping as though ready to dance and looked sleek that was supposed to indicate speed nightlily heres meek as milkwater aes sedai belongs to my wife and nemaris is on the delicate side she dont like a mount what gets frisky if you say so she replied and sniffed horses were seldom meek in her experience but there was nothing for it taking the reins she clambered awkwardly into the saddle then had to shift so she was not sitting on her cloak and halfstrangling herself every time she moved the mare did dance however she sawed the reins she had been sure it would trying to break her bones already a boat nowwith one oar or two a boat went where you wanted and stopped when you wanted unless you were a complete fool about tides and currents and winds but horses possessed brains however small and that meant they might take it into their minds to ignore bridle and reins and what the rider wanted that had to be considered when you had to straddle a bloody horse one thing aes sedai the man said as she was trying to find a comfortable seat why did saddles always seem harder than wood id keep her to a walk tonight was i you that wind you know and all that stink well she might be just a touch no time siuan said and dug her heels in meekasmilkwater nightlily leaped ahead so fast that she nearly pitched backward over the cantle only a quick grab at the pommel kept her in the saddle she thought the fellow shouted something after her but she could not be certain what in the light did this nemaris consider a frisky horse the mare sped out of the camp as though trying to win a race sped toward the falling moon and dragonmount a dark spike rising against the starry sky cloak billowing behind siuan made no effort to slow her rather digging in her heels again and slapping the mares neck with the reins as she had seen others do to urge speed she had to reach the sisters before anybody did something irretrievable all too many possibilities came to mind the mare galloped past small thickets and tiny hamlets and sprawling farms with their stonewalled pastures and fields snug beneath snowcovered slate roofs behind walls of stone or brick the inhabitants had not been roused by that fierce wind every building lay dark and still even the bloody cows and sheep were probably enjoying a good nights sleep farmers always had cows and sheep and pigs bouncing around on the hard leather of the saddle she tried leaning forward over the mares neck that was how it was done she had seen it almost immediately she lost the left stirrup and nearly slid off on that side barely clawing her way back to get her foot back in place the only thing to do was sit bolt upright one hand clutching the pommel in a deathgrip the other tighter still on the reins her flailing cloak tugged uncomfortably against her throat and she jounced up and down so hard that her teeth clicked if she opened her mouth at the wrong time but she hung on and even heeled the animal once more ah light but she was going to be bruised within an inch of her life come sunrise on through the night smacking the saddle with the mares every bounding stride at least her clenched teeth kept her from yawning at last the horselines and rows of wagons that ringed the aes sedai camp appeared out of the darkness though a thin rim of trees and with a sigh of relief she hauled back on the reins as hard as she could for a horse moving this fast surely it required hard hauling to stop nightlily did stop so abruptly that she would have hurdled over its head if the mare had not reared at the same time wideeyed she clung to the animals neck until it finally settled all four hooves to the ground again and for some little time after as well nightlily was breathing hard too she realized panting really she felt no sympathy the fool animal had tried to kill her just the way horses would recovering herself took a moment but then she pulled her cloak straight gathered the reins and rode past the wagons and the long lines of horses at a sedate walk shadowy men moved in the darkness along the horselines doubtless grooms and farriers seeing to the visibly unsettled animals the mare seemed more biddable now really this was not too bad at all as she entered the camp proper she hesitated only a moment before embracing saidar strange to think of a camp full of aes sedai as dangerous yet two sisters had been murdered here considering the circumstances of their deaths it seemed unlikely that holding the power would be enough to save her if she was the next target but saidar at least gave an illusion of safety so long as she remembered it was only illusion after a moment she wove the flows of spirit that would hide her ability and the glow of the power there was no need to advertise after all even at this hour with the moon low in the west there were a few people out on the wooden walkways serving women and workmen scurrying about late tasks or perhaps early would be a better word now most of the tents in nearly every size and shape imaginable were dark but a number of the larger ones glowed with the light of lamps or candles unsurprising under the circumstances every lit tent had men around it or gathered in front warders no one else could stand so still they seemed to fade into the night especially not in this icy night with the power filling her she could make out others their warders cloaks making them vanish in the shadows between the murdered sisters and what their bonds to their aes sedai must be carrying to them not surprising at all she suspected more than one sister was ready to tear her own hair or someone elses they took note of her heads swiveling to follow her passage as she rode slowly along the frozen ruts searching the hall had to be informed of course but others needed to hear first in her estimation they were much more likely to do something precipitate and quite possibly disastrous oaths held them but oaths given under duress to a woman they now believed dead for the hall for most of the hall they had nailed their flag to the mast in accepting a seat none oithem would be jumping until they were very very sure where they would land sheriams tent was too small for what she was sure she would find and dark besides she noted in passing she very much doubted the woman was asleep inside though morvrins big enough to sleep four comfortably would have done if there was room among all the books the brown had managed to acquire on the march but that was dark as well her third choice provided a catch though and she reined in nightlily well short of it myrelle had two peaked tents in the camp one for herself and one for her three wardersthe three she dared acknowledgeand her own shone brightly the shadows of women moving on the patched canvas walls three dissimilar men stood on the walkway in front of the tenttheir stillness marked them wardersbut she ignored them for the moment what exactly were they talking about inside certain that it was useless effort she wove air with just a hint of fire her weave touched the tent and struck a barrier against eavesdropping inverted of course and so invisible to her she had only made the attempt on the chance they were being careless small possibility of that with the secrets they had to hide the shadows against the canvas were still now so they knew someone had tried she rode the rest of the way wondering what they had been talking about as she dismountedwell at least she managed to turn halffalling off into something akin to jumping downone of the warders sheriams arinvar a lean cairhienin little taller than she stepped forward to reach for the reins with a small bow but she waved him away releasing saidar she tied the mare to one of the wooden slats of the walkway using a knot that would have held a sizable boat against heavy wind and a strong current none of those casual loops that others used not for her she might dislike riding but when she tied a horse she wanted it there when she came back arinvars eyebrows climbed as he watched her finish the knot but he would not be the one who had to pay for the bloody animal if it got loose and lost itself only one of the other two warders belonged to myrelle avar hachami a saldaean with a nose like an eagles beak and thick graystreaked mustaches after sparing her one glance and a slight inclination of his head he returned to watching the night morvrins jori short and bald and nearly as wide as he was tall did not acknowledge her at all his eyes studied the darkness and his hand rested lightly on his long sword hilt supposedly he was among the best of the warders with a blade where were the others she could not ask of course any more than she could ask who was within the men would have been shocked to their bones none of them tried to stop her from entering at least matters had not gotten that bad inside where two braziers gave off the scent of roses and made the air almost toasty compared to the night she found almost everyone she had hoped for and all watching to see who entered myrelle herself sitting on a sturdy straightchair in a silk robe covered with red and yellow flowers her arms folded beneath her breasts wore such a perfect expression of calm on her olive face that it only pointed up the heat in her dark eyes the light of the power shone around her it was her tent after all she would be the one to weave a ward here sheriam seated on one end of myrelles cot with a straight back pretended to be adjusting her blueslashed skirts her expression was as fiery as her hair and it grew hotter when she saw siuan she was not wearing the keepers stole a bad sign i might have expected it would be you carlinya said coldly fists on her hips she was never a warm woman but now the ringlets that stopped well short of her shoulders framed a face that seemed carved from ice nearly as pale as her dress i will not have you trying to listen in on my private conversations siuan oh yes they thought everything was at an end roundfaced morvrin for once not appearing at all absentminded or sleepyeyed despite the creases in her brown wool skirt walked around the small table where a tall silver pitcher and five silver cups sat on a lacquered tray it seemed no one felt like tea the cups were all dry dipping into her belt pouch the graying sister thrust a carved horn comb into siuans hand you are all windblown woman fix your hair before some lout takes you for a tavern trull instead of an aes sedai and tries to dandle you on his knee egwene and leane are alive and prisoners inside the tower siuan announced more calmly than she felt a tavern trull touching her hair she discovered that the other woman was right and began working the comb through the tangles if you wanted to be taken seriously you could not look as though you had been tussling in an alley she had enough difficulty with that as it was now and would have until some years after she could lay hands on the oath rod again egwene spoke to me in my dreams they succeeded in blocking the harbors near enough but they were captured where are beonin and nisao one of you go fetch them i dont want to scale the same fish twice there if they thought themselves free of their oaths and free of egwenes orders to obey her that should disabuse them except that no one moved to obey beonin wanted her bed morvrin said slowly studying siuan a very intense study a sharp mind hid behind that placid face she was too tired to talk any more and why would we have asked nisao to join us that earned a small frown from myrelle who was nisaos friend but the other two nodded agreement they and beonin thought of nisao as apart from themselves in spite of the oaths of fealty they shared in siuans opinion these women had never stopped believing they might still guide events somehow even after the rudder had long since been taken from their hands sheriam rose from the cot as though about to rush off even gathering her skirts but that had nothing to do with siuans command anger had vanished replaced by shining eagerness we dont need them for the moment in any case prisoners means the deep cells until the hall convenes for a trial we can travel there and free them before elaida knows what is happening myrelle gave a sharp nod and stood reaching to undo the sash of her robe best if we leave the warders behind i think they wont be needed in this she drew more deeply on the source already anticipating no siuan said sharply and winced as the comb caught in her hair sometimes she thought of cutting it shorter than carlinyas for convenience but gareth had complimented her saying how much he liked the way it brushed her shoulders light could she not escape the man even here egwene isnt to be tried and she isnt in the deep cells she wouldnt tell me where she is being held except to say that she is guarded constantly and she orders that there be no attempt to rescue her that involves sisters the other women stared at her in shocked silence in truth she herself had argued the point with egwene to no avail it had been an order delivered by the amyrlin seat in full fig what youre saying is irrational carlinya said finally her tone was still cool her face serene but her hands smoothed her embroidered white skirts unnecessarily if we capture elaida we will try her and very likely still her if their doubts and fears were not put to rest yet since she has egwene surely she will do the same i dont need beonin to tell me what the law says in that regard we must rescue her whatever she wants sheriams voice was hot as carlinyas was chill and her green eyes sparkled her hands had turned to fists gripping her skirts she cannot realize the danger she is in she must be in shock did she give you any hints where shes held dont try to hide things from us siuan myrelle said firmly her eyes seemed almost on fire and she jerked the silk sash tighter for emphasis why would she hide where shes being held for fear of what you and sheriam suggest giving up on the windwhipped tangles siuan tossed the comb down on the table she could not stand there combing her hair and expect them to pay attention tousled would have to do she is guarded myrelle by sisters and they wont give her up easily if we try a rescue aes sedai will die at the hands of aes sedai sure as silverpike spawn in the reeds its happened once but it must not happen again or all hope dies of reuniting the tower peacefully we cannot allow it to happen again so there is to be no rescue as to why elaida has decided not to try her i cant say egwene had been vague on that as if she did not understand either but she had been definite on the facts and it was not a claim she would make unless she was sure peacefully sheriam muttered sinking back onto the cot she imbued the word with a world of bitterness was there ever any chance of that from the beginning elaida has abolished the blue ajah what chance of peace is there elaida cannot simply do away with an ajah morvrin murmured as though that had anything to do with anything she patted sheriams shoulder but the firehaired woman sullenly shrugged off her plump hand there is always a chance carlinya said the harbors are blocked strengthening our position the negotiators meet every morning trailing off with a troubled look in her eyes she poured a cup of tea and drank half of it down in one go without adding honey blocking the harbors likely would have put an end to the negotiations by itself not that they had seemed to be going anywhere would elaida let them continue with egwene in her hands besides i do not comprehend why elaida would not have egwene put on trial morvrin said since conviction would be sure and certain but the fact remains that she is a prisoner she displayed none of sheriam or myrelles heat and none of carlinyas coldness she was simply presenting the facts with only a slight tightness of her mouth if she is not to be tried then without any doubt she is to be broken she has proven to be a stronger woman than i took her for at first but no one is strong enough to resist the white tower when it decides to break her we must consider the consequences if we dont get her out before it can siuan shook her head she isnt even going to be birched morvrin i dont understand why either but shed hardly tell us to leave her if she thought they were going to torture she broke off as the tentflap was pushed open and lelaine akashi stepped in bluefringed shawl draped along her arms sheriam stood though she need not have lelaine was a sitter but sheriam was the keeper then again lelaine was imposing in blueslashed velvet despite her slenderness dignity made flesh with an air of authority that seemed greater than ever tonight every hair in place she might have been entering the hall after a sound nights sleep smoothly siuan turned to the table and picked up the pitcher as if in anticipation that normally would have been her role in this company to pour tea and speak when her opinion was sought perhaps if she remained quiet lelaine would be about her business with the others and leave quickly without giving her a second glance the woman seldom did give her that much i thought that horse outside was the same i saw you ride in on siuan lelaines gaze ran over the other sisters each of them absolutely smoothfaced now am i interrupting siuan says egwene is alive sheriam said as though relating the price of delta perch on the dockhead and leane egwene spoke to siuans dreams she refuses any attempt at a rescue myrelle gave her a sidelong glance unreadable but siuan could have boxed her ears likely lelaine would have been the next she sought out but to tell her in her own way not spilled out on the wharf like this of late sheriam had become as flighty as a novice pursing her lips lelaine directed a look like twin awls at siuan did she now you really should be wearing your stole sheriam you are the keeper will you walk with me siuan its been far too long since we had a conversation alone with one hand she drew back the doorflap shifting that penetrating gaze to the other sisters sheriam blushed as only a redhead could brilliantly and fumbled the narrow blue stole from her belt pouch to lay it across her shoulders but myrelle and carlinya met lelaines study with level eyes morvrin had begun tapping her round chin with a fingertip as though unaware of anyone else she might well have been morvrin was like that had egwenes orders sunk in siuan had no chance even for a firm look while putting the pitcher down a suggestion from a sister of lelaines standing sitter or not was a command to one of siuans standing gathering her cloak and skirts she went out murmuring thanks to lelaine for holding the flap for her light she hoped those fools had listened to what she said four warders stood outside now but one of them was lelaines burin a copperskinned stump of a domani wrapped in a warder cloak that made most of him seem not there and avar had been replaced by another of myrelles nuhel dromand a tall burly man with an illianer beard that left his upper lip bare the man was so still you might have thought him a statue if not for the wisps of mist in front of his nostrils arinvar bowed to lelaine a quick courtesy though formal nuhel and jori did not let their vigilance slacken nor did burin for that matter the knot that secured nightlily took as long to undo as it had to tie but lelaine waited patiently until siuan straightened with the reins in her hands then set off at a slow pace along the wooden walkway past dark tents moonshadows masked her face she did not embrace the power so siuan could not either trailed by burin siuan walked beside lelaine leading the mare holding her silence it was the sitters place to begin and not only because she was a sitter siuan fought the urge to bend her neck and so lose the extra inch she had on the other woman she seldom thought any longer of the time when she had been amyrlin she had been embraced as aes sedai once more and part of being aes sedai meant fitting into your niche among the sisters instinctively the bloody horse nuzzled at her hand as though it thought itself a pet and she shifted the reins to her other hand long enough to wipe her fingers on her cloak filthy slobbering beast lelaine eyed her sideways and she felt her cheeks heating instinct strange friends you have siuan i believe some of them were in favor of sending you away when you first appeared in salidar sheriam i might comprehend though id think the fact that she stands so much higher than you now would make for awkwardness that was the major reason i avoided you myself to avoid awkwardness siuan nearly gaped in astonishment that came very near to talking about what was never to be talked about very near a transgression she would never had expected from this woman from herself perhapsshe had fitted herself into her niche yet she was who she wasbut never from lelaine i hope you and i can become friends again siuan though i can understand if that proves impossible this meeting tonight confirms what faolain told me lelaine gave a small laugh and folded her hands at her waist oh dont grimace so siuan she didnt betray you at least not intentionally she made one slip too many and i decided to press her rather hard not the way to treat another sister but then shes really just an accepted until she can be tested and passes faolain will make a fine aes sedai she was very reluctant to surrender everything she gave just bits and pieces really and a few names but put together with you in that gathering it gives me a complete picture i think i suppose i can let her free of confinement now she certainly wont think of spying on me again you and your friends have been very faithful to egwene siuan can you be as faithful to me so that was why faolain had seemed to go into hiding how many bits and pieces had she revealed while being pressed hard faolain did not know everything yet it would be best to assume that lelaine did but assume while revealing nothing unless she herself was pressed hard siuan stopped dead drawing herself up lelaine halted too clearly waiting for her to speak even with her face half in shadow that was clear siuan had to steel herself to confront this woman some instincts were buried in the bone for aes sedai im faithful to you as a sitter for my ajah but egwene alvere is the amyrlin seat so she is lelaines expression remained unruffled as much as siuan could make out she spoke in your dreams tell me what you know of her situation siuan siuan glanced over her shoulder at the stocky warder dont mind him the sitter said i havent kept a secret from burin in twenty years in my dreams siuan agreed she certainly did not intend to admit that had been only to summon her to salidar in telaranrhiod she was not supposed to have that ring in her possession the hall would take it away if they learned of it calmlyoutwardly calm at least she related what she had told myrelle and the others and more but not everything not the certainty of betrayal that had to have come from the hall itselfno one else had known of the plan to block the harbor except the women involvedthough whoever was accountable could not have known they were betraying egwene only helping elaida which was mystery enough why would any among them want to help elaida there had been talk of elaidas secret adherents from the start yet she herself had long since dismissed the notion most assuredly every blue fervently wanted elaida pulled down but until she knew who was responsible no sitter not even a blue would learn everything shes called a sitting of the hall for tomorrow no it would be tonight now when last sounds she finished inside the tower in the hall of the tower lelaine laughed so hard that she had to brush a tear from her eye oh that is priceless the hall to sit right under elaidas nose as it were i almost wish i could let her know just to see her face just as abruptly she turned serious again lelaine had always had a ready laugh when she chose to let it out but the core of her was always serious so egwene thinks the ajahs may be turning on one another that hardly seems possible shes only seen a handful of sisters you say still it bears looking into the next time in telaranrhiod perhaps someone can see what they can find in the ajah quarters instead of concentrating on elaidas study siuan barely suppressed a wince she planned to do a little searching in telaranrhiod herself whenever she went to the tower in the world of dreams she was a different woman in a different dress every time she turned a corner but she would have to be even more cautious than usual refusing rescue is understandable i suppose even laudableno one wants any more dead sistersbut very risky lelaine went on no trial and not even a birching what can elaida be playing at can she think to make her take up as accepted again that hardly seems likely but she gave a small nod as though considering it this was heading in a dangerous direction if sisters convinced themselves they knew where egwene might be the chance increased that someone would try to bring her out aes sedai guards or no trying at the wrong place could be as risky as at the right one if not more so worse lelaine was ignoring something egwene has called the hall to sit siuan asked acidly will you go reproving silence answered her and her cheeks grew hot again some things were buried in the bone of course i will go lelaine said at last a direct statement yet there had been a pause the entire hall will go egwene aivere is the amyrlin seat and we have more than sufficient dream tefangreal perhaps she will explain how she believes she can hold out if elaida orders her broken i would very much like to hear that then what are you asking me to be faithful to you about instead of answering lelaine resumed her slow walk through the moonlight carefully adjusting her shawl burin followed her a halfinvisible lion in the night siuan hurried to catch up tugging nightlily after her fending off the fool mares attempts to nuzzle her hand again egwene alvere is the lawful amyrlin seat lelaine said finally until she dies or is stilled should either happen we would be back to romanda trying for the staff and the stole and me forestalling her she snorted that woman would be a disaster as bad as elaida unfortunately she had enough support to forestall me as well wed be back to that except that if egwene dies or is stilled you and your friends will be as faithful to me as youve been to egwene and you will help me gain the amyrlin seat in spite of romanda siuan felt as though her stomach had turned to ice no blue would have been behind the first betrayal but one blue at least had reason to betray egwene now chapter two the dark ones touch beonin woke at first light as was her habit though little of the dawn trickled into her tent past the closed doorflap habits were good when they were the right habits she had taught herself a number over the years the air inside the tent held a touch of the nights chill but she left the brazier unlit she did not intend to remain long channeling briefly she lit a brass lamp then heated the water in the whiteglazed pitcher and washed her face at the rickety washstand with its bubbled mirror nearly everything in the small round tent was unsteady from the tiny table to her narrow camp cot and the only sturdy piece a lowbacked chair was rude enough to have come from the poorest farm kitchen she was accustomed to making do though not all of the judgments she had been called on to make had been given in palaces the meanest hamlet also deserved justice she had slept in barns and even hovels to make it so moving deliberately she put on the best riding dress she had with her a plain gray silk that was very well cut and snug boots that came to her knees then began brushing her dark golden hair with an ivorybacked hairbrush that had belonged to her mother her reflection in the mirror was slightly distorted for some reason that irritated her this morning someone scratched at the tentflap and a man called cheerily in a murandian accent breakfast aes sedai if it pleases you she lowered the brush and opened herself to the source she had not acquired a personal serving woman and it often seemed a new face brought every meal yet she remembered the stout graying man with a permanent smile who entered at her command carrying a tray covered with a white cloth leave it on the table please ehvin she said releasing saidar and was rewarded with a widening of his smile a deep bow over the tray and another before he left too many sisters forgot the small courtesies to those beneath them small courtesies were the lubricant of daily life eyeing the tray without enthusiasm she resumed her brushing a twiceaday ritual that she always found soothing rather than finding comfort in the brush sliding through her hair this morning however she had to make herself complete the full one hundred strokes before laying the brush on the washstand beside the matching comb and hand mirror once she could have taught the hills patience yet that had become harder and harder since salidar and nearly impossible since murandy so she schooled herself to it as she had schooled herself to go to the white tower against her mothers stern wishes schooled herself to accept the towers discipline along with its teaching as a girl she had been headstrong always aspiring to more the tower had taught her that you could achieve much if you could control yourself she prided herself on that ability selfcontrol or no selfcontrol lingering over her breakfast of stewed prunes and bread proved as difficult as completing her ritual with the hairbrush the prunes had been dried and perhaps too old to begin with they had been stewed to mush and she was sure she had missed a few of the black flecks that decorated the crusty bread she tried to convince herself that anything that crunched between her teeth was a barley grain or a rye seed this was not the first time she had eaten bread containing weevils yet it was hardly a thing to enjoy the tea had a strange aftertaste too as though that also was beginning to spoil when she finally replaced the linen cloth over the carved wooden tray she very nearly sighed how long before nothing edible remained in the camp was the same happening inside tar valon it must be so the dark one was touching the world a thought as bleak as a field of jagged stones but victory would come she refused to entertain any other possibility young althor had a great deal to answer for a very great deal yet he wouldmustachieve that somehow somehow but the dragon reborn lay beyond her purview all she could do was watch events unfold from afar she had never liked sitting to one side and watching all this bitter musing was useless it was time to be moving she stood up so quickly that her chair toppled over backward but she left it lying there on the canvas groundcloth putting her head out at the doorflap she found tervail on a stool on the walkway his dark cloak thrown back leaning on the scabbarded sword propped between his boots the sun stood on the horizon twothirds of a bright golden ball yet dark clouds in the other direction massing around dragonmount suggested more snow before long or perhaps rain the sun felt close to warm after the previous night either way with luck she could be snug indoors soon tervail gave a small nod to acknowledge her without stopping what appeared to be an idle study of everyone who moved in his sight there were none but laborers at the moment men in rough woolens carrying baskets on their backs men and women just as roughly clad driving highwheeled carts laden with bound firewood and sacks of charcoal and water barrels that clattered along the rutted street at least his scrutiny would have seemed idle to someone lacking the warder bond with him her tervail he was focused as a drawn arrow it was only the men he studied and his gaze lingered on those he did not know personally with two sisters and a warder dead at the hands of a man who could channelit seemed beyond possibility there could be two murderers of that sorteveryone was leery of strange men everyone who knew at least the news had hardly been shouted abroad how he thought he might recognize the killer was beyond her unless the man carried a banner but she would not upbraid or belittle him for trying to perform his duty whipcord lean with a strong nose and a thick scar along his jaw earned in her sendee he had been little more than a boy when she found him catquick and already one of the finest swordsmen in her native tarabon and for all the years since there had never been a moment when he did less at least twenty times he had saved her life quite aside from brigands and footpads too ignorant to recognize an aes sedai the law could be dangerous when one side or the other became desperate not to have the judgment go against them and often he had spotted the peril before she herself saddle winterfinch for me and bring your own horse she told him we are going for the little ride tervail raised one eyebrow slightly halfglancing in her direction then attached the scabbard to the right side of his belt and set off down the wooden walkway toward the horselines walking very quickly he never asked unnecessary questions perhaps she was more agitated within than she believed ducking back inside she carefully wrapped the hand mirror in a silk scarf woven in a blackandwhite tairen maze and tucked it into one of the two large pockets sewn inside her good gray cloak along with the hairbrush and comb her neatly folded shawl and a small box of intricately carved blackwood went into the other the box contained a few pieces of jewelry some that had come down from her mother and the rest from her maternal grandmother she herself seldom wore jewelry aside from her great serpent ring yet she always took the box and the brush comb and mirror with her when she journeyed reminders of the women whose memories she loved and honored and of what they had taught her her grandmother a noted advocate in tanchico had infused her with a love for the intricacies of the law while her mother had demonstrated that it was always possible to better yourself advocates rarely became wealthy though collaris certainly had been more than comfortable yet despite her disapproval her daughter aeldrine had become a merchant and amassed a tidy fortune buying and selling dyes yes it was always possible to better yourself if you seized the moment when it appeared as she had when elaida aroihan deposed siuan sanche matters since had not gone anywhere near as she had foreseen of course matters seldom did that was why a wise woman always planned alternative paths she considered waiting inside for tervail to returnhe could not fetch two horses in mere minutesbut now that the time had actually arrived her last stores of patience seemed to flee settling the cloak around her shoulders she snuffed the lamp with an air of finality outside however she forced herself to stand in one place rather than pacing along the walkways rough planks pacing would attract eyes and perhaps some sister who thought she was fearful of being alone in all truth she was afraid a little when a man could kill you unseen undetected it was most reasonable to be afraid she did not want company though she pulled up her cowl signaling a desire for privacy and drew the cloak around her a gray cat notcheared and lean began stropping himself against her ankles there were cats all over the camp they appeared anywhere that aes sedai gathered tame as house pets however feral they had been before after a few moments without having his ears scratched the cat strolled away as proud as a king in search of someone who would see to them he had plenty of candidates just moments earlier there had been only roughly garbed laborers and cart drivers in view but now the camp began to bustle clusters of whiteclad novices the socalled families scurried along the walkways to reach their classes held in any tent large enough to accommodate them or even in the open those who hurried by her ceased their childish prattle to offer perfect curtsies in passing the sight never ceased to amaze her or to produce anger a fair number of those children were well into their middle years or olderno few had at least some gray in their hair and some were grandmothersyet they were bending to the ancient routines as well as any girl she had ever seen come to the tower and so many a seemingly endless flood pouring down the streets how much had the tower lost through its focus on bringing in girls born with the spark and those already on the brink of channeling through their own fumbling while leaving the rest to find their way to tar valon as they would or could how much lost through insisting no girl above eighteen could submit to the discipline change was nothing she had ever soughtlaw and custom ruled an aes sedais life a bedrock of stabilityand some changes such as these novice families seemed too radical to go on but how much had the tower lost sisters glided along the walkways too usually in pairs or even threes usually trailed by their warders the flow of novices parted around them in ripples of curtsies ripples made jagged by the stares directed at the sisters who pretended not to notice very few of the aes sedai lacked the glow of the power around them beonin came close to clicking her tongue in irritation the novices knew that anaiya and kairen were deadthere had been no thought of hiding the funeral pyresbut telling them how the two sisters had died would simply have frightened them the newest added to the novice book in murandy had worn white long enough to be aware that sisters walking about filled with saidar was beyond unusual though eventually that alone would frighten them and to no purpose the killer seemed unlikely to strike in public with dozens of sisters about five mounted sisters riding slowly eastward none carrying the light of saidar caught her eye each was followed by a small entourage generally a secretary a serving woman perhaps a serving man as well in case of heavy lifting and some warders all rode with their hoods up but she had no difficulty making out who was who varilin of her own gray would have been tall as a man while takima the brown was a tiny thing saroiyas cloak was flamboyant with white embroidery she must use saidar to keep it so sparkling brightand a pair of warders trailing faiselle marked her as clearly as her brilliant green cloak which made the last wrapped in dark gray magla the yellow what would they find when they reached darein surely not negotiators from the tower not now perhaps they thought they must go through the motions anyway people frequently continued to go on as they had been after all purpose in it had been lost that seldom lasted long with aes sedai however they hardly seem to be together at all do they beonin you might think they just happened to be riding in the same direction so much for the cowl providing a modicum of privacy luckily she was practiced at suppressing sighs or anything else that might give away more than she wished the two sisters who had stopped beside her were much of a height both smallboned darkhaired and browneyed but there resemblance ended ashmanailles narrow face with its pointed nose seldom displayed any emotion at all her silk dress slashed with silver might have come from a tirewomans hands only moments before and silver scrollwork decorated the edges of her furlined cloak and cowl phaedrines dark wool bore a number of creases not to mention several stains her woolen cloak was unadorned and needed darning and she frowned much too often as she was doing right then she might have been pretty without that an odd pair of friends the usually unkempt brown and the gray who paid as much attention to her clothes as to anything else beonin glanced at the departing sitters they did appear to be riding in the same direction by chance more than riding together it was a measure of her upset this morning that she had failed to note that perhaps she said turning to face her unwanted visitors they are contemplating the consequences of last night yes ashmanaille unwelcome or not courtesy must be observed at least the amyrlin is alive the other gray replied and by what ive been told she will remain alive and healthy her and leane both not even nynaeves healing of siuan and leane could make anyone speak of stilling with ease alive and a captive it is better than being beheaded i suppose but not a great deal better when morvrin woke her to tell her the news it had been hard to share the browns excitement excitement for morvrin at least the woman had worn a small grin beonin had never considered altering her plans though facts they must be faced egwene was a prisoner and that was that do you not agree phaedrine of course the brown replied curtly curtly but that was phaedrine always so immersed in whatever had caught her attention that she forgot how she should behave and she was not done but that is not why we sought you ashmanaille says you have considerable acquaintance with murders a sudden gust of wind snatched at their cloaks but beonin and ashmanaille caught theirs smoothly phaedrine let hers swirl behind her eyes intent on beonin perhaps you have had some thoughts on our murders beonin ashmanaille said smoothly will you share them with us phaedrine and i have been putting our heads together but we are getting nowhere my own experience is more with civil matters i know that you have gotten to the bottom of a number of unnatural deaths of course she had thought on the murders was there a sister in the camp who had not she herself could not have avoided it had she tried finding a murderer was a joy far more satisfying than settling a boundary dispute it was the most heinous of crimes the theft of what could never be recovered all the years that would never be lived all that might have been done in them and these were the deaths of aes sedai which surely made it personal for every sister in the camp she waited for a last covey of whiteclad women two with gray hair to make their curtsies and hurry on the number of novices on the walkways was finally beginning to thin out the cats seemed to be following them novices were more free with petting than most sisters the man who stabs from greed she said once the novices were beyond hearing the woman who poisons from jealousy they are one thing this is quite another altogether there are two killings surely by the same man but well over a week apart that implies both the patience and the planning the motive is unclear yet it seems very unlikely that he chose his victims by chance knowing no more of him than the fact that he can channel you must begin by looking at what ties the victims together in this case anaiya and kairen they were both blue ajah so i ask myself what connection has the blue ajah with a man who can channel the answer comes back moiraine damodred and rand althor and kairen she also had contact with him yes phaedrines frown deepened to near a scowl you cannot be suggesting be is the killer really she was getting much too far above herself no beonin said coolly i am saying you must follow the connection which leads to the ashaman men who can channel men who can channel who know how to travel men who have some reason to fear aes sedai perhaps particular aes sedai more than others a connection is not the proof she admitted reluctantly but it is suggestive yes why would an ashaman come here twice and each time kill one sister that sounds as though the killer wanted those two and no others ashmanaille shook her head how could he know when anaiya and kairen would be alone you cannot think he is lurking about disguised as a workman from all i hear these ashaman are far too arrogant for that to me it seems more likely we have an actual workman who can channel and bears a grudge of some sort beonin sniffed dismissively she could feel tervail approaching he must have run to be back so soon and why would he have waited until now the last workmen they were taken on in murandy more than a month ago ashmanaille opened her mouth but phaedrine darted in quick as a sparrow snatching a crumb he might have only just learned how a male wilder as it were ive overheard workmen talking as many admire the ashaman as fear them ive even heard some say they wish they had the nerve to go to the black tower themselves the other grays left eyebrow twitched as much as both shooting to her hairline in another woman the two were friends yet she could not be pleased with phaedrine plucking the words from her mouth in that way all she said though was an ashaman could find him im sure beonin let herself feel tervail waiting only a few paces behind her now the bond carried a steady flow of unwavering calm and patience as strong as the mountains how she wished she could draw on that as she could on his physical strength that is most unlikely to happen im sure you will agree she said thinly romanda and the others might have stood in favor of this nonsensical alliance with the black tower but from that moment on they had fought like drunken cart drivers over how to implement it how to word the agreement how to present it every single detail corn apart put back together and torn apart again the thing was doomed thank the light i must go she told them and turned to take winterfinchs reins from tervail his tall bay gelding was sleek and powerful and fast a trained warhorse her brown mare was stocky and not fast yet she had always preferred endurance to speed winterfinch could keep going long after taller supposedly more powerful animals gave up putting a foot in the stirrup she paused with her hands on tall pommel and cantie two sisters dead ashmanaille and both blues find sisters who knew them and learn what else they had in common to locate the murderer you must follow the connections i doubt very much they will lead to ashaman beonin the important thing is that the killer is found she replied pulling herself into the saddle and turned winterfinch away before the other woman could go on an abrupt ending and discourteous but she had no more wisdom to offer and time seemed to press down on her now the sun was clear of the horizon and climbing after so long time pressed very hard indeed the ride to the traveling ground used for departures was short but near a dozen aes sedai were waiting in a line outside the call canvas wall some leading horses some cloakless as if they expected to be indoors before long and one or two wearing their shawls for some reason about half were accompanied by warders several of whom wore their colorshifting cloaks the one thing the sisters shared was that each shone with the glow of the power tervail expressed no surprise at their destination of course but more than that the warder bond continued to carry steady calm he trusted her a silvery flash appeared inside che walls and after sufficient time to count slowly to thirty a pair of greens who could not make a gateway alone entered together with four warders leading horses the custom of privacy already had attached itself to traveling unless someone allowed you to see her weave a gateway trying to learn where she was going was accounted akin to asking direct questions about her business beonin waited patiently on winterfinch with tervail towering over her on hammer at least the sisters here respected her raised cowl or perhaps they had their own reasons for silence either way she did not have to talk with anyone at this moment that would have been insupportable the line in front of her dwindled quickly and soon enough she and tervail were dismounting at the head of a much shorter line only three sisters he held aside the heavy canvas flap for her to enter first hung between tall poles the wall enclosed a space of nearly twenty paces by twenty where frozen slush covered the ground an uneven surface marked by footprints and hooiprints atop one another and scored in the middle by a razorstraight line everyone used the middle the ground glistened faintly perhaps the beginning of another thaw that would turn it all to slush that might well freeze again spring came later here than in tarabon but it was on the brink as soon as tervail let the canvas fall she embraced saidarand wove spirit almost caressingly this weave fascinated her a rediscovery of something thought lost forever and surely the greatest of egwene alveres discoveries every time she wove it she felt a sense of wonder so familiar as novice and even accepted that had not come to her since she attained the shawl something new and marvelous the vertical silvery line appeared in front of her right atop the scoring on the ground and suddenly became a gap that widened the view through appearing to rotate until she was faced by a square hole in the air more than two paces by two that showed snowdraped oaks with heavy spreading limbs a light breeze blew through the gateway rippling her cloak she had often enjoyed walking in that grove or sitting on one of the low branches for hours reading though never in snow tervail did not recognize it and darted through sword in hand tugging hammer behind him the warhorses hooves kicking up puffs of snow on the other side she followed a little more slowly and let the weave dissipate almost reluctantly it truly was wondrous she found tervail looking at what rose above the treetops in the near distance a thick pale shaft rearing against the sky the white tower his face was very still and the bond seemed filled with stillness too i think me you are planning something dangerous beonin he still held his blade bared though lowered now she laid a hand on his left arm that should be enough to reassure him she would never have impeded his sword arm if there was any real danger no more dangerous than is ne the words trailed off as she saw a woman some thirty paces away walking slowly toward her through the grove of massive trees she must have been behind a tree before an aes sedai in a dress of oldfashioned cut with straight white hair held back by a pearlstudded cap of silver wire and falling to her waist it could not be that strong face with its dark tilted eyes and hooked nose was unmistakable though unmistakable but turanine merdagon had died when beonin was accepted in midstep the woman vanished what is it tervail spun his sword coming up to stare in the direction she had been looking what frightened you the dark one he is touching the world she said softly it was impossible impossible but she was not given to delusions or fancies she had seen what she had seen her shiver had nothing to with standing ankledeep in snow silently she prayed may the light illumine me all of my days and may i shelter in the creators hand in the sure and certain hope of salvation and rebirth when she told him about seeing a sister more than forty years dead he did not try to dismiss it as hallucination merely muttered his own prayer half under his breath she felt no fear in him though plenty in herself but none in him the dead could not frighten a man who took each day as his last he was not so sanguine when she revealed what she intended part of it anyway she did so looking into the hand mirror and weaving very carefully she was not as adept with illusion as she would have liked the face in the mirror changed as the weave settled on her it was not a great change but the face was no longer an aes sedais face no longer beonin marinyes face just that of a woman who looked vaguely like her though with much paler hair why do you want to reach elaida he demanded suspiciously abruptly the bond carried an edge you mean to get close to her then lower the illusion yes she will attack you and no beonin if it must be done let me go there are too many warders in the tower for her to know them all and she will never expect a warder to attack her i can put a dagger in her heart before she knows what is happening he demonstrated a short blade appearing in his right hand quick as lightning what i do i must do myself tervail inverting the illusion and tying it off she prepared several other weaves just in case matters went too far awry inverting them also then began another a very complex weave that she laid on herself that would hide her ability to channel she had always wondered why some weaves such as illusion could be placed on yourself while it was impossible to make others such as healing touch your own body when she had asked that question as accepted turanine had said in that memorable deep voice as well ask why water is wet and sand dry child put your mind on what is possible rather than why some things are not good advice yet she never had been able to accept the second part the dead were walking may the light illumine me all the days of she tied off the last weave and removed her great serpent ring tucking it into her belt pouch now she could stand beside any aes sedai unrecognized for what she was you have always trusted me to know what is best she went on do you still his face remained as smooth as a sisters yet the bond brought an instant of shock but of course beonin then take winterfinch and go into the city hire a room at an inn until i come for you he opened his mouth but she raised an admonitory hand go tervail she watched him disappear through the trees leading both horses then turned to face the tower the dead were walking but all that mattered was that she reach elaida only that gusts of wind rattled the casements set in the windows the fire on the white marble hearth had warmed the air to the point that moisture condensed on the glass panes and trickled down like raindrops seated behind her gilded writing table with her hands calmly folded on the tabletop elaida do avriny aroihan the watcher of the seals the flame of tar valon the amyrlin seat kept a smooth face while she listened to the man in front of her rant shoulders hunched and shaking his fist did be kept bound and gagged for most of the voyage confined day and night to a cabin better called a cupboard for that i demand the captain of that vessel be punished elaida more i do demand an apology from you and from the white tower fortune stab me the amyrlin seat does no have the right to kidnap kings any longer the white tower does no have that right i do demand he was repeating himself again the man barely paused for breath it was difficult to keep her attention on him her eyes wandered to the bright tapestries on the walls the neatly arrayed red roses on white plinths in the corners tiresome maintaining outward calm while enduring this tirade she wanted to stand up and slap him the audacity of the man to speak so to the amyrlin seat but enduring calmly served her purpose better she would let him exhaust himself mattin stepaneos den balgar was muscular and he might have been goodlooking when young but the years had proven unkind the white beard that left his upper lip bare was neatly trimmed but the hair had retreated from most of his scalp his nose had been broken more than once and his scowl deepened creases on his flushed face that needed no deepening his green silk coat embroidered on the sleeves with the golden bees of illian had been brushed and cleaned well short of a sister channeling to do the work yet it had been his only coat for the voyage and not all the stains had come out the ship carrying him had been slow arriving late the day before but for once she was not displeased with someone elses slowness the light only knew what a mess alviarin would have made of matters had he arrived in a timely fashion the woman deserved to go to the headsman for the mire she had driven the tower into a mire elaida now had to dig out of much less for daring to blackmail the amyrlin seat mattin stepaneos cut off abruptly taking half a step back on the patterned taraboner carpet elaida wiped the frown from her face thinking of alviarin always made her glare unless she was careful your rooms are comfortable enough for you she said into the silence the serving men are suitable he blinked at the sudden change of direction the rooms do be comfortable and the serving men suitable he replied in a much milder tone perhaps remembering her frown even so i you should be grateful to the tower mattin stepaneos and to me rand althor took illian only days after you departed the city he took the laurel crown as well the crown of swords he named it can you believe he would have faltered in cutting off your head to take it i knew you would not leave voluntarily i saved your life there he should believe it had been done with his best interests at heart now the fool had the temerity to snort and fold his arms across his chest i am no a toothless old hound yet mother i did face death defending illian many times do you believe i fear dying so much i would rather be your guest for the rest of my life still that was the first time he had given her her proper title since entering the room the ornate gilded case clock standing against the wall chimed small figures of gold and silver and enamel moving on three levels on the highest above the clockface a king and queen knelt to an amyrlin seat unlike the wide stole resting on elaidas shoulders that amyrlins stole still had seven stripes she had not yet gotten around to bringing in an enameler there was so much to be done that was so much more important adjusting her stole on the bright red silk of her dress she leaned back so the flame of tar valon picked out in moonstones on the tall gilded chairback would stand directly above her head she intended to make the man take in every symbol of who she was and what she represented had the flametopped staff been at hand she would have held it under his crooked nose a dead man can reclaim nothing my son from here with my help it may be that you can reclaim your crown and your nation mattin stepaneos mouth opened a crack and he inhaled deeply like a man scenting a home he had never thought to see again and how would you arrange that mother i understand the city do be held by these ashaman he fumbled the cursed name slightly and aiel who follow the dragon reborn someone had been talking to him telling him too much his news of events was to be strictly rationed it seemed his serving man would have to be replaced but hope had washed the anger from his voice and that was to the good regaining your crown will require planning and time she told him since at the moment she had no idea of how it could be accomplished she certainly intended to find a way however kidnapping the king of illian had been meant to demonstrate her power but restoring him to a stolen throne would demonstrate it even further she would rebuild the full glory of the white tower at its highest the days when thrones trembled if the amyrlin seat frowned i am sure you are still weary from your journey she said standing just as if he had undertaken it of his own free will she hoped he was intelligent enough to make that pretense too it would serve them both far better than the truth in the days to come we will dine together at midday and discuss what might be done cariandre escort his majesty to his rooms and see to fetching a tailor he will need new clothes made a gift from me the plump ghealdanin red who had been standing still as a mouse beside the door to the anteroom glided forward to touch his arm he hesitated reluctant to go but elaida continued as though he were already leaving tell tarna to come in to me cariandre i have a great deal of work today she added for his benefit at last mattin stepaneos let himself be turned and she sat down again before he reached the door three lacquered boxes were arranged just so on the tabletop one her correspondence box where she kept recently received letters and reports from the ajahs the red shared whatever their eyesandears learnedshe thought they didbut the other ajahs still provided only dribbles though they had produced a number of unwelcome pieces of information in the last week or so unwelcome in part because they indicated contact with the rebels that must go beyond those farcical negotiations it was the fat goldembossed leather folder in front of her that she opened however the tower itself generated enough reports to have buried the table had she tried to read them all herself and tar valon produced ten times as many clerks handled the vast majority selecting only the most important for her to read they still made a thick stack you wanted me mother tarna said coolly shutting the door behind her there was no disrespect in it the yellowhaired woman was cold by nature her blue eyes icy elaida did not mind that what irritated her was that the bright red keepers stole around tarnas neck was little more than a wide ribbon her pale gray dress was slashed with enough red to display her pride in her ajah so why was her stole so narrow but elaida had a great deal of trust in the woman and of late that was a rare commodity what news from the harbor tarna there was no need to say which southharbor alone had any hope of remaining functional without massive repairs only riverships of the shallowest draft can enter tarna said crossing the carpet to stand in front of the writing table she might have been discussing the possibility of rain nothing fazed her but the rest are taking turns tying up to the part of the chain thats cuendillar so they can offload into barges the ship captains complain and it takes considerably longer yet for the time being we can make do elaidas mouth compressed and she drummed her fingers on the tabletop for the time being she could not begin to repair the harbors until the rebels finally collapsed so far they had not launched an assault thank the light that might begin with soldiers only yet sisters certainly would be drawn into it something they must want to evade as much as she did but razing the harbor towers as repairs would require laying the harbors open and defenseless might lead them to desperate acts light fighting must be avoided if at all possible she intended to fold their army into the tower guard once they realized they were finished and returned to the tower part of her already thought as if gareth bryne were commanding the tower guard for her an infinitely better man for high captain than jimar chubain the world would know the white towers influence then she did not want her soldiers killing one another any more than she wanted the tower weakened by her aes sedai killing one another the rebels were hers as much as those inside the tower and she meant to make them acknowledge it picking up the top sheet from the stack of reports she scanned it rapidly apparently despite my express order the streets are still not being cleaned why an uneasy light appeared in tarnas eyes the first time elaida had ever seen her look troubled people are frightened mother they dont leave their homes except at need and with great reluctance even then they say they have seen the dead walking in the streets this has been confirmed elaida asked quietly her blood suddenly seemed chill have any sisters seen them none in the red that i know of the others would speak with her as keeper yet not freely not to share confidences how under the light was that to be mended but people in the city are adamant they have seen what theyve seen slowly elaida set the page down to one side she wanted to shiver so she had read everything she could find concerning the last battle even studies and foretellings so old they had never been translated out of the old tongue and had lain covered in dust in the darkest corners of the library the althor boy had been a harbinger but now it seemed that tarmon gaidon would come sooner than anyone had thought several of those ancient foretellings from the earliest days of the tower said the dead appearing was the first sign a thinning of reality as the dark one gathered himself there would be worse before long have the tower guards drag ablebodied men out of their houses if need be she said calmly i want those streets clean and i want to hear that a start was made today today the other womans pale eyebrows lifted in surpriseshe bad lost her usual frigid selfcontrolbut all she said of course was as you command mother elaida projected serenity but it was a charade what would come would come and she still had secured no hold on the althor boy to think she had once had him right under her hand if only she had known then curse alviarin and that triply cursed proclamation calling anathema on anyone who approached him save through the tower she would have recalled it except that would seem weakness and in any case the damage had been done beyond simple mending still soon she would have elayne back in hand and the royal house of andor was the key to winning tarmon gaidon that she had foretold long ago and news of rebellion against the seanchan sweeping across tarabon had been very pleasant reading not everything was a tangle of briars stabbing her from every side scanning the second report she grimaced no one liked sewers yet they were onethird of the lifes blood of a city the other two being trade and clean water without the sewers tar valon would become prey to a dozen diseases overwhelming anything the sisters could do not to mention even more malodorous than the rotting garbage must have made the streets already though trade was cut to a trickle for the moment the water still came in at the upriver end of the island and was distributed to watertowers throughout the city then to fountains ornamental and plain that anyone was free to use but now it seemed the sewer outlets on the downriver end of the island were nearly clogged dipping her pen in the ink jar she scrawled i want these cleared by tomorrow across the top of the page and signed her name below if the clerks had any sense the work was already underway but she never accused clerks of having much sense the next report made her own eyebrows rise rats inside the tower that was beyond serious this should have been on top have someone check the wards tarna those wardings had held since the tower was built but perhaps they could have weakened after three thousand years how many of those rats were the dark ones spies a rap came at the door followed an instant later by a plump accepted named anemara who spread her striped skirts in a deep curtsy if it pleases you mother felaana sedai and negaine sedai have brought a woman to you they found wandering in the tower they say she wants to present a petition to the amyrlin seat tell her to wait and offer her tea anemara tarna said briskly the mother is busy no no elaida broke in send them in child send them in it had been too long since anyone had come to present her with a petition she was of a mind to grant whatever it was if it was not too ridiculous perhaps that would restart the flow it was far too long since any sisters had come to her without being summoned too perhaps the two browns would end that drought as well but only one woman entered the room carefully closing the door behind her by her silk riding dress and good cloak she appeared to be a noblewoman or a prosperous merchant a supposition supported by her confident manner elaida was sure she had never met the woman before yet there seemed something vaguely familiar about that face framed by hair even fairer than tarnas elaida stood and started around the table hands outstretched and an unaccustomed smile on her face she tried to make it seem welcoming i understand that you have a petition for me my daughter tarna pour her some tea the silver pot sitting on a silver tray atop the side table must still be at least warm the petition it was something i let them believe in order to reach you unbruised mother the woman replied in taraboner accents curtsying and halfway through that her face was suddenly that of beonin marinye embracing saidar tarna wove a shield on the woman but elaida contented herself with planting her fists on her hips to say that im surprised you dare show me your face would be an understatement beonin i managed to become part of what you might call the ruling council in salidar the gray said calmly i made sure they sat there and did nothing and i put the rumors about that many among them were in truth your secret adherents the sisters they were looking at one another with so much suspicion i think me most might have returned to the tower soon at that point but then other sitters beside the blues appeared the next i knew they had chosen their own hall of the tower and the ruling council it was done still i continued to do what i could i know that you commanded me to remain with them until they were all ready to return but that must happen within days now if i may say mother it was the most excellent decision not to try egwene for one thing she has the genius for discovering new weaves even better than elayne trakand or nynaeve almeara for another before they raised her lelaine and romanda struggled with one another to be named amyrlin with egwene alive they will struggle again but neither can succeed yes me i think very soon now sisters will begin following behind me in a week or two lelaine and romanda will find themselves alone with the remainder of their socalled hall how did you know the alvere girl wasnt to be tried elaida demanded how did you know shes even alive unshield her tarna tarna complied and beonin gave her a nod as if in gratitude a small gratitude those large bluegray eyes might make beonin appear constantly startled but she was a very composed woman combine composure with a wholehearted dedication to the law and also ambition which she possessed in as great a measure and elaida had known immediately that beonin was the one to send off after the sisters fleeing the tower and the woman had failed utterly oh she had apparently sowed a little dissension but really she had achieved nothing of what elaida had expected from her nothing she would find her rewards commensurate with her failure egwene she can enter telaranrhiod simply by going to sleep mother i myself have been there and seen her but i must use a teraugreal i could not acquire any of those the rebels have to bring with me in any event she spoke to siuan sanche in her dreams it is claimed though i think more likely in the world of dreams apparently she said that she is a prisoner but she would not tell where and she forbade any rescue attempt may i pour myself that tea elaida was so stunned she could not speak she motioned beonin to the side table and the gray curtsied again before going over to feel the silver pitcher cautiously with the back of her hand the girl could enter telaranrhiod and there were teraugreal that allowed the same thing the world of dreams was almost a legend and according to those troubling scraps the ajahs had deigned to share with her the girl had rediscovered the weave for traveling and made any number of other discoveries as well they had been the determining factor in her decision to preserve the girl for the tower but this on top of it if egwene can do this mother perhaps she really is a dreamer tarna said the warning she gave silviana is useless tarna the seanchan are still deep in altara and barely touching illian at least the ajahs were willing to pass on everything they learned of the seanchan or rather she hoped they passed on everything the thought roughened her voice unless they learn to travel can you think of any precaution i need to take beyond what is already in place she could not of course the girl had forbidden a rescue that was good on the face of it but it indicated she still thought of herself as amyrlin well silviana would remove that nonsense from her head soon enough if the sisters teaching her classes failed can she be fed enough of that potion to keep her out of tearanrhiod tarna grimaced slightlyno one liked that vile brew even the browns who had brought themselves to test itand shook her head we can make her sleep through the night but she would be useless for anything the next day and who can say whether it would affect this ability of hers may i pour for you mother beonin said balancing a thin white teacup on her fingertips tarna the most important news i have i dont care for any tea elaida said harshly did you bring back anything to save your skin from your miserable failure do you know the weave for traveling or this skimming or there were so many perhaps they were all talents and skills that had been lost but apparently most had not been named yet the gray peered at her across the teacup her face very still yes she said at last i cannot make cuendillar but i can make the new healing weaves work as well as most sisters and i know them all an edge of excitement crept into her voice the most marvelous is traveling without asking permission she embraced the source and wove spirit a vertical line of silver appeared against one wall and widened into a view of snowcovered oaks a cold breeze blew into the room making the flames dance in the fireplace that is called a gateway it can only be used to reach a place you know well but you learn a place by making a gateway there and to go somewhere you do not know well you use skimming she altered the weave and the opening dwindled into that silvery line once more then widened again the oaks were replaced by blackness and a graypainted barge railed and gated that floated on nothing against the opening release the weave elaida said she had the feeling that if she walked over to that barge the darkness would extend as far as she could see in any direction that she could fall in it forever it made her queasy the openingthe gatewayvanished the memory remained however resuming her seat behind the table she opened the largest of the lacquered boxes decorated with red roses and golden scrollwork from the top tray she picked up a small ivory carving a forktailed swallow dark yellow with years and stroked her thumb along the curved wings you will not teach these things to anyone without receiving my permission but why ever not mother some of the ajahs oppose the mother almost as strongly as those sisters beyond the river tarna said elaida shot a dark look at her keeper but that cool visage absorbed it without changing a hair i will decide who is reliable enough to be taught beonin i want your promise no i want your oath on my way here i saw sisters of different ajahs glaring at one another glaring what has happened in the tower mother your oath beonin the woman stood peering into her teacup long enough that elaida was beginning to think she would refuse but ambition won out she had tied herself to elaidas skirts in the hope of preferment and she would not abandon that now under the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth i swear that i will teach the weaves i learned among the rebels to no one without the permission of the amyrlin seat she paused taking a sip from the cup some sisters in the tower they are perhaps less reliable than you think i tried to stop it but that ruling council sent ten sisters to return to the tower and spread the tale of the red ajah and logain elaida recognized few of the names she reeled off until the last that one made her sit bolt upright shall i have them arrested mother tarna asked still as chill as ice no have them watched watch whoever they associate with so there uas a conduit between the ajahs inside the tower and the rebels how deeply had the rot spread however deep she would clean it out that may be difficult as matters stand mother elaida slapped the table with her free hand a sharp crack i didnt ask whether it would be difficult i said do it and inform meidani that i invite her to dinner this evening the woman had been persistent in trying to resume a friendship that had ended many years before now she knew why go and do that now a shadow crossed tarnas face as she curtsied dont worry elaida said beonin can feel free to teach you every weave she knows she did trust tarna after all and it certainly made her expression brighter if not warmer as the door closed behind her keeper elaida pushed the leather folder to one side and leaned her elbows on the table focusing on beonin now show me everything chapter three at the gardens a rangar arrived in answer to moridins summons spoken into her furious dreams to find him not yet there that was hardly surprising he liked to make an entrance eleven tall armchairs carved and gilded sat in a circle in the middle of the striped wooden floor but they were empty semirhage all in black as usual looked around to see who had entered then returned to her huddled conversation with demandred and mesaana in one corner of the room demandreds hooknosed face carried an expression of anger that only made him more striking not enough to attract her of course he was far too dangerous for that that wellfitted coat of bronze silk with falls of snowy lace at neck and wrists suited him however mesaana also wore the style of this age a darker patternembroidered bronze she appeared wan and subdued for some reason almost as if she had taken ill well that was possible this age had a number of nasty diseases and it seemed unlikely even she would trust semirhage for healing graendal the only other human present stood in the corner opposite cradling a delicate crystal goblet filled with dark wine but watching the trio rather than drinking only idiots ignored being studied by graendal yet the three went on with their fierce murmurs the chairs jarred with the rest of their surroundings the room appeared to have viewwalls though the stone arch of a doorway destroyed the illusion the chairs could have been anything here in telaranrhiod so why not something to suit the room and why eleven when that was surely two more than needed asmodean and sammael must be as dead as belal and rahvin why not the usual dilating door of a viewroom the display made the floor seem to be surrounded by the ansaline gardens with cormalinde masoons immense sculptures of stylized humans and animals towering over low buildings themselves like delicate sculptures in spinglass at the gardens only the finest wines had been served the finest dishes and it almost always had been possible to impress a beautiful woman with large winnings at the chinje wheels though cheating enough to win consistently had been difficult difficult but necessary for a scholar who lacked wealth all gone in ruins by the third year of the war a goldenhaired eversmiling zomara in a flowing white blouse and tight breeches bowed fluidly and offered arangar a crystal goblet of wine on a silver tray graceful and beautifully androgynous apparently human despite those dead black eyes the creatures had been one of aginors less inspired creations still even in their own age when moridin had been called ishamaelthere was no longer any doubt in her mind of who he washe had trusted the creatures above any human servant despite their uselessness for every other task somewhere he must have found a stasis box stuffed with the tilings he had dozens although he seldom brought them out yet ten more stood waiting graceful while standing still he must consider this meeting more important than most taking the goblet she waved the zomara away though it was already turning before she gestured she hated the creatures ability to know what was in her head at least it could not communicate what it learned to anyone memories of anything but commands faded in minutes even aginor possessed sense enough to see the need for that would he appear today osangar had missed every meeting since the failure at shadar logoth the true question was was he among the dead or was lie moving in secret perhaps at the great lords direction either way his absences presented delicious opportunities but the latter presented as many dangers dangers had been much on her mind lately casually she strolled over to graendal who do you think arrived first graendal the shadow take me whoever it was chose a depressing setting lanfear had preferred meetings that floated in endless night yet this was worse in its own way like meeting in a cemetery graendal smiled thinly at least she attempted a thin smile but no amount of effort would make those lips thin lush was the word for all of graendal lush and ripe and beautiful and barely concealed by the gray mist of her streith gown though perhaps she should not have worn quite so many rings all but one adorned with gems the coronet encrusted with rubies clashed with her sungold hair too the emerald necklace delana had provided went much better with her own green satin silks of course while the emeralds were real her silks were a product of the world of dreams she would have attracted too much notice in the waking world with a dress cut so low if it would even stay up there and there was the slit that bared her left leg to the hip her legs were better than graendals she had considered two slits her abilities here were not as large as someshe could not find egwenes dreams without the girl right beside herbut she could manage the clothes she wanted she enjoyed having her body admired and the more she flaunted it the more the others took her for inconsequential i arrived first graendal said frowning slightly into her wine i have fond memories of the gardens arangar managed a laugh so do i so do i the woman was a fool like the rest living in the past among the tatters of what was lost well never see the gardens again but well see their like she herself was the only one of them suited to rule in this age she was the only one who understood primitive cultures they had been her specialty before the war still graendal had useful skills and a wider range of contacts among the friends of the dark than she herself had though the other woman would certainly disapprove of how arangar meant to use them should she learn has it occurred to you that all of the others have alliances while you and i stand alone and osangar if he was alive but there was no need to bring him into this graendals gown turned a darker gray regrettably obscuring the view it was real streith arangar had found a pair of stasisboxes herself but filled with the most appalling rubbish for the most part has it occurred to you that this room must have ears the zomaran were here when i arrived graendal she purred the name if moridin is listening hell assume im trying to get into your bed he knows i never made alliances with anyone in truth she had made several but her allies always seemed to suffer fatal misfortunes once their usefulness ended and they took all knowledge of the affiliations to their graves those who found graves the streith went black as midnight in larcheen and spots of color appeared on graendals creamy cheeks her eyes became blue ice but her words were at odds with her face and her gown faded to near transparency as she spoke slowly sounding thoughtful an intriguing notion one ive never before considered i might do so now perhaps you will have to convince me though good the other woman was as quickwitted as ever it was a reminder that she must be careful she meant to use graendal and dispose of her not be caught in one of her traps i am very good at convincing beautiful women she stretched out a hand to caress graendals cheek now was not too soon to begin convincing the others besides something more than an alliance might come of it she had always fancied graendal she no longer really remembered having been a man in her memories she wore the body she did now which did make for a few oddities yet that bodys influence had not changed everything her appetites had not altered only broadened she would like very much to have that streith gown and anything else useful that graendal might possess of course but she dreamed of wearing that dress sometimes the only reason she was not wearing one now was that she would not have the other woman thinking she had imitated her the streith remained barely opaque but graendal stepped away from the caress looking past arangar who turned to find mesaana approaching flanked by demandred and semirhage he still appeared angry and semirhage coolly amused mesaana was still pale but no longer subdued no not subdued at all she was a hissing coreer spitting venom why did you let her go arangar you were supposed to be controlling her were you so busy playing your little dreamgames with her that you forgot to learn what she was thinking the rebellion will fall apart without her for a figurehead all my careful planning ruined because you couldnt keep a grasp on one ignorant girl arangar held on to her temper firmly she could hold it when she was willing to make the effort instead of snarling she smiled could mesaana actually have based herself inside the white tower how wonderful it would be if she could find a way to split that threesome apart i listened in on a sitting of the rebels hall last night in the world of dreams so they could meet inside the white tower with egwene leading it shes not the figurehead you believe ive tried telling you before but you never listened that came out too hard with an effort and it required effort she moderated her tone egwene told them all about the situation inside the tower the ajahs at one anothers throats she convinced them its the tower that is about to fall apart and that she might be able to help it along from where she is were i you id worry whether the tower can hold together long enough to keep this conflict going theyre determined to hold on mesaana murmured half under her breath she nodded good good then everything is proceeding according to plan i had been thinking i would need to stage some sort ofrescue but perhaps i can wait until elaida has broken her her return should create even more confusion then you need to sow more dissension arangar before im done i want these socalled aes sedai hating each other in their blood kzomara appeared bowing gracefully as it offered a tray with three goblets mesaana and her companions took the wine without a glance at the creature and it bowed again before flowing away dissension was always something she was good at semirhage said demandred laughed arangar forced her anger down sipping her own wineit was quite good with a heady aroma if nowhere near the vintages served at the gardensshe laid her free hand on graendals shoulder and toyed with one of those suncolored curls the other woman never flinched and the streith remained a bare mist either she was enjoying this or she had better control of herself than seemed possible semirhages smile grew more amused she too took her pleasures where she found them though semirhages pleasures had never attracted arangar if youre going to fondle one another demandred growled do it in private jealous arangar murmured and laughed lightly at his scowl where is the girl kept mesaana she didnt say mesaanas big blue eyes narrowed they were her best feature yet only ordinary when she frowned why do you want to know so you can rescue her yourself i wont tell you graendal hissed and arangar realized that her hand had become a fist in that golden hair bending graendals head back the other womans face remained tranquil but her gown was a red mist and rapidly growing darker more opaque arangar loosened her grip holding on lightly one of the first steps was making your quarry accustomed to your touch she did nothing to keep the anger from her voice this time however her bared teeth were an undisguised snarl i want the girl mesaana without her i have much weaker tools to work with mesaana sipped wine calmly before responding calmly by your own account you dont need her at all it has been my plan from the start arangar i will adapt it according to need but it is mine and i will decide when and where the girl is set free no mesaana i will decide when and where or whether she is freed moridin announced striding through the stone arch so he had set ears in place he was in unrelieved black this time a black somehow darker than what semirhage wore as usual moghedien and cyndane followed him both attired in identical redandblack that suited neither what hold did he have on them moghedien at least had never willingly followed anyone as for that beautiful bosomy little palehaired doll cyndane arangar had approached her just to see what might be learned and the girl had coldly threatened to rip her heart out if arangar touched her again hardly the words of someone who submitted easily sammael appears to have resurfaced moridin announced crossing the floor to take a seat he was a big man and he made the ornate highbacked chair seem a throne moghedien and cyndane sat down to either side of him but interestingly not until he had zomaran in snowy white were there instantly with wine yet moridin received his first whatever was at work there the zomaran sensed it that hardly seems possible graendal said as they all moved to take chairs her gown was dark gray now concealing everything he must be dead no one moved quickly though moridin was naeblis yet no one except moghedien and cyndane was willing to display any hint of subservience arangar certainly was not she took a seat across from moridin where she could watch him without seeming to and moghedien and cyndane moghedien was so still she would have faded into the chair except for her bright dress cyndane was a queen her face chiseled from ice trying to pull down the naeblis was dangerous yet those two might hold the key if she could figure out how to turn it graendal sat down beside her and the chair was suddenly closer arangar could have laid her hand on the other womans wrist but refrained from anything more than a slow smile it was best to keep her mind centered right then he could never have borne staying hidden this long demandred put in lounging into his chair between semirhage and mesaana legs crossed as though perfectly at ease that seemed doubtful he was another who was unreconciled she was sure sammael needed to have every eye directed at him nevertheless sammael or someone disguised as him gave orders to myrddraal and they obeyed so it was one of the chosen moridin scanned around the chairs as though he could detect who it had been black saa trickled across his blue eyes in a continuous stream she had no regrets that the true power was limited to his use alone now the price was much too high ishamael had certainly been at least half insane and he still was as moridin how long before she could remove him are you going to tell us what these orders were semirhages tone was cool and she sipped her wine calmly watching moridin over the goblets rim she sat very erect but she always did she too appeared completely at ease yet that was unlikely moridins jaw tightened i dont know he said at last reluctantly he never liked saying that but they sent a hundred myrddraal and thousands of trollocs into the ways that sounds like sammael demandred said thoughtfully twisting his goblet and studying the swirling wine perhaps i was mistaken a remarkable admission coming from him or an attempt to hide being the one who had worn sammael as a disguise she would like very much to know who had begun playing her own game or whether sammael really was alive moridin grunted sourly pass orders to your friends of the dark any report of trollocs or myrddraal outside the blight is to be handed to me as soon as you receive it the time of return is coming soon no one is allowed to go adventuring on their own any longer he studied them again each in turn save for moghedien and cyndane with a smile even more languorous than graendals arangar met his gaze mesaana shrank back from it as you learned to your sorrow he told mesaana and impossible as it seemed her face went paler still she took a long drink from her goblet her teeth clicking on the crystal semirhage and demandred avoided looking at her arangar exchanged looks with graendal something had been done to punish mesaanas failure to appear at shadar logoth but what once dereliction on that scale would have meant death they were too few for that now cyndane and moghedien appeared as curious as she was so they did not know either we can see the signs as clearly as you moridin demandred said irritably the time is near we need to find the rest of the seals on the great lords prison ive had my followers searching everywhere but theyve found nothing ah yes the seals indeed they must be found moridins smile was almost complacent only three remain all in althors possession though i doubt he has them with him theyre too susceptible to breaking now he will have hidden them direct your people to places he has been search them yourselves the easiest way is to kidnap lews therin in strong contrast to her icemaiden appearance cyndanes voice was breathy and sultry a voice made for lying on soft pillows wearing very little there was considerable heat in those big blue eyes now a searing heat i can make him tell where the seals are no moridin snapped fixing her with a steady stare you would accidentally kill him the time and manner of althors death will be at my choosing no one else strangely he put his free hand to the breast of his coat and cyndane flinched moghedien shivered no one else he repeated in a hard voice no one else cyndane said when he lowered his hand she exhaled softly then took a swallow of wine sweat glistened on her forehead arangar found the exchange illuminating it seemed that once she had disposed of moridin she would have moghedien and the girl on leashes very good indeed moridin straightened himself in his chair directing that stare at the rest of them that goes for all of you althor is mine you will not harm him in any way cyndane bent her head over her goblet sipping but the hatred in her eyes was plain graendal had said she was not lanfear that she was weaker in the one power but she surely was fixated on althor and she called him by the same name lanfear had always used if you want to kill someone he went on kill these two suddenly the semblances of two young men in rough country clothes stood in the center of the circle turning so that everyone could get a good look at their faces one was tall and wide with yellow eyes of all things while the other was not quite slender and wore a cheeky grin creations of tel arandriod they moved stiffly and their expressions never altered perrin aybara and mat cauthon are taveren easily found find them and kill them graendal laughed a mirthless sound finding taveren was never as simple as you made out and now its harder than ever the whole pattern is in flux full of shifts and spikes perrin aybara and mat cauthon semirhage murmured inspecting the two shapes so that is what they look like who knows moridin if you had shared this with us before now they might already have been dead moridins fist came down hard on the arm of his chair find them make doubly sure that your followers know their faces find aybara and cauthon and kill them the time is coming and they must be dead arangar took a sip of her wine she had no objections to killing these two if she happened to come across them but moridin was going to be terribly disappointed over rand althor chapter four a deal perrin sat steppers saddle a little back from the edge of the trees and watched the large meadow where red and blue wildflowers were beginning to poke through the winterbrown grass that the now vanished snows had flattened into a mat this stand was mainly leatherleaf that kept its broad dark foliage through the winter but only a few small pale leaves decorated the branches of the sweetgums among them the dun stallion stamped a hoof with an impatience perrin shared though he let none of it show the sun stood almost overhead he had been waiting there nearly an hour a stiff steady breeze blew out of the west down the meadow toward him that was good every so often his gauntleted hand stroked a nearly straight branch hacked from an oak thicker than his forearm and more than twice as long that lay across the saddle in front of him for half its length he had shaved two sides flat and smooth the meadow ringed by huge oaks and leatherleaf towering pine and shorter sweetgum was less than six hundred paces wide though longer than that the branch should be broad enough he had planned for every possibility he could imagine the branch fit more than one my lady first you should return to the camp gallenne said not for the first time rubbing irritably at his red eyepatch his crimson plumed helmet hung from the pommel of his saddle leaving his shoulderlength gray hair uncovered he had been heard to say in berelains hearing that most of those gray hairs were presents from her his black warhorse tried to take a nip at stepper and he reined the heavychested gelding sharply without taking his attention from berelain he had counseled against her coming in the first place grady can take you back and return while the rest of us wait a while longer to see whether the seanchan are going to show up i will remain captain i will remain berelains tone was firm and calm yet beneath her usual smell of patience lay an edge of concern she was not so certain as she made herself sound she had taken to wearing a light perfume that smelled of flowers perrin sometimes found himself trying to puzzle out which flowers but he was too focused for idle thoughts today vexation spiked in annouras scent though her ageless aes sedai face framed by dozens of thin braids remained as smooth as ever but then the beaknosed gray sister had smelled vexed ever since the rift between her and berelain it was her own fault visiting masema behind berelains back she also had counseled berelain to stay behind annoura edged her brown mare closer to the first of mayene and berelain moved her white mare just that far away without so much as a glance in her advisors direction vexation spiked again berelains red silk dress heavily embroidered in golden scrollwork displayed more bosom than she had in some time though a wide necklace of firedrops and opals provided a degree of modesty a wide matching belt supporting a jeweled dagger cinched her waist the narrow crown of mayene resting on her black hair holding a golden hawk in flight above her brows appeared ordinary beside the belt and necklace she was a beautiful woman the more so it seemed to him since she had stopped chasing him though still not a patch on faile of course annoura wore an unadorned gray riding dress but most of them were in their best for perrin that was a dark green silk coat with silver embroidery covering the sleeves and shoulders he was not much for fancy clothesfaile had chivvied him into buying what little he had well she had chivvied him gentlybut today he needed to impress if the wide plain leather belt fastened over the coat spoiled the impression a little so be it she must come arganda muttered a short stocky man alliandres first captain had not removed his silvered helmet with its three short white plumes and he sat his saddle easing his sword in its scabbard as though awaiting a charge his breastplate was silverplated too he would be visible for miles out in the sunlight she must the prophet says they wont aram put in and not softly heeling his leggy gray up beside stepper the brass wolfhead pommel of his sword stuck up over the shoulder of his greenstriped coat once he had seemed too good looking for a man but now his face grew grimmer every day there was a haggardness about him his eyes sunken and his mouth tight the prophet says either that or its a trap he says we shouldnt trust the seanchan perrin held his silence but felt his own spike of irritation as much with himself as with the onetime tinker balwer had informed him that aram had begun spending time with masema yet it had seemed unnecessary to tell the man not to let masema know everything perrin was doing there was no putting the egg back into the shell but he would know better in the future a workman should know his tools and not use them to breaking the same went for people as for masema no doubt he was afraid they would meet someone who knew he himself was dealing with the seanchan they were a large party though most would remain right there among the trees fifty of berelains winged guards in rimmed red helmets and red breastplates scarlet streamers floating from their slender steeltipped lances were mounted behind the golden hawk on blue of mayene rippling on the breeze beside them fifty ghealdanin in burnished breastplates and dark green conical helmets sat their horses behind ghealdans three silver stars on red the streamers on their lances were green they made a brave show yet all of them together were far less deadly than jur grady with his weathered farmers face even if they made him appear drab in his plain black coat with a silver sword pin on the high collar he knew it whether or not they did and he stood beside his bay gelding with the ease of a man resting before the days labor in contrast leof torfinn and tod alcaar the only other two rivers men present were still all but bouncing in their saddles with excitement despite the long wait it might have taken some of their pleasure away had they known they had been chosen in large part because they came nearest fitting their borrowed coats of dark finely woven green wool leof carried perrins own red wolfhead banner tod the red eagle of manetheren both rippling on staffs a little longer than the lances they had almost come to blows over who was to carry which perrin hoped it was not because neither wanted to carry the redbordered wolfhead leof looked happy enough tod looked ecstatic of course he did not know why perrin had brought the thing along in any trade you needed to make the other fellow think he was getting something extra as mats father often said colors swirled in perrins head and for a brief instant he thought he saw mat talking to a small dark woman he shook off the image here and now today were all that mattered faile was all that mattered they will come arganda snapped in answer to aram though he glared through the facebars of his helmet as if expecting a challenge what if they dont gallenne demanded his one eye scowling as fiercely as argandas pair his redlacquered breastplate was not much better than argandas silvered one small chance they could be talked into painting them something dull what if it is a trap arganda growled almost a wolfs guttural growl the man was near the end of his tether the breeze brought the scent of horses only moments before perrins ears caught the first bluetits trills too distant for anyone else to hear they came from the trees flanking the meadow large parties of men perhaps unfriendly were entering the woods more trills sounded closer theyre here he said which earned him looks from arganda and gallenne he tried to avoid revealing the acuteness of his hearing or his sense of smell yet that pair had been on the point of coming to blows the relayed trills grew nearer and everyone could hear them the two mens looks grew odd i cant risk the lady first if theres any chance of a trap gallenne said buckling on his helmet they all knew what the signal meant the choice is mine captain berelain replied before perrin could open his mouth and your safety is my responsibility my lady first berelain drew breath her face darkening but perrin got there first i told you how were going to spring that trap if thats what it is you know how suspicious the seanchan are likely theyre worried about us ambushing them gallenne harrumphed loudly the patience in berelains smell flickered then settled in again rock steady you should listen to him captain she said with a smile for perrin he knows what he is doing a party of riders appeared at the far end of the meadow and drew rein tallanvor was easy to pick out in a dark coat and mounted on a good dappled gray he was the only man not wearing armor vividly striped in red and yellow and blue the other pair unarmored were women one in blue with red on her skirts and breast the other in gray the sun reflected off something connecting them so a suldam and damane there had been no mention of that in all the negotiations carried out through tallanvor but perrin had counted on it its time he said gathering steppers reins onehanded before she decides were not coming annoura managed to get close enough to lay a hand on berelains arm for a moment before the other woman could move her mare away you should let me come with you berelain you may need my counsel yes this sort of negotiation it is my specialty i suspect the seanchan know an aes sedai face by now dont you annoura i hardly think theyd negotiate with you besides berelain added in a too sweet voice you must remain here to assist master grady spots of color appeared briefly on the aes sedais cheeks and her wide mouth tightened it had taken the wise ones to make her agree to take orders from grady today though perrin was just as glad he did not know how they had done it and she had been trying to wiggle out ever since leaving the camp you stay too perrin said when aram made to ride forward youve been hotheaded lately and i wont risk you saying or doing the wrong thing out there i wont risk faile on it that was true no need to say he would not risk the man carrying what was said out there back to masema you understand bubbles of disappointment filled arams scent but he nodded however reluctantly and rested his hands on the pommel of his saddle he might come close to worshiping masema but he would give his life a hundred times over rather than risk failes on purpose anyway what he did without thinking was another matter perrin rode out of the trees flanked by arganda on one side and berelain and gallenne on the other the banners followed behind and ten mayeners and ten ghealdanin in a column of twos as they walked their mounts forward the seanchan started toward them also in column with tallanvor riding beside the leaders one on a roan the other a bay the horses hooves made no sound on the thick mat of dead grass the forest had gone silent even to perrins ears while the mayeners and ghealdanin spread out in a line and most of the seanchan in their brightly painted armor did the same perrin and berelain advanced toward tallanvor and two of the armored seanchan one with three thin blue plumes on that lacquered helmet that was so like an insects head the other with two the suldam and damane came too they met in the middle of the meadow surrounded by wildflowers and silence with six paces between them as tallanvor positioned himself to one side between the two groups the armored seanchan removed their helmets with hands in steelbacked gauntlets that were striped like the rest of their armor the twoplumed helmet revealed a yellowhaired man with half a dozen scars seaming his square face he was a hardbitten man who smelled of amusement strangely but it was the other who interested perrin mounted on the bay a trained warhorse if he had ever seen one she was tall and broadshouldered for a woman though lean otherwise and not young gray marked the temples of her closecut tightly curled black hair as dark as good topsoil she displayed only two scars one slanting across her left cheek the other on her forehead had taken part of her right eyebrow some people thought scars a sign of toughness it seemed to perrin that fewer scars meant that you knew what you were doing confidence filled the scent of her in the breeze her gaze flickered across the fluttering banners he thought she paused slightly on manetherens red eagle and again on mayenes golden hawk yet she quickly settled to studying him her expression never altered a whit but when she noticed his yellow eyes something unidentifiable entered her scent something sharp and hard when she saw the heavy blacksmiths hammer in its loop on his belt the strange scent grew i give you perrintbashere aybara lord of the two rivers liege lord to queen alliandre of ghealdan tallanvor announced raising a hand toward perrin he claimed the seanchan were sticklers for formality but perrin had no idea whether this was a seanchan ceremony or something from andor tallanvor could have made it up for all of him i give you berelain sur paendrag paeron first of mayene blessed of the light defender of the waves high seat of house paeron with a bow to the pair of them he shifted his reins and raised the other hand toward the seanchan i give you bannergeneral tylee khirgan of the ever victorious army in service to the empress of seanchan i give you captain bakayar mishima of the ever victorious army in service to the empress of seanchan another bow and tallanvor turned his gray to ride back to a place beside the banners his face was as grim as arams but he smelled of hope im glad he didnt name you the wolf king my lord the bannergeneral drawled the way she slurred her words perrin had to listen hard to make out what she was saying otherwise id think tarmon gaidon was on us you know the prophecies of the dragon when the wolf king carries the hammer thus are the final days known when the fox marries the raven and the trumpets of battle are blown i never understood that second line myself and you my lady sur paendrag that would mean from paendrag my family is descended from artur paendrag tanreall berelain replied holding her head high an eddy in the breeze brought a whiff of pride among the patience and perfume they had agreed that perrin was to do all of the talkingshe was there to dazzle the seanchan with a beautiful young ruler or at least to lend weight to perrin with it but he supposed she had to answer a direct question tylee nodded as though that were exactly the answer she expected that makes you a distant cousin of the imperial family my lady no doubt the empress may she live forever will honor you so long as you make no claims to hawkwings empire yourself anyway the only claim i make is to mayene berelain said proudly and that i will defend to my last breath i didnt come here to talk about the prophecies or hawkwing or your empress perrin said irritably for the second time in a matter of moments those colors tried to coalesce in his head only to be dispelled he had no time the wolf king hopper would come as near to laughing as a wolf could over that any wolf would still he felt a chill he had not realized that he was mentioned in the prophecies and his hammer was a harbinger of the last battle but nothing mattered except faile only her and whatever it took to free her the agreement for this meeting was no more than thirty in either party but you have men in the woods on both sides of us a lot of men so do you mishima said with grin distorted by a white scar that met the corner of his mouth or you wouldnt know about ours his drawl was worse than hers perrin kept his eyes on the bannergeneral as long as they both remain theres the chance of accidents i dont want any accidents i want my wife back from the shaido and how do you propose we avoid accidents mishima said idly flipping his reins he sounded as though the question was not urgent it seemed tylee was content to let him do the talking while she observed perrins reactions are we supposed to trust you if we send our men out first or you to trust us if we ask you to withdraw first on the heights the paths are paved with daggers there isnt much room for trust i suppose we could both order our men to pull back at the same time but one side might cheat perrin shook his head youre going to have to trust me bannergeneral i have no reason to want to attack you or capture you and every reason not to i cant be sure of the same about you you might think capturing the first of mayene worth a little betrayal berelain laughed softly it was time tor the branch not just to force the seanchan out of the woods first but to convince them that they needed what he could offer he stood the branch upright on the saddle in front of him i expect your men are probably good soldiers my men arent soldiers though theyve fought trollocs and shaido and done well against both gripping the branch at its base he held it high overhead the shaved sides uppermost and facing either side but theyre used to hunting lions and leopards and ridgecats come down out of the mountains after our flocks and wild boar and bear animals that hunt back in forests not much different from this the branch tried to twist violently in his gauntleted fist as twin impacts not a heartbeat apart shivered down his arm he lowered the branch to display two pile arrows their chiselshaped heads driven clear of the tough wood on either side three hundred paces was a long range for that target but he had chosen jondyn barran and jori congar to makes the shots they were the best he had if it comes down to it your men wont even see whos killing them and that armor wont do much good against a two rivers longbow i hope it doesnt come to that with all of his strength he heaved the branch up into the air my eyes mishima growled a hand going to his sword even as he tried to rein the roan back and watch perrin and the branch all at the same time his helmet toppled from his saddle to the grass the bannergeneral made no move toward her sword though she also tried watching perrin and the branch at first she did then her gaze followed only the branch as it continued to climb until it hung centered between them a hundred feet in the air abruptly a ball of flame enveloped the branch so fierce that perrin felt the heat as from an open furnace berelain put up a hand to shield her face tylee merely watched thoughtfully the fire lasted just moments yet that was enough to leave only ash drifting on the breeze when it vanished ash and two plummeting specks that fell into the dry grass small flames shot up immediately and began growing spreading even the warhorses snorted in fear berelains mare danced in an attempt to fight her reins and flee perrin muttered a cursehe should have thought of the arrowheadsand started to dismount to stamp out the fire but before he could swing his leg over the saddle the flames vanished leaving only thin tendrils of smoke rising from a patch of blackened grass good norie the suldam murmured patting the damane norie is a wonderful damane the grayclad woman smiled shyly at the praise despite her words the suldam looked worried so tylee said you have a marath she paused pursing her lips you have an aes sedai with you more than one no matter i cant say the aes sedai ive seen have impressed me very much not marathdamane my general the suldam said quietly tylee sat very still studying perrin intently ashaman she said at last not a question you begin to interest me my lord then maybe one last thing will convince you perrin said tod roll that banner around the staff and bring it here hearing nothing behind him he looked over his shoulder tod was staring at him with a stricken look tod giving himself a shake tod began winding the red eagle around its staff he still looked unhappy when he rode forward and handed it to perrin though he sat there with his hand still stretched out as though hoping the staff might be returned to him heeling stepper toward the seanchan perrin held the banner in front of him in his fist parallel to the ground the two rivers was the heart of manetheren bannergeneral the last king of manetheren died in a battle right where emonds field the village i was born in grew up manetheren is in our blood but the shaido have my wife prisoner to free her ill give up any claim to reviving manetheren sign any sort of oath on it you want that claim would be a field of brambles for you seanchan you could be the one who cleared that field without a drop of blood shed behind him someone groaned miserably he thought it was tod suddenly the breeze was a gale howling in the opposite direction pelting them with grit blowing so hard that he had to cling to his saddle to kept from being knocked out of it his coat seemed on the point of being ripped from his body where had the grit come from the forest was carpeted inches deep with dead leaves the tempest stank of burned sulphur too sharp enough to burn perrins nose the horses tossed their heads mouths open but the roar of the wind buried their frightened whinnies only moments the ferocious wind lasted and then as suddenly as it came it was gone leaving only the breeze blowing the other way the horses stood shivering snorting and tossing their heads and rolling their eyes perrin patted steppers neck and murmured soothing sounds yet it had little effect the bannergeneral made a strange gesture and muttered avert the shadow where under the light did that come from ive heard tales of strange things happening or was it more convincing on your part my lord no perrin said truthfully neald possessed abilities with weather it had turned out but not grady what does it matter where it came from tylee looked at him thoughtfully then nodded what does it matter she said sounding as if she did not necessarily agree with him we have stories about manetheren that would be brambles underfoot and no boots half of amadicia is buzzing with talk of you and that banner come to bring manetheren alive again and save amadicia from us mishima sound withdrawal without hesitation the yellowhaired man raised a small straight horn that was hanging by a red cord around his neck blowing four shrill notes he repeated the sequence twice before letting the horn fall to swing against his chest my part is done tylee said perrin put back his head and shouted as loudly and distinctly as he could dannü tell when the last seanchan moves below the end of the meadow gather everyone and join grady the bannergeneral stuck her little finger into her ear and wiggled it about in spite of her gauntlet you have a strong voice she said dryly only then did she reach out to take the bannerstaff laying it carefully across the saddle in front of her she did not look at it again but one hand stroked the banner itself perhaps unconsciously now what do you have that can aid my plan my lord mishima hooked an ankle behind the tall pommel of his saddle and lowered himself to catch up his helmet the wind had rolled it across the beatendown grass halfway back to the line of seanchan soldiers brom the trees came a brief snatch of larksong then another another the seanchan were withdrawing had they felt the wind too no matter not near as many men as you already have perrin admitted not that are trained soldiers at least but i have ashaman and aes sedai and wise ones who can channel and youll need every one of them she opened her mouth and he raised a hand ill want your word that you wont try putting collars on them he glanced pointedly at the siddam and damane the suldam was keeping her eyes on tylee awaiting orders but at the same time she was idly stroking the other womans hair the way you might stroke a cat to soothe it and norie looked to be almost purring light your word that theyre safe from you them and anyone in the camp wearing a white robe most of those arent shaido anyway and the only aiel among them i know about are friends of mine tylee shook her head you have strange friends my lord in any case weve found people from cairhien and amadicia with bands of shaido and let them go though most of the cairhienin seem too disoriented to know what to do with themselves the only ones in white we keep are the aiel these gaishain make marvelous dacovale unlike the rest still ill agree to letting your friends go free and your aes sedai and ashaman putting an end to this gathering is very important tell me where they are and i can start incorporating you into my plans perrin rubbed the side of his nose with a finger it seemed unlikely many of those gaisbain were shaido but he was not about to tell her that let them have their chance at freedom when their year and a day was up itll have to be my plan im afraid sevanna will be a tough nut to crack but ive worked out how for one thing she has maybe a hundred thousand shaido with her and shes gathering in more not every one is algadsiswai but any adult will pick up a spear if they need to sevanna tylee gave a pleased smile weve heard that name i would dearly love to present sevanna of the jumai shaido to the captaingeneral her smile faded a hundred thousand is many more than i expected but not more than i can handle weve fought these aiel before in amadicia eh mishima riding back to join them mishima laughed but it was a harsh sound no amusement in it that we have bannergeneral theyre fierce fighters disciplined and crafty but they can be handled you surround one of their bands their septs with three or four damane and pound them till they give up its a nasty business they have their families with them but they surrender the sooner for it i understand you have a dozen or so damane perrin said but is that enough to face three or four hundred wise ones channeling the bannergeneral frowned you mentioned that before wise ones channeling every band weve caught had its wise ones but not one of them could channel thats because all the shaido have are with sevanna perrin replied at least three hundred and maybe four the wise ones with me are sure of it tylee and mishima exchanged a look and the bannergeneral sighed mishima looked glum well she said orders or no orders that puts an end to finishing this quietly the daughter of the nine moons will have to be disturbed if i must apologize for it to the empress may she live forever likely i will the daughter of the nine moons some highranking seanchan apparently but how was she supposed to be disturbed by any of this mishima grimaced a fearsome sight with all those scars crisscrossing his face i read there were four hundred damane on each side at semalaren and that was a slaughterhouse half the imperial army on the field dead and better than three out of four among the rebels nevertheless mishima we have it to do or rather someone else does you might escape an apology but i wont what under the light was so upsetting about an apology the woman smelled resigned unfortunately it will take weeks if not months to gather enough soldiers and damane to prick this boil i thank you for your offer of help my lord it will be remembered tylee held out the banner youll want this back since i cant deliver my side of the bargain but a piece of advice the ever victorious army may have other tasks in front of it for the nonce but we wont let anyone take momentary advantage of the situation to set himself up as a king we mean to reclaim this land not divide it into parcels and we mean to keep our lands berelain said fiercely making her mare lunge across the few paces of dead grass between her and the seanchan the mare was eager to lunge eager to run away from that wind and she had trouble reining the animal in even her scent was fierce no patience now she smelled like a shewolf defending her injured mate ive heard that your ever victorious army is misnamed ive heard the dragon reborn defeated you soundly to the south dont you ever think that perrin aybara cant do the same light and he had been worried over arams hotheadedness i dont want to defeat anybody except the shaido perrin said firmly fighting off the image that tried to form in his mind he folded his hands on the pommel of his saddle stepper seemed to be settling down at least the stallion still gave small shivers now and then but he had stopped rolling his eyes theres a way to do that and still keep everything quiet so you dont need to apologize if that was important to her he was ready to use it the daughter of the nine moons can rest easy i told you i had this planned out tallanvor told me you have some kind of tea that makes a woman who can channel go wobbly in the knees after a moment tylee lowered the banner back to her saddle and sat studying him a woman or a man she drawled at last ive heard of several men being caught that way but just how do you propose feeding it to these four hundred women when theyre surrounded by a hundred thousand aiel by feeding it to all of them without letting them know theyre drinking it ill need as much as i can get though wagonloads probably theres no way to heat the water you see so itll be thin tea tylee laughed softly a bold plan my lord i suppose they might have cartloads at the manufactory where the teas made but thats a long way from here in amadicia almost to tarabon and the only way i could get more than a few pounds at once would be to tell someone of higher rank why i wanted it and theres the end of keeping it quiet all over again the ashaman know a thing called traveling perrin told her a way to cross hundred of miles in a step and as for getting the tea maybe this will help from his left gauntlet he pulled a folded greasestained piece of paper tylees eyebrows rose as she read it perrin had the short text by heart the bearer of this stands under my personal protection in the name of the empress may she live forever give him what ever aid he requires in service to the empire and speak of it to none but me he had no idea who suroth sabelle meldarath was but if she signed her name to something like that she had to be important maybe she was this daughter of the nine moons handing the paper to mishima the bannergeneral stared at perrin that sharp hard scent was back stronger than ever aes sedai ashaman aiel your eyes that hammer now this who are you mishima whistled through his teeth suroth herself he murmured im a man who wants his wife back perrin said and ill deal with the dark one to get her he avoided looking at the suldam and damane he was not far short of making a deal with the dark one do we have a bargain tylee looked at his outstretched hand then took it she had a firm grip a deal with the dark one but he would do whatever it took to get faile free chapter five something strange the drumbeat of rain on the tent roof that had lasted through most of the night faded to something softer as faile approached sevannas chair a heavily carved and gilded throne placed in the center of the bright layered carpets that made up the tents floor with her eyes carefully lowered to avoid offense spring had arrived in a rush but the braziers were unlit and the morning air held a touch of chill curtsying deeply she presented the ropework silver tray the aiel woman took the golden goblet of wine and drank without so much as a glance in her direction but she gave another deep curtsy before backing away and setting the tray down on the brassbound blue chest that already held a tallnecked silver wine pitcher and three more goblets then returned to her place with the other eleven gaishain present standing between the mirrored standlamps along the red silk tent wall it was a spacious tent and tall no low aiel tent for sevanna often it was hard to see her as aiel at all this morning she lounged in a red brocaded silk robe tied so it gaped nearly to her waist and exposed half her considerable bosom though she wore enough jeweled necklaces emeralds and firedrops and opals ropes of fat pearls that she came near to being decent the aiel did not wear rings yet sevanna had at least one begemmed ring on every finger the thick band of gold and firedrops worn over the folded blue silk scarf that held back her waistlong yellow hair had taken on the aspect of a coronet if not a crown there was nothing aiel in that faile and the others six women and five men had been wakened in the night to stand beside sevannas beda pair of feather mattresses laid one atop the otherin case the woman woke and wanted something was any ruler in the world attended by a dozen servants while she slept she fought the urge to yawn many things might earn punishment but yawning surely would gaishain were supposed to be meek and eager to please and it seemed that that meant obsequious to the point of groveling bain and chiad fierce as they were otherwise seemed to find it easy faile did not in the near month since she was stripped and tied up like a blacksmiths puzzle for hiding a knife she had been switched nine times for trivial offenses that were serious in sevannas eyes her last set of welts had not faded completely yet and she had no intention of earning another set through carelessness she hoped that sevanna thought her tamed by that night trussed up in the cold only rolan and his braziers had saved her life she hoped that she was not being tamed pretend something too long and it could become truth she had been a prisoner less than two months yet she could no longer recall exactly how many days ago she was captured at times it seemed she had been in white robes for a year or more sometimes the wide belt and collar of flat golden links felt natural that frightened her she clung hard to hope she would escape soon she had to before perrin caught up and tried to rescue her why had he not caught up yet the shaido had been camped at maiden for a long time now he would not have abandoned her her wolf would be coming to rescue her she had to escape before he got himself killed in the attempt before she was no longer pretending how long are you going to keep punishing galina sedai therava sevanna demanded frowning at the aes sedai therava was seated crosslegged in front of her on a tasseled blue cushion straightbacked and stern last night she made my bath water coo hot and she is so welted i had to order the soles of her feet beaten that is not very effective when she must be left able to walk faile had been avoiding looking at galina ever since therava brought her into the tent but her eyes went to the woman of their own accord at mention of her name galina was kneeling erect halfway between the two aiel women and slightly to one side mottled brown bruises on her cheeks her skin damp and slick from the heavy rain she had been walked through to get there her feet and ankles muddy she wore only her firedropstudded golden collar and belt and seemed more naked than naked just a stubble remained of her hair and eyebrows every hair from head to toe had been singed from her with the one power faile had heard it described along with how the aes sedai had been hung from her ankles for her first beating that had been half the talk among the gaishain for days only the handful who recognized her ageless face for what it was still believed that she was aes sedai and some of those had the same doubts that had plagued faile on finding an aes sedai among the gaishain after all she possessed the face and the ring but why would an aes sedai let therava treat her so faile asked herself that question often without arriving at any answer she kept telling herself that aes sedai often did what they did for reasons no one else could understand but that was not very satisfying whatever her reasons for tolerating such abuse galinas eyes were wide and frightened now and fixed on therava she was panting so hard that her breasts heaved she had reason for fear anyone passing theravas tent was likely to hear galina howling for mercy inside for more than half a week faile had gotten glimpses of the aes sedai on some errand hairless and garbed as she was now and running as hard as she could with panic painting her face and every day therava added to the bands of welts that striped galina from her shoulders to the backs of her knees whenever one band began to heal therava refreshed it faile had heard shaido mutter that galina was being treated too harshly but no one was about to interfere with a wise one therava nearly as tall as most aiel men adjusted her dark shawl in a rattle of gold and ivory bracelets and regarded galina like a blueeyed eagle regarding a mouse her necklaces also gold and ivory seemed plain compared to sevannas opulence her dark woolen skirts and white algode blouse drab yet of the two women faile feared therava far more than she did sevanna sevanna might have her punished for a stumble but therava could kill her or crush her for a whim she surely would if faile attempted escape and failed so long as the faintest bruise remains on her face the rest of her will be bruised as well i have left the front of her unmarked so she can be punished for other misdeeds galina began trembling silent tears leaked down her cheeks faile averted her gaze it was painful to watch even if she managed to get the rod from theravas tent could the aes sedai still be of help in escape she gave every sign of being completely broken that was a harsh thought but a prisoner needed to be practical above all else would galina betray her to try buying her way out of the beatings she had threatened to betray her if faile failed to obtain the rod it was sevanna who would be interested in perrin aybaras wife yet galina looked desperate enough to try anything faile prayed for the woman to find strength to hold out of course she was planning an escape on her own in case galina could not keep her promise to take them with her when she left but it would be so much easier so much safer for everyone if she could do it oh light why had perrin not caught up yet no she had to keep her focus she is not very impressive like that sevanna muttered frowning into her goblet now even that ring cannot make her look like an aes sedai she shook her head irritably for some reason faile did not understand it was very important to sevanna that everyone know that galina was a sister she had even taken to giving her the honorific why are you here so early therava i have not even eaten yet will you take some wine water therava said firmly as for it being early the sun is almost over the horizon i broke fast before it rose you grow as indolent as a wetlander sevanna lusara a buxom domani gaishain quickly filled a goblet from the silver water pitcher sevanna seemed amused by the wise ones insistence on drinking only water yet she provided it for them anything else would have been an insult even she would want to avoid the copperskinned domani had been a merchant and well into her middle years but a few white hairs among the black falling below her shoulders had not been enough to save her she was stunningly beautiful and sevanna gathered the rich the powerful and the beautiful simply taking them if they were gaishain to someone else there were so many gaishain that few complained at having one taken lusara curtsied gracefully and bowed to present her tray to therava on her cushion all very proper but on the way back to her place against the wall she smiled at faile worse it was a conspiratorial smile faile suppressed a sigh her last switching had been for a sigh at the wrong moment lusara was one of those who had sworn fealty to her in the past two weeks after aravine faile had tried to choose carefully but rejecting someone who asked to swear was creating a possible betrayer so she had far too many adherents a good number of whom she was unsure of she was beginning to believe that lusara was trustworthy or at least that she would not intentionally betray her but the woman treated their escape plans like a childs game without cost if they lost it seemed she had treated merchanting in the same way making and losing several fortunes but faile would have no chance to start over if they lost nor would alliandre or maighdin or lusara among sevannas gaishain those who actually attempted escape were kept chained when not serving her or performing tasks therava took a swallow of water then set the goblet down on the flowered carpet beside her and fixed sevanna with a steely gaze the wise ones believe it is past time for us to move north and east we can find easily defended valleys in the mountains there and we can reach them in less than two weeks even slowed as we are by the gaishain this place is open on every side and our raids to find food must go further and further sevannas green eyes met that stare without blinking which faile doubted she herself could have done it nettled sevanna when the other wise ones met without her and frequently she took it out on her gaishain but she smiled and took a sip of wine before replying in patient tones as though explaining to someone not quite bright enough to understand here there is good soil for planting and we have their seed to add to our own who knows what the soil is like in the mountains our raids bring in cattle and sheep and goats too here there are good pastures what pasturage do you know of in these mountains therava here we have more water than any clan has ever had do you know where the water is in the mountains as to defending ourselves who will come against us these wetlanders run from our spears not all run therava said drily some are even good at dancing the spears and what if rand althor sends one of the other clans against us we would never know until the horns closed in on us suddenly she smiled too a smile that never reached her eyes some say your plan is to be captured and made gaishain to rand althor so you can induce him to marry you an amusing idea you agree despite herself faile flinched sevannas mad intention to marry althorshe had to be mad to think she couldwas what put faile in danger from galina if the aiel woman did not know that perrin was linked to althor galina could tell her would tell her if she could not get her hands on that cursed rod sevanna would take no chances on losing her then she would be chained as certainly as if caught trying to escape sevanna looked anything except amused eyes glittering she leaned forward her robe gaping to expose her bosom completely who says this who therava picked up her goblet and took another swallow of water realizing she would get no answer sevanna leaned back and rearranged her robe her eyes still glittered like polished emeralds though and there was nothing casual in her words they came out as hard as her eyes i will marry rand althor therava i almost had him until you and the other wise ones failed me i will marry him unite the clans and conquer all of the wetlands therava sneered over her goblet couladin was the caracarn sevanna i have not found the wise ones who gave him permission to go to rhuidean but i will rand althor is a creature of the aes sedai they told him what to say at alcair dal and a black day it was when he revealed secrets few are strong enough to know be grateful that most believe he lied but i forget you have never gone to rhuidean you believed his secrets lies yourself gaishain began entering past the tentflap their white robes raindamp holding their hems kneehigh until they were inside each wore the golden collar and belt their soft white laced boots left muddymarks on the carpets later when those had dried they would have to clean them away but getting visible mud on your robes was a sure path to the switch sevanna wanted her gaishain spotless when they were around her neither aiel woman paid the slightest attention to the arrivals sevanna seemed taken aback by what therava had said why do you care who gave couladin permission no matter she said waving a hand as though brushing away a fly when she got no reply couladin is dead rand althor has the markings however he got them i will marry him and i will make use of him if the aes sedai could control him and i saw them handling him like a babe then i can with a little help from you and you will help you agree that uniting the clans is worth doing no matter how it is done you did once somehow there was more than a hint of threat in that we shaido will become the most powerful of the clans in one leap lowering their cowls the new gaishain filed wordlessly along the tent walls nine men and three women one of them maighdin the sunhaired woman wore a grim expression that had been on her face since the day therava had discovered her in the wise ones tent whatever therava had done all maighdin would say of it was that she wanted to kill the other woman sometimes she whimpered in her sleep though therava kept whatever she thought about uniting the clans to herself there is much feeling against staying here many of the sept chiefs press the red disc on their narbaha every morning i advise you to heed the wise ones narbaha that would mean box of fools or something very near but what could this be bain and chiad were still teaching her about aiel ways when they could find time and chey had never mentioned any such thing maighdin stopped beside lusara a slender cairhienin nobleman named doirmanes stopped beside faile he was young and very pretty but he bit his lip nervously if he learned about the oaths of fealty he would have to be killed she was certain he would run to sevanna in a heartbeat we remain here sevanna said angrily flinging her goblet to the carpets in a spray of wine i speak for the clan chief and i have spoken you have spoken therava agreed calmly bendhuin sept chief of the green salts has received permission to go to rhuidean he left five days ago with twenty of his algaidsiswai and four wise ones to stand witness not until one of the new gaishain stood beside each of those already there did faile and the others raise their cowls and begin filing along the walls toward the doorflap already gathering their robes to the knee she had become quite sanguine about exposing her legs so he seeks to replace me and i was not even informed not you sevanna couladin as his widow you speak for the clan chief until a new chief returns from rhuidean but you are not the clan chief faile stepped out into the cold gray morning drizzle and the tentflap cut off whatever sevanna said to that what was going on between the two women sometimes as this morning they seemed antagonists but at others they seemed reluctant conspirators bound together by something that gave neither any comfort or perhaps it was the being bound together itself that made them uncomfortable well she could not see how knowing would help her escape so it did not really matter but the puzzle nagged at her six maidens stood clustered in front of the tent veils hanging down onto their chests spears thrust up through the harness of the bow cases on their backs bain and chiad were contemptuous of sevanna for using maidens of the spear for her guard of honor though she herself had never been a maiden and for having her tent always guarded but there were never fewer than six night or day those two were contemptuous of the shaido maidens for allowing it too neither being a clan chief nor speaking for one gave you as much power as most nobles possessed these maidens hands were flashing in a rapid conversation she caught the sign for caracarn several times but not sufficient else to make out what they were saying or whether about althor or couladin standing there long enough to find out if she could find out was beyond the question with the others already hurrying away down the muddy street the maidens would become suspicious for one thing and then they might switch her themselves or worse use her own bootlaces she had had a hard dose of that from some maidens for having insolent eyes and she did not want another especially when it meant baring herself in public being sevannas gaishain gave no protection any shaido could discipline any gaishain they thought was behaving improperly even a child could if the child was set to watch you carry out a chore for another thing the cold rain light as it was was going to soak through her woolen robes soon enough she had only a short walk back to her tent no more than a quarter of a mile but she would not complete it without being stopped for a time a yawn cracked her jaw as she turned from the large red tent she very much wanted her blankets and a few more hours sleep there would be more chores come afternoon what they might be she did not know matters would be much simpler if sevanna settled on who she wanted to do what when but she seemed to choose names at random and always at the last minute it made planning anything much less the escape very difficult all sorts of tents surrounded sevannas low dark aiel tents peaked tents walled tents tents of every sort and size in every color imaginable separated by a tangle of dirt streets that were now rivers of mud lacking enough of their own the shaido snatched up every tent they could find fourteen septs were camped in a sprawl around maiden now a hundred thousand shaido and as many gaishain and rumor said two more septs the morai and the white cliff would arrive within days aside from small children splashing through the mud with romping dogs most of the people she could see as she walked wore mudstained white and were carrying baskets or bulging sacks most of the women did not hurry they ran except for the blacksmiths the shaido seldom did any work themselves and generally only out of boredom she suspected with so many gaisbain finding chores for them all was itself a chore sevanna was no longer the only shaido to actually sit in a bathtub with a gaisbain scrubbing her back none of the wise ones had gone that far yet but some of the others would not stir themselves two paces to pick something up when they could tell a gaisbain to fetch it she was almost to the gaisbain portion of the camp hard against the gray stone walls of maiden when she saw a wise one striding toward her with her dark shawl wrapped around her head against the rain faile did not stop but she bent her knees a little meira was not so frightening as therava but the grimfaced woman was hard enough and shorter than faile her narrow mouth always grew even tighter when she was confronted with a woman taller than she faile would have thought that learning her own sept the white cliff would be there soon would brighten the womans mood but the news had had no discernable effect at all so you were just lagging meira said as she came close her eyes were as hard as the sapphires they resembled i left rhiale listening to the others because i feared some drunken fool had pulled you into a tent she glared around her as though looking for a drunken fool about to do just that no one accosted me wise one faile said quickly several had in the last few weeks some drunk and some not but rolan always appeared in the nick of time twice the big meradin had had to fight to save her and once he had killed the other man she had expected nine kinds of uproar and trouble but the wise ones judged it a fair fight and rolan said her name had never been mentioned for all that bain and chiad insisted it went against all custom assault was a constant danger for gaishain women here she was sure that alliandre had been assaulted once before she and maighdin also acquired meradin shadows rolan denied having asked them to help her people he said they were just bored and looking for something to do im very sorry i was slow do not cringe i am not therava i will not beat you for the pleasure of it words said in tones hard enough for a headsman meira might not beat people for pleasure but faile knew for a fact that she had a strong arm swinging a switch now tell me what sevanna said and did this water falling from the sky may be a wondrous thing but it is miserable to walk around in obeying the command was easy sevanna had not wakened during the night and once she did rise all her talk had been of what clothes and jewels she would wear especially the jewels her jewelry chest had been made to hold clothing and it was filled to the top with more gems than most queens possessed before putting on any garment at all sevanna had spent time trying on different combinations of necklaces and rings and studying herself in the giltframed standmirror it had been very embarrassing for faile she had just reached theravas arrival with galina when everything in front of her eyes rippled she rippled it was not imagination meiras blue eyes widened as far as they could go she had felt it too again everything rippled including herself harder than before in shock faile stood up straight and let go of her robe a third time the world rippled harder still and as it passed through her she felt as if she might blow away in a breeze or simply dissipate in a mist breathing hard she waited for the fourth ripple the one she knew would destroy her and everything else when it did not come she expelled every bit of air in her lungs from relief what just happened wise one what was that meira touched her own arm and looked faintly surprised that her hand did not pass through flesh and bone i do not know she said slowly giving herself a shake she added go on about your business girl she gathered her skirts and strode past faile at little short of a trot splashing mud as she went the children had vanished from the street but faile could hear them wailing inside the tents abandoned dogs shivered and whined tails tucked between their legs people in the street were touching themselves touching each other shaido and gaishain alike faile clasped her hands together of course she was solid she had only felt as though she were turning to mist of course hoisting her robes to avoid any more washing than she absolutely had to do she began to walk and then to run careless of how much mud she splashed onto herself or anyone else she knew there could be no running from another of those ripples but she ran anyway as fast as her legs could carry her the gaishain tents made a broad ring around maidens high granite walls and they were as varied as the tents in the outer part of the encampment though most were small her own peaked tent could have slept two uncomfortably it housed herself and three others alliandre maighdin and a former cairhienin noblewoman named dairaine one of those who curried favor with sevanna by carrying tales about the other garshain that complicated matters but there was no mending it short of killing the woman and faile would not countenance that not unless dairaine became a real threat they slept huddled together like puppies of necessity glad of the shared body warmth on cold nights the interior of the low tent was dim when she ducked inside lamp oil and candles were in short supply and not wasted on gaishain only alliandre was there lying facedown on her blankets in her collar with a damp cloth dipped in an herbal infusion over her bruised bottom at least the wise ones were as willing to give their healing herbs to gaishain as to shaido alliandre had done nothing wrong but had been named as one of the five who had pleased sevanna least yesterday unlike some she had done quite well while being punished doirmanes had begun weeping even before he was bent over the chestbut she seemed to be among those chosen out every three or four days being a queen did not teach you how to serve a queen but then maighdin was picked nearly as often and she was a ladys maid if not a very skilled one faile herself had only been chosen once it was a measure of how alliandres spirits had fallen that she made no move to cover herself only raised up on her elbows still she had combed her long hair if she failed to do that faile would know the woman had reached bottom did anything strange happen to you just now my lady she asked fear strong in her unsteady voice it did faile said standing crouched under the ridgepole i dont know what it was meira doesnt know what it was i doubt any of the wise ones do but it didnt harm us of course it had not harmed them of course not and it changes nothing in our plans yawning she unfastened the wide golden belt and dropped it on her blankets then grasped her outer robe to pull it over her head alliandre put her head down on her hands and began weeping quietly well never escape im going to be beaten again tonight i know it im going to be beaten every day for the rest of my life with a sigh faile left her outer robe where it was and knelt to stroke her liege womans hair there were as many responsibilities down as up i have those same fears now and then she admitted softly but i refuse to let them take control i will escape we will escape you have to keep your courage alliandre i know youre brave i know youve dealt with masema and kept your nerve you can keep it now if you try aravine put her head in at the tentflap she was a plain plump woman a noble faile was sure though she never claimed it and despite the dimness faile could see that she was beaming she wore sevannas belt and collar too my lady alvon and his son have something for you it will have to wait a few minutes faile said alliandre had stopped crying but she was just lying there silent and still my lady you wont want to wait for this failes breath caught could it be possible it seemed too much to hope for i can keep my nerve alliandre said raising her head to gaze at aravine if what alvon has is what i hope it is ill keep my nerve if sevanna has me put to the question snatching up her beltbeing seen outside without belt and collar both meant punishment almost as severe as for trying to run away faile hurried out of the tent the drizzle had slackened to a misting rain but she pulled up her cowl anyway the rain was still cold alvon was a stocky man overtopped by his son theril a lanky boy both wore mudstained almostwhite robes made of tentcloth theril alvons eldest was only fourteen but the shaido had not believed it because of his height as much as most men in amadicia faile had been ready to trust alvon from the start he and his son were something of legends among the gaishain three times they had run away and each time it had taken the shaido longer to bring them back and despite increasingly fierce punishment on the day they swore fealty they had been planning a fourth attempt to return to the rest of their family neither ever smiled that faile had seen but today smiles wreathed alvons weathered face and therils skinny one alike what do you have for me faile asked hastily fastening her belt around her waist she thought her heart was going to pound its way out of her chest it was my theril my lady alvon said a woodcutter he spoke with a coarse accent that made him barely intelligible he was just walking by see and there was nobody around nobody at all so he ducked in quick like and show the lady theril shyly theril reached into his wide sleevethe robes usually had pockets sewn in thereand drew out a smooth white rod that looked like ivory about a foot long and as slim as her wrist looking around to see if anyone was watchingthe street was empty save for them for the moment at leastfaile took it quickly and pushed it up her own sleeve to tuck into the pocket there the pocket was just deep enough to keep it from falling out but now that she had the thing in hand she did not want to let go of it it felt like glass and was distinctly cool to the touch cooler than the morning air perhaps it was an angreal or a terangreal that would explain why galina wanted it if not why she had not taken it herself hand buried in her sleeve faile gripped the rod hard galina was no longer a threat now she was salvation you understand alvon that galina may be unable to take you and your son with her when she leaves she said she has only promised that to me and those captured with me but i promise you that i will find a way to free you and everyone who has sworn to me all the rest too if i can but those above all under the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth i swear it how she had no idea short of calling on her father for an army but she would do it the woodcutter made as if to spit then glanced at her and his face colored he swallowed instead that galina aint going to help nobody my lady says shes aes sedai and all but shes that theravas plaything if you ask me and that therava aint never going to let her go anyways i know if we can get you free youll come back for the rest of us no need for you to swear and all that you said you wanted the rod if anybody could lay hands on it without getting caught and theril got it for you thats all i want to be free theril said suddenly but if we get anybody free then weve beaten them he looked surprised that he had spoken and blushed deep red his father frowned at him then nodded thoughtfully very well said faile told the boy gently but i made my oath and i stand by it you and your father she cut off as aravine looking past her shoulder laid a hand on her arm the womans smile had been replaced by fright turning her head faile saw rolan standing beside her tent a good two hands taller than perrin he wore his shoifa coiled around his neck with the black veil hanging down his broad chest rain slicked his face and made his short red hair cling to his scalp in curls how long had he been there not long or aravine would have noticed him before the tiny tent offered little concealment alvon and his son had their shoulders hunched as if they were thinking about attacking the tall meradin that was a very bad idea mice attacking a cat was not in it as perrin would have said go on about your duties alvon she said quickly you too aravine go on now aravine and alvon had sense enough not to offer courtesies before leaving with final worried glances at rolan but theril half raised a hand toward knuckling his forehead before catching himself blushing he scurried away after his father rolan came out from beside the tent to stand in front of her oddly he had a small bunch of blue and yellow wildflowers in one hand she was very conscious of the rod she was holding in her sleeve where was she to hide it once therava discovered it missing she likely would turn the camp upside down you must be careful faile bashere rolan said smiling down at her alliandre called him not quite pretty but faile had decided she was wrong those blue eyes and that smile made him very nearly beautiful what you are about is dangerous and i may not be here to protect you much longer dangerous she felt a chill in her middle what do you mean where are you going the thought of losing his protection made her stomach lurch few of the wetlander women had escaped the attentions of shaido men without him some of us are thinking of returning to the threefold land mis smile faded we cannot follow a false caracani and a wetlander at that but perhaps we will be allowed to live out our lives in our own holds we think on it we have been a long time from home and these shaido sicken us she would find a way to deal with it once he was gone she would have to somehow and what am i doing that is dangerous she tried to make her voice light but it was difficult light what would happen to her without him these shaido are blind even when they are not drunk faile bashere he replied calmly pushing her cowl back he tucked one of the wildflowers into her hair above her left ear we meradin use our eyes another wildflower went into her hair on the other side you have made many new friends lately and you are planning to escape with them a bold plan but dangerous and will you tell the wise ones or sevanna she was startled when that came out in an even tone her stomach was trying to tie itself into knots why would i do that he asked adding another flower to her decorations jhoradin thinks he will take lacile aldorwin back to the threefold land with him even if she is a treekiller he believes he may convince her to make a bridal wreath to lay at his feet lacile had found her own protector by climbing into the blankets of the meradin who had made her gaishain and arrela had done the same with one of the maidens who had captured her but faile doubted that jhoradin would attain his wish both women were focused on escape like arrows aimed at a target and now that i think on it i may take you with me if we go faile stared up at him the rain was beginning to soak through her hair to the waste rolan i love my husband ive told you that and it is true i know he said continuing to add flowers but for the moment you still wear white and what happens while you wear white is forgotten when you put it off your husband cannot hold it against you besides if we go when we come near to a wetlander town i will let you go i should never have made you gaishain in the first place that collar and belt hold enough gold to get you safely back to your husband her mouth fell open in shock it surprised her when her fist struck his wide chest gaishain were never allowed to offer violence but the man just grinned at her you she struck him again harder she beat at him you i cant think of a word bad enough you let me think you were going to abandon me to these shaido while all along you were meaning to help me escape finally he caught her fist and held it easily with a hand that enveloped hers completely if we go faile bashere he laughed the man laughed it is not decided anyway a man cannot let a woman think he is too eager again she surprised herself this time by beginning to laugh and cry at the same time so hard that she had to lean against him or fall down that bloody aiel sense of humor you are very beautiful with flowers in your hair faile bashere he murmured tucking in another blossom or without them and for the moment you still wear white light she had the rod leaning against her arm so coolly but there was no way to give it to galina until therava let her walk around freely again no way to be sure that the woman would not betray her before then out of desperation rolan offered her escape if the meradin decided to leave but he would continue to try to inveigle her into his blankets so long as she wore white and if the aleradin decided not to go would one of them betray her escape plans if rolan could be believed they all knew hope and danger all tied together inextricably what a tangle she turned out to have been exactly right about theravas reaction just before midday all of the gaishain were herded into the open and made to strip to their skins covering herself as best she could with her hands faile huddled together with other women wearing sevannas belt and collarthey had been made to put those on again straightawayhuddled for a scrap of decency while shaido rummaged through the gaishain tents tossing everything out into the mud all faile could do was think about her hiding place inside the town and pray hope and danger and no way to untangle them chapter six a stave and a razor mat had never really expected luca to leave jurador after only one daythe stonewalled salt town was wealthy and luca did like to see coin stick to his handsso he was not exactly disappointed when the man told him that valan lucas grand traveling show and magnificent display of marvels and wonders would remain there at least two more days not exactly disappointed yet he had hoped that his luck might hold good or his being taveren but then being taveren had never brought anything other than bad that he could see the lines at the entrance are already as long as they were at their best yesterday luca said gesturing expansively they were inside lucas huge gaudy wagon early in the morning after rennas death and the tall man sat in the gilded chair at the narrow tablea real table with stools tucked under for guests most other wagons had an affair rigged on ropes from the ceiling and people sat on the beds to eat luca had not yet donned one of his flamboyant coats but he made up for it with gestures latelle his wife was cooking the breakfast porridge on a small irontopped brick stove built into a corner of the windowless wagon and the air was sharp with spices the harshfaced woman put so many spices into everything she prepared that it was all inedible in mats estimation yet luca always gobbled down whatever she set in front of him as if it were a feast he must have a leather tongue i expect twice as many visitors today maybe three times as many and tomorrow as well people cant see everything in one visit and here they can afford to come twice word of mouth cauthon word of mouth that brings as many as aludras nightflowers i feel almost like a taveren the way things are falling out large audiences and the prospect of more a warrant of protection from the high lady luca cut off abruptly looking faintly embarrassed as if he had just remembered that mats name was on that warrant as being excluded from protection you might not like it if you really were taveren mat muttered which made the other man give him an odd look he put a finger behind the black silk scarf that hid his hanging scar and tugged at it for a moment the thing had felt too tight he had spent a night of bleak dreams about corpses floating downstream and woken to the dice spinning in his head always a bad sign and now they seemed to be bouncing off the inside of his skull harder than before i can pay you as much as youll make for every show you give between here and lugard no matter how many people attend thats on top of what i promised for carrying us to lugard if the show was not stopping all the time they could cut the time to reach lugard by three quarters at the least more if he could convince luca to spend whole days on the road instead of half days the way they did now luca seemed taken with the idea nodding thoughtfully but then he shook his head with a sadness that was plainly feigned and spread his hands and what will that look like a traveling show that never stops to give shows it will look suspicious thats what i have the warrant and the high lady will speak up for me besides but you certainly dont want to pull the seanchan down on us no its safer for you this way the man was not thinking of mat cauthons bloody safety he was thinking that his bloody shows might earn him more than mat paid that plus making himself as much the center of attention as any of the performers was nearly as important to him as gold some of the showfolk talked of what they would do when they retired not luca he intended to keep on until he fell over dead in the middle of a show and he would arrange it so he had the largest audience possible when he did its ready valan latelle said affectionately as she lifted the iron pot from the stove with a cloth protecting her hands and set it down on a thick woven mat on the table two places had already been set with whiteglazed plates and silver spoons luca would have silver spoons when everyone else settled for tin or pot metal or even horn or wood sterneyed with a hard set to her mouth the bear trainer looked quite odd wearing a long white apron over her spangled blue dress her bears probably wished they had trees to climb when she frowned at them strangely though she jumped to ensure her husbands comforts will you be eating with us master cauthon there was no welcome in that in tact just the opposite and she showed no sign of turning to the cupboard where the plates were stored mat gave her a bow that soured her face further he had never been less than civil to the woman but she refused to like him i thank you for the kind invitation mistress luca but no she grunted so much for being courteous he put on his flatbrimmed hat and left the dice rattling away lucas big wagon glittering in red and blue and covered with golden stars and comets not to mention the phases of the moon in silver stood in the middle of the show as far as possible from the animals smelly cages and the horselines it was surrounded by smaller wagons little houses on wheels most windowless and most painted just a single color with none of lucas extra decorations and by walltents the size of small houses in blue or green or red sometimes striped the sun stood nearly its own height above the horizon in a sky where a sprinkling of white clouds drifted slowly and children ran playing with hoops and balls while the showfolk were limbering up for their morning performances men and women twisting and stretching many with glittering colorful spangles on their coats or dresses four contortionists in filmy trousers tied at the ankle and blouses thin enough to leave little to the imagination made him wince two were sitting on their own heads atop blankets spread on the ground beside their red tent while the others had twisted themselves into a pair of knots that looked beyond untying their backbones must have been made of springwire petra the strongman stood barechested beside the green wagon he shared with his wife warming up by lifting weights with either hand that mat was not sure he could have lifted with both the man had arms thicker than mats legs and he was not sweating at all clarines small dogs stood in a line at the steps of the wagon wagging their tails and eagerly waiting on their trainer unlike latelles bears mat figured the plump womans dogs performed so they could make her smile he was always tempted to just sit quietly somewhere when the dice were clicking in his head some place nothing seemed likely to happen waiting for the dice to stop and though he would have enjoyed watching some of the female acrobats a number of whom wore as little as the contortionists he set out to walk the half mile to jurador eyeing everyone on the wide hardpacked clay road closely there was a purchase he hoped to make people were coming to join the long line waiting behind a stout rope stretched along the shows tall canvas wall only a handful with more than a touch of embroidery on the womens dresses or the mens short coats and a few farmers highwheeled carts lumbering behind a horse or an ox figures moved among the small forest of windmills that pumped the salt wells on the low hills behind the town and around the long evaporation pans a merchants train of canvascovered wagons twenty of them behind sixhorse teams rumbled out of the town gates as he approached the merchant herself in a bright green cloak seated beside the driver of the first wagon a flock of crows cawed past overhead giving him a chill but no one vanished before his eyes and everybody cast a long shadow so far as he could make out there were no dead peoples shades walking the road today although he was convinced that was what he had seen the day before the dead walking surely could mean nothing good very likely it had something to with tarmon gaidon and rand colors whirled in his brain and for an instant in his head he saw rand and min standing beside a large bed kissing he stumbled and nearly tripped over his own boots they had not been wearing any clothes he would have to be careful thinking about rand the colors swirled and resolved for a moment and he stumbled again there were worse things to spy on than kissing very careful what he thought light the pair of guards leaning on their halberds at the ironstudded gates hardfaced men in white breastplates and conical white helmets with horsetail crests eyed him suspiciously they probably thought he was drunk a reassuring nod failed to change their expressions by a hair he could have used a stiff drink right then the guards did not try to stop him entering though just watched him pass drunks caused trouble especially a man who was drunk this early in the day but a drunk in a good coatplain but wellcut and good silka man with a little lace at his wrists was an altogether different matter the stonepaved streets of jurador were noisy even at this hour with hawkers carrying trays or standing behind barrows crying their wares and shopkeepers beside narrow tables in front of their shops bellowing the fineness of their goods and coopers hammering hoops onto barrels for shipping salt the clatter of rugmakers looms nearly drowned out the ringing of the occasional blacksmiths hammer not to mention the music of flutes and drums and dulcimers drifting from inns and taverns it was a jumble of a town with shops and houses and inns cheek by jowl with taverns and stables all of stone and roofed with reddish tiles a solid town jurador and one accustomed to thievery most windows on the lower floors were covered with stout screens of wrought iron the upper windows as well on the homes of the wealthy most of whom were no doubt salt merchants the music of the inns and taverns pulled at him likely there would be dice games going on in most of them he could almost feel those dice spinning across a table it had been too long since he had rattled a set of dice in his hands instead of inside his head but he was not there for gambling this morning he had had no breakfast yet so he approached a wrinkled woman with a tray hung from a strap around her neck who shouted meat pies made from the finest beef to be found in altara he took her word for it and handed over the coppers she demanded he had seen no cattle at any farms near jurador only sheep and goats but it was best not to inquire too closely what was in a pie bought in the streets of any town there could be cows on nearby farms there could be in any case the meat pie was tasty and still hot for a wonder and he walked on along the crowded street juggling the pie and wiping greasy juice from his chin he was careful not to bump into anyone in the throng altarans were a touchy lot by and large in this town you could tell somebodys station to within a whisker by the amount of embroidery on coat or dress or cloak the more the higher long before you were close enough to tell wool from silk though the richer women covered their oliveskinned faces with transparent veils hung from ornate combs stuck into their tightly coiled braids but men and women alike whether salt merchants or ribbon hawkers wore long belt knives with curved blades and sometimes fondled the hilts as though looking for a fight he always tried to avoid fighting though his luck seldom did him much good there taveren took over with that it seemed the dice had never before signaled a fightbattles yes but never a dustup in the streetyet he walked very carefully indeed not that that would help of course when the dice stopped they stopped and that was that but he saw no reason to take chances he hated taking chances except with gambling of course and that was hardly taking a chance for him he spotted a barrel full of thick quarterstaffs and walking staffs in front of a shop displaying swords and daggers under the watchful eye of a bulky fellow with sunken knuckles a nose that had been broken more than once and a thick truncheon hanging at his belt beside the inevitable dagger the man announced in a rough voice that all the blades on display were andoran made but anybody who did not make his own blades always claimed they were andoran or else from the borderlands or tairen sometimes tear made good steel to mats surprise and delight a slim stave of what appeared to be black yew more than a foot taller than he was stood upright in the barrel pulling the stave out he checked the fine almost braided grain it was black yew all right that braided grain was what gave bows made from it such power twice what any other wood could give you could never be sure until you started slicing away the excess but the stave looked perfect how in the light had black yew come to be in southern altara he was sure it only grew in the two rivers when the proprietor a sleek woman with brightfeathered birds embroidered to below her bosom came out and began extolling the virtues of her blades he said how much for this black stick mistress she blinked startled that a man in silk and lace wanted a quarterstaffslim as it was she bloody well thought the bloody thing was a quarterstaffand named a price that he paid without bargaining which made her blink again and frown as if she thought she should have asked for more he would have paid more for the makings of a two rivers bow with the raw bowstave over his shoulder he walked on wolfing down the last of the meat pie and wiping his hand on his coat but he had not come for breakfast or a bowstave any more than for gambling it was the stables that interested him livery stables always had a horse or three for sale and if the price was right they would usually sell one that had not been for sale at least they did when the seanchan had not snapped them up already luckily the seanchan presence in jurador had been fleeting so far he wandered from stable to stable examining bays and roans blue roans and piebalds duns sorrels blacks whites grays and dapples all mares or geldings a stallion would not serve his purposes not every animal he looked at had a shallow girth or long cannons yet none matched what he had in mind until he entered a narrow stable jammed between a large stone inn called the twelve salt wells and a rugmakers shop he would have thought the racketing looms would have bothered the horses but they were all quiet apparently accustomed to the noise stalls stretched farther into the block than he had expected but lanterns hanging from the stall posts gave a fair light away from the doors the air speckled with dust from the loft above smelled of hay and oats and horse dung but not old dung three men with shovels were mucking out stalls the owner kept his place clean that meant less chance of disease some stables he had walked out of after getting one whiff the blackandwhite mare was out of her stall on a rope halter while a groom put down fresh straw and she stood squarely and with her ears perked forward showing alertness about fifteen hands tall she was long in front with a deep girth that promised endurance and her legs were perfectly proportioned with short cannons and a good angle to her fetlocks her shoulders were well sloped and her croup dead level with her whithers she had lines as good as pips or even better more than that she was a breed he had heard tell of but never thought to see a razor from arad doman no other breed would have that distinctive coloring in her coat black met white in straight lines that could have been sliced by a razor hence the name her presence here was as mystifying as the black yew he had always heard no domani would sell a razor to any outlander he let his eyes sweep past her without lingering studying the other animals in their stalls had the dice inside his skull slowed no it was his imagination he was sure they were spinning as hard as they had in lucas wagon a wiry man with only a fringe of gray hair remaining came forward ducking his head over folded hands toke fearnim my lord he introduced himself in rough accents eyeing the bowstave on mats shoulder dubiously men who wore silk coats and gold signet rings rarely carried such things how can i be of service my lord wishes to rent a horse or to buy embroidery small bright flowers covered the shoulders of the vest he wore over a shirt that might have been white once mat avoided looking at the flowers at all the fellow had one of those curved knives at his belt and two long white scars on his leathery face old scars any fighting he had done lately had not marked him where it showed buy master fearnim if you have anything for sale if i can find one thats halfway decent ive had more spavined gluebaits offered to me as sixyearolds when they were eighteen if a day than i can shake a stick at he hefted the bowstave slightly with a grin his da claimed bargaining went better if you could make the other fellow start grinning i have three for sale my lord none of them spavined the wiry man replied with another bow and no hint of a grin fearnim gestured one is out of her stall there five years old and prime horseflesh my lord and a steal at ten crowns gold he added blandly mat let his jaw drop for a pkbalcfi i know the seanchan have driven prices up but thats ridiculous oh shes not your common piebald my lord a razor is what she is domani bloodborn ride razors blood and bloody ashes so much for catching a bargain so you say so you say mat muttered lowering one end of the bowstave to the stone floor so he could lean on it his hip seldom bothered him any longer except when he did a lot of walking but he had done so this morning and he felt twinges well bargain or no he had to play out the game there were rules to horse trading break them and you were asking to have your purse emptied out ive never heard of any horse called a razor myself what else do you have only geldings or mares mind geldings are all i have for sale except the razor my lord fearnim said emphasizing the word razor a little turning toward the back of the stable he shouted adela bring out that big bay whats for sale a lanky young woman with a pimply face in breeches and a plain dark vest came darting out of the back of the stable to obey fearnim had adela walk the bay and then a dappled gray on rope leads in the good light near the doors mat had to hand him that their conformation was not bad at all but the bay was too big better than seventeen hands and the gray kept his ears half laid back and tried to bite adelas hand twice she was deft with the animals though easily evading the badtempered grays lunges rejecting the pair of them would have been easy even if he had not had his mind set on the razor a lean graystriped tomcat like a ridgecat in miniature appeared and sat at fearnims feet to lick a bloody gash on his shoulder rats are worse this year than i ever recall the stablekeeper muttered frowning down at the cat they fight back more too im going to have to get another cat or maybe two he brought himself back to the business at hand will my lord take a look at my prize since the others dont suit i suppose i could look at the piebald master fearnim mat said doubtfully but not for any ten crowns in gold fearnim said hurd walk the razor for the lord here he emphasized the breed again working the man down would be difficult unless he got some help for a change from being taveren his luck never helped with anything as straightforward as dickering hurd was the fellow refreshing the straw in the razors stall a squat man who had about three white hairs left on his head and no teeth in his mouth at all that was evident when he grinned which he did while he led the mare in a circle he clearly liked the animal and well he should she walked well but mat still inspected her closely her teeth said fearnim had been honest enough about her ageonly a fool lied very far about a horses age unless the buyer was a fool himself though it was surprising how many sellers thought buyers were all just that and her ears pricked toward him when he stroked her nose while checking her eyes they were clear and bright free of rheum he felt along her legs without finding any heat or swelling there was never a hint of a lesion or sore or of ringworm anywhere on her he could get his fist easily between her rib cage and her elbowshe would have a long strideand was barely able to fit his flat hand between her last rib and the point of her hip she would be hardy unlikely to strain a tendon if run fast my lord knows his horseflesh i see that i do master faernim and ten crowns gold is too much especially for a piebald some say theyre bad luck you know not that i believe it not as such or i wouldnt offer at all bad luck i never heard that my lord what do you offer i could get tairen bloodstock for ten crowns gold not the best true but still tairen ill give you ten crowns in silver fearnim threw back his head laughing uproariously and when he stopped they settled down to the dickering in the end mat handed over five crowns in gold along with four marks gold and three crowns silver all stamped in ebou dar there were coins from many countries in the chest under his bed but foreign coin usually meant finding a banker or money changer to weigh them and work out what they were worth locally aside from attracting more notice than he wanted he would have ended paying more for the animal maybe even the full ten crowns gold money changers scales always seemed to work that way he had not expected to get the man down that far but from fearnims expression grinning at last he had never expected to receive so much it was the best way for horse trading to end with both sides thinking they had come out ahead all in all the day had begun very well dice or no bloody dice he should have known it would not last when he got back to the show at midday riding the razor bareback because of his aching hip and with the dice rattling in his head the line of people was longer than when he had left waiting to pass beneath the big blue banner stretched between two tall poles that carried the shows name in big red letters as people dropped their coins into the clear glass pitcher held by a heavyset horse handler in a rough woolen coat to be poured from there into an ironbound chest under the watchful eyes of another horse handler who was even larger more people joined the line so it never seemed to grow shorter the thing stretched beyond the end of the rope and around the corner for a small wonder no one was pushing or shoving there were obvious farmers in the line wearing rough woolens and with dirt ingrained in their hands though the childrens faces and those of the farmwives at least had been scrubbed clean luca was getting his hopedfor crowd unfortunately no chance of convincing him to leave tomorrow now the dice said something was going to happen something fateful to mat bloody cauthon but what there had been times when the dice stopped and he still had no idea what happened just inside the canvas wall with people streaming past to enjoy the performers lining both sides of the main street aludra was taking delivery of two wagonloads of barrels in various sizes of more than the barrels it seemed i will show you where to park the wagons the slender woman told the driver of the lead wagon a lean man with a jutting jaw aludras waistlong beaded braids swung as her eyes followed mat for a moment but she quickly turned back to the wagon driver the horses you will take to the horselines afterward yes now what had she bought in such quantity something for her fireworks certainly every night soon after dark so she would catch everyone before they went to bed she launched her nightflowers two or three for a town the size of jurador or if there were several villages close together he had had some thoughts on why she wanted a bellfounder but the only one that seemed to make any sense actually made no sense at all that he could see he hid the mare on the horselines well you could not really hide a razor but a horse was noticed less among other horses and the time was not right yet the bowstave he left in the wagon he shared with egeanin and domon neither of whom was there then headed for tuons faded purple wagon that was parked not far from lucas wagon now though mat wished it had been left near the storage wagons only luca and his wife knew that tuon was a high lady rather than a servant who had been about to expose mat and egeanin to her supposed husband as lovers but many among the showfolk were already wondering why mat spent more time with tuon than with egeanin wondering and disapproving they were an oddly prim lot for the most part even the contortionists running off with the wife of a cruel lord was romantic canoodling with the ladys maid was sordid giving tuons wagon this favored spot among the people who had been with luca for years and were his most prized performers was going to cause more talk in truth he hesitated about going to tuon at all with the dice drumming in his head they had stopped too often in her presence and he still did not know the why for a single one of those times not for certain maybe the first time it had just been meeting her thinking of it made the hair on the back of his neck want to stand up still with women you always had to take chances with a woman like tuon ten chances a day and nevet knowing the odds until it was too late sometimes he wondered why his luck failed to help him more with women women were certainly as unpredictable as any honest dice ever made none of the redarms was on guard outside the wagonthey were beyond that nowso he trotted up the short flight of steps at the back of the wagon and rapped once before pulling the door open and entering after all he paid the rent for the thing and they were hardly likely to be lying around unclothed at this time of day anyway the door had a latch if they needed to keep people out mistress anan was off somewhere but the interior was still crowded the narrow table had been let down on ropes from the ceiling with mismatched plates of bread and olives and cheese laid out on it along with one of lucas tall silver wine pitchers a squat redstriped pitcher and flowerpainted cups tuon a months growth of tightly curled black hair on her head sat on the wagons sole stool at the far end of the table with selucia sitting on one of the beds at her side and noal and olver on the other bed elbows on the table today selucia was in the dark blue ebou dari dress that displayed her memorable bosom so well with a flowered scarf tied around her head but tuon wore a red dress that seemed to be made entirely of tiny pleats light he had only bought her the silk yesterday how had she convinced the shows seamstresses to complete a dress already he was pretty certain that usually took longer than a day with liberal promises of his gold he suspected well if you bought a woman silk you had to expect to pay to have it sewn he had heard that saying as a boy when he never expected to be able to afford silk but it was the lights own truth only the women are ever seen outside their villages noal was saying but the gnarled whitehaired old man cut off when mat entered the wagon pulling the door shut behind him the scraps of lace at noals wrists had seen better days as had his wellcut coat of fine gray wool but both were clean and neat though in truth they looked odd with his crooked fingers and battered face those belonged on an aging tavern tough one who had gone on fighting long past his prime olver in the good blue coat mat had had made for him grinned as widely as an ogier light he was a good boy but he would never be handsome with those big ears and that wide mouth his manner with women needed vast improvement if he was ever to have any luck there at all mat had been trying to spend more time with olver to get him away from the influence of his uncles vanin and harnan and the other redarms and the boy seemed to enjoy that just not as much as he enjoyed playing snakes and foxes or stones with tuon and staring at selucias bosom it was all very well for those fellows to teach olver how to shoot a bow and use a sword and the like but if mat ever learned who was teaching him to leer manners toy tuon drawled like honey sliding out of a dish hard honey around him unless they were playing stones her expression was usually severe enough for a judge handing down a death sentence and her tone matched it you knock then wait for permission to enter unless you are property or a servant then you do not knock you also have grease on your coat i expect you to keep yourself clean olvers grin faded at hearing mat admonished noal raked bent fingers through his long hair and sighed then began studying the green plate in front of him as if he might find an emerald among the olives grim tone or no grim tone mat enjoyed looking at the dark little woman who was to be his wife who was halfway his wife already light all she had to do was say three sentences and the thing was done burn him but she was beautiful once he had mistaken her for a child but that had been because of her size and her face had been obscured by a transparent veil without that veil it was plain that that heartshaped face belonged to a woman her big eyes were dark pools a man could spend a lifetime swimming in her rare smiles could be mysterious or mischievous and he prized them he enjoyed making her laugh too at least when she was not laughing at him true she was a little slimmer than he had always preferred but if he could ever get an arm around her without selucia there he believed she would feel just right and he might convince her to give him a few kisses with those full lips light he dreamed about that sometimes never mind that she called him down as if they were already married well almost never mind burn him if he could see what a little grease mattered lopin and nerim the two serving men he was saddled with would fight over which one got to clean the coat they had little enough to do that they really would if he did not name who received the task he did not say that to her women liked nothing better than making you defend yourself and once you started she had won ill try to remember that precious he said with his best smile sliding in beside selucia and putting his hat down on the other side from her the blanket scrunched up between them and they were a foot apart to boot yet you would have thought he had pressed himself against her hip her eyes were blue but the furious look she gave him was hot enough his coat should have been singed i hope theres more water than wine in that cup in front of olver its goats milk the boy said indignantly ah well maybe olver was still a little too young even for wellwatered wine tuon sat up very straight though she was still shorter than selucia who was a short woman herself what did you call me she said as close to crisply as her accent allowed precious you have a pet name for me so i thought i should have one for you precious pie thought selucias eyes were going to pop right out of her head i see tuon murmured pursing her lips in thought the fingers of her right hand waggled as though idly and selucia immediately slid off the bed and went to one of the cupboards she still took time to glare at him over tuons head very well tuon said after a moment it will be interesting to see who wins this game toy mats smile slipped game he was just trying to regain a little balance but she saw a game and that meant he could lose was likely to since he had no idea what the game was why did women always make things so complicated selucia resumed her place and slid a chipped cup in front of him and a blueglazed plate that held half a loaf of crusty bread six varieties of pickled olives mounded up and three sorts of cheese that perked his spirits again he had hoped for this if not expected it once you got a woman feeding you she had a hard time finding it in herself to stop you from putting your feet under her table again the thing of it is noal said resuming his tale in those ayyad villages you can see woman of any age but no men much above twenty if that not a one olvers eyes grew even wider the boy practically inhaled noals tales about the countries he had seen even the lands beyond the aiel waste swallowed them whole without butter are you any relation to jain charin noal mat chewed an olive and discreetly spat the pit into his palm the thing tasted not far from spoiling so did the next one but he was hungry so he gobbled them down and followed with some crumbly white goat cheese while ignoring the frowns tuon directed at him the old mans face went still as stone and mat had torn off a piece of bread and eaten that as well before noal answered a cousin he said at last grudgingly he was my cousin youre related to jain farstrider olver said excitedly his favorite book was the travels of jain farstrider which he would have sat up reading by lamplight long past his bedtime had juilin and thera allowed he said he intended to see everything farstrider had when he grew up all that and more who is this man with two names tuon asked only great men are spoken of so and you speak as if everyone should know him he was a fool noal said grimly before mat could open his mouth though olver did get his open and left it gaping while the old man continued he went gallivanting about the world and left a good and loving wife to die of a fever without him there to hold her hand while she died he let himself be made into a tool by abruptly noals face went blank staring through mat he rubbed at his forehead as though attempting to recall something jain farstrider was a great man olver said fiercely his hands curled into small fists as though he was ready to fight for his hero he fought trollocs and myrddraal and he had more adventures than anyone else in the whole world even mat he captured cowin gemallan after gemallan betrayed malkier to the shadow noal came to himself with a start and patted olvers shoulder he did that boy that much is to his credit but what adventure is worth leaving your wife to die alone he sounded sad enough to die on the spot himself olver had no answer to that and his face fell if noal had put the boy off his favorite book mat was going to have words with the old man reading was importanthe read himself sometimes he did and he had made sure olver had books he enjoyed standing tuon leaned across the table to rest a hand on noals arm the stern look had vanished from her face replaced by tenderness a wide belt of dark yellow tooled leather cinched her waist emphasizing her slim curves more of his coin spent well coin was always easy to come by for him and if she did not spend it likely he would throw it away on some other woman you have a good heart master charin she gave everybody their bloody names except for mat cauthon do i my lady noal said sounding as though he really wanted to hear an answer sometimes i think whatever he thought sometimes they were not to learn it now the door swung open and juilin put his head into the wagon the tairen thiefcatchers conical red cap was at its usual jaunty angle but his dark face was worried seanchan soldiers are setting up across the road im going to thera shell take a fright if she hears it from anybody else and as quickly as that he was gone again leaving the door swinging chapter seven a cold medallion seanchan soldiers blood and bloody ashes that was all mat needed with the dice spinning his head noal find egeanin and warn her olver you warn the aes sedai and bethamin and seta those five would all be together or at least close by one another the two former suldam shadowed the sisters whenever they left the wagon they all shared light he hoped none of them had gone into the town again that could put a weasel in the chicken yard for sure ill go down to the entrance and try to see whether were in any trouble she wont answer to that name noal muttered sliding out from the table he moved spryly for a fellow who looked to have had half the bones in his body broken one time or another you know she wont you know who i mean mat told him sharply frowning at tuon and selucia this name foolishness was their fault selucia had told egeanin that her name was now leilwin shipless and that was the name egeanin was using well he was not about to put up with that sort of thing not for himself and not for her she had to come to her senses soon or late im just saying noal said come on olver mat slid out after them but before he reached the door tuon spoke no warnings for us to remain inside toy no one left to guard us the dice said he should find hainan or one of the other redarms and plant him outside just to guard against accidents but he did not hesitate you gave your word he said settling his hat on his head the smile he got in reply was worth the risk burn him but it lit up her face women were always a gamble but sometimes a smile could be win enough he saw from the entrance that juradors days without a seanchan presence had come to an end directly across the road from the show several hundred men were taking off armor unloading wagons setting up tents in ordered rows establishing horselines all very efficiently done he saw taraboners with mail veils hanging from their helmets and bars of blue yellow and green painted across their breastplates and men who were clearly infantry stacking long pikes and racking bows much shorter than a two rivers bow in armor painted the same he thought those must be amadicians neither tarabon nor altara ran much to foot and altarans in service to the seanchan had their armor marked differently for some reason there were actual seanchan of course perhaps twenty or thirty that he could see there was no mistaking that painted armor of overlapping plates or those strange insectile helmets three of the soldiers came ambling across the road lean hardbitten men their blue coats with the collars striped greenandyellow were plain enough despite the colors and showed the wear of armor use but no signs of rank not officers then but still maybe as dangerous as red adders two of the fellows could have been from andor or murandy or even the two rivers but the third had eyes tilted like a saldaeans and his skin was the color of honey without slowing they started into the show one of the horse handlers at the entrance gave a shrill threenote whistle that began to echo through the show while the other a squinteyed fellow named bollin pushed the glass pitcher in front of the three price is a silver penny each captain he said with deceptive mildness mat had heard the big man speak in the same tone a heartbeat before he thumped another horse handler over the head with a stool children is five coppers if theys more than waisthigh on me and three if theys shorter but only children as has to be carried gets in free the honeyskinned seanchan raised a hand as if to push bollin out of his way then hesitated his face growing harder if that was possible the other two squared up beside him fists clenched as pounding boots announced the arrival of every man in the show it seemed performers in their flashy garb and horse handlers in coarse wool every man had a club of some sort in his hand including luca in a brilliant red coat embroidered with golden stars to his turneddown boottops and even the barechested petra who possessed the mildest nature of any man mat had ever met petras face was a thunderhead now though light this had the makings of a massacre with these fellows companions not a hundred paces away and all their weapons to hand it was a good place for mat cauthon to take himself out of surreptitiously he touched the throwing knives hidden up his sleeves and shrugged just to feel the one hanging down behind the back of his neck no way to check those under his coat or in his boots without being noticed though the dice seemed like continuous thunder he began to plan how to get tuon and the others away he had to hang onto her a while longer yet before disaster could open the door another seanchan appeared in bluegreenandyellow striped armor but carrying her helmet on her right hip she had the tilted eyes and honeycolored skin and there was a scattering of white in her closecropped black hair she was near a foot shorter than any of the other three and there were no plumes on her helmet just a small crest like a bronze arrowhead at the front but the three soldiers stood up very straight when they saw her now why am i not surprised to find you here at what looks to be the fine beginnings of a riot murel her slurred accent had a twang in it whats this all about then we paid our money standardbearer the honeyskinned man replied in the same twangy accents then they said we had to pay more on account of us being soldiers of the empire bollin opened his mouth but she silenced him with a raised hand she had that kind of presence running her eyes over the men gathered in a thick semicircle with their clubs and pausing a moment to shake her head over luca she settled on mat did you see what happened i did mat replied and they tried to walk in without paying thats good for you murel she said getting a surprised blink from the man good for all three of you means you wont be out your coin because youre all confined to camp for ten days and i doubt this show will be here that long youre all docked ten days pay as well youre supposed to be unloading wagons so the homefolks dont get the idea we think were better than they are or do you want a charge of causing dissension in the ranks the three men paled visibly apparently that was a serious charge i didnt think so now get out of my sight and get to work before i make it a full month instead of a week yes standardbearer they snapped out as one then ran back across the road as hard as they could go while tugging off their coats hard men yet the standardbearer was harder she was not finished however luca stepped forward bowing with a grand flourish but she cut off whatever thanks he was about to offer i dont much like fellows threatening my men with cudgels she drawled resting her free hand on her sword hilt not even murel not at these odds still shows you have backbone any of you fine fellows want a life of glory and adventure step across the road with me and ill sign you up you there in that fancy red coat you have the look of a born lancer to me ill wager i can whip you into a proper hero in no time a ripple of headshaking ran through the assembled men and some seeing that no trouble was likely now began slipping away petra was one of those luca looked as though he had been poleaxed a number of others appeared almost as stunned by the offer performing paid better than soldiering and you avoided the risk of people sticking swords into you well as long as youre standing here maybe i can convince you not likely youll get rich but the pay is usually on time and there always the chance of loot if the order is given happens now and then the food varies but its usually hot and theres usually enough to fill your belly the days are long but that just means youre tired enough to get a good nights sleep when you dont have to work the night too anyone interested yet luca gave himself a shake thank you captain but no he said sounding halfstrangled some fools thought soldiers were flattered by someone thinking they had a higher rank than they did some fool soldiers were excuse me if you please we have a show to put on and people who arent going to be pleased if they have to wait much longer to see it with a last wary look at the woman as if he feared she might try to drag him off by his collar he rounded on the men behind him all of you get back to your stands what are you doing lounging around here i have everything well in hand get back to your stands before people start demanding their money back that would have been a disaster in his book given the choice between handing back coin and having a riot luca would have been unable to decide which was worse with the showfolk dispersing and luca hurrying away while shooting glances at her over his shoulder the woman turned to mat the only man remaining aside from the two horse handlers and what about you from the look of you you might be made an officer and get to give me orders she sounded amused by the notion he knew what she was doing the people in the line had seen three seanchan soldiers sent running and who could say for sure why they had run but now they had seen her disperse a much larger crowd by herself he would have given her a place in the band as a bannerman in a breath id make a terrible soldier standardbearer he said tipping his hat and she laughed as he turned away he heard bollin saying mildly you didnt hear what i told that man its a silver penny for you and another for your goodwife coins clinked into the pitcher thank you things were back to normal and the dice were still racketing in his head making his way through the show where acrobats were again tumbling for the crowds on their wooden platforms and jugglers juggling and clarines dogs running atop large wooden balls and miyoras leopards standing on their hind legs inside a cage that looked barely strong enough to hold them he decided to check on the aes sedai the leopards brought them to mind the common soldiers might spend the day working yet he would have laid coin on at least some of the officers coming for a look before long he trusted tuon strangely enough and egeanin had enough sense to stay out of sight when there might be other seanchan around but common sense seemed in short supply among aes sedai even teslyn and edesina who had spent time as damane took foolish chances joline who had not seemed to think herself invulnerable everybody in the show knew the three women were aes sedai now but their large wagon covered with rainstreaked whitewash still stood near the canvastopped storage wagons not far from the horselines luca had been willing to rearrange his show for a high lady who gave him a warrant of protection but not for aes sedai who put him at risk with their presence and were practically penniless besides the women among the showfolk were sympathetic to the sisters for the most part the men wary to one degree or anotherit was almost always so with aes sedaibut luca likely would have turned them out to make their own way without mats gold aes sedai were more threat than anything else so long as they were in lands controlled by the seanchan mat cauthon got no thanks for it not that he was looking for any he would have settled for a touch of respect unlikely as that was aes sedai were aes sedai after all jolines warders blaeric and fen were nowhere to be seen so there was no need to talk his way past them to get inside but as he approached the dirtstreaked steps at the back of the wagon the foxhead medallion hanging beneath his shirt went icy cold against his chest then colder still for a moment he froze like a statue those fool women were channeling in there coming to himself he pounded up the steps and banged the door open the women he expected to see were all present joline a green sister slender and pretty and bigeyed and teslyn a narrowshouldered red who looked as though she chewed rocks and edesina a yellow handsome rather than pretty with waves of black hair spilling to her waist he had saved all three from the seanchan had gotten teslyn and edesina out of the damam kennels themselves yet their gratitude was variable to say the best bethamin as dark as tuon but tall and nicely rounded and yellowhaired seta had been suldam before they were forced into helping rescue the three aes sedai the five of them shared this wagon the aes sedai to keep an eye on the former suldam the former suldam to keep an eye on the aes sedai none realized their task but mutual distrust made them carry it out assiduously the one woman he had not expected to see was setalle anan who had kept the wandering woman in ebou dar before she decided to make herself part of that rescue for some reason but then setalle had a way of pushing herself in of meddling in fact she meddled between him and tuon incessantly what they were doing was completely unexpected though in the middle of the wagon bethamin and seta were standing rigid as fence posts jammed shouldertoshoulder between the two beds that could not be raised against the walls and joline was slapping bethamins face again and again first with one hand then the other silent tears trickled down the tall womans cheeks and seta looked afraid that she would be next edesina and teslyn arms folded beneath their breasts were watching with no expression whatsoever while mistress anan frowned her disapproval over teslyns shoulder whether disapproval of the slapping or of what bethamin had done to earn it he could not have said and did not care crossing the floor in one stride he seized jolines upraised arm and spun her around what in the light are you that was as far as he got before she used her other hand to catch him a buffet so hard that his ears rang now that killed the goat he said and spots still floating in his vision he dropped down onto the nearest bed and pulled a surprised joline across his lap his right hand landed on her bottom with a loud smack that pulled a startled squawk from her the medallion went colder still and edesina gasped when nothing happened but he tried to keep one eye on the other two sisters and one on the open door for jolines warders while he held her in place and whacked as fast and as hard as he could with no idea how many shifts or petticoats she was wearing under that worn blue wool he wanted to make sure he left an impression it seemed his hand was beating time for the dice spinning in his head struggling and kicking joline began cursing like a wagon driver as the medallion seemed to turn to ice and then to grow so cold he wondered if it would give him frostbite but he soon added wordless yelps to her pungent vocabulary his arm might not match petras but he was far from weak practice with bow and quarterstaff gave you strong arms edesina and teslyn seemed as frozen in place as the two wideeyed former mldamwell bethamin was grinning yet she appeared as amazed as setabut just as he began to think jolines yelps were outnumbering her curses mistress anan tried to push past the two aes sedai astonishingly teslyn made a peremptory gesture for her to remain where she was very few women or men argued with an aes sedais commands but mistress anan gave the red sister a frosty look and squeezed between the two aes sedai muttering something that made both of them eye her curiously she still had to force her way between bethamin and seta and he took advantage of that to land a final flurry of hard smacks then rolled the green sister off his lap his hand had begun to sting anyway joline landed with a thump and let out a gasped oh planting herself in front of him close enough that she interfered with jolines hasty scramble to her feet mistress anan studied him with her arms folded beneath her breasts in a way that increased the generous cleavage displayed by her plunging neckline despite the dress she was not ebou dari not with those hazel eyes but she had large golden hoops in her ears a marriage knife the hilt marked with red and white stones for her sons and daughters dangling from a wide silver collar around her neck and a curved dagger thrust behind her belt her dark green skirts were sewn up on the left side to show red petticoats with touches of gray in her hair she was every inch the stately ebou dari innkeeper sure of herself and accustomed to giving orders he expected her to upbraid himshe was as good as an aes sedai when it came to upbraidingso he was surprised when she spoke sounding very thoughtful joline must have tried to stop you and teslyn and edesina as well but whatever they did failed i think that means you possess a terangreal that can disrupt flows of the power ive heard of such thingscadsuane melaidhrin supposedly had one or so rumor said but ive never seen the like i would very much like to i wont try to take it away from you but i would appreciate seeing it how do you know cadsuane joline demanded attempting to brush off the seat of her skirt the first brush of her hand brought a wince and she gave over with a glare for mat just to show him she still had him in mind tears glistened in her big brown eyes and on her cheeks but if he had to pay for them it was worth the price she said something about the test for the shawl edesina said she did say how could you have passed the test for the shawl if you freeze at moments like this teslyn added mistress anans mouth tightened for a moment but if she was discomposed she regained her poise in a breath you may recall that i owned an inn she said dryly many people visited the wandering woman and many of them talked perhaps more than they should have no aes sedai would joline began then turned hurriedly blaeric and fen were starting up the steps borderlanders both they were big men and mat quickly got to his feet ready to use his knives if necessary they might drub him but not without bleeding for it surprisingly joline darted to the door and shut it right in fens face then fastened the latch the saldaean made no effort to open the door but mat had no doubt the pair of them would be waiting when he left when she turned around her eyes were blazing hot tears and all and she seemed to have forgotten mistress anan for the moment if you ever even think of she began shaking a finger at him he stepped forward and stuck a finger of his own to her nose so fast that she jumped back and bumped into the door from which she rebounded with a squeak spots of red blooming in her cheeks he cared not a whisker whether that was anger or embarrassment she opened her mouth but he refused to let her get a word in edgewise except for me youd be wearing a damane collar around your neck and so would edesina and teslyn he said as much heat in his voice as there was in her eyes in return you all try to bully me you go your own way and endanger all of us you bloody well channeled when you know there are seanchan right across the road they could have a damane with them or a dozen for all you know he doubted there was even one but doubt was not certainty and in any case he was not about to share his doubts with her not now well i might have to put up with some of that though youd better know im getting close to my edge but i wont put up with you hitting me you do that again and i vow ill pepper your hide twice as hard and twice as hot my word on it and i wont try to stop him next time if you do mistress anan said nor i teslyn added echoed after a long moment by edesina joline looked as though she had been hit between the eyes with a hammer very satisfactory as long as he could figure out how to avoid having his bones broken by blaeric and fen now would someone like to tell me why you bloody decided to start channeling like it was the last battle do you have to keep holding them like that edesina he nodded at seta and bethamin it was only an educated guess but edesinas eyes widened for a moment as if she thought his terangreal let him see flows of the power as well as stop them in any case an instant later both women were standing normally bethamin calmly began drying her tears with a white linen handkerchief seta sat down on the nearest bed hugging herself and shivering she looked more shaken than bethamin none of the aes sedai seemed to want to answer so mistress anan did it for them there was an argument joline wanted to go see these seanchan for herself and she wouldnt be argued out of it bethamin decided to discipline her just as if she had no clue what would happen the innkeeper shook her head in disgust she tried to pull joline across her lap with seta helping her and edesina wrapped them up in flows of air im assuming she said when the aes sedai all looked at her sharply i may not be able to channel but i do use my eyes that doesnt account for what i felt mat said there was a lot of channeling going on in here mistress anan and the three aes sedai studied him speculatively long stares that seemed to probe for the medallion they were not going to forget about his terangreal that was for sure joline took up the story bethamin channeled ive never before seen the weave she used but for a few moments until she lost the source she had sparks dancing all over the three of us i think she may have used as much of the power as she could draw sobs suddenly racked bethamin she sagged halfway to falling to the floor i didnt mean to she wept shoulders shaking face contorted i thought you were going to kill me but i didnt mean to i didnt seta began rocking back and forth staring at her friend in horror or perhaps her former friend they both knew adam could hold them and maybe any suldam but they might well have denied the full import any woman who could use an adam could learn to channel likely they had tried as hard as they could to deny that hard fact to forget it actually channeling altered everything however burn him this was all he needed on top of everything else what are you going to do about it only an aes sedai could handle this now shes started she cant just stop i know that much let her die teslyn said harshly we can keep her shielded until we can be rid of her then she can die we cant do that edesina said sounding shocked though not apparently at the thought of bethamin dying once we let her go shell be a danger to everyone around her i wont do it again bethamin wept almost pleading i wont pushing past mat as if he were a coatrack joline confronted bethamin staring up at the taller woman with her fists on her hips you wont stop you cant once you begin oh you may be able to go months between attempts to channel but you will try again and again and every time your danger will increase with a sigh she lowered her hands you are much too old for the novice book but theres nothing for it we will have to teach you enough to make you safe at least teach her teslyn screeched planting her fists on her hips i do say let her die do you have any idea how these suldam did treat me when they did have me prisoner no since youve never gone into detail beyond moaning over how horrible it was joline replied dryly then added in very firm tones but i will not leave any woman to die when i can stop it that did not end things of course when a woman wanted to argue she could keep it going if she was by herself and they all wanted to argue edesina joined in on jolines side and so did mistress anan just as if she had as much right to speak as the aes sedai of all things bethamin and seta took teslyns part denying any wish to learn to channel waving their hands and arguing as loudly as anyone wisely mat took the opportunity to slip out of the wagon and pull the door shut behind him softly no need to remind them of him the aes sedai at least would remember soon enough at least he could stop worrying about where the bloody adam were and whether the suldam would try using them again that was well and truly finished now he had been right about blaeric and fen they were waiting at the loot of the steps and stormclouds were not in it for their faces without any doubt they knew exactly what had happened to joline but not who was to blame it turned out what went on in there cauthon blaeric demanded his blue eyes sharp enough to poke holes slightly the taller of the two he had shaved his shienaran topknot and was not best pleased by the growth of short hair covering his scalp were you involved fen asked coldly how could i have been mat replied trotting down the steps as if he had not a care in the world shes aes sedai in case you hadnt noticed if you want to know what happened i suggest you ask her im not woolheaded enough to talk about it ill tell you that only i wouldnt ask her right now theyre all still arguing in there i took the chance to slip out while my hide was still intact not the best choice of words perhaps the two warders faces grew darker still impossible as that seemed but they let him go on his way without having to resort to his knives there was that neither seemed very eager to enter the wagon either instead they settled on the wagons steps to wait more fools they he doubted joline would be very forthcoming with them but she might well take out some of her temper on them because they knew had he been them he would have found tasks to keep him clear of that wagon for oh say a month or two that might help some women had long memories for some things he was going to need to watch over his shoulder for joline himself from now on but it had still been worth it with seanchan camped across the road and aes sedai arguing and women channeling as if they had never heard of the seanchan and the dice spinning in his head not even winning two games of stones from tuon that night could make him feel anything but wary he went to sleepon the floor since it was domons turn to use the second bed egeanin always got the otherwith the dice bouncing off the insides of his skull but he was sure that tomorrow had to be better than today well he had never claimed to always be right he just wished he was not quite so wrong so often chapter eight dragons eggs luca had the showfolk breaking camp taking down the big canvas wall and packing everything into the wagons while the sky was still dark the next morning it was the clatter and banging of it the shouting that woke mat groggy and stiff from sleeping on the floor as much as he could sleep for the bloody dice those things gave a man dreams that slaughtered sleep luca was rushing about in his shirtsleeves with a lantern giving orders and likely impeding matters as much as speeding them but petra wide enough to seem squat though he was not all that much shorter than mat paused in hitching the fourhorse team to his and clarines wagon to explain with the waning moon low on the horizon and halfhidden by trees a lantern on the drivers seat gave all the light they had a flickering pool of yellow that was repeated a hundred times and more through the camp clarine was off walking the dogs since they would be spending most of the day inside the wagon yesterday the strongman shook his head and patted the nearest animal patiently waiting for the last straps to be buckled as if the horse had showed signs of nerves maybe he felt edgy himself the night was only cool not really cold yet he was bundled up in a dark coat and had on a knitted cap his wife worried about him falling sick from drafts or the cold and took care that he would not well were strangers everywhere you see and a lot of people think they can take advantage of strangers but if we let one man get away with it ten more will try if not a hundred sometimes the local magistrate or what passes for one will uphold the law for us too but only sometimes because were strangers and tomorrow or the next day well be gone and anyway everybody knows strangers are usually up to no good so we have to stand up for ourselves fight for whats ours if need be once you do that though its time to move along same now as when there were only a few dozen of us with luca counting the horse handlers though in those days wed have been gone as soon as those soldiers left in those days there werent so many coins to be lost by leaving in a hurry he said dryly and shook his head perhaps for lucas greed or perhaps for how large the show had grown before going on those three seanchan have friends or at least companions who wont like their own being faced down that standard bearer did it but you can be sure theyll lay it to us because they think they can hit at us and they cant at her maybe their officers will uphold the law or their rules or whatever like she did but we cant be sure of that what is certain sure though is that those fellows will cause trouble if we stay another day no point to staying when it means fights with soldiers and maybe people hurt so they cant perform and sure trouble with the law one way or another it was the longest speech mat had ever heard from petra and the man cleared his throat as though embarrassed by saying so much well he muttered bending back to the harness luca will want to be on the road soon youll want to be seeing to your own horses mat wanted no such thing the most wonderful thing about having coin was not what you could buy but that you could pay others to do the work as soon as he realized the show was preparing to move he had rousted the four redarms from the tent they shared with chel vanin to hitch the teams for his wagon and tuons do as he instructed with the razor and saddle pips the stout horsethiefhe had not stolen a horse since mat had known him but that was what he was had roused himself long enough to say that he would get up when the others returned then rolled over in his blankets and was snoring again before harnan and the others had their boots half on vanins skills were such that no one voiced any complaint beyond the usual grumbling about the hour and all but harnan would have grumbled if allowed to sleep till noon when those skills were needed he would repay them tenfold and they knew it even fergin the skinny redarm was none too bright except when it came to soldiering but he was plenty smart enough there well smart enough the show left jurador before the sun broke the horizon a long snake of wagons rolling along the wide road through the darkness with lucas lurid monstrosity pulled by six horses at its head tuons wagon came just behind with gorderan driving almost wideshouldered enough to seem a strongman himself and tuon and selucia wellcloaked and hooded squeezed in on either side of him the storage wagons and animal cages and spare horses brought up the tail sentries at the seanchan camp watched them depart silent armored figures in the night marching the camps perimeter not that the camp itself was quiet shadowy forms stood in rigid lines among the tents while loud voices bellowed the rollcall at a steady pace and others answered mat all but held his breath until those regular shouts faded away behind him discipline was a wonderful thing for other men anyway he rode pips alongside the aes sedai wagon near the middle of the long line flinching a little every time the foxhead went cool against his chest which it began to do before they had gone much more than a mile it seemed that joline was wasting no time fergin handling the reins chattered away about horses and women with metwyn both were as happy as pigs in clover but then neither had any idea what was going on inside the wagon at least the medallion only turned cool and barely that they were using small amounts of the power still he disliked being so near any channeling at all in his experience aes sedai carried trouble in their belt pouches and seldom were shy about scattering it never mind who might be in the way no with the dice bouncing inside his head he could have done without aes sedai within ten miles he would have ridden up beside tuon for the chance to talk with her no matter that selucia and gorderan would hear every word but you never wanted a woman thinking you were too eager do that and she either took advantage or else skittered away like a water drop on a hot greased griddle tuon found enough ways to take advantage already and he had too little time for very much in the way of chasing sooner or later she would speak the words that completed the marriage ceremony sure as water was wet but that only made it more urgent for him to find out what she was like which had hardly been easy so far that little woman made a blacksmiths puzzle seem simple but how could a man be married to a woman if he did not know her worse he had to make her see him as something more than toy marriage to a woman with no respect for him would be like wearing a shirt of blackwasp nettles day and night worse still he had to make her care for him or he would find himself forced to hide from his own wife to keep her from making him dacovale and to cap it off he had to do all of that in whatever time remained before he had to send her back to ebou dar a fine stew and doubtless a tasty meal for some hero out of legend a little something to occupy his idle time before he rushed off to perform some great deed only mat bloody cauthon was no bloody hero he still had it to do though and no time or room for missteps it was the earliest start they had made yet but his hopes that the seanchan had frightened luca into moving faster were soon dashed as the sun climbed they passed stone farm buildings clinging to hillsides and occasionally a tiny tile or thatchroofed village nestled beside the road in a surround of stonewalled fields carved out of the forest where men and women stood gaping as the show streamed past and children ran alongside until their parents called them back but in the midafternoon the show reached something larger runnien crossing near a socalled river that could have been waded in fewer than twenty paces without going more than waistdeep despite the stone bridge across it was never a patch on jurador but it possessed four inns each three stories of stone roofed in green or blue tiles and near half a mile of hardpacked dirt between the village and the river where merchants could park their wagons for the night farms with their walled fields and orchards and pastures made a quilt of the countryside for a good league along the road and maybe more beyond the hills to either side of it they certainly covered the hillsides mat could see that was enough for luca ordering the canvas wall erected in the clearing near to the river to make watering the animals easier the man strutted into the village wearing coat and cloak red enough to make mats eyes hurt and so embroidered with golden stars and comets that a tinker would have wept for the shame of donning the garments the huge blueandred banner was stretched across the entrance each wagon in its place the performing platforms unloaded and the wall nearly all up by the time he returned escorting three men and three women the village was not all that far from ebou dar yet their clothing might have come from another country altogether the men wore short wool coats in bright colors embroidered with angular scrollwork along the shoulders and sleeves and dark baggy trousers stuffed into knee boots the women their hair in a sort of coiled bun atop their heads wore dresses nearly as colorful as lucas garments their narrow skirts resplendent with flowers from hem to hips they did all carry long belt knives though with straight blades for the most part and caressed the hilts whenever anybody looked at them that much was the same altara was altara when it came to touchiness these were the village mayor the four innkeepers and a lean leathery whitehaired woman in red the others addressed her respectfully as mother since the roundbellied mayor was as whitehaired as she not to mention mostly bald and none of the innkeepers lacked at least a little gray hair mat decided she must be the village wisdom he smiled and tipped his hat to her as she passed and she gave him a sharp look and sniffed in near perfect imitation of nynaeve oh yes a wisdom all right luca showed them around with wide smiles and expansive gestures elaborate bows and flourishes of his cloak stopping here and there to make a juggler or a team of acrobats perform a little for his guests but his smile turned to a sour grimace once they were safely back on their way and out of sight free admission for them and their husbands and wives and all the children he growled to mat and im supposed to pack up if a merchant comes down the road they werent that blunt but they were clear enough especially that mother darvale as if this flyspeck ever attracted enough merchants to fill this field thieves and scoundrels cauthon country folk are all thieves and scoundrels and an honest man like me is at their mercy soon enough he was toting up what he might earn there despite the complimentary admissions but he never did give over complaining entirely even when the line at the entrance stretched nearly as far as it had in jurador he just added complaining about how much he would have taken in with another three or four days at the salt town it was three or four more days now and likely he would have lingered until the crowds had dwindled to nothing maybe those three seanchan had been taveren work not likely but it was a pleasant way to think of it now that it was all in the past it was that was how they progressed at best a mere two leagues or perhaps three at an unhurried pace and usually luca would find a small town or a cluster of villages that he felt called for a halt or better to say that he felt their silver calling to him even if they passed nothing but flyspecks not worth the labor of erecting the wall they never made as much as four leagues before luca called a halt he was not about to risk having to camp strung out along the road if there was not to be a show luca liked to find a clearing where the wagons could be parked without too much crowding though if driven to it he would dicker with a farmer for the right to stop in an unused pasture and mutter over the expense the whole next day if it cost no more than a silver penny he was tight with his purse strings luca was trains of merchants wagons passed them in both directions making good speed and managing to raise small clouds of dust from the hardpacked road merchants wanted to get their goods to market as quickly as possible now and then they saw a caravan of tinkers too their boxy wagons as bright as anything in the show except for lucas wagon all of them were headed toward ebou dar oddly enough but then they moved as slowly as luca not likely any coming the other way would overtake the show two or three leagues a day and the dice rattled away so that mat was always wondering what lay beyond the next bend in the road or what was catching him up from behind it was enough to give a man hives the very first night outside runnien crossing he approached aludra near her bright blue wagon she had set up a small canvas enclosure eight feet tall for launching her nightflowers and she straightened with a glare when he pulled back a flap and ducked in a closed lantern sitting on the ground near the wall gave enough light for him to see that she was holding a dark ball the size of a large melon runnien crossing was only big enough to merit a single nightflower she opened her mouth all set to chivvy him out not even luca was allowed in here lofting tubes he said quickly gesturing to the metalbound wooden tube as tall as he was and near enough a foot across sitting upright in front of her on a broad wooden base thats why you want a bellfounder to make lofting tubes from bronze its the why i cant puzzle out it seemed a ridiculous ideawith a little effort two men could lift one of her wooden lofting tubes into the wagon that carried them and her other supplies a bronze lofting tube would require a derrickbut it was the only thing that had occurred to him with the lantern behind her shadows hid her expression but she was silent for a long moment such a clever young man she said finally her beaded braids clicked softly as she shook her head her laugh was low and throaty me i should watch my tongue i always get into the trouble when i make promises to clever young men never think i will tell you the secrets that would make you blush though not now you are already juggling two women it seems and me i will not be juggled then im right he was barely able to keep the incredulity from his voice you are she said and casually tossed the nightflower at him he caught it with a startled oath and only dared to breathe when he was sure he had a good grip the covering seemed to be stiff leather with a tiny stub of fuse sticking out of one side he had a little familiarity with smaller fireworks and supposedly those only exploded from fire or if you let air touch what was insidethough he had cut one open once without it going offyet who could say what might make a nightflower erupt the firework he had opened had been small enough to hold in one hand something the size of this nightflower would likely blow him and aludra to scraps abruptly he felt foolish she was not very likely to go throwing the thing if dropping it was dangerous he began tossing the ball from hand to hand not to make up for gasping and all that just for something to do how will casting lofting tubes from bronze make them a better weapon that was what she wanted weapons to use against the seanchan to repay them for destroying the guild of illuminators they seem fearsome enough to me already aludra snatched the nightflower back muttering about clumsy oafs and turning the ball over in her hands to examine the leather surface maybe it was not so safe as he had assumed a proper lofting tube she said once she was sure he had not damaged the thing it will send this close to three hundred paces straight up into the sky with the right charge and a longer distance across the ground if the tube is tilted at an angle but not far enough for what i have in mind a lofting charge big enough to send it further would burst the tube with a bronze tube i could use a charge that would send something a little smaller close to two miles making the slowmatch slower to let it travel that far is easy enough smaller but heavier made of iron and there would be nothing for pretty colors only the bursting charge mat whistled through his teeth seeing it in his head explosions erupting among the enemy before they were near enough to see you clearly a nasty thing to be receiving now that would be as good as having aes sedai on your side or some of those ashaman better aes sedai had to be in danger to use the power as a weapon and while he had heard rumors about hundreds of ashaman rumors grew with every telling besides if ashaman were anything like aes sedai they would start deciding where they were needed and then take over the whole fight he began envisioning how to use aludras bronze tubes and right away he spotted a glaring problem all your advantage was gone if the enemy came from the wrong direction or got behind you and if you needed derricks to move these things these bronze lofting tubes dragons she broke in lofting tubes are for making the nightflowers bloom for delighting the eye i will call them dragons and the seanchan will howl when my dragons bite her tone was grim as sharp stone these dragons then whatever you call them theyll be heavy and hard to move can you mount them on wheels like a wagon or cart would they be too heavy for horses to pull she laughed again its good to see you are more than the pretty face climbing a threestep folding ladder that put her waist nearly level with the top of the lofting tube she set the nightflower into the tube with the fuse down it slid in a little way and stopped a dome above the top of the tube hand me that she told him gesturing to a pole as long and thick as a quarterstaff when he handed it up to her she held it upright and used a leather cap on one end to push the nightflower deeper that appeared to take little effort i have already drawn plans for the dragoncarts four horses could draw one easily along with a second cart to hold the eggs not nightflowers dragons eggs you see i have thought long and hard about how to use my dragons not just how to make them pulling the capped rod from the tube she climbed down and picked up the lantern come i must make the sky bloom a little then i want my supper and my bed just outside the canvas enclosure stood a wooden rack filled with more peculiar implements a forked stick tongs as long as mat was tall other things just as odd and all made of wood setting the lantern on the ground she placed the capped pole in the rack and took a square wooden box from a shelf i suppose now you want to learn how to make the secret powders yes well i did promise i am the guild now she added bitterly removing the boxs lid it was an odd box a solid piece of wood drilled with holes each of which held a thin stick she plucked out one and replaced the lid i can decide what is secret better than that i want you to come with me i know somebody wholl be happy to pay for making as many of your dragons as you want he can make every bellfounder from andor to tear stop casting bells and start casting dragons avoiding rands name did not stop the colors from whirling inside his head and resolving for an instant into randfully clothed thank the lighttalking with loial by lamplight in a woodpaneled room there were other people but the image focused on rand and it vanished too quickly for mat to make out who they were he was pretty sure that what he saw was what was actually happening right that moment impossible as that seemed it would be good to see loial again but burn him there had to be some way to keep those things out of his head and if he isnt interested again the colors came but he resisted and they melted away i can pay to have hundreds cast myself a lot of them anyway the band was going to end up fighting seanchan and most likely trollocs as well and he would be there when it happened there was no getting around the fact try to avoid it how he would that bloody taveren twisting would put him right in the bloody middle so he was ready to pour out gold like water if it gave him a way to kill his enemies before they got close enough to poke holes in his hide aludra tilted her head to one side pursing her rosebud lips who is this man with such power itll have to be a secret between us thorn and juilin know and egeanin and domon and the aes sedai teslyn and joline at least and van in and the redarms but nobody else and i want to keep it that way blood and bloody ashes far too many people knew already he waited for her curt nod before saying the dragon reborn the colors swirled and despite his fighting them again became rand and loial for a moment this was not going to be as easy as it had seemed you know the dragon reborn she said doubtfully we grew up in the same village he growled already fighting the colors this time they nearly coalesced before vanishing if you dont believe me ask teslyn and joline ask thorn but dont do it around anyone else a secret remember the guild has been my life since i was a girl she scraped one of the sticks quickly down the side of the box and the thing sputtered into flame it smelled of sulphur the dragons they are my life now the dragons and revenge on the seanchan bending she touched the flame to a dark length of fuse that ran under the canvas as soon as the fuse caught she shook the stick until the fire went out then dropped it with a crackling hiss the flame sped along the fuse i think me i believe you she held out her free hand when you leave i will go with you and you will help me make many dragons for a moment as he shook her hand he was sure the dice had stopped but a heartbeat later they were rattling again it must have been imagination after all this agreement with aludra might help the band and incidentally mat cauthon stay alive yet it could hardly be called fateful he would still have to fight those battles and however you planned however welltrained your men were luck played its part too bad as well as good even for him these dragons would not change that but were the dice bouncing as loudly he thought not yet how could he be sure never before had they slowed without stopping it had to be his imagination a hollow thump came from inside the enclosure and acrid smoke billowed over the canvas wall moments later the nightflower bloomed in the darkness above runnien crossing a great ball of red and green streaks it bloomed again and again in his dreams that night and for many nights after but there it bloomed among charging horsemen and massed pikes rending flesh as he had once seen stone rent by fireworks in his dreams he tried to catch the things with his hands tried to stop them yet they rained down in unending streams on a hundred battlefields in his dreams he wept for the death and destruction and somehow it seemed that the rattling of the dice in his head sounded like laughter not his laughter the dark ones laughter the next morning with the sun just rising toward a cloudless sky he was sitting on the steps of his green wagon carefully scraping at the bowstave with a sharp knifeyou had to be careful almost delicate a careless slice could ruin all your workwhen egeanin and domon came out strangely they seemed to have dressed with special care in their best such as it was he was not the only one to have bought cloth in jurador but without promises of mats gold to speed them the seamstresses were still sewing for domon and egeanin the blueeyed seanchan woman wore a bright green dress heavily embroidered with tiny white and yellow flowers on the high neck and all down the sleeves a flowered scarf held her long black wig in place domon looking decidedly odd with a head of very short hair and that illianer beard that left his upper lip bare had brushed his worn brown coat till it actually had some semblance of neatness they squeezed past mat and hurried off without a word and he thought no more of it until they returned an hour or so later to announce that they had been into the village and gotten mother darvale to marry them he could not stop himself from gaping egeanins stern face and sharp eyes gave good indications of her character what could have brought domon to marry the woman as soon marry a bear realizing the illianer was beginning to glare at him he hastily got to his feet and made a presentable bow over the bowstave congratulations master domon congratulations mistress domon the light shine on you both what else was he to say domon kept glaring as if he had heard mats thoughts though and egeanin snorted my name is leilwin shipless cauthon she drawled thats the name i was given and the name ill die with and a good name it is since it helped me reach a decision i should have made weeks ago frowning she looked sideways at domon you do understand why i could not take your name dont you bayle no lass domon replied gently resting a thick hand on her shoulder but i will take you with any name you do care to use so long as you be my wife i told you that she smiled and laid her hand atop his and he began smiling too light but the pair of them were sickening if marriage made a man start smiling like dreamy syrup well not mat cauthon he might be as good as wed but mat cauthon was never going to start carrying on like a loon and that was how he ended up in a greenstriped walltent not very large that belonged to a pair of lean domani brothers who ate fire and swallowed swords even thom admitted that balat and abar were good and they were popular with the other performers so finding them places to stay was easy but that tent cost as much as the wagon had everybody knew he had gold to fling about and that pair just sighed over giving up their snug home when he tried to bargain them down well a new bride and groom needed privacy and he was more than glad to give it to them if it meant he did not have to watch them go mooneyed at each other besides he was tired of taking his turn sleeping on the floor in the tent at least he had his own cot every nightnarrow and hard it might be yet it was softer than floorboardsand with only him he had more room than in the wagon even after the rest of his clothes were moved in and stowed in a pair of brassbound chests he had a washstand of his very own a ladderback chair that was not too unsteady a sturdy stool and a table big enough to hold a plate and cup and a pair of decent brass lamps the chest of gold he left in the green wagon only a blind fool would try robbing domon only a madman would try robbing egeanin leilwin if she insisted though he was still certain she would regain her senses eventually after the first night spent close by the aes sedai wagon with the foxhead cool for half the night he had the tent set up facing tuons wagon by dint of making sure that the redarms started raising it before anyone else could claim the space are you placing yourself as my guard now tuon said coolly when she saw the tent for the first time no he replied im just hoping for more glimpses of you that was the lights own truthwell getting away from the aes sedai was part of it but the other was true tooyet the woman waggled her fingers at selucia and the pair of them launched into gales of giggles before recovering themselves and reentering the faded purple wagon with all the dignity of a royal procession women he was not often alone in the tent he had taken on lopin as his bodyservant after naleseans death and the stout tairen with his blocky face and a beard that nearly reached his chest was always popping in to bow his balding head and ask what my lord would enjoy for his next meal or inquire whether my lord had any need of wine or tea or would care for a plate of candied dried figs he had vaguely acquired somewhere lopin was vain over his ability to find delicacies where it seemed there could be none that or he was rifling through the clothes chests to see whether anything needed repair or cleaning or ironing something always did in his estimation though it all looked fine to mat nerim talmanes melancholy bodyservant frequently accompanied him largely because the skinny grayhaired cairhienin was bored mat could not understand how anyone could get bored with not having any work to do but nerim was full of dolorous comments on how poorly talmanes must be faring without him mournfully sighing about five times a day that talmanes must have given his place to another by now and he was ready to wrestle lopin if need be for a share of the cleaning and mending he even wanted his turn blacking mats boots noal dropped by to spin his tall tales and olver to play stones or snakes and foxes when he was not playing with tuon instead thorn came to play stones too and to share rumors he picked up in the towns and villages knuckling his long white mustache over the choicer bits juilin brought his own reports but he always brought amathera as well the former panarch of tarabon was pretty enough for mat to understand why the thiefcatcher was interested with a rosebud mouth just made for kissing and she clung to juilins arm as if she might return some of his feelings but her big eyes always gazed fearfully toward tuons wagon even when they were all inside mats tent and it was still all juilin could do to keep her from dropping to her knees and putting her face to the ground whenever she glimpsed tuon or selucia she did the same with egeanin and with bethamin and seta besides considering that amathera had been dacovale for just a matter of months it fair made mats skin crawl tuon could not really mean to make him dacovale when she was going to marry him could she he soon told them to stop bringing him rumors about rand fighting the colors in his head was too much effort and he lost that fight as often as he won sometimes it was all right but sometimes he caught glimpses of rand and min and it seemed those two were carrying on something awful anyway the rumors were all the same really the dragon reborn was dead killed by aes sedai by ashaman by the seanchan by a dozen other assassins no he was in hiding he was massing a secret army he was doing some fool thing or other that varied village by village and usually inn by inn the one thing that was clear was that rand was no longer in cairhien and nobody had any idea where he was the dragon reborn had vanished it was odd how many of these altaran farmers and villagers and townsfolk seemed worried by that as worried as the merchants passing through and the men and women who worked for them not one of those people knew any more of the dragon reborn than the tales they carried yet his disappearance frightened them thorn and juilin were clear on that until he made them stop if the dragon reborn was dead what was the world to do that was the question that people asked over breakfast in the morning and ale in the evening and likely on going to bed mat could have told them rand was alivethose bloody visions made him sure of thatbut explaining how he knew was another matter even thom and juilin seemed uncertain about the colors the merchants and the others would have thought him a mad man and if they believed that would only scatter rumors about him not to mention likely setting the seanchan to hunting for him all he wanted was the bloody colors out of his head moving into the tent made the showfolk eye him very oddly and small wonder first he had been running off with egearrinleilwin if she insisted on itand domon supposedly was her servant but now she was married to domon and mat was out of the wagon entirely some of the showfolk seemed to think it no more than he deserved for trailing after tuon yet a surprising number offered him sympathy several men commiserated over the fickleness of womenat least they did when they there were no women aroundand some of the unmarried women contortionists and acrobats and seamstresses began eyeing him much too warmly he might have enjoyed that if they had not been so willing to give him smoky looks right in front of tuon the first time that happened he was so startled that his eyes nearly popped tuon seemed to find it amusing of all things she seemed to but only a fool thought he knew what was in a womans head just because she had a smile on her face he continued to dine with her every midday if they were halted and began arriving for his nightly games of stones early so she had to feed him then too lights truth if you got a woman to feed you on a regular basis she was halfway won at least he dined with her when she would let him into the wagon one night he found the latch down and no amount of talking would make her or selucia open the door it seemed a bird had managed to get inside during the day an extremely bad omen apparently and the pair of them had to spend the night in prayer and contemplation to avert some evil or other they seemed to run half their lives according to strange superstitions tuon or selucia either one would make odd signs with their hands if they saw a torn spiderweb with the spider in it and tuon explained to him just as serious as if she were making sense that the sure result of clearing away a spiderweb before shooing the spider out of it was the death of someone close to you within the month they would see a flight of birds circle more than once and predict a storm or draw a finger through a line of marching ants count how long it took for the ants to rejoin their line and predict how many days of fair weather lay ahead and never mind that it did not work out that way oh there was rain three days after the birdscrows disturbingly enoughbut it was nowhere near a storm just a gray drizzling day obviously selucia miscounted with the ants tuon said placing a white stone on the board with that oddly graceful arching of her fingers selucia watching over her shoulder in a white blouse and divided brown skirts nodded as usual she wore a head scarf over her short golden hair even indoors a length of redandgold silk that day tuon was all in brocaded blue silk a coat of odd cut that covered her hips and divided skirts so narrow they seemed to be wide trousers she spent considerable time giving the seamstresses detailed instructions on what she wanted sewn and little of it was much like anything he had ever seen before it was all in seanchan styles he suspected though she had had a few riding dresses sewn that would not draw comment for when she went outside rain pattered softly on the roof of the wagon obviously what the birds told us was modified by the ants it is never simple toy you must learn these things i will not have you ignorant mat nodded as if that made sense and placed his black stone and she called his uneasiness about crows and ravens superstition knowing when to keep your mouth shut was a useful skill around women around men too but more so around women you could be pretty certain what would set a mans eyes on fire talking with her could be dangerous in other ways too what do you know of the dragon reborn she asked him another evening he choked on a mouthful of wine and the whirling colors in his brain dissipated in a fit of coughing the wine was near enough vinegar but even nerim had a hard time finding good wine these days well hes the dragon reborn he said when he could speak wiping wine from his chin with one hand for a moment he saw rand eating at a large dark table what else is there to know selucia refilled his cup smoothly a great deal toy for one thing he must kneel to the crystal throne before tarmon gaidon the prophecies are clear on that but i havent even been able to learn where he is it becomes still more urgent if he is the one who sounded the horn of valere as i suspect the horn of valere he said weakly the prophecies said what its been found then it must have been mustnt it if it was sounded she drawled dryly the reports ive seen from the place where it was blown a place called falme are very disturbing very disturbing securing whoever blew the horn man or woman may be as important as securing the dragon reborn himself are you going to play a stone or not toy he played his stone but he was so shaken that the colors whirled and faded without forming any image in fact he was barely able to eke out a draw from what had seemed a clear winning position you played very poorly toward the end tuon murmured frowning thoughtfully at the board now divided evenly between the control of black stones and white he could all but see her start trying to work out what they had been talking about when his poor play began talking with her was like walking a crumbling ledge across the face of a cliff one misstep and mat cauthon would be as dead as last years mutton only he had to walk that ledge he had no bloody choice oh he enjoyed it in a way the longer he spent with her the more opportunity to memorize that heartshaped face to get it down so he could see her just by closing his eyes but there was always that misstep waiting ahead he could almost see that too for several days after giving her the little bunch of silk flowers he brought her no presents and he thought he was beginning to detect hints of disappointment when he appeared emptyhanded then four days out of jurador just as the sun was peeking over the horizon into a nearly cloudless sky he got her and selucia out of the purple wagon well he just wanted tuon but selucia might as well have been her shadow when it came to trying to separate them he had commented on that once making a joke and both women went on talking as if he had not spoken it was a good thing he knew tuon could laugh at a joke because sometimes she seemed to have no sense of humor at all selucia wrapped in a green wool cloak with the cowl all but hiding her red headscarf eyed him suspiciously but then she nearly always did tuon never bothered with a scarf yet the shortness of her black hair was not so apparent with the hood of her blue cloak up cover your eyes precious he said i have a surprise for you i like surprises she replied placing her hands over her big eyes for an instant she smiled in anticipation but only for an instant some surprises toy that had the sound of a warning selucia stood hard by her shoulder and though the bosomy woman appeared completely at her ease something told him she was as tense as a cat ready to leap he suspected she did not like surprises wait right there he said and ducked around the side of the purple wagon when he returned he was leading pips and the razor both saddled and bridled the mare stepped lively frisking at the prospect of an outing you can look now i thought you might like a ride they had hours the show might as well have been deserted for all the evidence of life among the wagons only a handful had smoke rising from their metal chimneys shes yours he added and stiffened as the words nearly froze in his throat there was no doubt this time he had said the horse was hers and suddenly the dice were not beating so loudly in his head it was not that they had slowed he was sure of that there had been more than one set rattling away one had stopped when he made his agreement with aludra and another when he told tuon the horse was hers that was odd in itselfhow could giving her a horse be fateful for him but light it had been bad enough when he had to worry about one set of dice giving warning at a time how many sets were still bouncing off the inside of his skull how many more fateful moments were waiting to crash down on him tuon went immediately to the razor all smiles as she examined the animal as thoroughly as he had himself she did train horses for fun after all horses and damane the light help him selucia was studying him he realized her face an expressionless mask because of the horse or because he had gone stiff as a post shes a razor he said patting pips blunt nose the gelding had been getting plenty of exercise but the razors eagerness seemed to have infected him domani bloodborn favor razors and its not likely youll ever see another one outside of arad doman what will you name her it is bad luck to name a horse before riding it tuon replied taking the reins she was still beaming her big eyes shone shes a veryfine animal toy a wonderful gift either you have a good eye or you were very lucky i have a good eye precious he said warily she seemed more delighted than even the razor called for if you say so where is selucias mount oh well it had been worth a try a smart man hedged his bets though so a sharp whistle brought metwyn at a trot leading a saddled dapple mat ignored the wide grin that split the mans pale face the cairhienin redarm had been sure he would not get away with leaving selucia behind but there was no need to smirk over it mat judged the dapple gelding ten years old to be gentle enough for seiuciain his memory ladiess maids seldom were more than tolerable ridersbut the woman gave the animal a going over as complete as tuons and when she was done she directed a look at mat that said she would ride the horse so as not to make a bother but she found it decidedly lacking women could compress a great deal into one look once clear of the field where the show was camped tuon walked the razor along the road for a time then took her to a trot and then a canter the surface was hardpacked yellow clay here studded with edges of old paving stones no trouble for a wellshod horse though and he had made sure of the razors shoes mat kept pips even with tuon as much for the pleasure of watching her smile as anything else when tuon was enjoying herself che stern judge was forgotten and pure delight shone on her face not that watching her was easy since seiucia held the dapple between them the yellowhaired woman was a formidable chaperone and by the sidelong glances she gave him her small smiles she very much enjoyed the job of frustrating him at the start they had the road to themselves except for a few farm carts but after a while a tinker caravan appeared ahead of them a line of garishly painted and lacquered wagons rolling slowly southward down the other side of the road with massive dogs trotting alongside those dogs were the only real protection tinkers had the driver of the lead wagon a thing as red as lucas coats trimmed in yellow and with violent greenandyellow wheels to boot halfstood to peer toward mat then sat back down and said something to the woman beside him doubtless reassured by the presence of the two women with mat tinkers were a cautious lot of necessity that whole caravan would whip up their horses and flee a single man they thought meant harm mat nodded to the fellow as the wagons began to pass the lean grayhaired mans highcollared coat was as green as his wagons wheels and his wifes dress was striped in shades of blue most bright enough to suit any of the shows performers the grayhaired man raised his hand in a wave and tuon suddenly turned the razor and galloped into the trees cloak streaming out behind her in a flash seiucia had the dapple darting after her snatching his hat off so as not to lose it mat wheeled pips and followed shouts rose from the wagons but he paid them no mind his attention was all on tuon he wished he knew what she was up to not escape he was sure likely she was just trying to make him tear out his hair if so she was in a fair way for succeeding pips quickly reeled in the dapple and left a scowling selucia behind flailing her mount with the reins bur tuon and the razor kept their lead as the rolling land climbed toward hills startled flights of birds sprang up from beneath both animals hooves coveys of gray dove and of brownspeckled quail sometimes ruffed brown grouse all disaster needed was for the mare to be frightened by one of those the besttrained mount could rear and fall when a bird burst up under hoof worse tuon rode like a madwoman never slowing only swerving from her line where the underbrush lay dense leaping trees toppled by old storms as if she had a clue what lay on the other side well he had to ride like a madman himself to keep up though he winced every time he set pips to jump a tree trunk some were near as thick as he was tall he dug his bootheels into the geldings flanks urging more speed though he knew pips was running as hard as he ever had he had chosen too well in that bloody razor up and up they raced through the forest as abruptly as she had begun her mad dash tuon reined in well over a mile from the road the trees were old here and widely spaced black pines forty paces tall and widespreading oaks with branches that arched down to touch the ground before rising again and could have been sliced crosswise into tables to seat a dozen in comfort thick creepers shrouded halfburied boulders and stone outcrops but aside from that only a few weeds pushed through the mulch oaks that size killed off any lesser undergrowth beneath them your animal is better than he looks the fool woman said patting her mounts neck when he reached her oh she was all innocence just out for a pleasant ride maybe you do have a good eye with the cowl of her cloak fallen down her back her cap of short hair was visible glistening like black silk he suppressed a desire to stroke it burn how good my eye is he growled clapping his hat on he knew he should speak smoothly but he could not have taken the roughness from his voice with a file do you always ride like a moonblinded idiot you could have broken that mares neck before she even got a name worse you could have broken your own i promised to get you home safely and i mean to do just that if youre going to risk killing yourself every time you go riding then i wont let you ride he wished he had those last words back as soon as they left his tongue a man might laugh off a threat like that as a joke maybe if you were lucky but a woman now all he could do was wait for the explosion he expected aludras nightflowers to pale by comparison she raised the hood of her cloak settling it just so she studied him tilting her head first one way then the other finally she nodded to herself i name her akein that means swallow mat blinked that was it no eruption i know a good name it suits her what was she about now the woman almost never did or said what he expected what is this place toy she said frowning at the trees or should i say what was it do you know what did she mean what was this place it was a bloody forest was what it was but suddenly what had seemed a large boulder right in front of him nearly obscured by thick vines resolved into a huge stone head slightly tilted to one side a womans head he thought those smooth roundels were probably meant for jewels in her hair the statue it sat on must have been immense a full span of the thing showed yet only her eyes and the top of her head were out of the ground and that long white stone outcrop with an oak trees roots growing over it was piece of a spiral column all around them now he could make out bits of columns and large worked stones that plainly had been part of some grand structure and what had to be a stone sword two spans long all half buried still ruins of cities and monuments could be found in many places and few even among aes sedai had any idea what they had been opening his mouth to say that he did not know he caught sight through the trees of three tall hills in a row perhaps another mile on the middle hill had a cleft top like a wedge cut cleanly out while the hill on theleft had two and he knew there could hardly be three hills exactly like that anywhere else those hills had been called the dancers when this place had been londaren cor the capital city of eharon the road behind them had been paved then and ran through the heart of the city which had sprawled for miles people had said that the artistry in stone that the ogier had practiced in tar valon they had perfected in londaren cor of course the people of every ogierbuilt city had claimed their own outdid tar valon confirming tar valon as the touchstone he had a number of memories of the citydancing at a ball in the palace of the moon carousing in soldiers taverns where veiled dancers writhed watching the procession of flutes during the blessing of the swordsbut oddly he had another memory of those hills from near enough five hundred years after the trollocs left no stone standing in londaren cor and eharon died in blood and fire why it had been necessary for nerevan and esandara to invade shiota as the land was then he did not know those old memories were fragments however long a time any one covered and full of gaps he had no idea why those hills had been called the dancers either or what the blessing of the swords was but he remembered being an esandaran lord in a battle fought among these ruins and he remembered having those hills in view when he took an arrow through his throat he must have fallen no more than half a mile from the very spot where he sat pips drowning in his own blood light i hate to remember dying he thought and the thought turned to a coal burning in his brain a coal that burned hotter and hotter he remembered those mens deaths not just one but dozens of them heremembereddying toy are you ill tuon brought the mare close and peered up into his face concern filled her big eyes youve gone pale as the moon im right as spring water he muttered she was close enough for him to kiss if he bent his head but he did not move he could not he was thinking so furiously he had nothing left for motion somehow only the light knew the eelfinn had gathered the memories they had planted in his head but how could they harvest memory from a corpse a corpse in the world of men at that he was certain they never came to this side of that twisted doorframe terangreal for longer than minutes at a time a way occurred to him one he did not like not a scrap maybe they created some sort of link to any human who visited them a link that allowed them to copy all of a mans memories after that right up to the moment he died in some of those memories from other men he was whitehaired in some only a few years older than he really was and everything in between but there were none of childhood or growing up what were the odds of that if they had just stuffed him with random bits and pieces likely things they considered rubbish or had done with what did they do with memories anyway they had to have some reason for gathering them beyond giving them away again no he was just trying to avoid where this led burn him the bloody foxes were inside his head right then they had to be it was the only explanation that made sense well you look as if youre about to vomit tuon said backing the razor away with a grimace who in the show would have herbs i have some knowledge there im all right i tell you in truth he did want to sick up having those foxes in his head was a thousand times worse than the dice however hard the dice rattled could the eelfinn see through his eyes light what was he going to do he doubted any aes sedai could heal him of this not that he would trust them to not when it meant leaving off the foxhead there was nothing to be done he would just have to live with it he groaned at the thought cantering up to them selucia gave him and tuon each a quick look as if considering what they might have been up to in their time alone but then she had taken her time in catching up giving them that time that was hopeful next time you can ride this gentle creature and i will ride your gelding she told mat high lady people from those wagons are following us with dogs theyre afoot but they will be here soon the dogs dont bark trained guard dogs then tuon said gathering her reins mounted we can avoid them easily enough no need to try and no use mat told her he should have expected this those people are tinkers tuathaan and theyre no danger to anybody they couldnt be violent if their lives depended on it thats no exaggeration just simple truth but they saw you two go haring off trying to get away from me as it must have seemed and me chasing after now that those dogs have a scent trail the tinkers will follow us all the way back to the show if need be to make sure you two havent been kidnapped or harmed well go meet them to save the time and trouble it was not the tinkers time he cared about luca probably would not care one way or the other if a bunch of tinkers getting in the way delayed the show setting out but mat certainly would selucia scowled at him indignantly and her fingers flew but tuon laughed toy wishes to be commanding today selucia i will let him command and see how he does bloody kind of her they trotted back the way they had comeriding around the fallen trees this time though now and then tuon would gather her reins as if she meant to jump one then give mat a mischievous grin and it was not long before the tinkers came into sight running through the trees behind their huge mastiffs like a flight of butterflies fifty or so men and women in bright colors often in jarring combinations a man might be wearing a redandblue striped coat and baggy yellow trousers tucked into knee boots or a violetcolored coat above red trousers or worse some women wore dresses striped in as many colors as there were colors and even colors mat had no name for while others wore skirts and blouses as varied in hue and as clashing as the mens coats and trousers a fair number had shawls as well to add more colors to the eyescrambling blend except for the grayhaired man who had been driving the lead wagon they all appeared to be short of their middle years he must be the seeker the leader of the caravan mat dismounted and after a moment tuon and selucia did too the tinkers stopped at that calling their clogs to heel the big animals slumped to the ground tongues lolling out and the people came on more slowly none carried so much as a stick and though mat wore no weapons that showed they eyed him warily the men clustered in front of him while the women gathered around tuon and selucia there was no threat in it but as easily as that tuon and selucia were separated from him off where the tinker women could make inquiries suddenly it occurred to him that tuon might think it a fine game to claim he was trying to bother her she and selucia could ride off while he was trying to contend with tinkers crowding around him and pips so he could not climb into the saddle that was all they would do but unless he was willing to fight his way clear they might keep him here for hours maybe to give that pair time to escape the grayhaired man bowed with his hands pressed to his chest peace be on you and yours my lord forgiveness if we intrude but we feared our dogs had frightened the ladies horses mat responded with a bow in the same fashion peace be on you always seeker and on all the people the ladies horses werent frightened the ladies are impetuous at times what were the women saying he tried to eavesdrop but their voices were low murmurs you know something of the people my lord the seeker sounded surprised and had a right to the tuathaan kept away from anywhere larger than a moderatesized village they would seldom encounter anyone in a silk coat only a little mat replied a very little he had memories of meeting tinkers but he himself had never spoken to one before what were those bloody women saying will you answer me a question ive seen a number of your caravans the past few days more than id have expected to and all heading toward ebou dar is there a reason the man hesitated darting a glance toward the women they were still murmuring away and he had to be wondering why their conversation was lasting so long after all it only needed a moment to say yes i need help or the opposite it is the people called seanchan my lord he said finally word is spreading among the people that there is safety where the seanchan rule and equal justice for all elsewhere you understand my lord mat did like the showfolk tinkers were strangers wherever they went and worse strangers with an undeserved reputation for thieverywell they stole no more often than anyone elseand a deserved one for trying to entice young people into joining them and on top of it for tinkers there was no question of fighting back if anybody tried to rob them or chase them away take a care seeker their safety comes at a price and some of their laws are harsh you know what they do with women who can channel thank you for your concern my lord the man said calmly but few of our women ever begin channeling and if one does we will do as we always do and take her to tar valon abruptly the women began laughing great gales and peals the seeker relaxed visibly if the women were laughing mat was not the kind of man who would strike them down or kill them for getting in his way for mats part he scowled there was nothing in that laughter that he liked the tinkers made their departure with more apologies from the seeker for having bothered them but the women kept looking back and laughing behind cupped hands some of the men leaned close as they walked plainly asking questions but the women just shook their heads and looked back again laughing what did you tell them mat asked sourly oh thats none of your business now is it toy tuon replied and selucia laughed oh she bloody cackled she did he decided he was better off not knowing women just purely enjoyed planting needles in a man chapter nine a short path tuon and selucia were not the only women who caused mat trouble of course sometimes it seemed that most of the trouble in his life came from women which he could not understand at all since he always tried to treat them well even egeanin gave her share of grief though it was the smallest share i was right you do think you can marry her she drawled when he asked her for help with tuon she and domon were seated on the steps of their wagon with their arms around each other a trickle of smoke rose from domons pipe it was midmorning on a fine day though gathering clouds threatened rain for later and the performers were putting on their acts for the inhabitants of four small villages that combined perhaps equaled runnien crossing in size mat had no desire to go watch oh he still enjoyed watching the contortionists and better still the female acrobats and tumblers but when you saw jugglers and fireeaters and the like every day just about even miyora and her leopards became well less interesting if not exactly ordinary never you mind what i think egeanin will you tell me what you know of her trying to find out from her is like fishing blindfolded and barehanded in a briar patch trying to catch a rabbit my name is leilwin cauthon dont forget it again she said in tones suitable for giving orders on a ships deck her eyes tried to drive the command home like blue hammers why should i help you you aim too high above yourself a mole yearning for the sun you could face execution for simply saying you want to marry her its disgusting besides ive left all that behind me or its left me she added bitterly domon gave her a onearmed hug if youve left all that behind you what do you care how disgusting my wanting to marry her is there it was out in the open partly at least domon removed the pipe from his mouth long enough to blow a smokering aimed at mats face if she does no want to help you then give over he gave it that same ships deck voice of command egeanin muttered under her breath she appeared to be arguing with herself finally she shook her head no bayle hes right if im cast adrift then i have to find a new ship and a new course i can never return to seanchan so i might as well cut the cable and be done with it what she knew of tuon was mainly rumorit seemed the imperial family lived their lives behind walls even when in plain sight and only whispers of what went on behind those walls escapedyet those were sufficient to make the hair on the back of mats neck stand up his wifetobe had had a brother and a sister assassinated after they tried to have her killed true but still what kind of family went around killing one another the seanchan blood and the imperial family for starters half of her siblings were dead assassinated most of them and maybe the others too some of what egeaninleilwin had to tell was generally known among seanchan and hardly more comforting tuon would have been schooled in intrigue from infancy schooled in weapons and fighting with her bare hands heavily guarded yet expected to be her own last line of defense all of those born to the blood were taught to dissemble to disguise their intentions and ambitions power shifted constantly among the blood some climbing higher others slipping down and the dance was only faster and more dangerous in the imperial family the empressshe started to add may she live forever and halfchoked in swallowing the words then closed her eyes tor a long moment before continuingthe empress had borne many children as every empress did so that among those who survived there would be one fit to rule after her it would not do to have someone who was stupid or a fool ascend the crystal throne tuon was accounted very far from either light the woman he was to marry was as bad as warder and aes sedai wrapped into one and maybe as dangerous he had several conversations with egeaninhe was careful to name her leilwin to her face lest she go for him with her dagger yet he thought of her as egeanintrying to learn more but her knowledge of the blood was largely from the outside looking in and her knowledge of the imperial court by her own admission little better than that of a street urchin in seandar the day he gave tuon the mare he had ridden alongside egeanins wagon having one of those fruitless conversations he had accompanied tuon and selucia for a time but they kept looking at him sideways then exchanging glances and giggling over what they had told the tinker women without a sliver of doubt a man could only take so much of that sort of thing a clever gift that mare egeanin said leaning out from the drivers seat to look up the line of wagons domon was handling the reins she took her turn sometimes but handling a team was not among the skills she had learned on ships how did you know know what he asked she straightened and adjusted her wig he did not know why she continued to wear the thing her own black hair was short but no shorter than selucias about courting gifts among the blood when you are courting someone higher than you a traditional gift is something exotic or rare best of all is if you can connect the gift somehow to one of the recipients pleasures and its well known the high lady loves horses its good youve acknowledged that you dont expect to be her equal too not that this is going to work you understand i dont have a clue why shes still here now youve stopped guarding her but you cant believe shell actually say the words when she marries it will be for the good of the empire not because some layabout like you gave her a horse or made her smile mat ground his teeth to keep from shouting a curse he had acknowledged what no wonder a set of bloody dice had stopped tuon would let him forget this when it snowed on sunday he was certain sure of that if leilwin bloody shipless gave him small griefs the aes sedai managed larger aes sedai liked nothing better he was resigned to them traipsing about every village and town they stopped at asking questions and doing the light knew what else he had no choice but resignation with no way to stop them they claimed to be taking careat least teslyn and edesina did joline snapped that he was a fool for worryingyet an aes sedai taking care was still clearly a woman of consequence whether or not anybody recognized what she was lacking the coin for silks they had purchased bolts of fine wool in jurador and the seamstresses worked as hard for aes sedai as they did for mats gold so they strolled about dressed like wealthy merchants and as sure of themselves as any noble ever born nobody saw one of them walk five strides without knowing that she expected the world to conform itself to her three women like that with a traveling show at that were sure to cause talk at least joline left her great serpent ring in her belt pouch the other two had lost theirs to the seanchan if mat had seen joline with the thing actually on her finger he thought he would have wept he got no more reports on their activities from the former suldam joline had bethamin firmly in hand the tall dark woman ran when joline said run and jumped when she said toad edesina was giving her lessons too but joline considered bethamin a personal project for some reason she was never harsh that mat saw not after the face slapping but you might have thought she was getting bethamin ready to go to the tower and bethamin returned a sort of gratitude that made it clear her loyalties had shifted as for seta the yellowhaired woman was so frightened of the sisters that she did not dare follow them any longer she actually shivered when he suggested it strange as it seemed seta and bethamin had been so accustomed to how seanchan women who could channel saw themselves that they had really believed aes sedai could not be much different they were dangerous when off the leash yet dangerous dogs could be handled by someone who knew how and they were experts with that particular sort of dangerous dog now they knew that aes sedai were not dogs of any kind they were wolves seta would have found another place to sleep had that been possible and he learned from mistress anan that the seanchan woman put her hands over her eyes whenever joline or edesina was teaching bethamin in the wagon im certain she can see the weaves setalle said he would have said she sounded envious except that he doubted she envied anyone shes halfway to admitting it or she wouldnt hide her eyes soon or late shell come around and want to learn too maybe she did sound envious at that he could have wished for seta to come around soon rather than late another student would have left the aes sedai less time to trouble him if the show was halted he could hardly turn around without seeing joline or edesina peering around the corner of a tent or wagon at him usually the foxhead cooled on his chest he could not prove they were actually channeling at him yet he was certain of it he was unsure which of them found the loophole in his protection that adeleas and vandene had that something thrown with the power would hit him but after that he could barely leave his tent without getting hit by a rock and later by other things burning sparks like a shower from a forge fire stinging sparks that made him leap and his hair try to stand on end he was positive that joline was behind it if for no other reason he never saw her without blaeric or fen or both nearby for protection and she smiled at him like a cat smiling at a mouse he was planning how to get her aloneit was that or spend his time hiding from herwhen she and teslyn got into a shouting match that cleared edesina out of the whitewashed wagon almost as quickly as bethamin and seta and those two ran out and stood gaping at the wagon the yellow sister calmly went back to brushing her long black hair lifting it up with one hand and sweeping the wooden hairbrush down it with the other seeing mat she smiled at him without ceasing the motions of her brush the medallion went cold and the shouting vanished as though cut off by a knife he never learned what was said behind that powerwoven shield teslyn favored him somewhat yet when he asked her she gave him one of those looks and silence it was aes sedai business and none of his whatever had gone on in there though the rocks stopped and the sparks he tried thanking teslyn but she was having none of it when something be no to be spoken of it be no to be spoken of she told him firmly it would be well for you to learn that lesson if you are to be around sisters and i think your life be tied to aes sedai now if it was no before bloody thing for her to say she never cracked her teeth about his terangreal but the same could not be said of joline and edesina even after the argument they tried to bully him into handing it over every single day edesina cornering him by herself joline with her warders glowering over her shoulders at him terangreal were rightfully the property of the white tower terangreal needed proper study particularly one with the odd properties this one possessed terangreal were potentially dangerous too much so to be left in the hands of the uninitiated neither said especially a mans hands but joline came close he began to worry that the green would have blaeric and fen simply take it from him that pair still suspected he had been involved in what had happened to her and the dark looks they gave him said they wanted any excuse to beat him like a drum that would be stealing mistress anan told him in a lecturing tone gathering her cloak around her the sunlight was beginning to fade and coolness already setting in they were standing outside tuons wagon and he was hoping to get inside in time to be fed noal and olver were already inside setalle was apparently off to visit the aes sedai something she did frequently tower law is quite clear on that there might be considerable discussion over whether it had to be given back to youi rather think it would not be in the endbut joline would face a fairly harsh penance for theft all the same maybe shed think it worth a penance he muttered his stomach rumbled the potted finches and creamed onions that lopin had presented proudly for his midday meal had both turned out to be spoiling to the tairens extreme mortification which meant mat had had a heel of bread since breakfast and no more you know an awful lot about the white tower what i know lord mat is that youve made just about every misstep a man can make with aes sedai short of trying to kill one the reason i came with you in the first place instead of going with my husband half the reason im still here is to try to keep you from making too many missteps truth to tell i dont know why i should care but i do and thats that if you had let yourself be guided by me youd not be in trouble with them now i cant say how much i can recover for you not now but i am still willing to try mat shook his head there were only two ways to deal with aes sedai without getting burned let them walk all over you or stay away from them he would not do the first and could not do the second so he had to find a third way and he doubted it could come from following setalles advice womens advice about aes sedai generally was to follow the first path though they never worded it that way they talked of accommodation but it was never the aes sedai who was expected to do any accommodating half the reason whats the other he grunted as though he had been punched in the stomach tuon you think i cant be trusted with tuon mistress anan laughed at him a fine rich laugh you are a rogue my lord now some rogues make fine husbands once theyve been tamed a little around the edgesmy jasfer was a rogue when i met himbut you still think you can nibble a pastry here nibble a pastry there then dance off to the next theres no dancing away from this one mat said frowning up at the wagon door the dice clicked away in his head not for me he was not sure he really wanted to dance away anymore but want and wish as he might he was well and truly caught like that is it she murmured oh youve chosen a fine one to break your heart thats as may be mistress anan but i have my reasons id better get inside before they eat everything he turned toward the steps at the back of the wagon and she laid a hand on his arm could i see it just to see there was no doubt what she meant he hesitated then fished in the neck of his shirt for the leather cord that held the medallion he could not have said why he had refused joline and edesina even a glimpse it was a fine piece of work a silver foxhead nearly as big as his palm only one eye showed and enough daylight remained to see if you looked close that the pupil was half shaded to form the ancient symbol of aes sedai her hand trembled slightly as she traced a finger around that eye she had said she only wanted to see it but he allowed the touching she breathed out a long sigh you were aes sedai once he said quietly and her hand froze she recovered herself so quickly that he might have imagined it she was stately setalle anan the innkeeper from ebou dar with the big golden hoops in her ears and the marriage knife dangling hiltdown into her round cleavage about as far from an aes sedai as could be the sisters think im lying about never having been to the tower they think i was a servant there as a young woman and listened where i shouldnt have they havent seen you looking at this he bounced the foxhead once on his hand before tucking it safely back under his shirt she pretended not to care and he pretended not to know she was pretending her lips twitched into a brief rueful smile as if she knew what he was thinking the sisters would see it if they could let themselves she said as simply as if she were discussing the chances of rain but aes sedai expect that when certain things happen the woman a short path will go away decently and die soon after i went away but jasfer found me half starved and sick on the streets of ebou dar and took me to his mother she chuckled just a woman telling how she met her husband he used to take in stray kittens too now you know some of my secrets and i know some of yours shall we keep them to ourselves what secrets of mine do you know he demanded instantly wary some of his secrets were dangerous to have known and if too many knew of them they were not really secrets anymore mistress anan glanced at the wagon frowning that girl is playing a game with you as surely as you are playing one with her not the same game that you are shes more like a general plotting a battle than a woman being courted if she learns youre moonstruck with her though shell still gain the advantage i am willing to let you have an even chance or as near to one as any man has with a woman of any brains do we have an agreement we do he replied fervently that we do he would not have been surprised if the dice stopped then but they went on bouncing had the sisters fixation on his medallion been the only problem they gave him had they contented themselves with creating rumors everywhere the show stopped he could have said those days were no more than tolerably bad for traveling with aes sedai unfortunately by the time the show departed jurador they had learned who tuon was not that she was the daughter of the nine moons but that she was a seanchan high lady someone of rank and influence do you take me for a fool luca protested when mat accused him of telling them he squared up beside his wagon fists on his hips a tall man full of indignation and ready to fight over it by his glare thats a secret i want buried deep until well until she says i can use that warrant of protection that wont be much use if she revokes it because i told something she wants hidden but his voice was a shade too earnest and his eyes shifted a hair from meeting mats directly the truth of it was luca liked to boast nearly as much as he liked gold he must have thought it was safesafeto tell the sisters and only realized the snarl he had created after the words were out of his mouth a snarl it was as tangled as a pit full of snakes the high lady tuon readily at hand presented an opportunity no aes sedai could have resisted teslyn was every bit as bad as joline and edesina the three of them visited tuon in her wagon daily and descended on her when she went out for a walk they talked of truces and treaties and negotiations tried to learn what connection she had to the leaders of the invasion attempted to convince her to help arrange talks to end the fighting they even offered to help her leave the show and return home unfortunately for them tuon did not see three aes sedai representatives of the white tower perhaps the greatest power on earth not even after the seamstresses began delivering their riding dresses and they could change out of the ragbag leavings mat had been able to find for them she saw two escaped damane and a mantttidamam and she had no use for either until they were decently collared her phrase that when they came to her wagon she latched the door and if they managed to get inside before she could she left when they cornered her or tried to she walked around them the same as walking around a stump they all but talked themselves hoarse and she refused to listen any aes sedai could teach a stone patience if she had reason yet they were unaccustomed to flat being ignored mat could see the frustration growing the tight eyes and tighter mouths that took longer and longer to relax the hands gripping skirts in fists to keep them from grabbing tuon and shaking her it all came to a head sooner than he expected and not at all in the way he had imagined the night after he gave tuon the mare he ate his supper with her and selucia and with noal and olver of course that pair managed as much time with tuon as he did lopin and nerim as formal as if they were in a palace instead of squeezed for room to move served a typical earlyspring meal stringy mutton with peas that had been dried and turnips that had sat too long in somebodys cellar it was too early yet for anything to be near harvesting still lopin had made a pepper sauce for the mutton nerim had found pine nuts for the peas there was plenty to go around and nothing tasted off so it was as fine a meal as could be managed olver left once supper was done having already had his games with tuon and mat changed places with selucia to play stones noal remained too despite any number of telling looks rambling on about the seven towers in dead malkier which apparently had overtopped anything in cairhien and shol arbela the city of ten thousand bells in arafel and all manner of borderland wonders strange spires made of crystal harder than steel and a metal bowl a hundred paces across set into a hillside and the like sometimes he interjected comments on mats play that he was exposing himself on the left that he was setting a fine trap on the right and just when tuon looked ready to fall into it that sort of thing mat kept his mouth shut except for chatting with tuon though it took gritting his teeth more than once to accomplish tuon found noals natter entertaining he was studying the board wondering whether he might have a small chance of gaining a draw when joline led teslyn and edesina into the wagon like haughty on a pedestal smoothfaced aes sedai to their toenails joline was wearing her great serpent ring squeezing by selucia giving her very cold looks when she was slow to move aside they arrayed themselves at the foot of the narrow table noal went very still eyeing the sisters sideways one hand beneath his coat as if the fool thought his knives would do any good here there must be an end to this high lady joline said very pointedly ignoring mat she was telling not pleading announcing what would be because it had to be your people have brought a war to these lands such as we have not seen since the war of the hundred years perhaps not since the trolloc wars tarmon gaidon is approaching and this war must end before it comes lest it bring disaster to the whole world it threatens no less than that so there will be an end to your petulance you will carry our offer to whoever commands among you there can be peace until you return to your own lands across the sea or you can face the full might of the white tower followed by every throne from the borderlands to the sea of storms the amyrlin seat has likely summoned them against you already i have heard of vast borderland armies already in the south and other armies moving better to end this without more bloodshed though so avert your peoples destruction and help bring peace mat could not see edesinas reaction but teslyn simply blinked for an aes sedai that was as good as a gasp maybe this was not exactly what she had expected joline to say for his part he groaned under his breath joline was no gray as deft as a skilled juggler in negotiations that was for sure but neither was he and he still figured she had found a short path to putting tuons back up but tuon folded her hands in her lap beneath the table and sat very straight looking right through the aes sedai her face was as stern as it had ever been for him selucia she said quietly moving up behind teslyn the yellowhaired woman bent long enough to take something from beneath the blanket mat was sitting on as she straightened everything seem to happen all at once there was a click and teslyn screamed clapping her hands to her throat the foxhead turned to ice against mats chest and jolines head whipped around with an incredulous stare for the red edesina turned and ran for the door which swung half open then slammed shut slammed against blaeric or fen by the sound of men falling down the wagons steps edesina jerked to a halt and stood very stiffly arms at her sides and divided skirts pressed against her legs by invisible cords all that in moments and selucia had not stayed still she bent briefly to the bed noal was sitting on then snapped the silver collar of another adam around jolines neck mat could see that was what teslyn was gripping with both hands she was not trying to take it off just holding on to it but her knuckles were white the reds narrow face was an image of despair her eyes staring and haunted joline had regained the utter calm of an aes sedai but she did touch the segmented collar encircling her neck if you think that you can she began then cut off abruptly her mouth going tight an angry light shone in her eyes you see the adam can be used to punish though that is seldom done tuon stood and she had the bracelet of an adam on each wrist the gleaming leashes snaking away under the blankets on the beds how in the light had she managed to get her hands on those no mat said your promised not to harm my followers precious maybe not the wisest thing to use that name now but it was too late to call it back youve kept your promises so far dont go back on one now i promised not to cause dissension among your followers toy she said snippily and in any case it is very clear that these three are not your followers the small sliding door used to talk to whoever was driving or pass out food slid open with a loud bang she glanced over her shoulder and it slid shut with a louder a man cursed outside and began beating at the door the adam can also be used to give pleasure as a great reward tuon told joline ignoring the hammering fist behind her jolines lips parted and her eyes grew very wide she swayed and the ropesuspended table swung as she caught herself with both hands to keep from falling if she was impressed though she hid it well she did smooth her dark gray skirts once after she was upright again but that might have meant nothing her face was all aes sedai composure edesina looking over her shoulder matched that calm gaze although she now wore the third adam around her neckand come to it her face was paler than usualbut teslyn had begun weeping silently shoulders shaking tears leaking down her cheeks noal was tensed a man ready to do something stupid mat kicked him under the table and when the man glared at him shook his head noals scowl deepened but he took his hand out of his coat and leaned back against the wall still glaring well let him knives were no use here but maybe words could be much better if this could be ended with words listen mat said to tuon if you think youll see a hundred reasons this wont work light you can learn to channel yourself doesnt knowing that change anything youre not far different from them he might as well have turned to smoke and blown away for all the attention she paid try to embrace saiclar she drawled stern eyes steady on joline her voice was quite mild in comparison to her gaze yet plainly she expected obedience obedience she looked a bloody leopard staring at three tethered goats and strangely more beautiful than ever a beautiful leopard who might rake him with her claws as soon as the goats well he had faced a leopard a few times before this and those were his own memories there was an odd sort of exhilaration that came with confronting a leopard go ahead she went on you know the shield is gone joline gave a small grunt of surprise and tuon nodded good youve obeyed for the first time and learned that you cannot touch the power while you wear the adam unless i wish it but now i wish you to hold the power and you do though you didnt try to embrace it jolines eyes widened slightly a small crack in her calm and now tuon went on i wish you not to be holding the power and it is gone from you your first lessons joline drew a deep breath she was beginning to look not afraid but uneasy blood and bloody ashes woman mat growled do you think you can parade them around on those leashes without anyone noticing a heavy thump came from the door a second produced the sound of cracking wood whoever was beating at the wooden window was still at it too somehow that caused no sense of urgency if the warders got in what could they do i will house them in the wagon they are using and exercise them at night she snapped irritably i am nothing like these women toy nothing like them perhaps i could learn but i choose not to just as i choose not to steal or commit murder that makes all the difference recovering herself with visible effort she sat down with her hands on the table focused on the aes sedai once again ive had considerable success with one woman like you edesina gasped murmured a name too low to be caught yes tuon said you must have met my mylen in the kennels or at exercise i will train you all as well as she is you have been cursed with a dark taint but i will reach you to have pride in the service you give the empire i didnt bring these three out of ebou dar so you could take them back mat said firmly sliding himself along the bed the foxhead grew colder still and tuon made a startled sound how did you do that toy the weave melted when it touched you its a gift precious as he stood up selucia started toward him crouching her hands outstretched in pleading fear painted her face you must not she began no tuon said sharply selucia straightened and backed away though she kept her eyes on him strangely the fear vanished from her expression he shook his head in wonder he knew the bosomy woman obeyed tuon instantly she was sojhiv after all as much owned as tuons horse and she actually thought that right and goodbut how obedient did you need to be to lose your fear at an order they have annoyed me toy tuon said as he put his hands on teslyns collar still trembling tears still streaming down her cheeks the red looked as though she could not believe he would actually remove the thing they annoy me too placing his fingers just so he pressed and the collar clicked open teslyn seized his hands and began kissing them thank you she wept over and over thank you thank you mat cleared his throat youre welcome but theres no need for would you stop that teslyn reclaiming his hands took some effort i want them to stop annoying me toy tuon said as he turned to joline from anyone else that might have been petulant the dark little woman made it a demand i think theyll agree to that after this he said dryly but joline was looking up at him with a stubborn set to her jaw you will agree wont you the green said nothing i do agree teslyn said quickly we do all agree yes we all agree edesina added joline stared at him silently stubbornly and mat sighed i could let precious keep you for a few days until you change your mind jolines collar clicked open in his hands but i wont still staring into his eyes she touched her throat as though to confirm the collar was gone would you like to be one of my warders she asked then laughed softly no need to look like that even if i would bond you against your will i couldnt so long as you have that terangreal i agree master cauthon it may cost our best chance to stop the seanchan but i will no longer bother precious tuon hissed like a doused cat and he sighed again what you gained on the swings you lost on the roundabouts he spent part of that night doing what he liked least in the world working digging a deep hole to bury the three adam he did the job himself because surprisingly joline wanted them they were terangreal after all and the white tower needed to study them that might well have been so but the tower would just have to find their adam elsewhere he was fairly certain that none of the redarms would have handed them over if he told them to bury the things yet he was taking no chances that they would reappear to cause more trouble it started raining before the hole was kneedeep a cold driving rain and by the time he was done he was soaked to the skin and mud to his waist a fine end to a fine night with the dice bouncing around his skull chapter ten a village in shiota the following day brought a respite or so it seemed tuon in a blue silk riding dress and her wide tooledleather belt not only rode beside him as the show rolled slowly north she waggled her fingers at selucia when the woman tried to put her dun between them selucia had acquired her own mount somehow a compact gelding that could not match pips or akein but still surpassed the dapple by a fair margin the blueeyed woman with a green head scarf beneath her cowl today fell in on tuons other side and her face would have done an aes sedai proud when it came to giving notüing away mat could not help grinning let her hide frustration for a change lacking horses the real aes sedai were confined to their wagon metwyn was too far away on the drivers seat of the purple wagon to overhear what he said to tuon only a few thin clouds remained in the sky from the nights rain and all seemed right in the world even the dice bouncing in his head could steal nothing from that well there were bad moments but only moments early on a flight of ravens winged overhead a dozen or more big black birds they flew swiftly never deviating from their line but he eyed them anyway until they dwindled to specks and vanished nothing to spoil the day there not for him at least maybe for someone farther north did you see some omen in them toy tuon asked she was as graceful in the saddle as she was in everything else she did he could not recall seeing her be awkward about anything most omens i know concerning ravens specifically have to do with them perching on someones rooftop or cawing at dawn or dusk they can be spies for the dark one he told her sometimes crows too and rats but they didnt stop to look at us so we dont need to worry running a greengloved hand across the top of her head she sighed toy toy she murmured resettling the cowl of her cloak how many childrens tales do you believe do you believe that if you sleep on old hobs hill under a full moon the snakes will give you true answers to three questions or that foxes steal peoples skins and take the nourishment from food so you can starve to death while eating your fill putting on a smile took effort i dont think i ever heard either one of those making his voice amused required effort too what were the odds of her mentioning snakes giving true answers which the aelfinn did after a fashion in the same breath with foxes stealing skins he was pretty sure that the eelfinn did and made leather from it but it was old hob that nearly made him flinch the other was likely just taveren twisting at the world she certainly knew nothing about him and the snakes or the foxes in shandalle the land where artur hawkwing had been born though old hob caisen hob had been another name for the dark one the aelfinn and the eelfinn both surely deserved to be connected to the dark one yet that was hardly anything he wanted to think on when he had his own connection to the bloody foxes and to the snakes too that possibility was enough to sour his stomach still it was a pleasant ride with the day warming as the sun rose though it never could be called warm he juggled six colored wooden balls and tuon laughed and clapped her hands as well she should that feat had impressed the juggler he bought the balls from and it was harder while riding he told several jokes that made her laugh and one that made her roll her eyes and exchange fingertwitchings with selucia maybe she did not like jokes about common room serving maids it had not been the least offcolor he was no fool he did wish she had laughed though she had a marvelous laugh rich and warm and free they talked of horses and argued over training methods with stubborn animals that pretty head held a few odd notions such as that you could calm a fractious horse by biting its ear that sounded more likely to send it up like a haystack fire and she had never heard of humming under your breath to soothe a horse and would not believe his father had taught him such a skill shy of demonstration well i can hardly do that without a horse that needs soothing can i he said she rolled her eyes again selucia rolled hers too there was no heat in the argument though no anger just spirit tuon had so much spirit it seemed impossible it could fit into such a tiny woman it was her silences that put a small damper on the day more so than snakes or foxes they were far away and there was nothing to be done she was right there beside him and he had a great deal to do concerning her she never alluded to what had happened with the three aes sedai or to the sisters themselves either she never mentioned his terangreal or the fact that whatever she had made teslyn or joline weave against him had failed the night before might as well have been a dream she was like a general planning a battle setalle had said trained at intrigue and dissembling from infancy according to egeanin and it was all aimed straight at him but to what end surely it could not be some seanchan blood form of courting egeanin knew little of that but surely not he had known tuon a matter of weeks and kidnapped her she called him toy had tried to buy him and only a vain fool could twist that into a woman falling in love which left anything from some elaborate scheme for revenge to to the light alone knew what she had threatened to make him a cupbearer that meant dacovale according to egeanin though she had scoffed at the notion cupbearers were chosen for their beauty and in egeanins estimation he fell far short well in his own as well truth to tell not that he was likely to admit it to anybody any number of women had admired his face nothing said tuon could not complete the marriage ceremony just to make him think himself home free and safe then have him executed women were never simple but tuon made the rest look like childrens games for a long while they saw not so much as a farm but perhaps two hours after the sun passed its zenith they came on a sizable village the ring of a blacksmiths hammer on an anvil sounded dimly the buildings some of three stories were all heavy timber framing with whitish plaster between and had highpeaked roofs of thatch and tall stone chimneys something about them tugged at mats memory but he could not say what there was not a farm to be seen anywhere in the unbroken forest but villages were always tied to farms supporting them and living off them they must all be further in from the road back in the trees oddly the people he could see ignored the approaching train of show wagons a fellow in his shirtsleeves right beside the road glanced up from the hatchet he was sharpening on a grindstone worked by a footpedal then bent to his work again as though he had seen nothing a cluster of children came hurtling around a corner and darted into another street without more than a glance in the shows direction very odd most village children would stop to stare at a passing merchants train speculating on the strange places the merchant had been and the show had more wagons than any number of merchants trains a peddler was coming from the north behind six horses his wagons high canvas cover almost hidden by clusters of pots and pans and kettles that should have caused interest too even a large village on a welltraveled road depended on peddlers for most things the people bought but no one pointed or shouted that a peddler had come they just went on about their business perhaps three hundred paces short of the village luca stood up on his drivers seat and looked back over the roof of his wagon well turn in here he bellowed gesturing toward a large meadow where wildflowers cat daisies and jumpups and something that might have been loversknots dotted spring grasses already a foot high sitting back down he suited his own words and the other wagons began following their wheels rutting the rainsodden ground as mat turned pips toward the meadow he heard the shoes of the peddlers horses ringing on paving stones the sound jerked him upright that road had not been paved since he pulled the gelding back around the canvastopped wagon was rolling over level gray paving stones that stretched just the width of the village the peddler himself a rotund fellow in a wide hat was peering at the pavement and shaking his head peering at the village and shaking his head peddlers followed fixed routes he must have been this way a hundred times he had to know the peddler halted his team and tied the reins to the brake handle mat cupped both hands around his mouth keep going man he shouted at the top of his lungs as fast as you can keep going the peddler glanced in his direction then hopped up on his seat quite spryly for such a stout man gesturing as grandly as luca he began to declaim mat could not make out the words but he knew what they would be news of the world that he had picked up along the way interspersed with lists of his goods and claims for their vast superiority nobody in the village stopped to listen or even paused keep going mat bellowed theyre dead keep going behind him somebody gasped tuon or selucia maybe both suddenly the peddlers horses screamed tossing their heads madly they screamed like animals beyond the ragged edge of terror and kept screaming pips jerked in fear and mat had his hands full the gelding danced in circles wanting to run in any direction so long as it was away from here every horse belonging to the show heard those screams and began whinnying fearfully the lions and bears began roaring and the leopards joined in that set some of the shows horses to screaming too and rearing in their harnesses the tumult built on itself in moments as mat swung round struggling to control pips every one he could see handling reins was fighting to keep a wildeyed team from racing off or injuring themselves tuons mare was dancing too and selucias dun he had a moment of fear for tuon but she seemed to be handling akein as well as she had in her race into the forest even selucia seemed sure of her seat if not of her mount he caught glimpses of the peddler as well pulling off his hat peering toward the show at last mat got pips under control blowing hard as if he had been run too hard for too long but no longer trying to race away it was too late likely it had always been too late hat in hand the round peddler leaped down to see what was the matter with his horses landing he lurched awkwardly and looked down toward his feet his hat fell from his hand landing on the hardpacked road that was when he began screaming the paving stones were gone and he was ankledeep in the road just like his shrieking horses ankledeep and sinking into rockhard clay as if into a bog just like his horses and his wagon and the village houses and people melting slowly into the ground the people never stopped what they were doing women walked along carrying baskets a line of men carried a large timber on their shoulders children darted about the fellow at the grindstone continued sharpening his hatchet all of them nearly kneedeep in the ground by this time tuon caught mats coat from one side selucia from the other that was the first he realized he had moved pips toward the peddler light what do you think you can do tuon demanded fiercely nothing he replied his bow was done the horn nocks fitted the linen bowstrings braided and waxed but he had not fitted one arrowhead to its ash shaft yet and with all the rain they had been having the glue holding the goosefeather fletchings was still tacky that was all he could think of the mercy of an arrow in the peddlers heart before he was pulled under completely would the man die or was he being carried to wherever those dead shiotans were going that was what had caught him about those buildings that was how country people had built in shiota for near enough three hundred years he could not tear his eyes away the sinking peddler shrieked loudly enough to be heard over the screaming of his team help meeee he cried waving his arms he seemed to be looking straight at mat help meeee over and over mat kept waiting for him to die hoping for him to diesurely that was better than the otherbut the man kept on screaming as he sank to his waist to his chest desperately he tipped back his head like a man being pulled under water sucking for one last breath then his head vanished and just his arms remained frantically waving until they too were gone only his hat lying on the road said there had ever been a man there when the last of the thatched rooftops and tall chimneys melted away mat let out a long breath where the village had been was another meadow decked out in cat daisies and jumpups where red and yellow butterflies fluttered from blossom to blossom so peaceful he wished he could believe the peddler was dead except for the few that had followed luca into the meadow the shows wagons stood strung out along the road and everybody was down on the ground women comforting crying children men trying to quiet trembling horses everyone talking fearfully and loudly to be heard over the bears and the lions and the leopards well everyone except the three aes sedai they glided hurriedly up the road joline heeled by blaeric and fen by their expressions aes sedai and warders alike you might have thought villages sinking into the ground were as common as house cats pausing beside the peddlers wide hat the three of them stared down it teslyn picked it up and turned over in her hands then let it drop moving into the meadow where the village had stood the sisters walked about talking peering at this and that as if they could learn something from wildflowers and grasses none had taken the time to don a cloak but for once mat could not find it in him to upbraid them they might have channeled but if so they did not use enough of the power to make the foxhead turn chilly he would not have taken them to task if they had not today not after what he had just seen the arguing started right away no one wanted to cross that patch of hardpacked clay that seemingly had been paved with stone they shouted over one another including the horse handlers and the seamstresses all telling luca what had to be done and right now some wanted to turn back far enough to find a country road and use those narrower ways to find their way to lugard others were for forgetting lugard altogether for striking out for illian by those country roads or even going all the way back to ebou dar and beyond there was always amadicia and tarabon ghealdan too for that matter plenty of towns and cities there and far from this shadowcursed spot mat sat pips saddle idly playing with his reins and held his peace through all the shouting and armwaving the gelding gave a shiver now and then but he was no longer attempting to bolt thorn came striding through the crowd and laid a hand on pips neck juilin and amathera were close behind she clinging to him and eyeing the showfolk fearfully and then noal and olver the boy looked as though he would have liked to cling to someone for comfort to anyone but he was old enough not to want it seen if he did noal appeared troubled too shaking his head and muttering under his breath he kept peering up the road toward the aes sedai doubtless by that night he would be claiming to have seen something very like this before only on a much grander scale i think well be going on alone from here thorn said quietly juilin nodded grimly if we must mat replied small parties would stand out for those who were hunting for tuon for the kidnapped heir to the seanchan empire else he would have left the show long since making their way to safety without the show to hide in would be much more dangerous but it could be done what he could not do was turn these peoples minds one glance into any of those frightened faces told him he did not have enough gold for that there might not have been enough gold in the world luca listened in silence a bright red cloak wrapped around him until most of the showfolks energy was spent when their shouts began to trickle away he flung back the cloak and walked among them there were no grand gestures now here he clapped a man on the shoulder there peered earnestly into a womans eyes the country roads they would be half mud more streams than roads from the spring rains it would take twice as long to reach lugard that way three times maybe longer mat almost choked to hear luca invoke speed but the man was hardly warming up he talked of the labor of freeing wagons that bogged down made his listeners all but see themselves straining to help the teams pull them through mud nearly hubdeep on the wagon wheels not even a country road would get that bad but he made them see it at least he made mat see it towns of any size would be few and far between along those back roads the villages tiny for the most part few places to perform and food for so many hard to come by he said that while smiling sadly at a little girl of six or so who was peering up at him from the shelter of her mothers skirts and you just knew he was envisioning her hungry and crying for food more than one woman pulled her children close around her as for amadicia and tarabon and yes ghealdan they would be fine places to perform valan lucas grand traveling show and magnificent display of marvels and wonders would visit those lands and draw immense crowds one day to reach any of them now they must first return to ebou dar covering the same ground they had crossed these past weeks passing the same towns where people were unlikely to lay out coin to see again what they had seen so short a time before a long way with everyones purses growing lighter and their bellies tighter by the day or they could press on to lugard here his voice began to take on energy he gestured but simply he still moved among them but stepping more quickly lugard was a grand city ebou dar was a shadow beside lugard lugard truly was one of the great cities so populous they might perform there all spring and always have new crowds mat had never been to lugard but he had heard it was half a ruin with a king who could not afford to keep the streets clean yet luca made it sound akin to caemlyn surely some of these people had seen the place but they listened with rapt faces as he described palaces that made the tarasin palace in ebou dar seem a hovel talked of the silkclad nobles by the score who would come to see them perform or even commission private performances surely king roedran would want such had any of them ever performed before a king before they would they would from lugard to caemlyn a city that made lugard look an imitation of a city caemlyn one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the world where they might perform the whole summer to neverending throngs i should like to see these cities tuon said moving akein nearer to pips will you show them to me toy selucia kept the dun at tuons hip the woman looked composed enough but doubtless she was shaken by what she had seen lugard maybe from there i can find a way to send you back to ebou dar with a wellguarded merchants train and as many reliable bodyguards as he could hire tuon might be as capable and dangerous as egeanin made out but two women alone would be seen as easy prey by too many and not just brigands maybe caemlyn he might need more time than from here to lugard after all we shall see what we shall see tuon replied cryptically then began exchanging fingerwriggles with selucia talking about me behind my back only doing it right under my nose he hated it when they did that lucas as good as a gleeman thom but i dont think hes going to sway them thom snorted derisively and knuckled his long white mustaches hes not bad ill grant him that but hes no gleeman still hes caught them id say a wager on it my boy say one gold crown mat surprised himself by laughing he had been sure he would not be able to laugh again until he could rid his head of the image of that peddler sinking into the road and the horses he could almost hear them screaming still loudly enough that it came near to drowning out the dice you want to wager with we very well done i wouldnt play at dice with you thom said dryly but i know a man turning a crowds head with words when i see it ive done as much myself finishing with caemlyn luca gathered himself with a spark of his usual grandiosity the man strutted and from there he announced to tar valon itself i will hire ships to carry us all mat did choke at that luca would hire ships luca who was tight enough to render mice for tallow such crowds will come in tar valon that we could spend the rest of our lives in that vast citys splendor where ogierbuilt shops seem like palaces and palaces are beyond description rulers seeing tar valon for the first time weep that their cities are villages and their own palaces no more than peasants huts the white tower itself is in tar valon remember the greatest structure in the world the amyrlin seat herself will ask us to perform before her we have given shelter to three aes sedai in need who can believe they will do other than speak for us with the amyrlin seat mat looked over his shoulder and found the three sisters no longer wandering about the meadow where the village had vanished instead they stood side by side in the road watching him perfect images of aes sedai serenity no they were not watching him he realized they were studying tuon the three had agreed not to bother her anymore and being aes sedai were bound by that but how far did an aes sedais word ever go they found ways around the oath against lying all the time so tuon would not get to see caemlyn and perhaps not lugard chances were there would be aes sedai in both cities what easier for joline and the others than to inform those aes sedai that tuon was a seanchan high lady in all likelihood tuon would be on her way to tar valon before he could blink as a guest of course to help stop the fighting no doubt many would say that would be for the good that he should hand her over himself and tell them who she really was but he had given his word he began to calculate how near to lugard he dared wait before finding her passage back to ebou dar luca had had a difficult time making tar valon sound greater than caemlyn after his spiel on that city and if they ever reached tar valon some might actually be disappointed comparing his mad descriptions the white tower a thousand paces high ogierbuilt palaces the size of small mountains he claimed there was an ogier stedding actually inside the citybut finally he called for a show of hands in favor of pressing on every hand shot up even the childrens hands and they had no vote mat pulled a purse from his coat pocket and handed over an ebou dari crown i never enjoyed losing more thorn well he never enjoyed losing but in this instance it was better than winning thom accepted with a small bow i think ill keep this as a memento he said rolling the fat gold coin across the back of his fingers to remind me that even the luckiest man in the world can lose for all of the show of hands there was a shadow of reluctance to cross that patch of road ahead after luca got his wagon back onto the road he sat staring with latelle clinging to his arm as hard as amathera ever clung to juilin finally he muttered something that might have been an oath and whipped his team up with the reins by the time they reached the fatal stretch they were at a gallop and luca kept them there until well beyond where the paving stones had been it was the same with every wagon a pause waiting until the wagon ahead was clear then a flailing of reins and a hard gallop mat himself drew a deep breath before heeling pips forward at a walk not a gallop but it was hard not to dig his heels in especially when passing the peddlers hat tuons dark face and selucias pale displayed no more emotion than aes sedais faces did i will see tar valon one day tuon said calmly in the middle of that i shall probably make it my capital i shall have you show me the city toy you have been there light she was a tough little woman gorgeous but definitely tough as nails after slowing from his gallop luca set the pace at a fast walk rather than the shows usual amble the sun slid lower and they passed several roadside meadows sufficiently large to hold the show but luca pressed on until their shadows stretched long ahead of them and the sun was a fat red ball on the horizon even then he sat holding the reins and peering at a grassy expanse beside the road its just a field he said at last too loudly and turned his team toward it mat accompanied tuon and selucia to the purple wagon once the horses had been handed over to metwyn but there was to be no meal or games of stones with her that night this is a night for prayer she told him before going in with her maid do you know nothing toy the dead walking is a sign that tarmon gaidon is near he did not take this for one of her superstitions after all he had thought something very like that himself he was not much for praying yet he offered a small one then and there sometimes there was nothing else to do no one wanted to sleep so lamps burned late throughout the camp no one wanted to be alone either mat ate by himself in his tent with little appetite and the dice in his head sounding louder than ever but thorn came to play stones just as he finished and noal soon after lopin and nerim popped in every few minutes bowing and inquiring whether mat or the others wanted anything but once they fetched wine and cupslopin carried the tall pottery jar and broke the wax seal nerim carried the cups on a wooden traymat told them to find harnan and the other soldiers i dont doubt theyre getting drunk which seems a good notion to me he said thats an order you tell them i said to share lopin bowed gravely over his round belly i have assisted the file leader now and again by procuring a few items for him my lord i expect he will be generous with the brandy come along nerim lord mat wants us to get drunk and you are getting drunk with me if i have to sit on you and pour brandy down your throat the abstemious cairhienins narrow face grew pinched with disapproval but he bowed and followed the tairen out with alacrity mat did not think lopin would need to sit on the man not tonight juilin came with amathera and olver so games of snakes and foxes played sprawled on the groundcloth were added to stones played at the small table amathera proved an adequate player at stones unsurprising given that she had been a ruler once but her mouth became even more pouty when she and olver lost at snakes and foxes although nobody ever won that game then again mat suspected she had not been a very good ruler whoever was not playing sat on the cot mat watched the games when it was his turn there as did juilin if amathera was playing he seldom took his eyes from her except when it was his turn at a game noal nattered on with his storiesbut then he spun those tales even while playing and talking seemed to have no effect on his skill at stonesand thorn sat reading the letter mat had brought him what seemed a very long time ago the page was heavily creased from being carried in thorns coat pocket and much smudged from being read and reread he had said it was from a dead woman it was a surprise when domon and egeanin ducked through the entry flaps they had not precisely been avoiding mat since he moved out of the green wagon but neither had they gone out of their way to seek him out like everyone else they were in bettet clothes than they had worn for disguises in the beginning egeanins divided skirts and highcollared coat both of blue wool and embroidered in a yellow near to gold on the hem and cuffs had something of a uniform about them while domon in a wellcut brown coat and baggy trousers stuffed into turneddown boots just below his knees looked every inch the prosperous if not exactly wealthy illianer merchant as soon as egeanin entered amathera who was on the groundcloth with olver curled herself into a ball on her knees juilin sighed and got up from the stool across the table from mat but egeanin reached the other woman first theres no need for that with me or anyone else she drawled bending to take amathera by the shoulders and draw her to her feet amathera rose slowly hesitantly and kept her eyes down until egeanin put a hand beneath her chin and raised her head gently you look me in the eyes you look everyone in the eyes the taraboner woman touched her tongue to her lips nervously but she did keep looking straight at egeanins face when the hand was removed from her chin on the other hand her eyes were very wide this is a change juilin said suspiciously and with a touch of anger he stood stiff as a statue carved from dark wood he disliked any seanchan for what they had done to amathera youve called me a thief for freeing her there was more than a touch of anger in that he hated thieves and smugglers which domon was all things change given time domon said jovially smiling to head off more heated words why you do be looking at an honest man master thiefcatcher leilwin did make me promise to give up smuggling before she would agree to marry me fortune prick me who did ever hear of a woman refusing to marry a man unless he did give up a lucrative trade he laughed as though that were the funniest joke in the world egeanin fisted him in the ribs hard enough to change his laughter to a grunt married to her his ribs must be a mass of bruises i expect you to keep that promise bayle i am changing and so must you eyeing amathera brieflyperhaps to make sure she was still obeying egeanin was big on others doing as she told themshe stuck out a hand toward juilin i am changing master sandar will you juilin hesitated then clasped her hand ill make a try at it he sounded doubtful an honest try is all i ask frowning around the tent she shook her head ive seen orlop decks less crowded than this we have some decent wine in our wagon master sandar will you and your lady join us in a cup or two again juilin hesitated he has this game all but won he said finally no point in playing it out clapping his conical red hat on his head he adjusted his dark flaring tairen coat unnecessarily and offered his arm to amathera formally she clasped it tightly and though her eyes were still on egeanins face she trembled visibly i expect olver will want to stay here and play his game but my lady and i will be pleased to share wine with you and your husband mistress shipless there was a hint of challenge in his gaze it was clear that to him egeanin had further to go to prove she no longer saw amathera as stolen property egeanin nodded as if she understood perfectly the light shine on you tonight and for as many days and nights as we have remaining she said by way of farewell to those staying cheerful of her no sooner had the four departed than thunder boomed overhead another loud peal and rain began pattering on the tent roof quickly growing to a downpour that drummed the greenstriped canvas unless juilin and the others had run they would do their drinking wet noal settled on the other side of the red cloth from olver and took up amatheras part of the game rolling the dice for the snakes and the foxes the black discs that now represented olver and him were nearly to the edge of the webmarked cloth but it was evident to any eye that they would not make it to any eye but olvers at least he groaned loudly when a pale disc inked with a wavy line a snake touched his piece and again when a disc marked with a triangle touched noals noal took up the tale he had left off when egeanin and domon appeared as well a story of some supposed voyage on a sea folk raker athaan miere women are the most graceful in the world he said moving the black discs back to the circle in the center of the board even more so than domani and you know thats saying something and when theyre out of sight of land he cut off abruptly and cleared his throat eyeing olver who was stacking the snakes and foxes on the boards corners what do they do then olver asked why noal rubbed his nose with a gnarled finger why they scramble about the rigging so nimbly youd think they had hands where their feet should be thats what they do olver oohed and noal gave a soft sigh of relief mat began removing the black and white stones from the board on the table placing them in two carved wooden boxes the dice in his head bounced and rattled even when the thunder was loudest another game thom the whitehaired man looked up from his letter i think not mat my minds in a maze tonight if you dont mind my asking thorn why do you read that letter the way you do i mean sometimes your face looks like youre trying to puzzle out what it means olver yelped with glee at a good toss of the dice thats because i am in a way here he held out the letter but mat shook his head its no business of mine thorn its your letter and im no good with puzzles oh its your business too moiraine wrote it just before well anyway she wrote it mat stared at him for a long moment before taking the creased page and when his eyes fell on the smudged ink he blinked small precise writing covered the sheet but it began my dearest thorn who would have thought moiraine of all people would address old thorn merrilin so thorn this is personal i dont think i should read thorn cut in youll see mat drew a deep breath a letter from a dead aes sedai that was a puzzle and concerned him in some way suddenly he wanted nothing less than to read the thing but he began anyway it was near enough to make his hair stand on end my dearest thom there are many words i would like to write to you words from my heart but i have put this off because i knew that i must and now there is little time there are many things i cannot tell you lest i bring disaster but what i can i will heed carefully what i say in a short while i will go down to the docks and there i will confront lanfear how can i know that that secret belongs to others suffice it that i know and let that foreknowledge stand as proof for the rest of what i say when you receive this you will be told that i am dead all will believe that i am not dead and it may be that i shall live to my appointed years it also may be that you and mat cauthon and another a man i do not know will try to rescue me may i say because it may be that you will not or cannot or because mat may refuse he does not hold me in the affection you seem to and he has his reasons which he no doubt thinks are good if you try it must be only you and mat and one other more will mean death for all fewer will mean death for all even if you come only with mat and one other death also may come i have seen you try and die one or two or all three i have seen myself die in the attempt i have seen all of us live and die as captives should you decide to make the attempt anyway young mat knows the way to find me yet you must not show him this letter until he asks about it that is of the utmost importance he must know nothing that is in this letter until he asks events must play out in certain ways whatever the costs if you see lan again tell him that all of this is for the best his destiny follows a different path from mine i wish him all happiness with nynaeve a final point remember what you know about the game of snakes and foxes remember and heed it is time and i must do what must be done may the light illumine you and give you joy my dearest thom whether or not we ever see one another again moiraine thunder boomed as he finished fitting that shaking his head he handed the letter back thom he said gently lans bond to her was broken it takes death to do that he said she was dead and her letter says everyone would believe that she knew mat she knew it all in advance thats as may be but moiraine and lanfear went into that doorframe terangreal and it melted the thing was redstone or looked to be stone thom yet it melted like wax i saw it she went to wherever the eelfinn are and even if she is alive theres no way for us to get there anymore the tower of ghenjei olver piped up and all three adults turned their heads to stare at him birgitte told me he said defensively the tower of ghenjei is the way to the lands of the aelfinn and the eelfinn he made the gesture that began a game of snakes and foxes a triangle drawn in the air and then a wavy line through it she knows even more stories than you master charin that wouldnt be birgitte silverbow would it noal said wryly the boy gave him a level look im not an infant master charin but she is very good with a bow so maybe she is birgitte born again i mean i dont think theres any chance of that mat said ive talked with her too you know and the last thing she wants is to be any kind of hero he kept his promises and birgittes secrets were safe with him in any case knowing about this tower doesnt help much unless she told you where it is olver shook his head sadly and mat bent to ruffle his hair not your fault boy without you we wouldnt even know it exists that did not seem to help much olver stared at the red cloth game board dejectedly the tower of ghenjei noal said sitting up crosslegged and tugging his coat straight not many know that tale anymore jain always said hed go looking for it one day somewhere along the shadow coast he said thats still a lot of ground to search mat fitted the lid on one of the boxes it could take years years they did not have if tuon was right and he was sure that she was thorn shook his head she says you know mat mat knows the way to find me i doubt very much shed have written that on a whim well i cant help what she says now can i i never heard of any tower of ghenjei until tonight a pity noal sighed id like to have seen it something jain bloody farstrider never did you might as well give over he added when thom opened his mouth he wouldnt forget seeing it and even if he never heard the name hed have to think of it when he heard of a strange tower that lets people into other lands the thing gleams like burnished steel im told two hundred feet high and forty thick and theres not an opening to be found in it who could forget seeing that mat went very still his black scarf felt too tight against his hanging scar the scar itself suddenly felt fresh and hot it was hard for him to draw breath if theres no opening how do we get in thom wanted to know noal shrugged but olver spoke up once more birgitte says you make the sign on the side of it anywhere with a bronze knife he made the sign that started the game she says it has to be a bronze knife make the sign and a door opens what else did she tell you about thom began then cut off with a frown what ails you mat you look about to sick up what ailed him was his memory and not the other mens memories for once those had been stuffed into him to fill holes in his own memories which they did and more or so it seemed he certainly remembered many more days than he had lived but whole stretches of his own life were lost to him and others were like mothriddled blankets or shadowy and dim he had only spotty memories of fleeing shadar logoth and very vague recollections of escaping on domons rivership but one thing seen on that voyage stood out a tower shining like burnished steel sick up his stomach wanted to empty itself i think i know where that tower is thorn rather domon knows but i cant go with you the eelfinn will know im coming maybe the aelfinn too burn me they might already know about this letter because i read it they might know every word weve said you cant trust them theyll take advantage if they can and if they know youre coming theyll be planning to do just that theyll skin you and make harnesses for themselves from your hide his memories of them were all his own but they were more than enough to support the judgment they stared at him as if he were mad even olver there was nothing for it but to tell them about his encounters with the aelfinn and the eelfinn as much as was needful at least not about his answers from the eelfinn certainly or his two gifts from the aelfinn but the other mens memories were necessary to explain what he had reasoned out about the eelfinn and aelfinn having links to him now and the pale leather harnesses the eelfinn wore those seemed important and how they had tried to kill him that was very important he had said he wanted to leave and failed to say alive so they took him outside and hanged him he even removed the scarf to show his scar for extra weight and he seldom let anybody see that the three of them listened in silence thom and noal intently olvers mouth slowly dropping open in wonder the rain beating on the tent roof was the only sound aside from his voice that all has to stay inside this tent he finished aes sedai have enough reasons already to want to put their hands on me if they find out about those memories ill never be free of them would he ever be entirely free of them he was beginning to think not yet there was no reason to give them fresh reasons to meddle in his life are you any relation to jain noal raised his hands in a placating gesture peace man i believe you its just that tops anything i ever did anything jain ever did too would you mind if i made the third i can be handy in tight spots you know burn me did everything i said pass in one ear and out the other theyll know im coming they may already know everything and it doesnt matter thom put in not to me ill go by myself if necessary but if i read this correctly he began folding the letter up almost tenderly the only hope of success is if you are one of the three he sat there on the cot silent now looking mat in the eye mat wanted to look away and could not bloody aes sedai the woman almost certainly was dead and yet she still tried coercing him into being a hero well heroes got patted on the head and pushed out of the way until the next time a hero was needed if they survived being a hero in the first place very often heroes did not he had never really trusted moiraine or liked her either only fools trusted aes sedai but then if not for her he would be back in the two rivers mucking out the barn and tending his das cows or he would be dead and there old thom sat saying nothing just staring at him that was the rub he liked thom oh blood and bloody ashes burn me for a fool he muttered ill go thunder crashed deafeningly right atop a flash of lightning so bright it shone through the tent canvas when the rumbling booms faded there was dead silence in his head the last set of dice had stopped he could have wept chapter eleven a hell in maderin despite the late hours kept by everyone that night the show made a very early start the next morning grainyeyed and groggy mat trudged out of his tent while the sky was still dark to find men and women with lanterns trotting to get ready when they were not running and nearly everyone shouting for somebody or other to move faster many had the unsteady step of people who had not slept everyone seemed to feel that the farther they could get from where that village had vanished in front ot their eyes the better lucas great gaudy wagon took to the road before the sun had cleared the horizon and once again he set a goodly pace two merchants trains of twenty or so wagons each passed them heading south and a slow caravan of tinkers but nothing going the other way the farther the better mat rode with tuon and selucia made no attempt to put the dun between them yet there was no conversation however much he tried to start one save for an occasional unreadable glance when he made a sally or told a joke tuon rode looking straight ahead the cowl of her blue cloak hiding her face even juggling failed to catch her attention there was something broody about her silence and it worried him when a woman went silent on you there usually was trouble in the offing when she brooded you could forget about usually he doubted it was the village of the dead that had her fretting she was too tough for that no there was trouble ahead little more than an hour after they set out a farm on rolling ground hove into sight with dozens of blackfaced goats cropping grass in a wide pasture and a large olive grove boys weeding among the rows of darkleaved olive trees dropped their hoes and rushed down to the stone fences to watch the show pass shouting with excitement to know who they were and where they were going and where coming from men and women came out of the sprawling tileroofed farmhouse and two big thatchroofed barns shading their eyes to watch mat was relieved to see it the dead paid no mind to the living as the show rolled onward farms and olive groves grew thicker on the ground until they ran side by side pushing the forest back a mile or more on either side of the road and well short of midmorning they reached a prosperous town somewhat larger than jurador a merchants long train of canvastopped wagons was turning in at the main gates where half a dozen men in polished conical helmets and leather coats sewn with steel discs stood guard with halberds more men cradling crossbows kept watch atop the two gate towers but if the lord of maderin one nathin sarmain vendare expected trouble the guards were the only sign of it farms and olive groves reached right to the stone walls of maderin an unsound practice and right costly should the town ever need to be defended luca had to bargain with a farmer for the right to set up the show in an unused pasture and came back muttering that he had just bought the scoundrel a new flock of goats or maybe two but the canvas wall was soon rising with luca chivvying everyone for speed they were to perform today and leave early in the morning very early nobody complained or much said an unneeded word the farther the better and tell no one what you saw luca cautioned more than once we saw nothing out of the ordinary we wouldnt want to frighten the patrons away people looked at him as if he were insane no one wanted to think of that melting village or the peddler much less speak of them mat was sitting in his tent in his shirtsleeves waiting for thorn and juilin to return from their trip into the town to learn whether there was a seanchan presence he was idly tossing a set of dice on his small table after an early run of mostly high numbers five single pips stared up at him ten times in a row most men thought the dark ones eyes an unlucky toss selucia pulled back the entry flap and strode in despite her plain brown divided skirts and white blouse she managed to seem a queen entering a stable a filthy stable by the expression on her face though lopin and nerim could have satisfied his mother when it came to cleaning she wants you she drawled peremptorily touching her flowered scarf to make sure her short yellow hair was covered come whats she want with me then he said and leaned his elbows on the table he even stretched out his legs and crossed his ankles once you let a woman think you would jump whenever she called you never got out from under again shell tell you you are wasting time toy she wont be pleased if precious expects me to come running when she crooks a finger she better learn to like being displeased grimacingif her mistress tolerated the name selucia took it for a personal affrontshe folded her arms beneath that impressive bosom it was clear as good glass that she intended to wait there until he went with her and he was of a mind to make it a long wait he tossed the dice the dark ones eyes expecting him to jump when tuon said toad hah another toss spinning across the table one die nearly going over the edge the dark ones eyes still he had nothing else to do at the moment even so he took his time donning his coat a good bronzecolored silk by the time he picked up his hat he could hear her foot tapping impatiently well what are you waiting for he asked she hissed at him she held the entry flap open but she purely hissed like a cat setalle and tuon were sitting on one of the beds talking when he entered the purple wagon but they cut off the instant he stepped through the door and gave him brief but appraising looks which told him the subject of their talk had been mat cauthon it made his hackles rise plainly whatever tuon wanted was something they thought he would disapprove of and just as plainly she meant to have it anyway the table was snug against the ceiling and selucia brushed past him to take a place behind tuon as the tiny woman sat down on the stool her face stern and those beautiful big eyes steady hang all the prisoners immediately i wish to visit the common room of an inn she announced or a tavern i have never seen the inside of either you will take me to one in this town toy he let himself breathe again thats easy enough just as soon as thorn or juilin lets me know its safe it must be a low place what is called a hell his mouth fell open low hells were the lowest of the low dirty and dimly lit where the ale and wine were cheap and still not worth half what you paid the food was worse and any woman who sat on your lap was trying to pick your pocket or cut your purse or else had two men waiting upstairs to crack you over the head as soon as you walked into her room at any hour of the day or night you would find dice rolling in a dozen games sometimes for surprising stakes given the surroundings not goldonly a stone fool displayed gold in a hellbut silver often crossed the tables few of the gamblers would have come by their coin by any means even halfway honest and those few would be as hardeyed as the headcrackers and knifemen who preyed on drunks in the night hells always had two or three strongarms with cudgels about to break up fights and most days they worked hard for their pay they usually stopped the patrons from killing one another but when they failed the corpse was dragged out the back and left in an alley somewhere or on a rubbish heap and while they were dragging the drinking never slowed or the gambling either that was a hell how had she even heard of such places did you plant this fool notion in her head he demanded of setalle why what in the light makes you think that she replied going all wideeyed the way women did when pretending to be innocent or when they wanted you to think they were pretending just to confuse you he could not see why they bothered women confused him all the time without trying its out of the question precious i walk into a hell with a woman like you and ill be in six knife fights inside the hour if i survive that long tuon gave a pleased smile just a flicker but definitely pleased do you really think so i know so for a fact which produced another brief smile of delight delight the bloody woman wanted to see him in a knife fight even so toy you promised they were arguing over whether he had made a promisewell he was calmly presenting the logic that saying something was easy was no promise tuon just stubbornly insisted he had promised while setalle took up her embroidery hoop and selucia watched him with the amused air of someone watching a man try to defend the indefensible and he did not shout no matter what tuon saidwhen a knock came at the door tuon paused you see toy she said after a moment that is how it is done you knock and then wait she made a simple gesture over one shoulder at her maid you may enter the presence selucia called drawing herself up regally she probably expected whoever came in to prostrate themselves it was thom in a dark blue coat and dark gray cloak that would make him unremarked in any common room or tavern neither welltodo nor poor a man who could afford to pay for his own drink while listening to the gossip or buy another man a cup of wine to pay for hearing his news and the latest rumors he did not prostrate himself but he did make an elegant bow despite his bad right leg my lady he murmured to tuon before turning his attention to mat harnan said he saw you strolling this way i trust im not interrupting i heard voices mat scowled he had not been shouting youre not interrupting what did you find out that there may be seanchan in the town from time to time no soldiers but it seems theyre building two farm villages a few miles to the north of the road and three more a few miles south the villagers come to town to buy things now and then mat managed to keep from smiling as he spoke over his shoulder he even got a smattering of regret into his voice im afraid theres no jaunt into maderin for you precious too dangerous tuon folded her arms emphasizing her bosom there were more curves to her than he once had thought not like selucia certainly but nice curves farmers toy she drawled dismissively no farmer has ever seen my face you promised me a tavern or a common room and you wont escape on this puny excuse a common room should present no difficulties thom said its a pair of scissors or a new pot these farmers are after not drink they make their own ale it seems and dont much like the local brew thank you thorn mat said through gritted teeth she wants to see a hell the whitehaired man gave a wheezing cough and knuckled his mustache vigorously a hell he muttered a hell do you know a hell in this town where i might take her without starting a riot he intended the question for sarcasm but thorn surprised him by nodding i might just know a place at that the man said slowly the white ring i intend to go there anyway to see what news i can pick up mat blinked however unremarked thom might be elsewhere he would be looked at askance in a hell wearing that coat more than askance the usual garb there was coarse dirty wool and stained linen besides asking questions in a hell was a good way to have a knife planted in your back but maybe thom meant that this white ring was not a hell at all tuon might not know the difference if the place were only a little rougher than the usual should i get harnan and the others he asked testing oh i think you and i should be protection enough for the lady thom said with what might have been the ghost of a smile and knots loosened in mats shoulders he still cautioned the two womenthere was no question of selucia staying behind of course mistress anan refused tuons invitation to accompany them saying she had already seen as many hells as she had any wish toabout keeping their hoods well up tuon might believe no farmer had ever seen her face but if a cat could gaze on a king as the old saying said then a farmer might have gazed on tuon some time or other and it would be just their luck to have one or two of them turn up in maderin being taveren usually seemed to twist the pattern for the worst in his experience toy tuon said gently as selucia settled the blue cloak on her slim shoulders i have met many farmers while visiting the country but they very properly kept their eyes on the ground even if i allowed them to stand believe me they never saw my face oh he went to fetch his own cloak white clouds nearly obscured the sun still short of its midday peak and it was a brisk day for spring with a strong breeze to boot people from the town crowded the main street of the show men in rough woolens or sober coats of finer stuff with just a touch of embroidery on the cuffs women many wearing lace caps in somber collared dresses beneath long white aprons or dark highnecked dresses with embroidery curling across the bosom children darting everywhere escaping their parents and being chased down all of them oohing and aahing at miyoras leopards or latelles bears at the jugglers or balat and abar eating fire the lean brothers moving in unison not pausing for so much as a glimpse of the female acrobats mat threaded through the throng with tuon on his arm which he assured by placing her hand on his left wrist she hesitated a moment then nodded slightly a queen giving assent to a peasant thorn had offered his arm to selucia but she stayed at her mistresss left shoulder at least she did not try to crowd between luca in scarlet coat and cloak was beneath the big banner at the entrance watching coins clink into the glass pitcher clink again as they were dropped into the strongbox he wore a smile on his face the line waiting to get in stretched near a hundred paces along the canvas wall and more people were trickling out of the town and heading toward che show i could take in a fine bit here over two or three days he told mat after all this place is solid and were far enough from his smile flickered out like a snuffed candle you think were far enough dont you mat sighed gold would defeat fear every time in valan luca he could not hold his cloak closed with tuon on his arm so it flared behind him in the stiff breeze yet that was to the good the gate guards slouching in a ragged line eyed them curiously and one made a sketchy bow silk and lace had that effect with country armsmen at least and that was what these men were no matter how brightly they had burnished their helmets and coinarmor coats most leaned on their halberds like farmers leaning on shovels but thorn stopped and mat was forced to halt too a few paces into the town after all he had no idea where the white ring lay a heavy guard captain thom said worry touching his voice are there brigands in the area no outlaws around here a grizzled guard said gruffly a puckered white scar slanting across his square face combined with a squint to give him a villainous appearance he was not one of the leaners and he held his halberd as if he might know how to use it the seanchan cleaned out the few we hadnt caught move along now old fellow you re blocking the way there was not a wagon or cart in sight and the few people leaving the town afoot had plenty of room the gate arch was wide enough for two wagons abreast though it might be a squeeze the seanchan said we didnt set enough guards a stocky fellow about mats age put in cheerfully and lord nathin listens close when the seanchan talk the grizzled man clouted him with a gauntleted hand on the back of his helmet hard enough to stagger him you watch your mouth with people from off keilar the older man growled else youll be back behind a plow before you can blink my lord he added to mat raising his voice you want to call your servant before he gets himself in trouble my apologies captain thom said humbly ducking his white head the very image of a chastened serving man no offense meant my apologies he would have thumped you too if i hadnt been here mat told him when he caught up thorn was limping noticeably he must have been tired for it to show that much he almost did anyway and what did you learn that was worth risking that i wouldnt have asked without you in that coat thorn chuckled as they walked deeper into the town the first lesson is what questions to ask the second and just as important is when and how to ask i learned there arent any brigands which is always good to know though ive heard of very few bands big enough to attack something as large as the show i learned nathin is under the seanchan thumb either hes obeying a command with those extra guards or he takes their suggestions as commands and most important i learned that nathins armsmen dont resent the seanchan mat quirked an eyebrow at him they didnt spit when they said the name mat they didnt grimace or growl they wont fight the seanchan not unless nathin tells them to and he wont thorn exhaled heavily its very strange ive found the same everywhere from ebou dar to here these outlanders come take charge impose their laws snatch up women who can channel and if the nobles resent them very few among the common people seem to unless theyve had wife or relation collared anyway very strange and it bodes ill for getting them out again but then altara is altara ill wager theyre finding a colder reception in amadicia and tarabon he shook his head we had best hope they are else he did not say what else but it was easy to imagine mat glanced at tuon how did she feel hearing thom talk about her people so she said nothing only walked at his side peering curiously at everything from the shelter of her cowl tileroofed buildings three and four stories tall most of brick lined the wide stonepaved main street of maderin shops and inns with signs that swung in the stiff breeze crowded in beside stables and rich peoples homes with large lamps above the arched doorways and humbler structures that housed poorer folk by the laundry hanging from nearly every window horse carts and handbarrows laden with bales or crates or barrels slowly made their way through a moderately thick throng men and women with brisk strides full of that storied southern industry children dashing about in games of catch tuon studied it all with equal interest a fellow pushing a wheeled grindstone and crying that he sharpened scissors or knives till they could cut wishes caught her attention as much as a lean hardfaced woman in leather trousers with two swords strapped to her back doubtless a merchants guard or perhaps a hunter for the horn but a rarity either way a buxom domani in a clinging red dress that fell just short of transparent with a pair of bulky bodyguards in scalearmor jerkins at her back got neither more nor less study than a lanky oneeyed fellow in frayed wool hawking pins needles and ribbons from a tray he had not noticed this sort of curiosity from her in jurador but she had been intent on finding silk in jurador here she seemed to be trying to memorize all she saw thorn soon led them off into a maze of twisting streets most of which deserved the name only because they were paved with rough stone blocks the size of a mans two fists buildings as big as those on the main street some housing shops on the ground floor loomed over them almost shutting out the sky many of those ways were too narrow for horse cartsin some mat would not have had to extend his arms fully to touch the walls on either sideand more than once he had to press tuon against the front of a building to let a heavyloaded handbarrow rumble past over the uneven paving stones the barrowman calling apologies for the inconvenience without slowing porters trudged through that cramped warren too men walking bent nearly parallel to the ground each with a bale or crate on his back held level by a padded leather roll strapped to his hips just the sight of them made mats own back ache they reminded him how much he hated work he was on the point of asking thorn how far they had to go maderin was not that big a townwhen they reached the white ring on one of those winding streets where his arms could more than compass the width of the pavement a brick building of three floors across from a cutlers shop the painted sign hanging over the inns red door a frilly white circle of lace made the knots return to his shoulders ring it might be called but that was a womans garter if ever he had seen one it might not be a hell but inns with signs like that usually were rowdy enough in their own right he eased the knives up his coatsleeves and those in his boot tops as well felt the blades under his coat shrugged just to get the feel of the one hanging behind his neck though if it went that far tuon nodded approvingly the bloody woman was dying to see him get into a knife fight selucia had the sense to frown ah yes thom said a wise precaution and he checked his own knives tightening those knots in mats shoulders a little more thom carried almost as many blades as he did up his sleeves beneath his coat selucia writhed her fingers at tuon and suddenly they were in a silent argument fingers flashing of course it could not be that tuon bloody well owned selucia the same as owning a dog and you did not argue with your dogbut an argument it seemed both women with their jaws set stubbornly finally selucia folded her hands and bowed her head in acquiescence a reluctant submission it will be well tuon told her in a jollying tone you will see it will be well mat wished he was sure of that taking a deep breath he extended his wrist for her hand again and followed thom the spacious woodpaneled common room of the white ring held better than two dozen men and women nearly half obvious outlanders at square tables beneath a thickbeamed ceiling all neatly dressed in finely woven wool with little by way of ornamentation most were talking quietly over their wine in pairs cloaks draped over their lowbacked chairs though three men and a woman with long beaded braids were tossing bright red dice from a winecup at one table pleasant smells drifted from the kitchen including meat roasting goat most likely beside the wide stone fireplace where a parsimonious fire burned and a polished brass barrelclock sat on the mantel a saucyeyed young woman who rivaled seluciaand with her blouse unlaced nearly to her waist to prove itswayed her hips and sang accompanied by a hammered dulcimer and a flute a song about a woman juggling all of her lovers she sang in a suitably bawdy voice none of the patrons appeared to be listening as i walked out one fine spring day i met young jac who was pitching hay his hair so fair and his eyes were too well i gave him a kiss oh what could i do we snuggled and we tickled while the sun rose high and i wont say how often he made me sigh lowering her hood tuon stopped just inside the door and frowned around the room are you certain this is a hell master merrilin she asked in a low voice thank the light some places a question of that sort could get you thrown out and roughly silk coat or no in others the prices just doubled i assure you you wont find a bigger collection of thieves and rascals anywhere in maderin at this hour thorn murmured stroking his mustaches nowjac gels an hour when the sky is clear and willi gets an hour when my fathers not near its the hayloft with mori i for he shows no fear and keilin comes at midday hes oh so bold lord brelan gets an evening when the night is cold master andril gets a morning but hes very old oh what oh what is a poor girl to do my loves are so many and the hours so few tuon looked doubtful but with selucia at her shoulder she walked over to stand in front of the singer who faltered a moment at tuons intense scrutiny before catching the song up again she sang over the top of tuons head plainly attempting to ignore her it seemed that with every other verse the woman in the song added a new lover to her list the male musician playing the dulcimer smiled at selucia and got a frosty stare back the two women got other looks as well the one so small and with very short black hair the other rivaling the singer and with her head wrapped in a scarf but no more than glances the patrons were intent on their own business it isnt a hell mat said softly but what is it why would so many people be here in the middle of the day it was mornings and evenings when common rooms filled up like this the locals are selling olive oil lacquerware or lace thom replied just as quietly and the outlanders are buying it seems local custom is to begin with a few hours of drink and conversation and if you have no head for it he added dryly you sober up to find youve made much less of a bargain than you thought in your wine light thorn shell never believe this place is a hell i thought you were taking us somewhere merchants guards drink or apprentices at least she might believe that trust me mat i think youll find she has lived a very sheltered life in some ways sheltered when her own brothers and sisters tried to kill her you wouldnt care to wager a crown on it would you thorn chuckled always glad to take your coin tuon and selucia came gliding back faces expressionless i expected rougher garb on the patrons tuon said quietly and perhaps a fight or two but the song is too salacious for a respectable inn though she is much too covered to sing it properly in my opinion what is that for she added in tones of suspicion as mat handed thorn a coin oh thorn said slipping the crown into his coat pocket i thought you might be disappointed that only the more successful blackguards were presentthey arent always so colorful as the poorer sortbut mat said youd never notice she leveled a look at mat who opened his mouth indignantly and closed it again what was there to say he was already in the pickling kettle no need to stoke the fire as the innkeeper approached a round woman with suspiciously black hair beneath a white lace cap and stuffed into a gray dress embroidered in red and green across her more than ample bosom thorn slipped away with a bow and a murmured by your leave my lord my lady murmured but loud enough for mistress heilin to hear the innkeeper had a flinty smile yet she exercised it for a lord and lady curtsying so deeply that she grunted straightening back up and she seemed only a little disappointed that mat wanted wine and perhaps food not rooms her best wine even so when he paid he let her see that he had gold in his purse as well as silver a silk coat was all very well but gold wearing rags got better service than copper wearing silk ale tuon drawled ive never tasted ale tell me good mistress is it likely any of these people will start a fight any time soon mat nearly swallowed his tongue mistress heilin blinked and gave her head a small shake as if uncertain she really had heard what she thought she had no need to worry my lady she said it happens time to time if they get too far in their cups but ill settle them down hard if it does not on my account tuon told her they should have their sport the innkeepers smile went crooked and barely held but she managed another curtsy then scurried away clutching mats coin and calling jera wine for the lord and lady a pitcher of the kiranaille and a mug of ale you mustnt ask questions like that precious mat said quietly as he escorted tuon and selucia to an empty table selucia refused a chair taking tuons cloak and draping it over the chair she held for tuon then standing behind it it isnt polite besides it lowers your eyes thank the light for those talks with egeanin whatever name she wanted to go by seanchan would do any fool thing or refuse to do what was sensible to avoid having their eyes lowered tuon nodded thoughtfully your customs are often very peculiar toy you will have to teach me about them i have learned some but i must know the customs of the people i will rule in the name of the empress may she live forever ill be glad to teach you what i can mat said unpinning his cloak and letting it fall carelessly over the low back of his chair it will be good for you to know our ways even if you end up ruling a sight less than you expect to he set his hat on the table tuon and selucia gasped as one hands darting for the hat tuons reached it first and she quickly put it on the chair next to her that is very bad luck toy never put a hat on a table she made one of those odd gestures for warding off evil folding under the middle two fingers and extending the other two stiffly selucia did the same ill remember that he said dryly perhaps too dryly tuon gave him a level look very level i have decided you will not do for a cupbearer toy not until you learn meekness which i almost despair of teaching you perhaps i will make you a running groom instead you are good with horses would you like trotting at my stirrup when i ride the robes are much the same as for a cupbearer but i will have yours decorated with ribbons pink ribbons he managed to maintain a smooth face but he felt his cheeks growing hot there was only one way she could know pink ribbons had any special significance to him tylin had told her it had to be burn him women would talk about anything the arrival of the serving maid with their drink saved him from having to make any response jera was a smiling young woman with nearly as many curves as the singer not so well displayed yet not really concealed by the white apron she wore tied snugly her dark woolen dress fit quite snugly too not that he gave her more than a glance of course he was with his wifetobe anyway only a complete woolhead looked at a woman while with another jera placed a tall pewter wine pitcher and two polished pewter cups on the table and handed a thick mug of ale to selucia then blinked in confusion when selucia transferred the mug to tuon and took a cup of wine in return he handed her a silver penny to settle her discomposure and she gave him a beaming smile with her curtsy before darting off to another call from the innkeeper it was unlikely she received much in the way of silver you could have smiled back at her toy tuon said holding the mug up for a sniff and wrinkling her nose she is very pretty you were so stonefaced you probably frightened her she took a sip and her eyes widened in surprise this actually is quite good mat sighed and took a long swallow of dark wine that smelled faintly of flowers in none of his memories his own or those other mens could he recall having understood women oh one or two things here and there but never anywhere near completely sipping her ale steadilyhe was not about to tell her ale was taken in swallows not sips she might get herself drunk deliberately just to experience a hell fully he was not ready to put anything past her today or any daytaking sips between every sentence the maddening little woman questioned him on customs telling her how to behave in a hell was easy enough keep to yourself ask no questions and sit with your back to a wall if you could and near to a door in case of a need to leave suddenly better not to go at all but if you had to yet she quickly passed on to courts and palaces and got few answers there he could have told her more of customs in the courts of eharon or shiota or a dozen other dead nations than in those of any nation that still lived scraps of how things were done in caemlyn and tear were all he really knew and bits from fal dara in shienar well that and ebou dar but she already knew those ways so you have traveled widely and been in other palaces than the tarasin she said finally and took the last bit of ale in her mug he had not finished half his wine yet he thought selucia had not taken above two small swallows of hers but you are not nobly born it seems i thought you must not be that i am not he told her firmly nobles he trailed off clearing his throat he could hardly tell her nobles were fools with their noses so high in the air they could not see where they were stepping she was who and what she was after all expressionless tuon studied him while pushing her empty mug to one side still studying she flickered the fingers of her left hand over her shoulder and selucia clapped her own hands together loudly several of the other patrons looked at them in surprise you called yourself a gambler tuon said and master merrilin named you the luckiest man in the world jera came running and selucia handed her the mug another quickly she commanded though not in an unkindly way still she had a regal manner to her jera dropped a hasty curtsy and scurried off again as though she had been shouted at i have luck sometimes mat said cautiously lets see whether you have any today toy tuon looked toward the table where the dice were rattling on the tabletop he could see no harm in it it was a certainty he would win more than he lost yet he thought it unlikely one of the merchants would pull a knife however much his luck was in he had not noticed anyone carrying one of those long belt knives that everybody wore farther south standing he offered tuon his arm and she rested her hand lightly on his wrist selucia left her wine on the table and stayed close to her mistress two of the altaran men one lean and bald except for a dark fringe the other roundfaced above three chins scowled when he asked whether a stranger might join the game and the third a graying stocky fellow with a pendulous lower lip went stiff as a fence post the taraboner woman was not so unfriendly of course of course why not she said her speech slightly slurred her face was flushed and the smile she directed at him had a slackness about it apparently she was one of those with no head for wine it seemed the locals wanted to keep her happy because the scowls vanished though the graying man remained woodenfaced mat fetched chairs from a nearby table for himself and tuon selucia chose to remain standing behind tuon which was just as well six people crowded the table jera arrived to curtsy and proffer a refilled mug to tuon with both hands and a murmured my lady and another serving woman graying and nearly as stout as mistress heilin replaced the wine pitcher on the gamblers table smiling the bald man filled the taraboners cup to the brim they wanted her happy and drunk she drained half the cup and with a laugh wiped her lips delicately with a laceedged handkerchief getting it back up her sleeve required two tries she would come away with no good bargains this day mat watched a little play and soon recognized the game it used four dice rather than two but without a doubt it was a version of phi match a game that had been popular for a thousand years before artur hawkwing began his rise small piles of silver admixed with a few gold coins lay in front of each of the players and it was a silver mark that he laid in the middle of the table to buy the dice while the stout man was gathering his winnings from the last toss he expected no trouble from merchants but trouble was less likely if they lost silver rather than gold the lean man matched the wager and mat rattled the crimson dice in the pewter cup then spun them out onto the table they came to rest showing four fives is that a winning toss tuon asked not unless i match it mat replied scooping the dice back into the cup without tossing a fourteen or the dark ones eyes first the dice clattered in the cup clattered across the table four fives his luck was in for sure he slid one coin over in front of himself and left the other abruptly the graying fellow scraped back his chair and stood up ive had enough he muttered and began fumbling the coins in front of him into his coat pockets the other two altarans stared at him incredulously youre leaving vane the lean man said now i said ive had enough camrin the graying man growled and went stumping out into the street pursued by camrins scowl at his back the taraboner woman leaned over unsteadily her beaded braids clicking on the tabletop to pat the fat mans wrist just means ill buy my lacquerware from you master kostelle she said fuzzily you and master camrin kostelles triple chins wobbled as he chuckled so it does mistress alstaing so it does doesnt it camrin i suppose the bald man replied grumpily i suppose he shoved a mark out to match mats once again the dice spun across the table this time they came up totaling fourteen oh tuon said sounding disappointed you lost i won precious thats a winning toss if its your first he left his original bet in the middle of the table another he said with a grin his luck was in all right as strong as it had ever been the bright red dice rolled across the table bounced across the table ricocheted off the wagered coins sometimes and toss after toss they came to rest showing fourteen white pips he made fourteen every way it could be made even at one coin to a wager the silver in front of him grew to a tidy sum half the people in the common room came to stand around the table and watch he grinned at tuon who gave him a slight nod he had missed this dice in a common room or tavern coin on the table wondering how long his luck would hold and a pretty woman at his side while he gambled he wanted to laugh with pleasure as he was shaking the dice in the cup again the taraboner merchant glanced at him and for an instant she did not look drunk at all suddenly he no longer felt like laughing her face slackened immediately and her eyes became a tad unfocused once more but for that instant they had been awls she had a much better head for wine than he had supposed it seemed camrin and kostelle would not get away with fobbing off shoddy work at top prices or whatever their scheme had been what concerned him though was that the woman was suspicious of him come to think she herself had not risked a coin against him the two altarans were frowning at him but just the way men who were losing frowned over their bad luck she thought he had found some way to cheat never mind that he was using their dice or more likely the inns dice an accusation of cheating could get a man a drubbing even in a merchants inn men seldom waited on proof of that charge one last toss he said and i think ill call it done mistress heilin the innkeeper was among the onlookers he handed her a small handful of his newwon silver coins to celebrate my good fortune serve everybody what they want to drink until those run out that brought appreciative murmurs and someone behind him clapped him on the back a man drinking your wine was less likely to believe you had bought it with cheated coin or at least they might hesitate long enough to give him a chance to get tuon out he cant keep this run going forever camrin muttered scrubbing a hand through the hair he no longer possessed what say you kostelle halves fingering a gold crown free of the coins piled in front of him he slid it over beside mats silver mark if theres only to be one more toss lets make a real wager on it bad luck has to follow this much good kostelle hesitated rubbing his chins in thought then nodded and added a gold crown of his own mat sighed he could refuse the bet but walking away now might well trigger mistress alstaings charge so could winning this toss reluctantly he pushed out silver marks to match their gold that left only two in front of him he gave the cup an extra heavy shake before spilling the dice onto the table he did not expect that to alter anything he was just venting his feelings the red dice tumbled across the tabletop hit the piled coins and bounced back spinning before they fell to a stop each showing a single pip the dark ones eyes laughing just as if it were not just their own coin won back camrin and kostelle began dividing their winnings the watchers started drifting away calling congratulations to the two merchants murmuring words of commiseration to mat some lifting the cup he was paying for in his direction mistress alstaing took a long pull at her winecup studying him over the rim to all outward appearance as drunk as a goose he doubted she thought he had been cheating any longer not when he was walking away with only one mark more than he sat down with sometimes bad luck could turn out to be good so your luck is not endless toy tuon said as he escorted her back to their table or is it that you are lucky only in small things nobody has endless luck precious myself i think that last toss was one of the luckiest ive ever made he explained about the taraboner womans suspicions and why he had bought wine for the whole common room at the table he held her chair for her but she remained standing looking at him you may do very well in seandar she said finally thrusting her nearly empty mug at him guard this until i return he straightened in alarm where are you going he trusted her not to run away but not to stay out of trouble without him there to pull her out of it she put on a longsuffering face even that was beautiful if you must know i am going to the necessary toy oh the innkeeper can tell you where it is or one of the serving women thank you toy she said sweetly id never have thought to ask she waggled her fingers at selucia and the two of them walked toward the back of the common room having one of their silent talks and giggling sitting down he scowled into his winecup women seemed to enjoy finding ways to make you feel a fool and he was halfmarried to this one where are the women thom asked dropping down into the chair beside mat and setting a nearly full winecup on the table he grunted when mat explained and went on in a low voice leaning his elbows on the table to put his head close we have trouble behind and ahead far enough ahead that it may not bother us here but best we leave as soon as they return mat sat up straight what kind of trouble some of those merchant trains that passed us the last few days brought news of a murder in jurador about the time we left maybe a day or two later its hard to be sure a man was found in his own bed with his throat ripped only there wasnt enough blood he had no need to say more mat took a long pull at his wine the bloody gholam was still following him how had it found out he was with lucas show but if it was still a day or two behind at the pace the show was making likely it would not catch up to him soon he fingered the silver foxhead through his coat at least he had a way to fight it if it did appear the thing carried a scar he had given it and the trouble ahead theres a seanchan army on the border of murandy how they assembled it without my learning about it before this he puffed out his mustaches offended by his failure well no matter everybody who passes through they make drink a cup of some herbal tea tea mat said in disbelief wheres the trouble in tea every so often this tea makes a woman go unsteady in her legs and then the suldam come and collar her but thats not the worst theyre looking very hard for a slight dark young seanchan woman well of course they are did you expect they wouldnt be this solves my biggest problem thorn when we get closer we can leave the show take to the forest tuon and selucia can travel on with luca luca will like being the hero who returned their daughter of the nine moons to them thom shook his head gravely theyre looking for an impostor mat somebody claiming to be the daughter of the nine moons except the description fits her too closely they dont talk about it openly but there are always men who drink too much and some always talk too much as well when they do they mean to kill her when they find her something about blotting out the shame she caused light mat breathed how could that be thom whatever general commands that army must know her face wouldnt he and other officers too id think there must be nobles who know her wont do her much good if they do even the lowest soldier will slit her throat or bash in her head as soon as shes found i had that from three different merchants mat even if theyre all wrong are you willing to take the chance mat was not and over their wine they began planning not that they did much drinking thom seldom did anymore for all his visits to common rooms and taverns and mat wanted a clear head luca will scream over letting us have enough horses to mount everyone whatever you pay him thom said at one point and there are packhorses for supplies if were taking to the forest then ill start buying thom by the time we have to go well have as many as we need ill wager i can find a few good animals right here vanin has a good eye too dont worry ill make sure he pays for them thom nodded doubtfully he was not so certain how reformed vanin was aludras coming with us the whitehaired man said in surprise a little later shell want to take all of her paraphernalia thatll mean more packhorses we have time thom the border of murandy is a long way yet i mean to head north into andor or east if vanin knows a way through the mountains better east any way vanin knew would be a smugglers path a horsethiefs escape route there would be much less chance of unfortunate encounters along something like that the seanchan could be almost anywhere in altara and the way north took him nearer that army than he liked tuon and selucia appeared from the back of the common room and he stood taking up tuons cloak from her chair thorn rose too lifting selucias cloak were leaving mat said trying to place the cloak around tuon selucia snatched it out of his hands i havent seen even one fight yet tuon protested too loudly any number of people turned to stare merchants and serving women ill explain outside he told her quietly away from prying ears tuon stared up at him expressionless he knew she was tough but she was so tiny like a pretty doll that it was easy to believe she would break if handled roughly he was going to do whatever was necessary to make sure she was not put in danger of being broken whatever it took finally she nodded and let selucia place the blue cloak on her shoulders thorn attempted to do the same for the yellowhaired woman but she took it away from him and donned it herself mat could not recall ever seeing her let anyone help her with her cloak the crooked street outside was empty of human life a slatribbed brown dog eyed them warily then trotted away around the nearest bend mat moved nearly as quickly in the other direction explaining as they went if he had expected shock or dismay he would have been disappointed it could be ravashi or chimal the little woman said thoughtfully as if having an entire seanchan army out to kill her were no more than an idle distraction my two nearest sisters in age aurana is too young i think only eight fourteen you would say chimal is quiet in her ambition but ravashi has always believed she should have been named just because she is older she might well have sent someone to plant rumors should i disappear for a time it is really quite clever of her if she is the one just as coolly as talking about whether it might rain this plot could be dealt with easily if the high lady were in the tarasin palace where she belongs selucia said and coolness vanished from tuon oh her face became as chill as that of an executioner but she rounded on her maid fingers flashing so furiously they should have been striking sparks selucias face went pale and she sank to her knees head down and huddling her fingers gestured briefly and tuon let her own hands fall stood looking down at the scarfcovered top of selucias head breathing heavily after a moment she bent and lifted the other woman to her feet standing very close she said something very short in that fingertalk selucia replied silently tuon made the same gestures again and they exchanged tremulous smiles tears glistened in their eyes tears will you tell me what that was all about mat demanded they turned their heads to study him what are your plans toy tuon asked at last not ebou dar if thats what youre thinking precious if one army is out to kill you then they probably all are and there are too many soldiers between here and ebou dar but dont worry ill find some way to get you back safely so you always her eyes went past him widening and he looked over his shoulder to see seven or eight men round the last bend in the street every man had an unsheathed sword in his hand their steps quickened at sight of him run tuon he shouted spinning to face their attackers thom get her away from here a knife came into either hand from his sleeves and he threw them almost as one the lefthand blade took a graying man in the eye the righthand a skinny fellow in the throat they dropped as if their bones had melted but before their swords clattered on the paving stones he had already snatched another pair of knives from his boot tops and was sprinting toward them it took them by surprise losing two of their number so quickly and him closing the distance instead of trying to flee but with him so close so quickly and them jamming against one another on that narrow street they lost most of the advantage that swords gave them over his knives not all unfortunately his blades could deflect a sword but he only bothered when someone drew back for a thrust in short order he had a fine collection of gashes across his ribs on his left thigh along the right side of his jaw a cut that would have laid open his throat had he not jerked aside in time but had he tried to flee they would have run him through from behind alive and bleeding was better than dead his hands moved as fast as ever they had short moves almost delicate flamboyance would have killed him one knife slipped into a fat mans heart and out again before the fellows knees began to crumple he sliced inside the elbow of a man built like a blacksmith who dropped his sword and awkwardly drew his belt knife with his left hand mat ignored him the fellow was already staggering from blood loss before his blade cleared the scabbard a squarefaced man gasped as mat sliced open the side of his neck he clapped a hand to the wound but he only managed to totter back two steps before he fell as men died the others gained room but mat moved faster still dancing so that a falling man shielded him from anothers sword while he closed inside the swordarc of a third to him the world consisted of his two knives and the men crowding each other to get at him and his knives sought the places where men bleed most heavily some of those ancient memories came from men who had not been very nice at all and then miracle of miracles bleeding profusely but his blood too hot to let him feel the full pain yet he was facing the last one he had not noticed before she was young and slim in a ragged dress and she might have been pretty had her face been clean had her teeth not been showing in a rictus snarl the dagger she was tossing from hand to hand had a doubleedged blade twice the length of his hand you cant hope to finish alone what the others failed in together he told her run ill let you go unharmed with a cry like a feral cat she rushed at him slashing and stabbing wildly all he could do was dance backwards awkwardly trying to fend her off his boot slid in a patch of blood and as he staggered he knew he was about to die abruptly tuon was there left hand seizing the young womans wristnot the wrist of her knife hand worse lucktwisting so the arm went stiff and the girl was forced to double over and then it mattered not at all which hand held her knife because tuons right hand swept across bladed like an axe and struck her throat so hard that he heard the cartilage cracking choking she clutched her ruined throat and sagged to her knees then fell over still sucking hoarsely for breath i told you to run mat said not sure which of the two he was addressing you very nearly let her kill you toy tuon said severely why i promised myself id never kill another woman he said wearily his blood was beginning to cool and light he hurt looks like ive ruined this coat he muttered fingering one of the bloodsoaked slashes the motion brought a wince when had he been gashed on the left arm her gaze seemed to bore into his skull and she nodded as if shehad come to some conclusion thorn and selucia were standing a little down the street in front of the reason tuon was still there better than half a dozen bodies sprawled on the paving stones thorn had a knife in either hand and was allowing selucia to examine a wound on his ribs through the rent in his coat oddly by evidence of the dark glistening patches on his coat he seemed to have fewer injuries than mat mat wondered whether tuon had taken part there too but he could not see a spot of blood on her anywhere selucia had a bloody gash down her left arm though it appeared not to hinder her im an old man thorn said suddenly and sometimes i imagine i see things that cant be but luckily i always forget them selucia paused to look up at him coolly ladys maid she might be but blood seemed not to faze her at all and what might you be trying to forget i cant recall thorn replied selucia nodded and went back to examining his wounds mat shook his head sometimes he was not entirely sure thorn still had all his wits for that matter selucia seemed a shovel shy of a full load now and then too this one cant live to be put to the question tuon drawled frowning at the woman choking and twitching at her feet and she cant talk if she somehow managed to bending fluidly she scooped up the womans knife and drove it hard beneath the womans breastbone that rasping fight for air went silent glazing eyes stared up at the narrow strip of sky overhead a mercy she did not deserve but i see no point to needless suffering i won toy you won what are you talking about you used my name before i used yours so i won mat whistled faintly through his teeth whenever he thought he knew how tough she was she found a way to show him he did not know the half if anybody happened to be looking out a window that stabbing might raise questions with the local magistrate probably lord nathin himself but there were no faces at any window he could see people avoided getting embroiled in this sort of thing if they could for all he knew any number of porters or barrowmen might have come along during the fight for a certainty they would have turned right around again as quickly as they could whether any might have gone for lord nathins guards was another question still he had no fear of nathin or his magistrate a pair of men escorting two women did not decide to attack more than a dozen carrying swords likely these fellows and the unfortunate young woman were well known to the guards limping to retrieve his thrown knives he paused in the act of pulling the blade from the graying mans eye he had not really taken in that face before everything had happened too quickly for more than general impressions carefully wiping the knife on the mans coat he tucked it away up his sleeve as he straightened our plans have changed thorn were leaving maderin as fast as we can and were leaving the show as fast as we can luca will want to be rid of us so much that hell let us have all the horses we need this must be reported toy tuon said severely failure to do so is as lawless as what they did you know that fellow thorn said mat nodded his name is vane and i dont think anybody in this town will believe a respectable merchant attacked us in the street luca will give us horses to be rid of this it was very strange the man had not lost a coin to him had not wagered a coin so why very strange indeed and reason enough to be gone quickly chapter twelve a manufactory the midday amadician sun was warm on perrins head as he rode stayer toward the roofs of almizar beneath high scudding white clouds a hundred miles southwest of amador impatient he kept the bay at a trot farms stretched as far as he could see in any direction on both sides of the road thatchroofed stone houses with gray smoke rising from the chimneys and chickens scratching in front of the barns fattailed sheep and spotted black cattle grazed in stonewalled pastures and men and boys were plowing the fields or sowing those already plowed it seemed to be laundry day he could see large kettles sitting over fires behind houses and women and girls hanging shirts and blouses and bed linens on long lines to dry there was little of wildness only scattered thickets and most of those neatly coppiced to provide firewood he reached out with his mind to find wolves and found nothing unsurprising wolves stayed clear of this many people this much tameness the breeze stiffened and he gathered his cloak around him despite the need to make a show it was plain brown wool the only silk cloak he had was lined with fur and too hot for the day his green silk coat worked in silver would have to do that and his cloak pin two wolves heads in silverandgold a gift from faile it had always seemed too ornate to wear but he had dug it out of the bottom of a chest that morning a little something to make up for the plain cloak what was surprising were the tinker caravans camped in fields scattered around the town five of them within his sight according to elyas there was always feasting when two caravans encountered one another and a meeting of three caused days of celebration but larger gatherings seldom occurred except in the summer at sunday when they had their meeting places he almost wished he had brought aram despite the risk of masema learning too much maybe if the man could spend a little time among his own people he might decide to put down his sword that was the best solution perrin could think of to a thorny problem although not likely to work aram liked the sword perhaps too well but he could not send the man away he had as good as put that sword in arams hand and now aram and the sword were his responsibility the light only knew what would become of the man if he truly went over to masema you study the tuathaan and frown my lord general khirgan drawled he could understand her speech a little better now that they had spent time together youve had problems with them in your lands we have nothing like them at home but the only trouble connected to them i know of has been locals trying to drive them away apparently theyre supposed to be great thieves she and mishima were ornate today in blue cloaks trimmed with red and yellow and red coats with blue cuffs and lapels edged in yellow three small vertical blue bars shaped like the thin plumes of a seanchan helmet on the left breast of her coat indicated her rank as two did for mishima the dozen soldiers riding behind wore their striped armor and painted helmets however and carried steeltipped lances held at precisely the same angle the cluster of failes hangerson following the seanchan also twelve in number made a brave display in tairen coats with puffy satinstriped sleeves and dark cairhienin coats with stripes of house colors across the chests yet in spite of their swords they looked much less dangerous than the soldiers and seemed to know it whenever the breeze gusted from behind it carried traces of irritation that perrin doubted came from the seanchan the soldiers scent was of stillness waiting like wolves who knew teeth might be needed soon but not now not yet ah they steal a chicken now and then general neald said with a laugh giving one of his thin waxed mustaches a twist but id not be calling them great thieves he had enjoyed the seanchan astonishment at the gateway that had brought them all here and he was still posing over it somehow managing to strut while sitting his saddle it was difficult to remember that had he not earned that black coat he would still be working his fathers farm and perhaps wondering about marriage to a neighbor girl in a year or two great theft requires courage and tinkers have not a bit of it huddled in his dark cloak balwer grimaced or perhaps smiled sometimes it was hard to tell the difference with the desiccated little man unless perrin could catch his scent the pair of them accompanied perrin in much the same way as a grayhaired suldam linked to a cooleyed damane with touches of gray in her own dark hair accompanied khirgan and mishima supposedly to balance the numbers to the seanchan suldam and damane counted as one when connected by the segmented metal leash he would have been satisfied to come with neald alone or neald and balwer at least but tallanvor had been right about seanchan and protocol the talks had dragged on for three days and while some time had been spent on whether to follow perrins plan or make it a part of something tylee would come up with with her yielding at the end only because she could find nothing bettera good part had been wasted on how many each side was to bring here it had to be the same number for each and the bannergeneral had wanted to bring a hundred of her soldiers and a pair of damane for honors sake she had been astounded that he was willing to come with less and was only willing to accept it after he pointed out that everyone among failes people was noble in his or her own lands he had the feeling she thought she had been cheated because she could not match his escorts rank with her own strange folk these seanchan oh there were sides to be sure this alliance was purely temporary not to mention delicate and the bannergeneral was just as aware of that as he twice they offered me shelter when i needed it me and my friends and asked nothing in return perrin said quietly yet what i remember best about them was when trollocs surrounded emonds field the tuathaan stood on the green with children strapped to their backs the few of their own that survived and ours they would not fightit isnt their waybut if the trollocs overran us they were ready to try to carry the children to safety carrying our children would have hampered them made escape even less likely than it already was but they asked for the task neald gave an embarrassed cough and looked away a flush tinged his cheek for all he had seen and done he was young yet just seventeen this time there was no doubt about balwers thin smile i think your life might make a story the general said her expression inviting him to tell as much of it as he would id rather my life were ordinary he told her stories were no place for a man who wanted peace one day id very much like to see some of these trollocs i keep hearing about mishima said when the silence began to stretch amusement tinged his smell yet he stroked his sword hilt perhaps without knowing it no you wouldnt perrin told him youll get your chance soon or late but you wont like it after a moment the scarred man nodded solemnly in understanding amusement melting at last he must be beginning to believe that trollocs and myrddraal were more than travelers fanciful tales if any doubts remained to him the time was coming that would erase doubt forever heading into almizar as they turned their horses toward the north end of the town along a narrow cart lane balwer slipped away medore went with him a tall woman nearly as dark as tylee but with deep blue eyes in dark breeches and a mans coat with puffy redstriped sleeves a sword at her hip balwer rode with his shoulders hunched a bird perched precariously on his saddle medore straightbacked and proud every inch a high lords daughter and leader of failes people though she followed balwer rather than riding beside surprisingly failes hangerson seemed to have accepted taking direction from the fussy little man it made them much less bother than they once had been it actually made them useful in some ways which perrin would have thought impossible the bannergeneral offered no objection to them leaving though she gazed after them thoughtfully kind of the lady to visit a servants friend she mused that was the tale balwer had given that he used to know a woman who lived in almizar and medore wanted to meet her if she was still alive medores a kind woman perrin replied its our way being kind to servants tylee gave him one glance only that yet he reminded himself not to take her for a fool it was too bad he knew nothing of seanchan ways to speak of or they might have come up with a better story but then baiwer had been in a frenzya dry dusty frenzy yet still a frenzyto seize this chance to gather information on what was happening in amadicia under the seanchan for himself perrin could barely make himself care only faile mattered now later he could worry about other matters just north of almizar the stone walls dividing seven or eight fields had been removed to make a long stretch of bare earth that appeared thoroughly turned by the harrow the dirt all scored and scuffed a large odd creature with a pair of hooded people crouched on its back was running awkwardly along that stretch on two legs that seemed spindly for its size in fact odd barely began to encompass it leathery and gray the thing was larger than a horse without counting a long snakelike neck and a thin even longer tail that it held stretched out stiffly behind as it ran it beat wings ribbed like those of a bat stretching as long as most riverships he had seen animals like this before but in the air and at a distance tylee had told him they were called raken slowly the creature lumbered into the air barely clearing the treetops of a coppiced thicket at the end of the field his head swiveled to follow as the raken climbed slowly toward the sky awkwardness vanishing in flight now that would be a thing to fly on one of those he crushed the thought ashamed and angered that he could let himself be diverted the bannergeneral slowed her bay and frowned at the field at the far end men were feeding four more of the peculiar animals holding up large baskets for them to eat from horned snouts darting and horny mouths gulping perrin hated to think what a creature that looked like that might eat they should have more raken than this here she muttered if this is all there are we take what we can get and go on he said none if it comes to that we already know where the shaido are i like to know if anything is coming up behind me she told him dryly picking up the pace again at a nearby farm that appeared to have been taken over by the seanchan a dozen or so soldiers were dicing at tables set up haphazardly in front of the thatchroofed house more were passing in and out of the stone barn though he saw no sign of horses except for a team hitched to a wagon that was being unloaded of its crates and barrels and jute sacks by a pair of men in rough woolens at least perrin assumed the others were soldiers nearly half were women the men as short as the women for the most part and thin if taller and none carried a sword but they all wore closefitting coats of skyblue and each had a pair of knives in scabbards sewn to their snug boots uniforms implied soldiers mat would be right at home with this lot he thought watching them laugh over good tosses and groan over bad those colors spun in his head and for an instant he glimpsed mat riding off a road into forest followed by a line of mounted folk and packhorses an instant only because he dashed the image aside without so much as a thought to why mat was going into the woods or who was with him only faile mattered that morning he had tied a fiftyfirst knot in the leather cord he carried in his pocket fiftyone days she had been a prisoner he hoped she had been a prisoner that long it would mean she was still alive to be rescued if she was dead his hand tightened on the head of the hammer hanging at his belt tightened until his knuckles hurt the bannergeneral and mishima were watching him he realized mishima warily with a hand hovering near his sword hilt tylee thoughtfully a delicate alliance and little trust on either side for a moment i thought you might be ready to kill the fliers she said quietly you have my word we will free your wife or avenge her perrin drew a shuddering breath and released his hold on the hammer faile had to be alive alyse had said she was under her protection but how much protection could the aes sedai give when she wore gaishain white herself lets be done here time is wasting how many more knots would he need to tie in that cord the light send not many dismounting he handed stayers reins to carlon belcelona a cleanshaven tairen with a long nose and an unfortunately narrow chin carlon had a habit of fingering that chin as if wondering where his beard had gone or running a hand over his hair as though wondering why it was tied with a ribbon at the nape of his neck making a tail that just reached his shoulders but he gave no more sign of giving up his fool pretense that he was following aiel ways than the others did balwer had given them their instructions and at least they obeyed those most of them were already drifting over to the tables leaving their mounts in the care of the rest some producing coin others offering leather flasks of wine which the soldiers were rejecting strangely though it seemed anyone with silver was welcome in their games without more than glancing in their direction perrin tucked his gauntlets behind his thick belt and followed the two seanchan inside tossing back his cloak so his silk coat showed by the time he came out failes peoplehis people he supposedwould have learned a great deal of what those men and women knew one thing he had learned from balwer knowledge could be very useful and you never knew which scrap would turn out worth more than gold for the moment though the only knowledge he was interested in would not come from this place the front room of the farmhouse was filled with tables facing the door where clerks sat poring over papers or writing the only sound was the scritching of pen on paper and a mans dry persistent cough the men wore coats and breeches of dark brown the women dresses in the exact same shade some wore pins in silver or brass in the shape of a quill pen the seanchan had uniforms for everything it seemed a roundcheeked fellow at the back of the room who wore two silver pens on his chest stood and bowed deeply belly straining his coat as soon as tylee entered their boots were loud on the wooden floor as they walked back to him between the tables he did not straighten until they reached his table tylee khirgan she said curtly i would speak with whoever is in command here as the bannergeneral commands the fellow replied obsequiously made another deep bow and hurried through a door behind him the clerk who was coughing a smoothfaced fellow younger than perrin who by his face might have come from the two rivers began hacking more roughly and covered his mouth with a hand he cleared his throat loudly but the harsh cough returned mishima frowned at him fellow shouldnt be here if hes ill he muttered what if its catching you hear about all sorts of strange sicknesses these days mans hale at sunrise and by sunfall hes a corpse and swollen to half again his size with no one knowing what he died of i heard of a woman who went mad in the space of an hour and everybody who touched her went mad too in three days she and her whole village were dead those who hadnt fled he made a peculiar gesture forming an arc with thumb and forefinger the others curled tightly you know better than to believe rumors or repeat them the bannergeneral said sharply making the same gesture she seemed unaware she had done so the stout clerk reappeared holding the door for a graying leanfaced man with a black leather patch hiding the spot where his right eye had been a puckered white scar ran down his forehead behind the patch and onto his cheek as short as the men outside he wore a coat of darker blue with two small white bars on his chest though he had the same sheaths sewn to his boots blasic faloun bannergeneral he said with a bow as the clerk hurried back to his table how may i serve you captain faloun we need to speak in tylee cut off when the man who was coughing surged to his reet his stool toppling with a clatter clutching his middle the young man doubled over and vomited a dark stream that hit the floor and broke up into tiny black beetles that went scurrying in every direction someone cursed shockingly loud in what was otherwise dead silence the young man stared at the beetles in horror shaking his head to deny them wildeyed he looked around the room still shaking his head and opened his mouth as if to speak instead he bent over and spewed another black stream longer that broke into beetles darting across the floor the skin of his face began writhing as though more beetles were crawling on the outside of his skull a woman screamed a long shriek of dread and suddenly clerks were shouting and leaping up knocking over stools and even tables in their haste frantically dodging the flitting black shapes again and again the man vomited sinking to his knees then falling over twitching disjointedly as he spewed out more and more beetles in a steady stream he seemed somehow to be getting flatter deflating his jerking ceased but black beetles continued to pour from his gaping mouth and spread across the floor at lastit seemed to have gone on for an hour but could not have been more than a minute or twoat last the torrent of insects dwindled and died what remained of the fellow was a pale flat thing inside his clothes like a wineskin that had been emptied the shouting went on of course half the clerks were up on the tables that remained upright men as well as women cursing or praying or sometimes alternating both at the tops of their lungs the other half had fled outside small black beetles scuttled all across the floor the room stank of terror i heard a rumor faloun said hoarsely sweat beaded on his forehead he smelled of fear not terror but definitely fear from east of here only that was centipedes little black centipedes some of the beetles scurried toward him and he backed away with a curse making the same odd gesture that tylee and mishima had perrin crushed the beetles under his boot they made the hair on the back of his neck want to stand but nothing mattered except faile nothing theyre just borer beetles you can find them almost anywhere theres old fallen timber the man jerked lifted his gaze and jerked again when he saw perrins eyes catching sight of the hammer at perrins belt he darted a quick startled glance at the bannergeneral these beetles came from no log theyre soulblinders work thats as may be perrin replied calmly he supposed soulblinder was a name for the dark one it makes no difference he moved his foot revealing the crushed carcasses of seven or eight of the insects they can be killed and i have no time to waste on beetles i can crush underfoot we do need to talk in private captain tylee added her scent was full of fear too yet tightly controlled mishimas hand was locked in that same strange gesture his fear was almost as well controlled as hers faloun gathered himself visibly the fear smell fading it did not go away yet he had mastery of himself now he avoided looking at the beetles however as you say bannergeneral atal get down off that table and have these these things swept out of here and see that mehtan is laid out properly for the rites however he died he died in service the stout clerk bowed before climbing down gingerly and again when he was on the floor but the captain was already turning away will you follow me bannergeneral his study might have been a bedroom originally but now it held a writing table with flat boxes full of papers and another table larger that was covered with maps weighted down by inkwells stones and small brass figures a wooden rack against one wall held rolls that appeared to be more maps the gray stone fireplace was cold faloun gestured them to half a dozen mismatched chairs that stood on the bare floor in front of the writing table and offered to send for wine he seemed disappointed when tylee refused both perhaps he wanted a drink to steady his nerves a small scent of fright still clung to him tylee began i need to replace six raken captain and eighteen moratraken and a full company of groundlings the one i had is somewhere in amadicia heading west and beyond finding faloun winced bannergeneral if you lost raken you know everything has been stripped to the bone because of his one eye flickered to perrin and he cleared his throat before going on you ask for threequarters of the animals i have left if you can possibly do with fewer perhaps only one or two four tylee said firmly and twelve fliers ill settle for that she could make that slurred seanchan accent sound crisp when she wanted to this region is as stable as seandar by all i hear but ill leave you four as you say bannergeneral faloun sighed may i see the order please everything has to be recorded since i lost the ability to fly myself i spend all my time pushing a pen like a clerk lord perrin tylee said and he produced the document signed by suroth from his coat pocket that made falouns eyebrows climb higher and higher as he read and he fingered the wax seal lightly but he did not question it any more than the bannergeneral had it appeared the seanchan were accustomed to such things he appeared relieved to hand it back though and wiped his hands on his coat unconsciously accustomed to them but not comfortably so he studied perrin trying to be surreptitious and perrin could all but see on his face the question the bannergeneral had asked who was he to have such a thing i need a map of altara captain if you have such a thing tylee said i can manage if you dont but better if you do the northwestern quarter of the country is what im interested in youre favored by the light bannergeneral the man said bending to pull a roll from the lowest level of the rack i have the very thing you want by accident it was in with the amadician maps i was issued id forgotten i had the thing until you mentioned it uncommon luck for you id say perrin shook his head slightly accident not taveren work even rand was not taveren enough to make this happen the colors whirled and he splintered them unformed once faloun had the map spread out on the map table the corners held down by brass weights in the form of raken the bannergeneral studied it until she had her landmarks fixed it was large enough to cover the table and showed exactly what she had asked for along with narrow strips of amadicia and ghealdan the terrain rendered in great detail with the names of towns and villages rivers and streams in very small letters perrin knew he was looking at a fine example of the mapmakers art far better than most maps could it be taveren work no no that was impossible theyll find my soldiers here she drawled marking a point with her finger theyre to leave immediately one flier to a raken and no personal items they fly light and as fast as possible i want them there before tomorrow night the other moratraken will travel with the groundlings i hope to be leaving in a few hours have them assembled and ready carts perrin said neald could not make a gateway large enough to accommodate a wagon whatever they bring has to be in carts not wagons faloun mouthed the word incredulously carts tylee agreed see to it captain perrin could smell an eagerness in the man that he interpreted as a desire to ask questions but all faloun said bowing was as you command bannergeneral so shall it be done the outer room was in a different sort of turmoil when they left the captain clerks darted everywhere sweeping frantically or beating at the remaining beetles with their brooms some of the women wept as they wielded their brooms some of the men looked as though they wanted to and the room was still rank with terror there was no sign of the dead man but perrin noticed that the clerks moved around the place where he had lain refusing to let a foot touch it they tried not to step on any beetles either which made for considerable dancing about on their toes when perrin crunched his way toward the outer door they stopped to stare at him outside the mood was calmer but not by much tylees soldiers still stood by their horses in a row and neald was affecting an air of casual indifference even to yawning and patting his mouth but the suldam was petting the trembling damane and murmuring soothingly and the bluecoated soldiers many more than had been there before stood in a large cluster talking worriedly the cairhienin and tairens rushed to surround perrin leading their horses and all talking at once is it true my lord camaille asked her pale face twisted with worry and her brother barmanes said uneasily four men carried out something in a blanket but they averted their eyes from whatever it was all of them atop one another all smelling of near panic they said he spewed beetles and they said the beetles chewed their way out of him and the light help us theyre sweeping beetles out of the door well be killed and burn my soul its the dark one breaking free and more that made less sense be quiet perrin said and for a wonder they fell silent usually they were very prickly with him insisting that they served faile not him now they stood staring at him waiting for him to put their fears to rest a man did spew up beetles and die but theyre ordinary beetles you can find in dead timber anywhere give you a nasty pinch if you sit on one but nothing worse likely it was the dark ones work somehow true enough but it has nothing to do with freeing the lady faile and that means it has nothing to do with us so calm yourselves and lets get on about our business strangely it worked more than one cheek reddened and the smell of fear was replacedor at least suppressedby the scent of shame at letting themselves come so near to panic they looked abashed as they began mounting their own natures reasserted themselves though first one then another offered boasts of the deeds they would do in rescuing faile each wilder than the next they knew them for wild because each boast brought laughter from the others yet the next always tried to make his more outrageous still the bannergeneral was watching him again he realized as he took stayers reins from carlon what did she see what did she think she might learn what sent all the raken away he asked we should have come here second or third she replied swinging up into her saddle i still have to acquire adam i wanted to keep believing i had a chance as long as i could but we might as well get to the heart that piece of paper faces a real test now and if it fails theres no point to going after adam a frail alliance and small trust why should it fail it worked here falouns a soldier my lord now we must talk with an imperial functionary she imbued that last word with a wealth of scorn she turned her bay and he had no choice but to mount and follow almizar was a considerable town and prosperous with six tall watchtowers around its edge but no wall elyas said amadician law forbade walls anywhere save amador a law made at the behest of the whitecloaks and enforced by them as much as by whoever held the throne balwer would no doubt learn who that might be now with ailron dead the streets were paved with granice blocks and lined with solid buildings of brick or stone some gray some black many three or four stories high and most roofed in dark slate the rest in thatch people filled the streets dodging between wagons and horse carts and handcarts hawkers crying their wares women in deep bonnets that hid their faces carrying shopping baskets men in kneelength coats striding along selfimportantly apprentices in aprons or vests running errands as many soldiers walked the streets as locals men and women with skin as dark as any tairen skin the color of honey men as pale as cairhienin but fairhaired and tall all in brightly colored seanchan uniforms most wore no more than a belt knife or dagger but he saw some with swords they walked in pairs watchful of everyone around them and had truncheons at their belts too a town watch he supposed but a lot of them for a place the size of almizar he never had fewer than two of those pairs in his sight two men and a woman came out of a tall slateroofed inn and mounted horses held by grooms he knew her for a woman only by the way her long splittailed coat fit over her bosom because her hair was cut shorter than the mens and she wore mens clothing and a sword just like the other two her face was certainly as hard as theirs as the three cantered off west down the street mishima grunted sourly hunters for the horn he muttered my eyes if theyre not those fine fellows cause trouble everywhere they go getting in fights sticking their noses where they dont belong ive heard the horn of valere has already been found what do you think my lord ive heard its been found too perrin replied cautiously there are all sorts of rumors floating about neither one so much as glanced at him and in the middle of a crowded street catching their scents was wellnigh impossible yet for some reason he thought they were mulling over his answer as if it had hidden depths light could they think be was tied up with the horn he knew where it was moiraine had carried it off to the white tower he was not about to tell them though small trust worked both ways the local people gave the soldiers no more heed than they did each other nor the bannergeneral and her armored followers but perrin was another matter at least when they noticed his golden eyes he could tell instantly when someone did the quick jerk of a womans head her mouth falling open as she stared the man who froze gaping at him one fellow actually tripped over his own boots and stumbled to his knees that one stared then scrambled to his feet and ran pushing people from his path as though fearful perrin might pursue him i suppose he never saw yellow eyes on a man before perrin said wryly are they common where you come from the bannergeneral asked not common i wouldnt say that but ill introduce you to another man who has them she and mishima exchanged glances light he hoped there was nothing in the prophecies about two men with yellow eyes those colors whirled and he dashed them the bannergeneral knew exactly where she was going a stone stable on the southern edge of the town but when she dismounted in the empty stableyard no groom came rushing out a stonefenced paddock stood next to the stable but it held no horses she handed her reins to one of her soldiers and stood staring at the stable doors only one of which was open by her scent perrin thought she was steeling herself follow my lead my lord she said finally and dont say anything you dont have to it might be the wrong thing if you must speak speak to me make it clear youre speaking to me that sounded ominous but he nodded and began planning how to steal the forkroot if things went wrong he would need to learn whether the place was guarded at night balwer might already know the little man seemed to pick up information like that without trying when he followed her inside mishima remained with the horses and looking relieved not to accompany them what did that mean or did it mean anything seanchan in just a few days they had him seeing hidden meanings in everything the place had been a stable once obviously but now it was something else the stone floor had been swept clean enough to satisfy any farmwife there were no horses and a thick smell like mint would have overwhelmed the remaining scent of horse and hay to any nose but his or elyas the stalls at the front were filled with stacked wooden crates and in the back the stalls had been removed except for the uprights that supported the loft now men and women were working back there some using mortats and pestles or sieves at tables others carefully tending flat pans sitting on metal legs above charcoal braziers using tongs to turn what appeared to be roots a lean young man in his shirtsleeves put a plump jute bag into one of the crates then bowed to tylee as deeply as the clerk had body parallel to the floor he did not straighten until she spoke bannergeneral khirgan i wish to speak with whoever is in charge if i may her tone was much different than it had been with the clerk not peremptory at all as you command the lean fellow replied in what sounded an amadician accent at least if he was seanchan he spoke at a proper speed and without chewing his words bowing again just as deeply he hurried to where six stalls had been walled in halfway down the lefthand row and tapped diffidently at a door then awaited permission before going in when he came out he went to the back of the building without so much as a glance toward perrin and tylee after a few minutes perrin opened his mouth but tylee grimaced and shook her head so he closed it again and waited a good quarter of an hour he waited growing more impatient by the heartbeat the bannergeneral smelled solidly of patience at last a sleekly plump woman in a deep yellow dress of odd cut came out of the small room but she paused to study the work going on in the back of the building ignoring tylee and him half of her scalp had been shaved bald her remaining hair was in a thick graying braid that hung to her shoulder finally she nodded in satisfaction and made her unhurried way to them an oval blue panel on her bosom was embroidered with three golden hands tylee bowed as deeply as faloun had for her and remembering her admonition perrin did the same the sleek woman inclined her head slightly she smelled of pride you wish to speak with me bannergeneral she had a smooth voice as sleek as she herself and not welcoming she was a busy woman being bothered a busy woman well aware of her own importance yes honorable tylee said respectfully a spike of irritation appeared among her smell of patience then was swallowed again her face remained expressionless will you tell me how much prepared forkroot you have on hand an odd request the other woman said as though considering whether to grant it she tilted her head in thought very well she said after a moment as of the midmorning accounting i have four thousand eight hundred seventythree pounds nine ounces a remarkable achievement if i do say it myself considering how much i have shipped off and how hard it is getting to find the plant in the wild without sending diggers unreasonable distances impossible as it seemed the pride in her scent deepened ive solved that problem however by inducing the local farmers to plant some of their fields in forkroot by this summer i will need to build something bigger to house this manufactory ill confide in you i will not be surprised if i am offered a new name for this though of course i may not accept smiling a small sleek smile she touched the oval panel lightly but it was near a caress the light will surely favor you honorable tylee murmured my lord will you do me the favor of showing your document to the honorable that with a bow to perrin markedly lower than the one she had offered the honorable the sleek womans eyebrows twitched reaching out to take the paper from his hand she froze staring at his face she had finally noticed his eyes giving hersell a small shake she read without any outward expression of surprise then folded the paper up again and stood tapping it against her free hand it seems you walk the heights bannergeneral and with a very strange companion what aid do youor heask of me forkroot honorable tylee said mildly all that you have loaded into carts as soon as possible and you must provide the carts and drivers as well i fear impossible the sleek woman snapped drawing herself up haughtily i have established strict schedules as to how many pounds of prepared forkroot are shipped every week which i have adhered to rigidly and ill not see that record sullied the harm to the empire would be immense the suldam are snapping up marattidamane on every hand forgiveness honorable tylee said bowing again if you could see your way clear to let us have bannergeneral perrin cut in plainly this was a touchy encounter and he tried to keep his face smooth but he could not avoid a frown he could not be certain that even near five tons of the stuff would be sufficient and she was trying to negotiate some lesser weight his mind raced trying to find a way fast thought was shoddy thought in his estimationit led to mistakes and accidentsbut he had no choice this may not interest the honorable of course but suroth promised death and worse if there was any hindrance to her plans i dont suppose her anger will go beyond you and me but she did say to take it all of course the honorable will not be touched by the high ladys anger tylee sounded as though she was not so sure of that the sleek woman was breathing hard the blue oval with the golden hands heaving she bowed to perrin as deeply as tylee had ill need most of the day to gather enough carts and load them will that suffice my lord it will have to wont it perrin said plucking the note from her hand she let go reluctantly and watched hungrily as he tucked it into his coat pocket outside the bannergeneral shook her head as she swung into the saddle dealing with the lesser hands is always difficult none of them see anything lesser in themselves i thought this would be in the charge of someone of the fourth or fifth rank and that would have been hard enough when i saw that she was of the third rankonly two steps below a hand to the empress herself may she live forever i was sure we wouldnt get away with more than a few hundred pounds if that but you handled it beautifully a risk taken but still beautifully masked well nobody wants to chance death perrin said as they started out of the stableyard into the town with everyone strung out behind them now they had to wait for the carts perhaps find an inn impatience burned in him the light send they did not need to spend the night you didnt know the dark woman breathed that woman knew she stood in the shadow of death as soon as she read suroths words but she was ready to risk it to do her duty to the empire a lesser hand of the third rank has standing enough that she might well escape death on the plea of duty done but you used suroths name thats all right most of the time except when addressing the high lady herself of course but with a lesser hand using her name without her title meant you were either an ignorant local or an intimate of suroth herself the light favored you and she decided you were an intimate perrin barked a mirthless laugh seanchan and maybe taveren too tell me if the question does not offend did your lady bring powerful connections or perhaps great lands that surprised him so much that he twisted in his saddle to stare at her something hit his chest hard sliced a line of fire across his chest punched his arm behind him a horse squealed in pain stunned he stared down at the arrow sticking through his left arm mishima the bannergenetal snapped pointing that fourstory building with the thatched roof between two slate roofs i saw movement on the rooftop shouting a command to follow mishima galloped off down the crowded street with six of the seanchan lancers horseshoes ringing on the paving stones people leapt out of their way others stared no one in the street seemed to realize what had happened two of the other lancers were out of their saddles tending the trembling mount of one that had an arrow jutting from its shoulder perrin fingered a broken button hanging by a thread the silk of his coat was slashed from the button across his chest blood oozed dampening his shirt trickled down his arm had he not twisted just at that moment that arrow would have been through his heart instead of his arm maybe the other would have hit him as well but the one would have done the job a two rivers shaft would not have been deflected so easily cairhienin and tairens crowded around him as he dismounted all of them trying to help him which he did not need he drew his belt knife but camaille took it from him and deftly scored the shaft so she could break it cleanly just above his arm that sent a jolt of pain down his arm she did not seem to mind getting blood on her fingers just plucking a laceedge handkerchief irom her sleeve a paler green than usual for cairhienin and wiping them then examined the end of the shaft sticking out of his arm to make sure there were no splinters the bannergeneral was down off her bay too and frowning my eyes are lowered that you have been injured my lord id heard that there has been an increase in crime of late arsons robbers killing when there was no need murders done for no reason anyone knows i should have protected you better grit your teeth my lord barmanes said tying a length of leather cord just above the arrowhead are you ready my lord perrin tightened his jaw and nodded and barmanes jerked the bloodstained shaft free perrin stifled a groan your eyes arent lowered he said hoarsely whatever that meant it did not sound good the way she said it nobody asked you to wrap me in swaddling i certainly never did neald pushed through the crowd surrounding perrin his hands already raised but perrin waved him away not here man people can see folk in the street had finally noticed and were gathering to watch murmuring excitedly to one another he can heal this so youd never know i was hurt he explained flexing his arm experimentally he winced that had been a bad idea youd let him use the one power on you tylee said disbelievingly to be rid of a hole in my arm and a slice across my chest as soon as were somewhere half the town isnt staring at us wouldnt you she shivered and made that peculiar gesture again he was going to have to ask her what that meant mishima joined them leading his horse and looking grave two men fell from that roof with bows and quivers he said quietly but it wasnt that fall that killed them they hit the pavement hard yet there was hardly any blood i think they took poison when they saw theyd failed to kill you that doesnt make any sense perrin muttered if men will kill themselves rather than report failure tylee said gravely it means you have a powerful enemy a powerful enemy very likely masema would like to see him dead but there was no way masemas reach could extend this far any enemies i have are far away and dont know where i am tylee and mishima agreed that he must know about that but they looked doubtful then again there were always the forsaken some of them had tried to kill him before others had tried to use him he did not think he was going to bring the forsaken into the discussion his arm was throbbing the cut on his chest too lets find an inn where i can hire a room fiftyone knots how many more light how many more chapter thirteen siege push them elayne shouted fireheart tried to dance impatient at being crowded in a narrow cobblestone street with other horses and women afoot but she steadied the black gelding with a firm hand birgitte had insisted she remain well back insisted as if she were a brainless fool push them burn you none of the hundreds of men on the wide guardwalk atop the city wall whitestreaked gray stone rearing fifty feet paid her any heed of course it was doubtful they heard her amid shouts of their own curses and screams the clash of steel rang over the broad street that ran alongside the wall beneath the noonday sun suspended in a rare cloudless sky as those men sweated and killed one another with sword or spear or halberd the melee spanned two hundred paces of the wall enveloping three of the high round towers where the white lion of andor flew and threatening two more though all still seemed secure thank the light men stabbed and hacked and thrust no one giving ground or quarter that she could see redcoated crossbowmen atop the towers did their share of killing but once fired a crossbow required time to ready for another shot and they were too few to turn the tide in any case they were the only guardsmen up there the rest were mercenaries save birgitte this near the bond let elaynes eye find her warder easily intricate golden braid swaying as she shouted encouragement to her soldiers pointing her bow to where reinforcement was needed in her short whitecollared red coat and wide skyblue trousers tucked into her boots she alone atop the wall wore no armor of any sort she had insisted elayne don plain gray in the hope of avoiding notice and any effort to capture or kill hersome of the men up there had crossbows or shortbows slung on their backs and for those not in the forefront and engaged fifty paces made an easy shotbut the four golden knots of rank on her own shoulder would make birgitte the target of any of arymillas men with eyes at least she was not actually mingling in the press at least she elaynes breath caught as a wiry fellow in breastplate and conical steel cap lunged at birgitte with a sword but the goldenhaired woman dodged the thrust calmlythe bond said she might have been out for a hard ride no moreand a backhand blow with her bow caught the fellow on the side of his head knocking him from the rampart he had time to scream before he hit the paving stones with a sickening splat his was not the only corpse decorating the street birgitte said men would not follow you unless they knew you were ready to face the same dangers and hardships they did but if she got herself killed with this manfoolishness elayne did not realize she had heeled fireheart forward until caseille seized her bridle i am not an idiot guardswoman lieutenant she said frigidly i have no intention of going closer until it is safe the arafellin woman jerked her hand back her face becoming very still behind the facebars of her burnished conical helmet instantly elayne felt sorry for the outburstcaseille was just doing her job but she still felt coldly angry too she would not apologize shame surged as she recognized the sulkiness of her own thoughts blood and bloody ashes but there were times she wanted to slap rand for planting these babes in her these days she could not be certain from one moment to the next which way her emotions would leap leap they did however if this is what happens to you when you get with child aviendha said adjusting the dark shawl looped over her arms i think i will never have any the highcantled saddle of her dun pushed her bulky aiel skirts high enough to bare her stockinged legs to the knee but she showed no discomfort at the display with the mare standing still she looked quite at home on a horse but then mageen daisy in the old tongue was a gentle placid animal tending to stoutness luckily aviendha was too ignorant of horses to realize that muffled laughter pulled elaynes head around the women of her bodyguard all twentyone of them assigned this morning counting caseille in polished helmets and breastplates wore smooth faces much too smooth in fact without doubt they were laughing inside but the four kinswomen standing behind them had hands over their mouths and their heads together ajise a pleasantfaced woman normally with touches of gray in her hair saw her lookingwell glaringand rolled her eyes ostentatiously which set the others off in another round of laughter caiden aplumply pretty domani laughed so hard she had to hold on to kumiko though the stout graying woman seemed to be having her own difficulties irritation stabbed at elayne not at the laughterall right a little at the laughterand certainly not at the kinswomen not very much at least they were invaluable this fight on the wall was not arymillas first assault in recent weeks by far in truth the frequency was increasing with three or four attacks coming some days now she knew very well that elayne had insufficient soldiers to hold six leagues of wall burn her elayne was all too aware that she could not even spare trained hands to fit hoardings to all those miles of wall and towers untrained hands would only bungle the work all arymilla needed was to get enough men across to seize a gate then she could bring the battle into the city where elayne would be badly outnumbered the population might rise in her favor no certain thing yet that only meant adding to the slaughter apprentices and grooms and shopkeepers fighting trained armsmen and mercenaries whoever sat on the lion throne thenand very likely that would not be elayne trakandit would be stained red with the blood of caemlyn so apart from holding the gates and leaving watchmen on the towers she had pulled all of her soldiers back into the inner city close to the royal palace and stationed men with looking glasses in the tallest spires of the palace whenever a watchman signaled an attack forming linked kinswomen made gateways to carry soldiers to the spot they took no part in the fighting of course she would not have allowed them to use the power as a weapon even had they been willing so far it had worked though often by a hair low caemlyn outside the walls was a warren of houses shops inns and warehouses that allowed men to close before they were seen three times her soldiers had been forced to fight on the ground inside the wall and to retake at least one wall tower bloody work that she would have burned low caemlyn to the ground to deny arymillas people cover except that the fire might easily spread inside the walls and spawn a conflagration spring rains or no spring rains as it was every night saw arsons inside the city and containing chose was difficult enough besides people lived in those houses despite the siege and she did not want to be remembered as the one who had destroyed their homes and livelihoods no what nettled her was that she had not thought of using the kin that way earlier if she had she would not be saddled with sea folk still not to mention a bargain that gave up a square mile of andor light a square mile her mother had never given up one inch of andor burn her this siege hardly gave her time to mourn her mother or lini her old nursemaid rahvin had murdered her mother and likely lini had died trying to protect her whitehaired and thin with age lini would not have backed down even for one of the forsaken but thinking of lini made her hear the womans reedy voice you cant put honey back in the comb child what was done was done and she had to live with it thats it then caseille said theyre making for the ladders it was true all along the wall elaynes soldiers were pushing forward arymillas falling back climbing through the crenels where their ladders were propped men still died on the rampart but the fight was ending elayne surprised herself by digging her heels into firehearts flanks no one was quick enough to catch her this time pursued by shouts she galloped across the street and flung herself out of the saddle at the base of the nearest tower before the gelding was fully halted pushing open the heavy door she gathered her divided skirts and raced up the widdershins spiraling stairs past large niches where clusters of armored men stared in amazement as she darted by these towers were made to be defended against attackers trying to make their way down and into the city at last the stairs opened into a large room where stairs on the other side spiraled upward in the opposite direction twenty men in mismatched helmets and breastplates were taking their ease tossing dice sitting against the wall calking and laughing as if there were no dead men beyond the rooms two ironstrapped doors whatever they were doing they stopped to gape when she appeared uh my lady i wouldnt do that a rough voice said as she laid hands on the iron bar across one of the doors ignoring the man she turned the bar on its pivot pin and pushed the door open a hand caught at her skirt but she pulled free none of arymillas men remained on the wall none standing at least dozens of men lay on the bloodstreaked guardwalk some still others groaning any number of those might belong to arymilla but the ringing of steel had vanished most of the mercenaries were tending the wounded or just squatting on their heels to catch their breath shake them off and pull up the bloody ladders birgitte shouted loosing an arrow into the mass of men trying to flee down the dirtpaved low caemlyn street below the wall she nocked another and fired again make them build more if they want to come again some of the mercenaries leaned through crenels to obey but only a handful i knew i shouldnt have let you come along today she went on still loosing shafts as fast as she could nock and draw crossbow bolts from the towertops struck down men below as well but tileroofed warehouses offered shelter here for any who could get inside it took a moment for elayne to realize that last comment had been directed at her and her face heated and how would you have stopped me she demanded drawing herself up quiver empty birgitte lowered her bow and turned with a scowl by tying you up and having her sit on you she said nodding toward aviendha who was striding out of the tower the glow of saidar surrounded her yet her hornhilted belt knife was in her fist caseille and the rest of the guardswomen spilled out behind her swords in hand and faces grim seeing elayne unharmed changed their expressions not a whit those bloody women were insufferable when it came to treating her like a blown glass vase that might break at the rap of a knuckle they would be worse than ever after this and she would have to suffer it i would have caught you aviendha muttered rubbing her hip except that fool horse tossed me off that was highly unlikely with such a placid mare aviendha had simply managed to fall off seeing the situation she slipped her knife back into its sheath quickly trying to pretend she had never had it out the light of saidar vanished too i was quite safe elayne tried to remove the acerbic touch from her voice without much success min said i will bear my babes sister until theyre born no harm can come to me aviendha nodded slowly thoughtfully but birgitte growled id just as soon you didnt put her visions to the test take too many chances and you might prove her wrong that was foolish min was never wrong surely not that was aldin miheres company a tall mercenary said in a lilting if rough murandian accent as he removed his helmet to reveal a lean sweaty face with graystreaked mustaches waxed to spikes rhys abalaman as he called himself had eyes like stones and a thinlipped smile that always seemed a leer he had been listening to their conversation and he kept darting sideways glances at elayne while he talked to birgitte i recognized him i did good man miheres i fought alongside him more times than i can number i have hed almost made it to that warehouse door when your arrow took him in the neck captaingeneral a shame that elayne frowned he made his choice as you did captain you may regret the death of a friend but i hope you arent regretting your choice most of the mercenaries she had put out of the city maybe all had signed on with arymilla her greatest fear at present was that the woman would succeed in bribing companies still inside the walls none of the mercenary captains had reported anything but mistress harfor said approaches had been made including an approach to abalaman the murandian favored her with his leer and a formal bow flourishing a cloak he was not wearing oh i fought against him as often as with my lady id have killed him or hed have killed me had we come face to face this fine day more acquaintance than friend you see and id much rather take gold to defend a wall like this than to attack it i notice some of your men have crossbows on their backs captain but i didnt see any using them not the mercenary way birgitte said dryly irritation floated in the bond though whether with abalaman or elayne there was no way to know the sensation vanished quickly birgitte had learned to master her emotions once they discovered how she and elayne mirrored one another through the bond very likely she wished elayne could do the same but then so did elayne abalaman rested his helmet on his hip you see my lady the way of it is if you press a man too hard when hes trying to get off the field attempting to ride him down and the like well the next time its you trying to get off the field he might return the favor after all if a mans leaving the field then hes out of the fight now isnt he until he comes back tomorrow elayne snapped the next time i want to see those crossbows put to work as you say my lady abalaman said stiffly making an equally stiff bow if youll pardon me i must be seeing to my men he stalked off without waiting on her pardon shouting to his men to stir their lazy stumps how far can he be trusted elayne asked softly as far as any mercenary birgitte replied just as quietly if someone offers him enough gold it becomes a toss of the dice and not even mat cauthon could say how theyll land that was a very odd remark she wished she knew how mat was and dear thom and poor little olver every night she offered prayers that they had escaped the seanchan safely there was nothing she could do to help them though she had enough on her plate trying to help herself at the moment will he obey me about the crossbows birgitte shook her head and elayne sighed it was bad to give orders that would not be obeyed it put people in the habit of disobeying moving close she spoke in a near whisper you look tired birgitte this was nothing for anyone elses ears birgittes face was tight her eyes haggard anyone could see that but the bond said she was boneweary as it had for clays now but then elayne felt that same dragging tiredness as though her limbs were made of lead their bond mirrored more than emotions you dont have to lead every counterattack yourself and who else is there for a moment weariness larded birgittes voice too and her shoulders actually slumped but she straightened quickly and strengthened her tone it was pure willpower elayne could feel it stone hard in the bond so hard she wanted to weep my officers are inexperienced boys birgitte went on or else men who came out of retirement and should still be warming their bones in front of their grandchildrens fireplace except for the mercenary captains anyway and there isnt one id trust without someone looking over his shoulder which brings us back to who else but me elayne opened her mouth to argue not about the mercenaries birgitte had explained about them bitterly and at great length at times mercenaries would fight as hard as any guardsman but other times they pulled back rather than take too many casualties fewer men meant less gold for their next hire unless they could be replaced with men as good battles that could have been won had been lost instead because mercenaries left the field to preserve their numbers they disliked doing it if anybody except their own kind was watching though that spoiled their reputation and lowered their hire price but there had to be someone else she could not afford birgitte falling over from exhaustion light she wished gareth bryne were there egwene needed him but so did she she opened her mouth and suddenly rumbling booms crashed from the city behind her she turned and her mouth stayed open gaping in astonishment now where moments before there had been clear sky over the inner city a huge mass of black clouds loomed like sheersided mountains forked lightning slashing down through a gray wall of rain that seemed as solid as the city walls the gilded domes of the royal palace that should have been glittering in the sun were invisible behind that wall that torrent fell only over the inner city everywhere else the sky remained bright and cloudless there was nothing natural in that amazement lasted only moments though that silverblue lightning threetined fivetined was striking inside caemlyn causing damage and maybe deaths how had those clouds come to be she reached to embrace saiciar to disperse them the true source slipped away from her and then again it was like trying to grasp a bead buried in a pot of grease just when she thought she had it it squirted away it was like this far too often now aviendha will you deal with that please of course aviendha replied embracing saidar easily elayne stifled a surge of jealousy her difficulty was rands bloody fault not her sisters and thank you i need the practice that was untrue an attempt to spare her feelings aviendha began weaving air fire water and earth in complex patterns and doing so nearly as smoothly as she herself could have if much more slowly her sister lacked her skill with weather but then she had not had the advantage of sea folk teaching the clouds did not simply vanish of course first the lightnings became single bolts dwindled in number then ceased that was the hardest part calling lightning was twirling a feather between your fingers compared to stopping it that was more like picking up a blacksmiths anvil in your hands then the clouds began to spread out to thin and grow paler thar was slow too doing too much too fast with weather could cause effecrs that rippled across the countryside for leagues and you never knew what the effects might be raging storms and flash floods were as likely as balmy days and gentle breezes by the time the clouds had spread far enough to reach the outer walls of caemlyn they were gray and dropping a steady soaking downpour that quickly slicked elaynes curls to her scalp is that enough smiling aviendha turned her face up to let the rain run down her cheeks i love to watch water falling from rhe sky light you would think she had had enough of rain it had rained nearly every bloody day since spring came its time to be getting back to the palace elayne birgitte said tucking her bowstring into her coat pocket she had begun unstringing her bow as soon as the clouds began moving toward them some of these men need a sisters attention and my breakfast seems two days past elayne scowled the bond carried a wariness that told her all she needed to know they must return to the palace to get elayne in her delicate condition out of the rain as if she might melt abruptly she became aware of the groans from the wounded and her face grew hot those men did need a sisters attention even if she could hold on to saidar the least of their injuries were beyond her modest abilities and aviendha was no better at healing yes it is time she said if only she could get her emotions back under control birgitte would be pleased at that too spots of color decorated her cheeks too echoes of elaynes shame they looked very odd with the frown she wore as she hurried elayne into the tower fireheart and mageen and the other horses were all standing patiently where their reins had been dropped as elayne expected even mageen was well trained they had the wall street utterly to themselves until alise and the other kin walked out of the narrower way there was not a cart or wagon to be seen every door in sight was tightly shut every window curtained though there might well be no one behind any of them most people had had sense enough to leave as soon they caught a glimmering that hundreds of men were about to start swinging swords in their vicinity one curtain twitched a womans face showed for a moment then vanished some others took ghoulish delight in watching talking quietly among themselves the four kinswomen took their places where they had opened their gateway some hours earlier they eyed the corpses in the street and shook their heads but these were not the first dead men they had seen not one would have been allowed to test for accepted yet they were calm sure of themselves as dignified as sisters despite the rain soaking their hair and dresses learning egwenes plans for the kin to be associated with the tower and a place for aes sedai to retire had lessened their fears over their future especially once they found out that their rule would remain in place and the former aes sedai would have to follow it too not all believed over the last month seven of their number had run away without leaving so much as a noteyet most did and took strength from belief having work to do had restored their pride elayne had not realized that had been dented until they stopped seeing themselves as refugees wholly dependent on her they held themselves straighter now worry had vanished from their faces and they were not so quick to bend their necks for a sister unfortunately though that part of it really had begun earlier they once had considered aes sedai superior to mortal flesh but had learned to their dismay that the shawl did not make a woman more than she was without it alise eyed elayne compressing her lips for a moment and adjusting her brown skirts unnecessarily she had argued against elayne being allowedallowedto come here and birgitte had almost given way alise was a forceful woman are you ready for us captaingeneral she said we are elayne said but alise waited until birgitte nodded before linking with the other three kinswomen she ignored elayne after that one glance really nynaeve should never have begun trying to put some backbone into them as she had put it when she could lay hands on nynaeve again she was going to have words with the woman the familiar vertical slash appeared and seemed to rotate into a view of the main stableyard in the palace a hole in the air nearly four paces by four but the view through the opening of the tall arched doors of one of the white marble stables was a little offcenter from what she expected when she rode onto the raindrenched flagstones of the stableyard she saw why there was another gateway slightly smaller open if you tried to open a gateway where one already existed yours was displaced just enough that the two did not touch though the gap between was thinner than a razors edge from that other gateway a twinned column of men seemed to be riding out of the stableyards outer wall curving away to exit the stableyard through the open ironstrapped gates some wore burnished helmets and breastplates or plateandmail but every man had on the whitecollared red coat of the queens guard a tall broadshouldered man with two golden knots on the left shoulder of his red coat stood in the rain watching them helmet balanced on his hip thats a sight to soothe sore eyes birgitte murmured small groups of kinswomen were scouring the countryside for anyone trying to come to elaynes support but it was a chancy business thus far the kinswomen had brought word of dozens and dozens of groups trying to find a way into the city yet they had only managed to locate five bands totaling fewer than a thousand word had spread of how many men arymilla had around the city and men supporting trakand were skittish about being found about who might do the finding as soon as elayne and the others appeared redclad grooms with the white lion on their left shoulders came running a scrawny gaptoothed fellow with a fringe of white hair took firehearts bridle while a lean graying woman held elaynes stirrup for her to dismount ignoring the downpour she strode toward the tall man splashing water with every step his hair hung every which way over his face clinging wetly but she could see he was young well short of his middle years the light shine on you lieutenant she said your name how many did you bring and from where through that smaller opening she could see a line of horsemen extending out of sight among tall trees whenever a pair rode through another appeared at the far end of the column she would not have believed that many of the guards remained anywhere charlz guybon my queen he replied sinking to one knee and pressing a gauntleted fist to the flagstones captain kindlin in aringill gave me permission to try reaching caemlyn that was after we learned lady naean and the others had escaped elayne laughed stand man stand im not queen yet aringill there had never been so many of the guards there as you say my lady he said as he regained his feet and made a bow that was more proper for the daughterheir can we continue this inside birgitte put in irritably guybon took in her coat with its gold stripes on the cuffs and knots of rank and offered a salute that she returned with a quick arm across her chest if he was surprised to see a woman as captaingeneral he was wise enough not to show it im soaked to the skin and so are you elayne aviendha was right behind her shawl wrapped around her head and not looking so pleased with rain now that her white blouse clung wetly and her dark skirts hung with water the guardswomen were leading their horses toward one of the stables except for the eight who would remain with elayne until their replacements arrived guybon made no comment on them either a very wise man elayne allowed herself to be hustled as far as the simple colonnade that offered entrance to the palace itself even here the guardswomen surrounded her four ahead and four behind so she felt a prisoner once out of the rain though she balked she wanted to know she tried again to embrace saidarremoving the moisture from her clothes would be a simple matter with the powerbut the source skittered away once more aviendha did not know the weave so they had to stand there dripping the plain iron standlamps along the wall were still unlit and with the rain the space was dim guybon raked his hair into a semblance of order with his fingers light he was little short of beautiful his greenish hazel eyes were tired but his face seemed suited to smiling he looked as if he had not smiled in too long captain kindlin said i could try to find men who d been discharged by gaebril my lady and they started flocking in as soon as i put out the call youd be surprised how many tucked their uniforms into a chest against the day they might be wanted again a good many carried off their armor too which they shouldnt have done strictly speaking but im glad they did i feared id waited too long when i heard of the siege i was considering trying to fight my way to one of the city gates when mistress zigane and the others found me a puzzled look came over his face she became very upset when i called her aes sedai but that has to be the one power that brought us here it was and she isnt elayne said impatiently how many man four thousand seven hundred and sixtytwo of the guards my lady and i encountered a number of lords and ladies who were trying to reach caemlyn with their armsmen be content i made sure they were loyal to you before i let them join me there are none from the great houses but they bring the total near to ten thousand my lady he said that as if it were of no moment at all there are forty horses fit for riding in the stable i have brought you ten thousand soldiers elayne laughed and clapped her hands in delight wonderful captain guybon wonderful arymilla still had her outnumbered but not so badly as before guardsman lieutenant my lady i am a lieutenant from this moment you are captain guybon and my second birgitte added at least for the present youve shown resourcefulness youre old enough to have experience and i need both guybon seemed overwhelmed bowing and murmuring stammered thanks well a man of his age would normally expect to serve at least ten or fifteen more years before being considered for captain much less second to the captaingeneral however temporary and now its past time for us to be getting into dry clothes birgitte continued especially you elayne the warder bond carried an implacable firmness that suggested she might try dragging elayne if she dallied temper flared hot and sharp but elayne fought it down she had nearly doubled the number of her soldiers and she would not let anything spoil this day besides she wanted dry clothes too chapter fourteen wet things inside the gilded standlamps were lit since daylight never penetrated far into the palace flames flickering on the lamps that lacked glass mantles the lamps mirrors provided a good light in the bustling corridor though and bustling it was with liveried servants scurrying in every direction or sweeping or mopping serving men with the white lion on the left breast of their red coats were up on tall ladders taking down the winter tapestries mainly flowers and scenes of summer and putting up the spring tapestries many displaying the colorful foliage of fall always two seasons ahead for the majority of the hangings was the custom to provide a touch of relief from winters cold or summers heat to remind while springs new growth was on all the trees that the branches would grow bare and the snows come again to remind when dead leaves were falling and the first snows too and days grew ever colder that there would be a spring there were a few battles among them showing days of particular glory for andor but elayne did not enjoy looking at those as much as she had as a girl still they had their place now as well tokens of what battle actually was the difference between how a child looked at things and a woman did glory was always bought with blood glory aside necessary things were often paid for with battle and blood there were too few servants to carry out such tasks in a timely manner and a fair number were whitehaired pensioners with bent backs who seldom moved quickly in any case however slow they were she was glad they had willingly come out of retirement to train those newly hired and take up the slack left by those who had fled while gaebril reigned or after rand took caemlyn else the palace would have taken on the aspect of a barn by this time a dirty barn at least all of the winter runners were up off the floors she left a damp trail behind her on the redandwhite floor tiles and with all the spring rains wet runners would have been sprouting mildew before nightfall servants in redandwhite hurrying about their duties looked aghast as they bowed or curtsied which did nothing for her temper they did not appear upset to see aviendha or birgitte drenched and dripping or the guardswomen either burn her if everyone did not stop expecting her to be mollycoddled all the day long her scowl was such that the servants began making their courtesies quickly and scurrying on her temper was becoming the stuff of evening stories in front of the fireplace though she tried not to unleash it on servants on anyone really but more so with servants they lacked the luxury of shouting back she intended to go straight to her apartments and change but intentions or no she turned aside when she saw reanne corly walking in a crossing corridor where the floor tiles were all red the servants reactions had nothing to do with it she was not being stubborn she was wet and she wanted dry clothing and a warm towel in the worst way but seeing the kinswoman was a surprise and the two women with reanne also caught her eye birgitte muttered a curse before following her swishing her bowstave sideways through the air as though thinking of striking someone the bond carried a blend of longsuffering and irritability soon stifled aviendha never left elaynes side though busily trying to wring water out of her shawl despite all the rain she had seen all the rivers since crossing the spine of the world and the great cisterns beneath the city aviendha winced at the waste the water splashing uselessly on the floor the eight guardswomen left behind by her sudden swerve hurried to catch up stolid and silent except for the stamp of their boots on the floor tiles give anyone a sword and boots and they began stamping one of the women with reanne was kara defane who had been the wise woman or healer of a fishing village on toman head before the seanchan collared her plump and merryeyed in brown wool with embroidered blue and white flowers at her cuffs kara appeared little older than elayne though she was nearly fifty the other was named jillari a former damane from seanchan despite everything the sight of her made elaynes flesh feel cold whatever else could be said of her the woman was seanchan after all not even jillari herself knew how old she was though she appeared just into her middle years slight of build with long fiery red hair and eyes as green as aviendhas she and marille the other seanchanborn damane who remained in the palace persisted in maintaining that they still were damane that they needed to be collared because of what they could do daily walks were one way the kin were trying to accustom them to freedom carefully supervised walks of course they were always closely watched day and night either might try to free the suldam otherwise for that matter kara herself was not trusted alone with any of the suldam nor was lemore a young taraboner noble collared when tanchico fell the notion would not come to them on its own yet there was no saying what either would do if a suldam ordered her to help the woman escape the habit of obedience remained strong in kara and lemore both jillaris eyes widened at the sight of elayne and she immediately fell to her knees with a thud she tried to fold herself into a bundle on the floor but kara caught her shoulders and gently urged her back to her feet elayne tried not to let her distaste show and hoped that if it did everyone would take it for the kneeling and crouching some of it was how could anyone want to be collared she heard linis voice again and shivered you cant know another womans reasons until youve worn her dress for a year burn her if she had any desire to do that no need for all that kara said this is what we do she curtsied not very gracefully she had never seen a town larger than a few hundred people before the seanchan took her after a moment the redhaired woman spread her own dark blue skirts more awkwardly still she almost fell over in fact and blushed a bright crimson jillari is sorry she almost whispered folding her hands at her waist her eyes she kept meekly directed at the floor jillari will try to remember i kara said remember what i told you i call you jillari but you call yourselfl or me try it and look at me you can do it she sounded as though she were encouraging a child the seanchan woman wet her lips giving kara a sidelong look i she said softly and promptly began weeping tears rolling down her cheeks faster than she could wipe them away with her fingers kara enveloped her in a hug and made soothing noises she seemed about to cry too aviendha shifted uncomfortably it was not the tearsmen or women aiel wept unashamed when they felt the needbut for them touching hands was a great display in public why dont you two walk on alone for a while reanne told the pair with a comforting smile that deepened the fine lines at the corners of her blue eyes her voice was high and lovely suitable for singing ill catch you up and we can eat together they offered her curtsies too jillari still weeping and turned away with karas arm around the smaller womans shoulders if you care to my lady reanne said before they had gone two steps we could talk on the way to your apartments the womans face was calm and her tone put no special freight on the words yet elaynes jaw tightened she forced it to relax there was no point in being stubborn stupid she was wet and beginning to shiver though the day could hardly be called cold an excellent suggestion she said gathering her sodden gray skirts come we could walk a little faster birgitte muttered not quite far enough under her breath we could run aviendha said without trying to keep her voice low at all we might get dry from the exertion elayne ignored them and glided at a suitable pace in her mother it would have been called regal she was not sure she managed that but she was not about to run through the palace or even hurry the sight of her rushing would start a dozen rumors if not a hundred each one of some dire event worse than the one before too many rumors floated on every breath of air as it was the worst was that the city was about to fall that she planned to flee before it did no she would be seen to be utterly unruffled everyone had to believe her completely confident even if that was a false facade anything else and she might as well yield to arymilla fear of defeat had lost as many battles as weakness had and she could not afford to lose a single one i thought the captaingeneral had you out scouting reanne birgitte had been using two of the kin for scouts women who could not make a gateway large enough to admit a horse cart but with circles of kinswomen available to make gateways for trade as well as moving soldiers she had coopted the remaining six who could travel on their own an encircling army was no impediment to them yet reannes wellcut fine blue wool though unadorned save for a redenameled circle pin on the high neck was decidedly unsuited for skulking about the countryside the captaingeneral believes her scouts need rest unlike herself reanne added blandly raising an eyebrow at birgitte the bond carried a brief flash of annoyance aviendha laughed for some reason elayne still did not understand aiel humor tomorrow i go out again it takes me back to the days long ago when i was a packpeddler with one mule the kin all followed many crafts during their long lives always changing location and craft before anyone took note of how slowly they aged the oldest among them had mastered half a dozen crafts or more shifting from one to another easily i decided to use my freeday helping jillari settle on a surname reanne grimaced its custom in seanchan to strike a girls name from her familys rolls when shes collared and the poor woman feels she has no right to the name she was born with jillari was given with the collar but she wants to keep that there are more reasons to hate the seanchan than i can count elayne said heatedly then belatedly she caught up to the import of it all learning to curtsy choosing a new surname burn her if pregnancy was making her slowwitted on top of everything else when did jillari change her mind about the collar there was no reason to let everyone know she was being dense today the other womans expression did not alter a whit but she hesitated just long enough to let elayne know her deception had failed just this morning after you and the captaingeneral left or youd have been informed reanne hurried on so the point had no time to fester and theres other news as good at least its somewhat good one of the suldam marli noichinyou recall herhas admitted seeing the weaves oh that is good news elayne murmured very good twentyeight more to go but they might be easier now that one of them has broken she had watched an attempt to convince marli that she could learn to channel that she could already see weaves of the power the plump seanchan woman had been stubbornly defiant even after she began crying somewhat good i said reanne sighed in marlis opinion she might as well have admitted she kills children now she insists that she must be collared she begs for the adam it makes my skin creep i dont know what to do with her send her back to the seanchan as soon as we can elayne replied reanne stopped dead in shock her eyebrows climbing birgitte cleared her throat loudlyimpatience filled the bond before being stifledand the kinswoman gave a start then began walking again at a faster pace than before but theyll make her a damane i cant condemn any woman to that elayne gave her warder a look that slid off like a dagger sliding off good armor birgittes expression was bland to the goldenhaired woman being a warder contained strong elements of older sister and worse sometimes mother can she said emphatically lengthening her own stride well it would not hurt to get dry a little sooner rather than later she helped hold enough others prisoner that she deserves a taste of it herself reanne but thats not why i mean to send her back if any of the others wants to stay and learn and make up for what shes done i certainly wont hand her to the seanchan but lights truth i hope they all feel like marli theyll put an adam on her reanne but they wont be able to keep secret who she was every onetime suldam i can send the seanchan to collar will be a mattock digging at their roots a harsh decision reanne said sadly she plucked at her skirts in an agitated manner smoothed them then plucked at them again perhaps you might consider thinking on it for a few days surely it isnt anything that has to be done immediately elayne gritted her teeth the woman had as much as implied that she had reached this decision in one of her swinging moods but had she it seemed reasonable and logical they could not keep the suldam imprisoned forever sending those who did not want to be free back to the seanchan was a way to be rid of them and strike a blow at the seanchan at the same time it was more than hatred of any seanchan of course it was burn her but she bloody well hated being unsure whether her own decisions were sound she could not afford to make unsound decisions still there was no hurry better to send back a group if possible in any event there was less chance of someone arranging an accident that way she did not put that sort of thing past the seanchan i will think on it reanne but i doubt ill change my mind reanne sighed again deeply eager for her promised return to the white tower and novice whiteshe had been heard to say she envied kirstian and zaryashe wanted very much to enter the green ajah but elayne had her doubts reanne was kindhearted softhearted in fact and elayne had never met any green who could be called soft even those who seemed frilly or frail on the surface were cold steel inside ahead of them vandene glided from a crossing corridor slender whitehaired and graceful in dark gray wool with deep brown trim and turned in the same direction they were going apparently without noticing them she was green and as hard as a hammerhead jaem her warder walked beside her head bent in close conversation now and then raking a hand through his thinning gray hair gnarled and lean his dark green coat hanging loose on him he was old but every scrap as hard as she an old root that could dull axes kirstian and zarya both in plain novice white followed meekly with their hands folded at their waists the one pale as a cairhienin the other short and slimhipped for runaways who had succeeded in what so few did remaining free of the white tower for years over three hundred years in kirstians case they had resettled into their places as novices with remarkable ease but then the kins rule was a blending of the rules that governed novices and those that accepted lived by perhaps to them the white woolen dresses and the loss of freedom to come and go as they chose were the only real change though the kin regulated that last to some extent im very glad she has those two to occupy her reanne murmured in tones of sympathy pained caring shone in her eyes its good that she mourns her sister but i fear shed be obsessed with adeleas death without kirstian and zarya she may be anyway i believe that dress shes wearing belonged to adeleas ive tried offering solacei have experience helping people overcome grief ive been a village wise woman as well as wearing the red belt in ebou dar many years ago but she wont give me two words in fact vandene wore only her dead sisters clothing now and adeleas flowery perfume as well at times elayne thought vandene was trying to become adeleas to offer up herself in order to bring her sister back to life but could you fault someone for being obsessed with finding who had murdered her sister not that more than a handful of people knew that was what she was doing everyone else believed as reanne did that she was absorbed with teaching kirstian and zarya that and beginning their punishment for running away vandene was doing both of course and with a will yet it was really just a cover for her true purpose elayne reached out without looking and found aviendhas hand waiting to take hers a comforting grip she squeezed back unable to imagine the grief of losing aviendha they shared a quick glance and aviendhas eyes mirrored her own feelings had she really once thought aiel faces impassive and unreadable as you say reanne she has kirstian and zarya to occupy her reanne was not among the handful who knew the truth we all mourn in our own way vandene will find solace along her own path when she found adeleas murderer it was to be hoped if that failed to at least begin assuaging the pain well that was to be faced when it must be for now she must allow vandene her head especially since she had no doubt the green would ignore any attempt to rein her in that was more than irritating it was infuriating she had to watch vandene perhaps destroying herself and worse make use of it having no alternative made that no less unpalatable as vandene and her companions turned aside down another hallway reene harfor appeared out of a side corridor right in front of elayne a stout quiet woman with a graying bun atop her head and an air of regal dignity her formal scarlet tabard with the white lion of andor as always looking freshly ironed elayne had never seen her with a hair out of place or looking even slightly the worse for a long day spent overseeing the workings of the palace and more besides her round face appeared puzzled for some reason but it took on a look of concern at the sight of elayne why my lady youre drenched she said sounding shocked as she made her curtsy you need to get out of those wet things right away thank you mistress harfor elayne said through her teeth i hadnt noticed she regretted the outburst instantlythe first maid had been as faithful to her as to her motherbut what made matters worse was that mistress harfor took her flareup in stride never so much as blinking elayne trakands moods were no longer anything to be surprised at i will walk with you if i may my lady she said calmly falling in at elaynes side a freckled young serving woman carrying a basket of folded bed linens began to offer her courtesies only a hair more directed at elayne than the first maid but reene made a quick gesture that sent the girl scurrying before she completed bending her knees perhaps it was just to keep her from overhearing reene did not stop talking three of the mercenary captains are demanding to meet with you i put them in the blue reception room and told the servants to keep watch so no small valuables accidentally fall into their pockets not that i had to as it turned out careane sedai and sareitha sedai appeared soon after and settled in to keep the captains company captain mellar is with them too elayne frowned mellar she was trying to keep him too busy for mischief yet he had a way of turning up where and when she least wanted him for that matter so did careane and sareitha one of them had to be the black ajah killer unless it was merilille and she was beyond reach it seemed reene knew about that keeping her in the dark would have been criminal she had eyes everywhere and they might notice a vital clue what do the mercenaries want mistress harfor more money is my guess birgitte growled and swung her unstrung bow like a club most likely reene agreed but they refused to tell me her mouth tightened slightly no more than that yet it seemed these mercenaries had managed to offend her if they were stupid enough not to see that she was more than a superior serving woman then they were very dense indeed has dyelin returned elayne asked and when the first maid said not added then i will see these mercenaries as soon as ive changed clothes she might as well get them out of the way rounding a corner she found herself facetoface with two of the windfinders and barely suppressed a sigh the sea folk were the last people on earth she wanted to confront right then lean and dark and barefoot in red brocaded silk trousers and a blue brocaded silk blouse with a green sash tied in an elaborate knot chanelle din seran white shark was aptly named elayne had no idea what a white shark looked likeit might well have been a little thingbut chanelles big eyes were hard enough to belong on a fierce predator especially when she took in aviendha there was bad blood there a tattooed hand raised the gold piercework scent box hanging on a chain about chanelles neck and she inhaled the sharp spicy scent deeply as though covering some foul odor aviendha laughed out loud which made chanelles full lips grow thin thinner at least thin was beyond them the other was renaile din calon once windfinder to the mistress of the ships in blue linen trousers and a red blouse sashed with blue tied in a much less intricate knot both women wore the long white mourning stoles for nesta din reas yet renaile must have felt nestas death most keenly she was carrying a carved wooden writing box with a capped ink jar set in one corner and a sheet of paper with a few scrawled lines clipped to its top wings of white in her black hair hid the six gold earrings in her ears much thinner rings than the eight she had worn before learning of nestas fate and the gold honor chain crossing her dark left cheek looked stark supporting only the medallion that named her clan after sea folk custom nestas death had meant starting over for renaile with no more rank than a woman raised from apprentice on the day she herself had put off her honors her face still held dignity though much subdued now that she was acting as chanelles secretary i am on my way elayne began but chanelle cut her off imperiously what news do you have of talaan and of merilille are you even trying to find them elayne took a deep breath shouting at chanelle never did any good the woman was more than willing to shout back and seldom willing to listen to reason she would not engage in another screaming match servants slipping by to either side did not pause to offer bows or curtsiesthey could sense the mood herebut they shot grim looks at the sea folk women that was pleasing though it should not have been however upsetting they were the windfinders were guests in a way they were bargain or no bargain chanelle had complained more than once of slowfooted servants and tepid bathwater and that was pleasing too still she would maintain her dignity and civility the news is the same as yesterday she replied in tones of moderation well she attempted tones of moderation if traces of sharpness remained the windfinder would have to live with them the same as last week and the week before that inquiries have been made at every inn in caemlyn your apprentice is not to be found merilille is not to be found it seems they must have managed to leave the city the gate guards had been warned to watch for a sea folk woman with tattooed hands but they would not have tried to stop an aes sedai leaving or taking anyone with her that she wanted for that matter the mercenaries would let anyone at all pass who offered a few coins and now if you will excuse me i am on my way that is not good enough chanelles voice was hot enough to singe leather you aes sedai stick together as tightly as oysters merilille kidnapped talaan and i think you are hiding her we will search for them and i assure you when we find them merilille will be punished sharply before she is sent to the ships to fulfill her part of the bargain you seem to be forgetting yourself birgitte said her voice was mild her face calm but the bond quivered with anger she held her bowstave propped in front of her with both hands as if to keep them from making fists youll withdraw your accusations or youll suffer for it perhaps she was not as selfcontrolled as she seemed this was no way to go on with windfinders they were women of power among their own people and accustomed to wielding it but birgitte did not hesitate by the bargain zaida made youre under the lady elaynes authority youre under my authority any searching you do will be when you arent needed and unless i misremember badly youre supposed to be in tear right now to bring back wagonloads of grain and salt beef i strongly suggest you travel there immediately or you might learn a little about punishment yourself oh that was entirely the wrong way with windfinders no elayne said as hotly as chanelle surprising herself search if you wish chanelle you and all of the windfinders search caemlyn from end to end and when you cant find talaan or merilille you will apologize for calling me a liar well the woman had as good as anyway she felt a strong desire to slap chanelle she wanted to light her anger and birgittes were feeding each other frantically she tried to soothe her fury before it burst into open rage but the only result was a sudden longing to weep that she had to fight just as wildly chanelle drew herself up scowling you would claim we had reneged on the bargain we have labored like bilge girls this past month and more you will not cast us off without meeting your side of the bargain renaile the aes sedai at the silver swan are to be told told mindthat they must produce merilille and talaan or else pay what the white tower owes themselves they cannot pay all but they can make a start renaile began unscrewing the silver cap of the ink jar not a note chanelle snapped go yourself and tell them now tightening the cap renaile bowed almost parallel to the floor quickly touching fingertips to her heart as you command she murmured her face a dark mask she did not delay in obeying setting out at a trot the way she had come with the writing box tucked under her arm still fighting the desire to strike chanelle and weep at the same time elayne winced this was not the first time the sea folk had gone to the silver swan nor even the second or third but always before they had gone asking not demanding there were nine sisters resident at the inn at presentthe number kept changing as sisters entered the city or left and rumor said there were other aes sedai in the city tooand it worried her that none had appeared at the palace she had stayed clear of the swanshe knew how much elaida wanted to lay hands on her but not who the sisters at the swan supported or whether they supported anyone they had been closemouthed as mussels with sareitha and careaneyet she had expected some of them to come to the palace if only to learn what was behind the sea folks claim why were so many aes sedai in caemlyn when tar valon itself was under siege she herself was the first answer that came to mind and that made her more determined to avoid any sister she did not personally know to be a supporter of egwene but that would not stop word of the bargain made for aid in using the bowl of the winds from spreading and of the price the tower had been committed to pay for that help burn her but that news would be a bloody wagonload of fireworks going off at once when it became general knowledge among aes sedai worse ten wagonloads watching renaile trot away she fought to steady her emotions and tried to bring the tone back to something approaching civility she handles her change in circumstances very well i think chanelle gave a dismissive puff and well she should every windfinder knows she will rise and fall many times before her body is given back to the salt she twisted to gaze after the other sea folk woman and a touch of malice entered her voice she seemed to be speaking to herself she fell from a greater height than most and she should not have been surprised to find her landing hard after so many fingers she trod on while she was her mouth snapped shut and she jerked her head around to glare at elayne at birgitte at aviendha and reene even at the guardswomen daring them to comment elayne prudently kept her mouth closed and the light be thanked so did everyone else for her pan she thought she almost had her temper smoothed the desire to cry suppressed and she did not want to say anything that might start chanelle shouting and undo all her work for that matter she could not think of anything to say after hearing that she doubted it was part of athaan miere custom to take revenge on someone you believed had misused their position above you it was very human though the windfinder stared her up and down frowning youre wet she said as though just noticing it is very bad to be wet for long in your condition you should change your clothes right away elayne threw back her head and screamed as loudly as she could a howl of pure outrage and fury she screamed until her lungs were empty leaving her panting in the silence that followed everyone stared at her in amazement almost everyone aviendha began laughing so hard she had to lean against a tapestry of mounted hunters confronting a leopard that had turned she had one arm pressed across the middle as if her ribs hurt the bond carried amusement tooamusementthough birgittes face remained as smooth as a sisters i must travel to tear chanelle said breathily after a moment and she turned away without another word or any gesture toward a courtesy reene and reanne offered curtsies neither quite meeting elaynes eye and pled duties before hurrying off elayne stared at birgitte and aviendha in turn if one of you says a single word she said warningly birgitte put on such an expression of innocence that it was palpably false and the bond carried such mirth that elayne found herself fighting the urge to laugh aviendha only laughed the harder gathering her skirts and such dignity as she could summon elayne set out for her apartments if she walked faster than before well she want to get out of these damp clothes that was the only reason the only reason chapter fifteen a different skill to elaynes fury a quiet simmering fury that clenched her jaw she got lost on the way to her apartments those rooms had been hers since she left the nursery yet twice she took a turn only to find that it did not lead where she expected and a sweeping flight of marblerailed stairs took her in entirely the wrong direction burn her now being with child was fuzzing her wits completely she could feel puzzlement and increasing concern through the bond as she retraced her way climbed a different set of stairs some of the guardswomen murmured uneasily not quite loudly enough for her to make out the words until the bannerwoman in charge a slim cooleyed saldaean named devore zarbayan silenced them with a sharp word even aviendha began looking at her doubtfully well she was not about to have getting lostin the palaceflung in her face not a word from anybody she said grimly not one she added when birgitte opened her mouth anyway the goldenhaired woman snapped her jaws shut and gave a tug at her thick braid almost the way nynaeve did she did not bother to keep disapproval from her face and the bond still carried puzzlement and worry enough that elayne began to feel worried herself she struggled to fight that off before she found herself wringing her hands and apologizing it was that strong i think ill try to find my rooms if i can have just a few words birgitte said in a tight voice i want to get dry before i wear out my boots we need to talk of this later i fear theres nothing to be done but with a stiff nod barely bending her neck she stalked off slashing her unstrung bow from side to side elayne almost called her back she wanted to but birgitte had as much need of dry clothing as she besides her mood had swung to grumpy and stubborn she was not going to talk about losing her way in the very halls where she had grown up not now or later nothing to be done what did that mean if birgitte was suggesting that her wits were too befuddled to be set straight her jaw tightened all over again at last after yet another unexpected turn she found the tall lioncarved doors of her apartments and heaved a small sigh of relief she had begun to think her memories of the palace really were completely jumbled a pair of guardswomen resplendent in broadbrimmed hats with white plumes and laceedged sashes embroidered with the white lion slanting across their burnished breastplates and more pale lace at their cuffs and necks stiffened on either side of the doors at her approach she intended them to have redlacquered breastplates to match their silk coats and breeches when she had time to spend on that sort of thing if they were to be so pretty that any assailant would discount them until it was too late she would make them positively gaudy none of the guardswomen seemed to mind in fact they were eagerly looking forward to the lacquered breastplates she had overheard some who were unaware she was near disparage the guardswomenmostly women but including doilin mellar their own commanderyet she had full confidence in their ability to protect her they were brave and determined or they would not have been there yurith azeri and others who had been merchants guards a rare trade for women gave daily lessons in the sword and one or another of the warders gave a second lesson every day too sareithas ned yarman and vandenes jaem were quite laudatory about how quickly they learned jaem said it was because they did not think they already knew something of how to use a blade which seemed silly how could you believe you already knew something if you needed lessons in it despite the guards already there devore told off two of those who accompanied her and they drew their swords and went inside while elayne waited in the corridor with aviendha and the rest tapping her foot impatiently everyone avoided looking at her the search was not a slur on the women guarding the doorsshe supposed it was possible for someone to scale the side of the palace there certainly was carving enough to provide handholdsyet she felt irritation at being made to wait on it only when they came out and reported to devore that there were no assassins waiting within no aes sedai waiting to whisk elayne back to elaida and the tower were she and aviendha allowed to enter with the guardswomen forming upon either side of the doors with the others she was not sure they would have physically prevented her from entering sooner but so far she had been unwilling to put it to the test being restrained by her own bodyguards would have been beyond insufferable no matter that they were just doing their jobs better to avoid the possibility altogether a small fire burned on the white marble hearth of the anteroom but it seemed to give little warmth the carpets had been taken up for spring and the floor tiles felt cold beneath the soles of her shoes stout as they were essande her maid spread redtrimmed gray skirts with still surprising grace though the slim whitehaired woman suffered from painful joints which she denied and refused healing for she would have refused any suggestion that she return to her retirement as vehemently elaynes golden lily was embroidered large on her breast and proudly worn two younger women flanked her a pace back in similar livery but with smaller lilies stocky squarefaced sisters named sephanie and naris shyeyed yet quite well trained by essande they made deep curtsies settling nearly to the floor slowmoving and frail essande might be but she never wasted time in idle chitchat or stating the obvious there were no exclamations over how wet elayne and aviendha were though doubtless the guardswomen had alerted her well get you both warm and dry my lady and right into something suitable for meeting mercenaries the red silk with firedrops on the neck should impress them suitably its past time you ate too dont bother telling me you have my lady naris go fetch meals from the kitchens for the lady elayne and the lady aviendha aviendha gave a snort of laughter yet she had long since ceased objecting to being called lady and a good thing since she would never stop essande with servants there were things you commanded and things you simply had to tolerate naris grimaced and took a deep breath for some reason but dropped another deep curtsy this to essande and one only slightly deeper to elayneshe and her sister were every bit as much in awe of the elderly woman as they were of the daughterheir of andor before gathering her skirts and darting into the corridor elayne grimaced too the guardswomen also had told essande about the mercenaries apparently and that she had not eaten she hated people talking about her behind her back but how much of that was her shifting moods she could not recall being upset before because a maid knew what dress to lay out in advance or because someone knew she was hungry and sent for a meal without being asked servants talked among themselves gossiped constantly in truth that was a givenand passed along anything that might help their mistress be served better if they were good at their jobs essande was very good at hers still it rankled and rankled the worse for her knowing that it was irrational she let essande lead her and aviendha into the dressing room with sephanie bringing up the rear she was feeling very miserable by this time damp and shivering not to mention angry with birgitte for stalking off frightened by losing her way in the place where she had grown up and sullen over her bodyguards gossiping about her in truth she felt absolutely wretched soon enough though essande had her out of her wet things and wrapped in a large white towel that had been hanging on a warming rack in front of the wide marble fireplace at the end of the room that had a soothing effect this fire was not at all small and the room seemed not far short of hot a welcome heat that soaked into the flesh and banished shivers essande toweled elaynes hair dry while sephanie performed the same office for aviendha which chagrined aviendha still though this was hardly the first time she and elayne frequently brushed each others hair at night yet accepting this simple service from a ladys maid put spots of color in aviendhas sundark cheeks when sephanie opened one of the wardrobes lining one wall aviendha sighed deeply she held one towel loosely draped around heranother woman drying her hair might be embarrassing but near nudity presented no difficultiesand a second smaller was wrapped around her hair do you think i should wear wetlander clothes elayne since we are going to meet these mercenaries she asked in tones of great reluctance essande smiled she enjoyed dressing aviendha in silks elayne hid a smile of her own no easy task since she wanted to laugh her sister pretended to disdain silks but she seldom missed an opportunity to wear them if you can bear it aviendha she said gravely adjusting her own robing towel carefully essande saw her in her skin every day and sephanie too but it was nothing to let happen without reason for best effect we should both overawe them you wont mind too much will you but aviendha was already at the wardrobe her towel gaping carelessly as she fingered dresses several sets of aiel garb hung in another of the wardrobes but tylin had given her chests of finely cut silks and woolens before they left ebou dar enough to fill nearly a quarter of the carved cabinets that brief burst of amusement left elayne no longer feeling as if she had to argue over everything so without demurral she let essande get her into the red silk with firedrops the size of a finger joint sewn in a band around the high neck the garment would impress for sure with no need for other jewels though in truth the great serpent ring on her right hand was jewel enough for anyone the whitehaired woman had a delicate touch but elayne still winced as she began doing up the rows of tiny buttons down her back tightening the bodice across her tender bosom opinions varied on how long that would last yet all agreed that she could expect more swelling oh how she wished rand were near enough to share the full effect of her bond with him that would teach him to get her with child so carelessly of course she could have drunk the heartleaf tea before lying with himshe pushed that thought away firmly this was all rands fault and that was that aviendha chose blue which she often did with rows of tiny pearls edging the bodice the silk was not so deeply cut as ebou dari fashions yet still would display a little cleavage few dresses sewn in ebou dar failed to do that as sephanie began fastening her buttons aviendha fondled something she had retrieved from her belt pouch a small dagger with a rough hilt of deerhorn wrapped in gold wire it was also a terangreal though elayne had not been able to puzzle out what it did before pregnancy forced a halt to such studies she had not known her sister was carrying the thing aviendhas eyes were almost dreamy as she stared at it why does that fascinate you so elayne asked this was not the first time she had seen the other woman absorbed in that knife aviendha gave a start and blinked at the dagger in her hands the iron bladeit looked like iron at least and felt almost like ironhad never been sharpened so far as elayne could tell and was little longer than her palm though wide in proportion even the point was too blunt for stabbing i thought to give it to you but you never said anything about it so i thought i might be wrong and then we would believe you were safe from some dangers at least when you were not so i decided to keep it that way if i am right at least i could protect you and if i am wrong it does no harm elayne shook her towelwrapped head in confusion right about what what are you talking about this aviendha said holding up the dagger i think that if you have this in your possession the shadow cannot see you not the eyeless or the shadowtwisted maybe not even leafblighter except that i must be wrong if you did not see it sephanie gasped her hands going still until essande murmured a soft admonition essande had lived too long to be shaken by mere mention of the shadow or much else for that matter elayne stared she had tried teaching aviendha to make terangreal but her sister possessed not a scrap of facility there yet perhaps she had a different skill maybe even one that could be called a talent come with me she said and taking aviendhas arm she almost pulled her out of the dressing room essande followed with a torrent of protest and sephanie attempting to continue buttoning up aviendhas dress on the fly in the larger of the apartments two sitting rooms goodly fires blazed in both of the fireplaces and if the air was not so warm as in the dressing room it was still comfortable the scrolledged table bordered with lowbacked chairs in the middle of the whitetiled floor was where she and aviendha took most of their meals several leatherbound books from the palace library sat in a stack on one end of the table histories of andor and books of tales the mirrored standlamps gave a good light and they often read here of an evening more important a long side table against one darkpaneled wall was covered with terangreal from the cache the kin had kept hidden in ebou dar cups and bowls statuettes and figurines jewelry all manner of things most looked commonplace aside from perhaps a strangeness of design yet even the most fragileseeming could not be broken and some were much lighter or heavier than they appeared she could no longer safely study them in any meaningful wayshe had mins assurance her babes could not be harmed but with her control of the power so slippery damaging herself was more a possibility than everyet she changed what was on the table every day picking out pieces at random from the panniers kept in the apartments boxroom just so she could look at them and speculate on what she had learned before getting with child not that she had learned very muchwell nothing really but she could think on them there was no worry of anything being stolen reene had rooted out most if not all of the dishonest among the servants and the constant guard at the entrance saw to the rest mouth tight with disapprovaldressing was done in the dressing room decently not out where anyone at all might walk inessande resumed her task with elaynes buttons sephanie likely as agitated by the older womans displeasure as anything else breathed hard as she worked on aviendhas pick out something and tell me what you think it does elayne said looking and speculating had done no good and she had not expected it to yet if aviendha could somehow tell what a tevangreal did just by holding it jealousy surged up in her hot and bitter but she knocked it down then for good measure jumped up and down on it until it vanished she would not be jealous of aviendha i am not sure that i can elayne i only think this knife makes a kind of warding and i must be wrong or you would know it you know more of these things than anyone elaynes cheeks heated with embarrassment i dont know nearly as much as you seem to think try aviendha ive never heard of anyone being able to to read tevangreal but if you can even a little dont you see how wonderful that would be aviendha nodded but her face held doubt hesitantly she touched a slim black rod a pace long and so flexible it could be bent into a circle and spring back lying in the middle of the table touched it and jerked her hand back swiftly wiping her fingers unconsciously on her skirt this causes pain nynaeve told us that elayne said impatiently and aviendha gave her a level look nynaeve almeara did not say you can change how much pain each blow gives uncertainty overcame her again at once though and her voice became tentative at least i think that can be done i think one blow can feel like one or a hundred but i am only guessing elayne it is only what i think keep going elayne told her encouragingly maybe well find something that makes it certain what about this she picked up an oddly shaped metal cap covered with strange angular patterns of what seemed to be the most minute engraving it was much too thin to be of use as a helmet though it was twice as heavy as it appeared the metal felt slick too not simply smooth as if it were oiled aviendha put down the dagger reluctantly and turned the cap over once in her hands before setting it back on the table and taking up the dagger again i think that allows you to direct a a device of some sort a machine she shook her towelwrapped head but i do not know how or what kind of machine you see i am only guessing again elayne would not let her stop though terangreal after terangreal aviendha touched or sometimes held for a moment and every time she had an answer delivered hesitantly and with cautions that it was only a surmise but always an answer she thought a small hinged box apparently ivory and covered with rippling red and green stripes held music hundreds of tunes perhaps thousands with a terangreal that might be possible after all a fine music box might have cylinders for as many as a hundred tunes and some could play quite long pieces on one cylinder after another without changing them a flatfish white bowl almost a pace across was for looking at things that were far away she thought and a tall vase worked with vines in green and blue blue vineswould gather water out of the air that sounded useless but aviendha almost caressed it and after consideration elayne realized it would be very useful indeed in the waste if it worked as aviendha believed and someone figured out how to make it work a blackandwhite figurine of a bird with long wings spread in flight was for talking to people a long way off she said so was a blue figure of a woman small enough to fit in the palm of her hand in an oddly cut skirt and coat and five earrings six fingerrings and three bracelets elayne began to think that aviendha was giving up offering the same answer every time in hopes that she would stop asking but then she realized that her sisters voice was becoming more confident rather than less that the protests that she was only guessing had dwindled and her guesses were growing in detail a bent featureless rod of dull black as wide as her wristit seemed metal yet one end accommodated itself to any hand that gripped itmade her think of cutting either metal or stone if they were not too thick nothing that could catch fire though the apparently glass figure of a man a foot tall with his hand raised as if to signal stop would chase away vermin which would certainly have been useful given caemlyns plague of rats and flies a stone carving the size of her hand all deep blue curvesit felt like stone at least though somehow it did not really look carved was for growing something not plants it made her think of holes only they were not exactly holes and she did not believe anyone had to channel to make it work only sing the right song some terangreal did not require channeling but really singing done with aviendhas dress sephanie had grown enthralled with the recitation her eyes getting wider and wider essande listened with interest too her head tilted to one side murmuring small exclamations at each new revelation but she was not bouncing on her toes the way sephanie was what about that one my lady the younger woman blurted when aviendha paused she pointed to the statuette of a stout bearded man with a merry smile holding a book two feet tall it appeared to be agedarkened bronze and was certainly heavy enough to be looking at him always makes me want to smile too my lady me as well sephanie pelden aviendha said stroking the bronze mans head he holds more than the book you see he holds thousands and thousands of books abruptly the light of saidar enveloped her and she touched thin flows of fire and earth to the bronze figure sephanie squeaked as two words in the old tongue appeared in the air above the statuette as black as if printed with good ink some of the letters were shaped a little oddly but the words were quite clear ansoen and imsoen floating on nothing aviendha looked nearly as startled as the maid i think we have proof at last elayne said more calmly than she felt her heart was in her throat and pounding lies and truth the two words might be translated or in context perhaps fiction and not fiction would be better it was proof enough for her she marked where the flows touched the figure for when she could return to her studies but you shouldnt have done that it isnt safe the glow around aviendha vanished oh light she exclaimed flinging her arms around elayne i never thought i have greattoh to you i never meant to endanger you or your babes never my babes and i are safe elayne laughed hugging back mins viewing her babes were safe at least until they were born so many babies died in their first year min had said nothing beyond them being born healthy min had said nothing about her not being burned out either but she had no intention of bringing that up with her sister already feeling guilty you have no toh to me it was you i was thinking of you could have died or burned yourself out aviendha pulled back enough to look into elaynes eyes what she saw there reassured her for a small smile curved her lips i did make it work though perhaps i can take over the study of them with you to guide me it should be perfectly safe we have months before you can do it yourself you have no time at all aviendha a womans voice said from the doorway we are leaving i hope you have not grown too used to wearing silk i see you elayne aviendha leaped away from the embrace flushing furiously as two aiel women entered the room and not just any two aiel palehaired nadere as tall as most men and wide with it was a wise one of considerable authority among the goshien and dorindha her long red hair touched with white was the wife of bael clan chief of the goshien though her true prominence came from being roofmistress of smoke springs hold the clans largest hold it was she who had spoken i see you dorindha elayne said i see you nadere why are you taking aviendha away you said i could stay with elayne to help guard her back aviendha protested you did dorindha elayne took her sisters hand in a firm grip and aviendha squeezed back you and the wise ones too gold and ivory bracelets clattered as dorindha shifted her dark shawl how many do you need to guard your back elayne she asked dryly you have perhaps a hundred or more dedicated to nothing else and as hard as far dareis alai a smile deepened the creases at the corners of her eyes i think those women outside wanted us to give up our belt knives before letting us in nadere touched the horn hilt of her knife her green eyes holding a fierce light though it was unlikely the guards had shown any such desire even birgitte suspicious of everyone when it came to elaynes safety could see no danger from the aiel and elayne had accepted certain obligations when she and aviendha adopted each other wise ones who had taken part in that ceremony as nadere had could go wherever they wished in the palace whenever they wished that was one of the obligations as for dorindha her presence was so commanding if in a quiet way that it seemed inconceivable anyone would attempt to bar her way your training has been in abeyance too long aviendha nadere said firmly go and change into proper clothing but i am learning so much from elayne nadere weaves even you do not know i think i can make it rain in the threefold land and just now we learned that i can whatever you may have learned nadere cut in sharply it seems you have forgotten as much such as the fact that you are an apprentice still the power is the least of what a wise one must know else only those who can channel would be wise ones now go and change and count your luck that i do not make you return in your skin to face a strapping the tents are being struck as we speak and if the clans departure is delayed you will face the strap without another word aviendha dropped elaynes hand and ran from the room bumping into naris who staggered and almost dropped the large clothcovered tray she was carrying at a quick gesture from essande sephanie hurried after aviendha naris eyes went wide at the sight of the aiel women but essande admonished her for taking so long and directed her to lay out the meal on the table setting the young maid into hurried motion while muttering apologies under her breath elayne wanted to run after aviendha too to grasp every moment with her but naderes words held her youre leaving caemlyn dorindha where are you going as much as elayne liked the aiel she did not want them wandering about the countryside with the situation as unstable as it was they were problem enough simply venturing out of their camp to hunt or trade we are leaving andor elayne in a few hours we will be far beyond your borders as to where you must ask the car acam nadere had walked over to study what naris was laying out and naris began to tremble so that she nearly dropped more than one dish this looks good but i do not recognize some of these herbs the wise one said your midwife has approved all of this elayne ill summon a midwife when my time is near nadere dorindha you cant think rand would want your destination kept from me what did he say dorindha gave a small shrug he sent a messenger one of the black coats with a letter for bael bael let me read it of course her tone said there had never been any question of her not reading it but the cavacam asked bael not to tell anyone so i cannot tell you no midwife nadere said incredulously who tells you what to eat and drink who gives you the proper herbs stop looking daggers at me woman melaines temper is worse than yours could ever be but she has sense enough to let monaelle govern her in these things every woman in the palace governs what i eat elayne replied bitterly sometimes i think every woman in caemlyn does dorindha cant you at least my lady your food is getting cold essande said mildly but with just the touch of firmness that an elderly retainer was allowed gritting her teeth elayne glided to the chair essande stood behind she did not flounce much as she wanted to she glided essande produced an ivorybacked hairbrush and removing the towel from elaynes head began brushing her hair while she ate she ate largely because not eating only meant someone would be told to fetch more hot food because essande and her own bodyguards between them might well keep her there until she did but except for some dried apple that had not gone bad the meal was decidedly unappetizing the bread was crusty but flecked with weevils and the soaked dried beans since all of the preserved beans had spoiled were tough and tasteless the apple was mixed in a bowl of herbssliced burdock root black haw cramp bark dandelion nettle leafwith a touch of oil and for meat she had a piece of kid simmered in bland broth with next to no salt as far as she could tell she would have killed for salty beef dripping with fat avkndbas plate had sliced beef though it looked tough she could as well ask for wine to drink she had her choice of water or goats milk she wanted tea almost as much as she did fatty meat but even the weakest tea sent her running to make water and she had quite enough difficulties with that as it was so she ate methodically mechanically trying to think of anything but the tastes in her mouth except for the apple at least she tried to pry some news of rand out of the two aiel women but it seemed they knew less than she as far as they would admit anyway they could be closemouthed when they wanted to be she at least knew that he was somewhere far to the southeast somewhere in tear she suspected though he could as easily have been on the plains of maredo or in the spine of the world beyond that she knew he was alive and not a whit more she tried keeping the conversation on rand in the hope they might let something slip yet she might as well have tried dressing bricks with her fingers dorindha and nadere had their own goal convincing her to acquire a midwife right away they went on and on about how she might be endangering herself and her babes and not even mins viewing would dissuade them very well she said at last slapping down her knife and fork i will start looking for one today and if she failed to find one well they would never know i have a niece whos a midwife my lady essande said melfane dispenses herbs and ointments from a shop on candle street in the new city and i believe she is quite knowledgeable she patted a few last curls into place and stepped back with a pleased smile you do so remind me of your mother my lady elayne sighed it seemed she was to have a midwife whether she wanted one or not someone else to see that her meals were wretched well perhaps the midwife could suggest a remedy for those backaches at night and the tender bosom thank the light she had been spared the desire to sick up women who could channel never suffered that part of pregnancy when aviendha returned she was in aiel garb again with her stilldamp shawl draped over her arms a dark scarf tied around her temples to hold back her hair and a bundle on her back unlike the multitudes of bracelets and necklaces dorindha and nadere wore she had a single silver necklace intricately worked discs in a complex pattern and one ivory bracelet densely carved with roses and thorns she handed elayne the blunt dagger you must keep this so you will be safe i will try to visit you as often as i can there may be time for an occasional visit nadere said severely but you have fallen behind and must work hard to catch up strange she mused shaking her head to speak casually of visiting from so far to cover leagues hundreds of leagues in a step strange things we have learned in the wetlands come aviendha we must go dorindha said wait elayne told them please wait just a moment clutching the dagger she raced to her dressing room sephanie paused in hanging up aviendhas blue dress to curtsy but elayne ignored her and opened the carved lid of her ivory jewelry chest sitting atop the necklaces and bracelets and pins in their compartments were a brooch in the shape of a turtle that appeared to be amber and a seated woman wrapped in her own hair apparently carved from agedarkened ivory both were angreal placing the antlerhilted dagger in the chest she picked up the turtle and then impulsively snatched up the twisted stone dream ring all red and blue and brown it seemed to be useless to her since she became pregnant and if she could manage to weave spirit she still had the silver ring worked in braided spirals that had been recovered from ispan hurrying back to the sitting room she found dorindha and nadere arguing or at least having an animated discussion while essande pretended to be checking for dust running her fingers under the edge of the table from the angle of her head she was listening avidly though naris putting elaynes dishes back on the tray was gaping at the aiel women openly i told her she would feel the strap if we delayed the departure nadere was saying with some heat as elayne entered the room it is hardly fair if she is not the cause but i said what i said you will do as you must dorindha replied calmly but with a tightness to her eyes that suggested these were not the first words they had exchanged perhaps we will not delay anything and perhaps aviendha will pay the price gladly to say farewell to her sister elayne did not bother with trying to argue for aviendha it would have done no good aviendha herself displayed an equanimity that would have credited an aes sedai as if whether she was to be beaten for anothers fault were of no matter at all these are for you elayne said pressing the ring and the brooch into her sisters hand not as gifts im afraid the white tower will want them back but to use as you need aviendha looked at the things and gasped even the loan of these is a great gift you shame me sister i have no farewell gift to give in return you give me your friendship you gave me a sister elayne felt a tear slide down her cheek she essayed a laugh but it was a weak tremulous thing how can you say you have nothing to give youve given me everything tears glistened in aviendhas eyes too despite the others watching she put her arms around elayne and hugged her hard i will miss you sister she whispered my heart is as cold as night and mine sister elayne whispered hugging back equally hard i will miss you too but you will be allowed to visit me sometimes this isnt forever no not forever but i will still miss you they might have begun weeping next only dorindha laid her hands on their shoulders it is time aviendha we must go if you are to have any hope of avoiding the strap aviendha straightened with a sigh scrubbing at her eyes may you always find water and shade sister may you always find water and shade sister elayne replied the aiel way had a finality about it so she added until i see your face again and as quickly as that they were gone as quickly as that she felt very alone aviendhas presence had become a certainty a sister to talk to laugh with share her hopes and fears with but that comfort was gone essande had slipped from the room while she and aviendha were hugging and now she returned to set the coronet of the daughterheir on elaynes head a simple circlet of gold supporting a single golden rose on her forehead so these mercenaries wont forget who theyre talking to my lady elayne did not realize her shoulders had slumped until she straightened them her sister was gone yet she had a city to defend and a throne to gain duty would have to sustain her now chapter sixteen the new follower the blue reception room named for its arched ceiling painted to display the sky and white clouds and its blue floor tiles was the smallest reception room in the palace less than ten paces square the arched windows that made up the far wall overlooking a courtyard and still filled with glassed casements against the spring weather gave a fair light even with the rain falling outside but despite two large fireplaces with carved marble mantels a cornice of plaster lions and a pair of tapestries bearing the white lion that flanked the doors a delegation of caemlyns merchants would have been insulted to be received in the blue room a delegation of bankers livid likely that was why mistress harfor had put the mercenaries there although they would not know they were being insulted she herself was present overseeing the pair of liveried young maids who were keeping the winecups full from tall silver pitchers standing on a tray atop a plainly carved sideboard but she had the embossed leather folder used to carry her reports pressed to her bosom as if in anticipation of the mercenaries being dealt with quickly halwin norry the wisps of white hair behind his ears as always looking like feathers was standing in a corner also with his leather folder clutched to his narrow chest their reports were a daily fixture and seldom much in them to cheer the heart of late quite the opposite warned by the pair of guards women who had checked the room ahead of her everyone was on their feet when elayne entered with another pair at her back deni colford in charge of the guardswomen who had replaced devore and the others had simply ignored her order for them all to remain outside ignored her she supposed they made a good show swaggering proudly as they did yet she could not stop grinding her teeth careane and sareitha formal in their fringed shawls bowed their heads slightly in respect but mellar swept off his plumed hat in a flourishing bow one hand laid over the laceedged sash slanting across his burnished breastplate the six golden knots brazed to that breastplate three on each shoulder rankled her yet she had let them pass so far his hatchet face offered her a smile that was much too warm too but then however cold she was to him he thought he had some chance with her because she had not denied the rumor her babes were his her reasons for not countering that filthy tale had changedshe no longer had need to protect her babes rands babesyet she let it stand give the man time and he would braid a rope for his own neck and if he failed to she would braid one for him the mercenaries all well into their middle years were only a heartbeat behind mellar though not so elaborate in their courtesies evard cordwyn a tall squarejawed andoran wore a large ruby in his left ear and aldred gomaisen short and slender the front of his head shaved had horizontal stripes of red and green and blue covering half his chest far more than it seemed at all likely he was entitled to in his native cairhien hafeen bakuvun graying was ornamented with a thick gold hoop in his left ear and a jeweled ring on every finger the domani was very stout but the way he moved spoke of solid muscle beneath the fat dont you have duties captain mellar elayne said coolly taking one of the rooms few chairs there were only five arms and high backs simply carved with vines and leaves and lacking even a hint of gilt standing in a widely spaced row in front of the windows the chairs put the light behind whoever sat in them on a bright day those given audience here squinted in the glare unfortunately that advantage was lost today the two guardswomen took up positions behind her and to either side each with a hand resting on her sword hilt watching the mercenaries with fierce expressions that made bakuvun smile and gomaisen rub his chin to halfhide a sly grin the women gave no sign of being offended they knew the point of their uniforms elayne knew they would wipe away any smiles very quickly if they needed to draw their blades my first duty above all is to protect you my lady easing his sword mellar eyed the mercenaries as though he expected them to attack her or perhaps him gomaisen looked bitterly amused and bakuvun laughed aloud all three men had empty scabbards cordwyn a pair on his back no mercenary was allowed to enter the palace carrying so much as a dagger i know you have other duties she said levelly because i assigned them to you captain training the men i brought in from the countryside you are not spending as much time with them as i expect you have a company of men to train captain a company of old men and boys and surely enough to occupy his hours he spent few enough with her bodyguards in spite of commanding them that was just as well really he liked to pinch bottoms i suggest you see to them now rage flashed across mellars narrow facehe actually quivered but he mastered himself instantly it was all gone so fast that she might have imagined it but she knew she had not as you command my lady he said smoothly his smile had an oily smoothness too my honor is to serve you well with another flamboyant bow he started for the door as near to strutting as made no difference little could dent doilin mellars demeanor for long bakuvun laughed again throwing his head back man wears so much lace now i vow i keep expecting him to offer to teach us to dance and now he does dance the cairhienin laughed too a nasty guttural sound mellars back stiffened and his step hesitated then quickened so much so that he bumped into birgitte at the doorway he hurried on without stopping to ask pardon and she frowned after himthe bond carried anger quickly suppressed and impatience which was not before shutting the door behind her and moving to stand beside elaynes chair with one hand resting on the chairback her thick braid was not so neatly done as usual after having been undone for drying but the uniform of the captaingeneral suited her taller than gomaisen in her heeled boots birgitte had a commanding presence when she wanted to the mercenaries offered her small bows respectful though not deferential whatever misgivings of her they might have entertained in the beginning few who had seen her use her bowor expose herself to the enemy had any remaining you speak as if you know captain mellar captain bakuvun elayne put just a hint of question in that but kept her tone casual birgitte was attempting to project confidence along the bond to equal her expression yet wariness and worry kept intruding and the everpresent weariness elayne tightened her jaw to fight a yawn birgitte had to get some rest ive seen him once or twice before my lady the domani replied cautiously not above thrice at most id say yes no more than that he tilted his head eyeing her almost sideways you know hes followed my trade in the past he did not try to hide the fact captain she said as if tired of the subject had he let anything interesting slip she might have arranged to question him alone but pressing was not worth the risk of mellar discovering that questions were being asked he might run then before she could learn what she wanted to know do we really have need of the aes sedai my lady bakuvun asked the other aes sedai he added glancing at her great serpent ring he held out his silver cup and one of the maids darted to fill it they were both pretty women perhaps not the best choices but reene had not much to choose from most of the maids were either young or else aged and not so spry as they once had been all theyve done the whole time weve been here is try to put us in awe of the white towers might and reach i respect aes sedai as much as any man yes i do indeed but if youll forgive me it gets tiresome when they turn to trying to browbeat a man i vow it does my lady a wise man always stands in awe of the tower sareitha said calmly shifting her brownfringed shawl perhaps to draw attention to it her dark square face lacked the ageless look as yet and she admitted yearning for it only fools fail to stand in awe of the tower careane said on sareithas heels a bulky woman as wide in the shoulders as most men the green had no need for gestures her coppery face proclaimed what she was to anyone who knew what to look for as loudly as did the ring on her right forefinger the word i hear gomaisen said darkly is that tar valon is besieged i hear the white tower is split with two amyrlins i even hear the tower itself is held by the black ajah a brave man to mention that rumor to aes sedai but he still flinched saying it flinched and went right on who is it you want us to be in awe of do not believe everything you hear captain gomaisen sareithas voice was serene a woman stating indisputable fact truth has more shadings than you might think and distance often distorts truth into something very different from the facts lies about darkfriend sisters are dangerous to repeat however what you had best believe careane added just as calmly is that the white tower is the white tower now and always and you stand before three aes sedai you should have a care with your words captain gomaisen scrubbed the back of a hand across his mouth but his dark eyes held defiance a hunted defiance i am just saying what can be heard on any street he muttered are we here to talk about the white tower cordwyn said scowling he emptied his winecup before going on as if this talk made him uneasy how much had he already consumed he seemed a trifle unsteady on his feet and there was a touch of slur in his words the tower is hundreds of leagues from here and what happens there is no business of ours true friend bakuvun said true our business is swords swords and blood which my lady brings us to the sordid matter ofhe waggled thick begemmed fingersgold every day we lose men day after day with no end in sight and there are very few suitable replacements to be found in the city none at all that ive found cordwyn muttered eyeing the young maid filling his cup she blushed at his scrutiny and finished her task quickly spilling wine on the floor tiles and making mistress harfor frown those that might have been are all signing up for the queens guards that was true enough enlistments seemed to increase by the day the queens guards would be a formidable force eventually unfortunately the vast majority of those men were months from being able to handle a sword without stabbing themselves in the foot and further from being of any use in battle as you say friend bakuvun murmured as you say he directed a wide smile at elayne perhaps he meant to seem friendly or maybe reasonable but it minded her of a man trying to sell her a pig in a sack even after were done here finding new men wont be easy my lady suitable men arent found under cabbage leaves no theyre not fewer men means fewer coins for our next hires an inescapable fact of the world we think its only just that we receive compensation anger surged in elayne they thought she was desperate to hold on to them was what they thought worse they were right these three men represented better than a thousand more between them even with what guybon had brought her that would be a grievous loss especially if it started other mercenaries thinking her cause was lost mercenaries disliked being on the losing side they would run like rats fleeing fire to avoid that her anger surged but she held it in rein by a hairs breadth she could not keep the scorn from her voice though did you think you would take no casualties did you expect to mount guard and take gold for it without baring your swords you signed for so much gold each day birgitte put in she did not say how much because every company had bargained for its own agreement the last thing they needed was for the mercenary companies to grow jealous of one another as it was it seemed that half the common room fights the guards broke up were between men of different companies a fixed amount to put it cruelly the more men you lose the greater your profit ah captaingeneral the stout man said blandly but you forget the deathmoney that has to be paid to the widows and orphans gomaisen made a choking noise and cordwyn stared at bakuvun incredulously then tried to cover it by draining his winecup again elayne trembled her hands tightening to fists on the arms of her chair she would not give way to anger she would nott i intend to hold you to your agreements she said coldly well at least she was not raging youll be paid what you signed for including the usual victory gold after i gain the throne but not a penny more if you try to back out ill assume you are turning coat and going over to arymilla in which case ill have you and your companies arrested and put outside the gates without swords or horses the maid refilling cordwyns winecup yet again suddenly squealed and danced away from him rubbing her hip the anger elayne had been holding down fountained white hot and if one of you ever again dares fondle one of my women he and his company will be put out without swords horses or bootsl do i make myself clear very clear my lady bakuvuns voice held a distinct chill and his wide mouth was tight very clear indeed and now since our discussion seems concluded may we withdraw think carefully sareitha said suddenly will the white tower choose to see an aes sedai on the lion throne or a fool like arymilla marne count the aes sedai in this palace careane added count the aes sedai inside caemlyn there are none in arymillas camps count and decide where the white towers favor lies count sareitha said and remember that the white towers displeasure can be fatal it was very hard to believe that one of them must be black ajah yet it must be so unless it was merilille of course elayne hoped that was not so she liked merilille but then she liked careane and sareitha too not as much as she did merilille yet still a liking any way she looked at it a woman she liked was a darkfriend and already under penalty of death when the mercenaries had departed making their courtesies hurriedly and mistress harfor had sent the maids away with the remnants of the wine elayne leaned back in her chair and sighed i handled that very badly didnt i mercenaries require a strong hand on the reins birgitte replied but there was doubt in the bond doubt and worry if i may say my lady norry said in his dry voice i cannot see anything else you could have done mildness would only have emboldened them to make further demands he had been so still that elayne had almost forgotten he was there blinking at the world he seemed a wading bird wondering where the water had gone in contrast to mistress harfors neatness ink stains marked his tabard and his fingers she eyed the leather folder in his hands with distinct distaste will you leave us please sareitha careane she said they hesitated slightly but there was nothing they could do save bow their heads and glide from the room like swans and you two as well she added over her shoulder to the guardswomen they did not so much as twitch outside birgitte snapped with a jerk of her head that set her braid swaying now oh the pair jumped for her they did they headed for the doors so fast they might as well have trotted elayne scowled as the door closed behind them burn me i dont want to hear any bloody bad news not today i dont want to hear how much of the food brought in from illian and tear is already spoiled when it arrives i dont want to hear about arson or flour black with weevils or sewers breeding rats faster than they can be killed or flies so thick youd think caemlyn was a filthy stable i want to hear some bloody good news for a change burn her she sounded petulanti truth be told she felt petulant oh how that grated she was trying to gain a throne and behaving like a child in the nursery master norry and mistress harfor exchanged glances which only made matters worse he fondled his folder with a sigh of regret the man enjoyed droning his numbers even when they were dire at least they no longer balked at giving their reports in company well not very far jealous of their own responsibilities each was wary of the other straying and quick to point out where some imagined boundary had been crossed still they managed to run the palace and the city efficiently with few barked knuckles are we private my lady reene asked elayne drew a deep breath and performed novice exercises that seemed to have no calming effect whatsoever then attempted to embrace the source to her surprise saidar came to her easily filling her with the sweetness of life and joy and soothing her moods too it was always that way anger or sorrow or just being with child might interfere with embracing the power in the first place yet once it filled her her emotions stopped jumping about deftly she wove fire and air just so with traces of water but when she was done she did not release the source the feel of being filled with the power was wondrous yet not that much more so than knowing she would not be wanting to weep for no reason or shout for as little in the next moment after all she was not foolish enough to draw too deeply we are private she said saidar touched her ward and was gone someone had tried to listen in not the first time that had happened with so many women who could channel gathered in the palace it would have been surprising if no one attempted to snoop but she wished she knew how to trace whoever was making those attempts as it was she hardly dared say anything of substance without a ward in place then i have a little good news mistress harfor said shifting her folder but not opening it from jon skellit the barber had been most assiduous about carrying his reports approved beforehand by reene out to arymilla and bringing back what he could learn in the camps outside the city he was in the employ of naean arawn but naean supporting arymillas claim would surely share skellits reports with arymilla unfortunately what he had been able to learn so far had not been much of use he says that arymilla and the high seats supporting her intend to be in the first party to ride into caemlyn she boasts of it constantly it seems elayne sighed arymilla and the others stayed together moving from camp to camp according to no pattern she could see and for some time great effort had gone into trying to learn where they would be ahead of time a simple matter then to send soldiers through a gateway to seize all of them at once and decapitate her opposition as simple as such things could be anyway men would die under the best of circumstances some of the high seats might well escape yet if only arymilla herself could be taken there would be an end to it elenia and naean had made public renunciation of their own claims which was irreversible that pair might go on supporting arymilla if they remained freethey had tied themselves to her tightlybut with arymilla in hand all elayne really would have to contend with was gaining the support of at least four more of the great houses as if it were easy so far efforts in that direction had proven futile perhaps today would bring good news on that front though but this news was useless if arymilla and the others were riding into caemlyn it would mean the city was beyond the brink of falling worse if arymilla was boasting she must believe it would happen soon the woman was a fool in many ways but it would be a mistake to underestimate her completely she had not carried her claim this far by being an absolute fool this is your good news birgitte said she saw the implications too a hint of when might help reene spread her hands arymilla gave skellit a gold crown with her own hands once my lady he turned it over to me as proof that hes reformed her lips compressed for a moment skellit had saved himself from hanging yet he would never regain trust thats the only time the mans been within ten paces of her he has to go by what he can pick up gossiping with the other men she hesitated hes very afraid my lady the men in those camps are certain theyll take the city in a matter of days afraid enough to turn his coat a third time elayne asked quietly there was nothing to say to the other matter no my lady if naean or arymilla learns what hes done hes a dead man and he knows it but hes afraid if the city falls they will learn i think he may bolt soon elayne nodded grimly mercenaries were not the only rats to flee fire do you have any good news master norry the first clerk had been standing quietly fingering his embossed leather folder and trying to appear as if he were not listening to reene i think i can better mistress harfor my lady there might have been a touch of triumph in his smile of late it was rare for him to have better news than she i have a man i believe can follow mellar successfully may i have him brought in now that was excellent news five men had died trying to follow doilin mellar when he went out into the city at night and the coincidence seemed strained the first time it had appeared the fellow fell afoul of a footpad and she thought nothing of it beyond settling a pension on the mans widow the guards managed to keep crime under some controlexcept for arson at leastyet robbers used darkness as a cloak to hide in the other four had seemed the same killed with a single knife thrust their purses emptied but however dangerous the streets at night coincidence hardly seemed credible when she nodded the spindly old man hurried to the doors and opened one to put his head out she could not hear what he saidthe ward worked both waysbut in a few minutes a burly guardsman entered pushing ahead of him a shuffling man with fetters on his wrists and ankles everything about the prisoner seemed average he was neither fat nor thin tall nor short his hair was brown of no particular shade she could name and his eyes as well his face was so ordinary she doubted she could describe him no feature stood out at all his clothing was just as unremarkable a plain brown coat and breeches of neither the best wool nor the worst somewhat rumpled and beginning to show dirt a lightly embossed belt with a simple metal buckle that might have ten thousand twins in caemlyn in short he was eminently forgettable birgitte motioned the guardsman to stop the fellow well short of the chairs and told him to wait outside a reliable man norry said watching the guardsman leave afrim hansard he served your mother faithfully and knows how to keep his mouth shut chains elayne said this is samwil hark my lady norry said eyeing the man with the sort of curiosity he might have shown toward an unfamiliar and oddly shaped animal a remarkably successful cutpurse the guards only caught him because another ruffian um turned the cat on him as they say in the streets hoping to lessen his own sentence for a third offense of strongarm robbery a thief would be eager for that not only was the flogging longer the thiefmark branded on his forehead would be much harder to disguise or hide than the mark on his thumb for his second offense anyone who has managed to keep from being caught for as long as master hark should be able to carry out the task i have in mind for him im innocent i am my lady hark knuckled his forehead the iron chains of his fetters clinking and put on an ingratiating smile he talked very quickly its all lies and happenstances it is im a good queens man i am i wore your mothers colors in the riots my lady not that i took part in the rioting you understand im a clerk when i have work which im out of at the moment but i wore her colors on my cap for all to see i did the bond was full of birgittes skepticism master harks rooms contained chests full of neatly cut purses the first clerk went on there are thousands of them my lady quite literally thousands i suppose he may regret keeping urn trophies most cutpurses have sense enough to get rid of the purse as soon as possible i picks them up when i sees one i does my lady hark spread his hands as far as his chains allowed and shrugged the very image of injured innocence maybe it were foolish but i never saw no harm just a harmless sort of amusement my lady mistress harfor sniffed loudly disapproval clear on her face hark managed to look even more hurt his rooms also contained coins to the value of over one hundred twenty gold crowns secreted under the floorboards in cubbyholes in the walls in the rafters everywhere his excuse for that norry raised his voice as hark opened his mouth again is that he distrusts bankers he claims the money is an inheritance from an aged aunt in four kings i myself very much doubt the magistrates in four kings will have registered such an inheritance though the magistrate judging his case says he seemed surprised to learn that inheritances are registered indeed harks smile laded somewhat at being reminded he says that he worked for wilbin saems a merchant until saems death four months ago but master saems daughter maintains the business and neither she nor any of the other clerks recall any samwil hark they hates me they does my lady hark said in a sullen voice his hands gripped the chain between them in fists i was gathering evidence of how they was stealing from the good masterhis own daughter mindonly he died afore i could give it to him and i was turned out in the streets without a reference or a penny i was they burned what id gathered gave me a drubbing and threw me out elayne tapped her chin thoughtfully a clerk you say most clerks are better spoken than you master hark but ill offer you a chance to give evidence for your claim would you send for a lapdesk master norry norry gave a thin smile how could the man make a smile seem dry no need my lady the magistrate in the case had the same idea for the first time that she had ever seen he took a sheet of paper from the folder clutched to his chest she thought trumpets should sound harks smile faded away completely as his eyes followed that page from norrys hand to hers one glance was all that was needed a few uneven lines covered less than half the sheet the letters cramped and awkward no more than half a dozen words were actually legible and those barely hardly the hand of a clerk she murmured returning the page to norry she tried to make her face stern she had seen her mother passing judgment morgase had been able to make herself appear implacable i fear master hark that you will sit in a cell until the magistrates in four kings can be queried and soon after that you will hang harks lips writhed and he put a hand to his throat as if he could already feel the noose unless of course you agree to follow a man for me a dangerous man who doesnt like to be followed if you can tell me where he goes at night instead of hanging you will be exiled to baerlon where you would be well advised to find a new line of work the governor will be informed of you suddenly harks smile was back of course my lady im innocent but i can see how things look dark against me i can ill follow any man you want me to i was your mothers man i was and im your man too loyal is what i am my lady loyal if i suffers for it birgitte snorted derisively arrange for master hark to see mellars face without being seen birgitte the man was unmemorable but there was no point in taking chances then turn him loose hark looked ready to dance iron chains or no iron chains but first you see this master hark she held up her right hand so he could not miss the great serpent ring you may have heard that i am aes sedai with the power already in her it was a simple matter to weave spirit it is true the weave she laid on harks belt buckle his boots his coat and breeches was somewhat akin to that for the warder bond though much less complex it would fade from the clothing and boots in a few weeks or months at best but metal would hold a finder forever ive laid a weave on you master hark now you can be found wherever you are in truth only she would be able to find hima finder was attuned to the one who wove itbut there was no reason to tell him that just to be sure that you are indeed loyal harks smile seemed frozen in place sweat beaded on his forehead when birgitte went to the door and called in hansard giving him instructions to take hark away and keep him safe from prying eyes hark staggered and would have fallen if the husky guardsman had not held him up on the way out of the room i fear i may just have given mellar a sixth victim elayne muttered he hardly seems capable of following his own shadow without tripping over his boots it was not so much harks death she regretted the man would have hanged for sure i want whoever put that bloody man in my palace i want them so badly my teeth ache the palace was riddled with spiesreene had uncovered above a dozen beyond skellit though she believed that was all of thembut whether mellar had been set to spy or to facilitate kidnapping her he was worse than the others he had arranged for men to die or he had killed them in order to gain his place that those men had thought they were to kill her made no difference murder was murder trust me my lady norry said laying a finger alongside his long nose cutpurses are um stealthy by nature yet they seldom last long sooner or later they cut the purse of someone faster afoot than they someone who doesnt wait for the guards he made a quick gesture as if stabbing someone hark has lasted at least twenty years a number of the purses in his um collection were embroidered with prayers of thanks for the end of the aiel war those went out of fashion very quickly as i recall birgitte sat down on the arm of the next chair and folded her arms beneath her breasts i could arrest mellar she said quietly and have him put to the question youd have no need of hark then a poor joke my lady if i may say so mistress harfor said stiffly at the same time that master norry said that would be um against the law my lady birgitte bounded to her feet outrage flooding the bond blood and bloody ashes we know the mans as rotten as last months fish no elayne sighed fighting not to feel outraged as well we have suspicions not proof those five men might have fallen afoul of footpads the law is quite clear on when someone may be put to the question and suspicions are not reason enough solid evidence is needed my mother often said the queen must obey the law she makes or there is no law i will not begin by breaking the law the bond carried something stubborn she fixed birgitte with a steady look neither will you do you understand me birgitte trahelion neither will you to her surprise the stubbornness lasted only moments longer before dwindling away to be replaced by chagrin it was only a suggestion birgitte muttered weakly elayne was wondering how she had done that and how to do it againsometimes there seemed doubt in birgittes mind over which of them was in chargewhen deni coiford slipped into the room and cleared her throat to draw attention to herself a long brassstudded cudgel balanced the sword hanging at the heavyset womans waist looking out of place deni was getting better with the sword but still preferred the cudgel she had used keeping order in a wagon drivers tavern a servant came to say that the lady dyelin has arrived my lady and will be at your service as soon as shes freshened herself send the lady dyelin word that shes to meet me in the map room elayne felt a surge of hope at last perhaps she might hear some good news chapter seventeen a bronze bear leaving mistress harfor and master norry elayne started eagerly toward the map room still holding saidar eagerly but not hurriedly deni and three guardswomen strode ahead of her heads swiveling in constant search of threats and the other four stamped along behind she doubted that dyelin would take long over her ablutions good news or bad the light send that it was good birgitte hands clasped behind her back and wearing a frown seemed sunk in silence as they walked though she studied every crossing corridor as if expecting an attack from it the bond still carried worry and tiredness a yawn cracked elaynes jaws before she could stop herself an unwillingness to start rumors was not the only reason she maintained a stately pace there were more than servants in the hallways now courtesy had required her to offer rooms in the palace to the nobles who managed to reach the city with armsmencounting armsmen loosely some were welltrained and carried a sword every day others had been guiding a plow before being called to follow their lord or ladyand a fair number had accepted mainly those who had no dwelling in caemlyn or she suspected felt pinched for coin farmers or laborers might think all nobles wealthy and certainly most were if only in comparison but the expenses required by their positions and duties left many counting coins as carefully as any farmwife what she was to do for the newest arrivals she did not know nobles already were sleeping three and four to a bed wherever the beds were large enough all but the narrowest could take at least two and did many kinswomen had been reduced to pallets on the floor in the servants quarters and thank the light spring had made that possible it seemed the whole lot of her noble guests were out strolling and when they offered her courtesies she had to stop and pass at least a few words sergase gilbearn small and slim in a green riding dress her dark hair lightly touched with white who had brought all twenty of the armsmen in her service and vinegary old kelwin janevor wiry in his discreetly darned blue wool coat who had brought ten received as gracious an exchange as did lanky barel layden and stout anthelle sharplyn though they were high seats if of minor houses all had ridden to her support with whatever they could gather and none had turned back on learning the odds many looked uneasy today though no one said anything of itthey were all full of good wishes and hopes for a speedy coronation and how honored they were to follow herbut worry was written on their faces arilinde branstrom normally so ebullient you might think she believed her fifty armsmen could turn the tide for elayne by themselves was not the only woman chewing her lip and laerid traehand stocky and taciturn and usually as stolid as stone was not the only man with a furrowed brow even news of guybon and the aid he had brought caused only brief smiles quickly swallowed in ill ease do you think theyve heard of arymillas confidence she asked in one of the brief intervals when she was not responding to bows and curtsies no that wouldnt be enough to upset arilinde or laerid arymilla inside the walls with thirty thousand men likely would fail to upset that pair it wouldnt birgitte agreed she glanced around as if to see who besides the guardswomen might hear before going on maybe theyre worried over whats been worrying me you didnt get lost when we got back or rather you had help elayne paused to offer a few hurried words to a grayhaired couple in woolens that would have suited prosperous farmers brannin and elvaine martans manor house was much like a large farmhouse sprawling and housing generations a third of their armsmen were their sons and grandsons nephews and greatnephews only those too young or too old to ride had been left behind to see to planting she hoped the smiling pair did not reel they were getting short shrift but she was walking on almost as soon as she stopped what do you mean i had help she demanded the palace is changed for a moment there was confusion in the bond birgitte grimaced it sounds mad i know but its as if the whole thing had been built to a slightly different plan one of the guardswomen ahead missed a step caught herself i have a good memory birgitte hesitated the bond filled with a jumble of emotions hastily pushed down most of her memories of past lives had vanished as surely as the winters snow nothing remained before the founding of the white tower and the four lives she had lived between then and the end of the trolloc wars were beginning to fragment little seemed to frighten her yet she feared losing the rest especially her memories of gaidal cain i dont forget a path once ive followed it she went on and some of these hallways arent the same as they were some of the corridors have been shifted others arent there anymore and there are some new nobody is talking about it that i could find out but i think the old people are keeping quiet because theyre afraid their wits are going and the younger are afraid theyll lose their positions thats elayne shut her mouth clearly it was not impossible birgitte did not suffer from sudden fancies naris reluctance to leave her apartments suddenly made sense and perhaps reenes earlier puzzlement too she almost wished being with child really had befuddled her but how not the forsaken she said firmly if they could do something like this theyd have done it long since and worse than a good day to you too lord aubrem lean and craggy and bald save for a thin white fringe aubrem pensenor should have been dandling his grandchildrens children on his knee but his back was straight his eyes clear he had been among the first to reach caemlyn with near to a hundred men and the first news that it was arymilla marne marching against the city with naean and elenia supporting her he began reminiscing about riding for her mother in the succession until birgitte murmured that lady dyelin would be waiting for her oh in that case dont let me delay you my lady the old man said heartily please give my regards to lady dyelin shes been so busy ive not exchanged two words with her since reaching caemlyn my very best regards if you will house pensenor had been allied to dyelins taravin since time out of mind not the forsaken birgitte said once aubrem was out of earshot but what caused it is only the first question will it happen again if it does will the changes always be benign or might you wake up and find yourself in a room without doors or windows what happens if youre sleeping in a room that disappears if a corridor can go so can a room and what if its more than the palace we need to find out if all the streets still lead where they did what if the next time part of the city wall isnt there anymore you do think dark thoughts elayne said bleakly even with the power in her the possibilities were enough to give her a sour stomach birgitte fingered the four golden knots on the shoulder of her whitecollared red coat they came with these strangely the worry carried by the bond was less now that she had shared her concerns elayne hoped the woman did not think she had answers no that really was impossible birgitte knew her too well for that does this frighten you deni she asked ill admit it does me no more than needful my lady the blocky woman answered without stopping her careful scan of what lay ahead where the others walked with a hand on their sword hilts her hand rested on her long cudgel her voice was as placid and as matteroffact as her face one time a big wagon man named eldrin hackly came near breaking my neck not usually a rough man but he was drunk beyond drunk that night i couldnt get the angle right and my cudgel seemed to bounce off his skull without making a dent that frightened me more because i knew certain sure i was about to die this is just maybe and any day you wake up maybe you die any day you wake up maybe you die there were worse ways to look at life elayne supposed still she shivered she was safe at least till her babes were born but no one else was the two guards at the wide lioncarved doors to the map room were experienced guardsmen one short and the next thing to scrawny the other wide enough to appear squat though he was of average height nothing visible picked them out from any other men in the guards but only good swordsmen trusted men got this duty the short man nodded to deni then straightened his back stiffly at a disapproving frown from birgitte deni smiled at him shylydeni shylywhile a pair of guardswomen went through the inevitable routine birgitte opened her mouth but elayne laid a hand on her arm and the other woman looked at her then shook her head thick golden braid swaying slowly its not good when theyre on duty elayne they should be seeing to their duties not mooning over each other she did not raise her voice yet color appeared in denis round cheeks and she stopped smiling and started watching the corridor again it was better that way perhaps yet still a pity somebody ought to have a little pleasure in their lives the map room was the secondlargest ballroom in the palace and spacious with four redstreaked marble fireplaces where small fires burned beneath the carved mantels a domed ceiling worked with gilt and supported by widely spaced columns two spans from white marble walls that had been stripped of tapestries and sufficient mirrored standlamps to light the room as well as if it had windows the greatest part of its tile floor was a detailed mosaic map of caemlyn originally laid down more than a thousand years ago after the new city had been completed though before low caemlyn began growing long before there was an andor before even artur hawk wing it had been redone several times since as tiles faded or became worn so every street was exactat least they had been until today the light send they still wereand despite many buildings replaced over the years even some of the alleys were unchanged from what the huge map showed there would be no dancing in the map room for the foreseeable future however long tables between the columns held more maps some large enough to spill over the edges and shelves along the walls held stacks of reports those not so sensitive they needed to be locked away or else committed to memory and burned birgittes wide writing table nearly covered with baskets most full of papers stood at the far end of the room as captaingeneral she had her own study but as soon as she discovered the map room she had decided the map in the floor made it too good not to use a small wooden disc painted red marked the spot on the outer wall where the assault had just been beaten back birgitte scooped it up in passing and tossed it into a round basket full of the things on her writing table elayne shook her head it was a small basket but if there were enough attacks at once to need that many markers my lady birgitte i have that report on available fodder you asked for a graying woman said holding out a page covered with neat lines the white lion was worked small on the breast of her neat brown dress five other clerks went on with their work pens skritching they were among master norrys most trusted and mistress harfor had personally screened the half dozen messengers in redandwhite livery swift young menboys reallywho stood against the wall behind the clerks small writing tables one a pretty youth began a bow before cutting it short with a blush birgitte had settled the question of courtesies to her or other nobles with very few words work came first and any noble who disliked that could just avoid the map room thank you mistress anford ill look at it later if you and the others will wait outside please mistress anford quickly gathered up the messengers and the other clerks giving them only time to stopper their ink jars and blot their work no one showed a glimmer of surprise they were accustomed to the need for privacy at times elayne had heard people call the map room the secrets room though nothing very secret was kept there all of that was locked away in her apartments while the clerks and messengers were filing out elayne strode to one of the long tables where a map showed caemlyn and its surroundings for at least fifty miles in each direction even the black tower had been inked in a square sitting less than two leagues south of the city a growth on andor and no way to be rid of it she still sent parties of guardsman to inspect some days via gateways but the place was large enough that the ashaman could have been up to anything without her learning of it pins with enameled heads marked arymillas eight camps around the city and small metal figures various other camps a falcon finely wrought in gold and no taller than her little finger showed where the goshien were or had been were they gone yet she slipped the falcon into her belt pouch aviendha was very much a falcon on the other side of the table birgitte raised a questioning eyebrow theyre gone or going elayne told her there would be visits aviendha was not gone forever sent somewhere by rand where i dont know burn him i wondered why aviendha wasnt with you elayne laid one finger atop a bronze horseman less than a hand tall standing a few leagues west of the city someone needs to take a look at davram basheres camp find out whether the saldaeans are leaving too and the legion of the dragon it did not matter if they were really they had not interfered in matters thank the light and the time when fear that they might restrained arymilla was long past but she disliked things happening in andor without her knowledge send guardsmen to the black tower tomorrow as well tell them to count how many ashaman they see so hes planning a big battle another big battle against the seanchan i suppose folding her arms beneath her breasts birgitte frowned at the map id wonder where and when except we have enough in front of us to be going on with the map displayed the reasons arymilla was pressing so hard for one to the northeast of caemlyn almost off the map lay the bronze image of a sleeping bear curled up with its paws over its nose two hundred thousand men near enough almost as many trained men as all of andor could field four borderland rulers accompanied by perhaps a dozen aes sedai they tried to keep hidden searching for rand their reasons unstated borderlanders had no cause to turn against rand that she could seethough the simple fact was he had not bound them to him as he had other landsbut aes sedai were another matter especially with their allegiance uncertain and twelve approached a dangerous number even for him well the four rulers had in part deciphered her motives for asking them into andor yet she had managed to mislead them concerning rands whereabouts unfortunately the borderlanders had belied every tale of how swiftly they could move as they crept south and now they sat in place trying to find a way to avoid coming near a city under siege that was understandable even laudable outland armies in close proximity to andoran armsmen on andoran soil would make for a touchy situation there were always at least a few hotheads bloodshed and maybe war could start all too easily under those circumstances even so bypassing caemlyn was going to be difficult the narrow country roads had been turned to bogs by the rains giving hard passage to an army that large elayne could have wished they had marched another twenty or thirty miles toward caemlyn though she had hoped their presence would have had a different effect by now it might still more important certainly to arymilla and possibly to herself a few leagues below the black tower stood a tiny silver swordsman with his blade upright in front of him and a silver halberdier plainly by the same silversmiths hand one to the west of the black square the other to the east luan ellorien and abelle aemlyn arathelle and pelivar had close to sixty thousand men between them in those two camps their estates and those of the nobles tied to them must have been stripped near the bone those two camps were where dyelin had been these past three days trying to learn their intentions the spindly guardsman opened one of the doors and held it for an elderly serving woman carrying a ropework silver tray with two tall golden wine picchers and a circle of goblets made of blue sea folk porcelain reene must have been uncertain how many would be present the frail woman moved slowly careful not to tilt the heavy tray and drop anything elayne channeled flows of air to take the tray then let them dissipate unused implying that the woman could not do her job would only be hurtful she was effusive in her thanks though the old woman smiled broadly clearly delighted and offered her a deep curtsy once unburdened of the tray dyelin arrived almost right behind the maid an image of vigor and shooed her out before grimacing over the contents of one pitcherelayne sighed doubtless it held goats milkand filling a goblet from the other plainly dyelin had confined her freshening to washing her face and brushing her hair golden flecked with gray because her dark gray riding dress with a large round silver pin worked with taravins owl and oak on the high neck had spots of halfdried mud on the skirts theres something seriously amiss she said swirling the wine in her goblet without drinking a frown deepened the fine lines at the corners of her eyes ive been in this palace more times than i can remember and today i got lost twice we know about that elayne told her and quickly explained what little they had puzzled out what she intended to do belatedly she wove a ward against eavesdropping and was unsurprised to feel it slice through saidar at least whoever had been listening in would get a jolt from that a small jolt since so little of the power was involved that she had not sensed it maybe there was a way to make it a bard jolt next time though maybe that would begin to discourage eavesdroppers so it might happen again dyelin said when elayne was done her tone was calm but she licked her lips and took a swallow of wine as if her mouth was suddenly dry well well then if you dont know what caused it and you dont know whether it will happen again what are we to do elayne stared again someone seemed to think she had answers she did not but then that was what it meant to be queen you were always expected to have an answer to find one that was what it meant to be aes sedai we cant stop it so well live with it dyelin and try to keep people from growing too afraid ill announce what happened as much as we know and have the other sisters do the same that way people will know that aes sedai are aware and that should provide some comfort a little theyll still be frightened of course but not as much as theyll be if we say nothing and it does happen again that seemed a feeble effort to her but surprisingly dyelin agreed without hesitation i myself can suggest nothing else to be done most people think you aes sedai can handle anything it should suffice in the circumstances and when they realized that aes sedai could not handle anything that she could not well that was a river that she would cross when she reached it is the news good or bad before dyelin could answer the door opened again i heard that lady dyelin had returned you should have sent for us elayne you arent queen yet and i dislike you keeping secrets from me where is aviendha catalyn haevin a cooleyed ungovernable young womana girl in truth still long months short of her majority though her guardian had abandoned her to go her own waywas pride to her toenails her plump chin held high of course that might have been because of the large enameled pin of haevins blue bear that decorated the high neck of her blue riding dress she had begun showing dyelin respect and a certain wariness shortly after she started sharing a bed with her and sergase but with elayne she insisted on every perquisite of a high seat we all heard conail northan said lean and tall in a red silk coat with laughing eyes and an eagles beak of a nose he was of age just a few months past his sixteenth name day he swaggered and caressed the hilt of his sword much too fondly but there seemed no harm in him only boyishness an unfortunate trait in a high seat and none of us could wait to hear when luan and the others will join us this pair would have run the whole way he ruffled the hair of the two younger boys with him perival mantear and branlet gilyard who gave him a dark look and raked fingers through his hair to straighten it perival blushed quite short but already pretty he was the youngest at twelve yet branlet had only a year on him elayne sighed but she could not ask them to leave children most of them might beperhaps all considering conails behavioryet they were the high seats of their houses and along with dyelin her most important allies she did wish she knew how they had learned the purpose of dyelins journey that had been intended to be a secret until she knew what news dyelin brought another task for reene gossip unchecked the wrong gossip could be as dangerous as spies where is aviendha catalyn demanded strangely she had become quite taken with aviendha fascinated might have been a better word of all things she had persisted in trying to make aviendha teach her to use a spear so my lady conail said strolling over to fill a blue goblet with wine when are they joining us the bad news is that they arent dyelin said calmly the good news is that theyve each rejected an invitation to join arymilla she cleared her throat loudly as branlet reached for the wine pitcher his cheeks reddened and he picked up the other pitcher as if he had really meant to all along the high seat of house gilyard yet still a boy for all of the sword on his hip perival also wore a sword one that dragged on the floor tiles and looked too big for him but he had already taken goats milk pouring her own wine catalyn smirked at the younger boys a superior smile that vanished when she noticed dyelin looking at her thats small turnips to call good news birgitte said burn me if it isnt you bring back a bloody halfstarved squirrel and call it a side of beef pungent as always dyelin said dryly the two women glared at each other birgittes hands balling into fists dyelin fingering the dagger at her belt no arguing elayne said making her voice sharp the anger in the bond helped at times she feared the pair might come to blows i wont put up with your bickering today where is aviendha gone catalyn what else did you learn dyelin gone where gone away elayne said calmly saidar or no saidai she wanted to slap the girls face dyelin the older woman took a sip of wine to cover breaking off her staring match with birgitte coming to stand beside elayne she picked up the silver swordsman turned him over set him down again aemlyn arathelle and pelivar tried to convince me to announce a claim to the throne but they were less adamant than when i spoke with them last i believe ive almost convinced them i wont do it almost birgitte put a hundredweight of derision in the word dyelin ignored her pointedly elayne frowned at birgitte who shifted uncomfortably and stalked off long enough to get herself a goblet of wine very satisfying whatever she was doing right she hoped it continued to work my lady perival said with a bow extending one of two goblets he held to elayne she managed a smile and a curtsy before taking the offering goats milk light but she was beginning to revile the stuff luan and abelle were noncommittal dyelin continued frowning at the halberdier they may be swaying toward you she hardly sounded as though she believed it however i reminded luan that he helped me arrest naean and elenia back in the beginning but that may have done no more good than it did with pelivar so they may all be waiting for arymilla to win birgitte said grimly if you survive theyll declare for you against her if you dont one of them will make her own claim ellorien has the next best right after you doesnt she dyelin scowled but she offered no denials and ellorien elayne asked quietly she was sure she knew the answer there already her mother had had ellorien flogged that had been under rahvins influence but few seemed to believe that few seemed to believe gaebril had even been rahvin dyelin grimaced the womans head is stone shed announce a claim in my name if she thought it would do any good at least she has enough sense to see it wont elayne noted that she made no mention of any claims in elloriens own name in any case i left keraille surtovni and julanya fote to watch them i doubt theyll move but if they do well know straightaway three kinswomen who needed to form a circle to travel were watching the borderlanders for the same reason no good news at all then no matter what face dyelin tried to put on it elayne had hoped the threat of the borderlanders would drive some of the houses to support her at least one reason i let them cross anclor still holds she thought grimly even if she failed to gain the throne she had done that service for andor unless whoever did take the throne bungled matters completely she could see arymilla doing just that well arymilla was not going to wear the rose crown and that was that one way or another she had to be stopped so its six six and six catalyn said frowning and thumbing the long signet ring on her left hand she looked thoughtful unusual for her her usual style was to speak her mind with no consideration whatsoever even if candraed joins us we are short often was she wondering whether she had tied haevin to a hopeless cause unfortunately she had not tied her house so tightly the knots could not be undone i was certain luan would join us conail muttered and abelle and pelivar he took a deep swallow of wine once we beat arymilla theyll come you mark me on it but what are they thinking branlet demanded are they trying to start a war with three sides his voice went from treble to bass halfway through that and his face flooded with red he buried his face in his goblet but grimaced apparently he liked goats milk as little as she did its the borderlanders perivals voice was a boys piping but he sounded sure of himself theyre holding back because whoever wins here the borderlanders still have to be dealt with he picked up the bear hefting it as if its weight would give him answers what i dont understand is why theyre invading us in the first place were so far from the borderlands and why havent they marched on and attacked caemlyn they could sweep arymilla aside and i doubt we could keep them out as easily as we do her so why are they here smiling conail clapped him on the shoulder now that will be a battle to see when we face the borderlanders northans eagles and mantears anvil will do andor proud that day eh perival nodded but he did not look happy at the prospect conail certainly did elayne exchanged glances with dyelin and birgitte both of whom looked amazed elayne felt astonished herself the other two women knew of course but little perival had come near touching a secret that had to be kept others might puzzle out eventually that the borderlanders had been meant to push houses into joining her but it must not be confirmed luan and the others sent to arymilla asking for a truce until the borderlanders were turned back dyelin said after a moment she asked time to consider as near as i can calculate it was then that she began increasing her efforts at the walls she tells them shes still considering aside from anything else catalyn said heatedly that shows why arymilla doesnt deserve the throne she puts her own ambition above andors safety luan and the others must be fools not to see it not fools dyelin replied just men and women who think they see the future better than they do what if she and dyelin were the ones who were not seeing the future clearly elayne wondered to save andor she would have thrown her support to dyelin not gladly but to save andors blood she would have dyelin would have the support of ten houses more than ten even danine candraed might finally decide to stir herself in support of dyelin except that dyelin did not want to be queen she believed that elayne was the one to wear the rose crown so did elayne but what if they were wrong not the first time that question had come to her but now staring at the map with all of its ill tidings she could not shake free of it that evening after a dinner memorable only for the surprise of tiny strawberries she sat in the large sitting room of her apartments reading trying to read the leatherbound book was a history of andor as was most of her reading of late it was necessary to read as many as possible to gain any real version of truth crosschecking one against another for one thing a book first published during any monarchs reign never mentioned any of her missteps or those of her immediate predecessors if they were of her own house you had to read books written while trakand held the throne to learn of mantears mistakes and books written under mantear to learn of norwelyns errors others mistakes could teach her how not to make the same herself her mother had made that almost her first lesson she could not concentrate however she often found herself staring at a page without seeing a word thinking of her sister or starting to say something to aviendha before remembering that she was not there she felt very lonely which was ridiculous sephanie stood in a corner against the possibility she wanted anything eight guardswomen were standing outside the door to the apartments and one of them yurith azeri was an excellent conversationalist an educated woman though silent on her past but none of them was aviendha when vandene glided into the room followed by kirstian and zarya it seemed a relief the two whiteclad women stopped by the doorway expressions meek untouched by the oath rod pale kirstian hands folded at her waist appeared just into her middle years zarya with her tilted eyes and hooked nose well short of them she held something wrapped in white toweling forgive me if im interrupting vandene began then frowned the whitehaired greens face somehow gave an impression of age despite her aes sedai features those could have been twenty or forty or anything in between that seemed to change at every blink perhaps it was her dark eyes luminous and deep and pained which had seen so much there was an air of tiredness about her too her back was straight but she still looked weary it is none of my business of course she said delicately but is there a reason you are holding so much of the power i thought you must be weaving something very complex when i felt you in the corridor with a start elayne realized that she held nearly as much ofsaidar as she could contain safely how had that happened she did not recall drawing any deeper hastily she released the source regret filling her as the power drained away and the world became ordinary again on the instant her mood bounced sideways you arent interrupting anything she said peevishly setting her book down on the table in front of her she had not finished three pages of the thing anyway may i make us private then elayne gave a curt nodit was none of the womans bloody business how much of the power she held she knew the protocols as well as elayne or betterand told sephanie to wait in the anteroom while vandene wove a ward against eavesdropping ward or no ward vandene waited until the door closed behind the maid before speaking reanne corly is dead elayne oh light no temper vanished into sobs and she hastily snatched a laceedged handkerchief from her sleeve to blot the tears suddenly streaming down her cheeks her cursed shifting moods at work yet reanne surely deserved tears she had so wanted to become a green how burn her she wished she could stop blubbering there were no tears from vandene perhaps there were no more tears in her she was smothered with the power whoever did it used much more than was needed the residues of saidar were thick on her and in the room where she was found the murderer wanted to be sure no one would miss seeing how she died that makes no sense vandene perhaps it does zarya the saldaean woman laid her small bundle on rhe table and unwrapped it to reveal an articulated wooden doll it was very old the simple dress threadbare the painted face flaking and missing an eye half of its long dark hair gone this belonged to mirane larinen zarya said derys nermala found it behind a cupboard i dont see what mirane leaving a doll behind has to do with reannes death elayne said wiping her eyes mirane was one of the kinswomen who had run away only this vandene answered when mirane went to the tower she hid this doll outside because she had heard that everything she owned would be burned after she was put out she retrieved it and always carried it with her always she had a quirk though wherever she stopped for a time she hid the doll again do not ask me why but she would not have run away and abandoned it still dabbing at her eyes elayne leaned back in her chair her weeping had dwindled to sniffles but her eyes still leaked tears so mirane didnt run away she was murdered and disposed of a grisly way to put it the others too you think all of them vandene nodded and for a moment her slender shoulders slumped i very much fear so she said straightening i expect clues were left among the things they left behind treasured keepsakes like this doll a favorite piece of jewelry the murderer wanted us to think she was being clever at hiding her crimes but not clever enough only we werent clever enough to find those clues so she decided to become more blatant to frighten the kinswomen into fleeing elayne muttered that would not cripple her but it would throw her back on the mercies of the windfinders and those seemed to be growing mingy how many of them know of this all by now i should think vandene said dryly zarya told derys to keep quiet but that woman likes the sound of her own voice this seems aimed at me at helping arymilla gain the throne but why would a black sister have any interest in that i cant think we have two murderers among us at least this settles the question of merilille speak with sumeko and alise vandene they can make sure the rest dont panic sumeko ranked next after reanne as the kin ordered their hierarchy and while alise stood much lower she was a woman of great influence from now on none of them is to be alone not ever always at least two together and three or four would be better and warn them to be careful of careane and sareitha id advise against that vandene said quickly they should be safe in groups and word would reach careane and sareitha warned against aes sedai the kin would give themselves away in a minute kirstian and zarya nodded solemnly after a moment elayne reluctantly agreed to the continued secrecy the kin should be safe in groups let chanelle know about reanne and the others i cant imagine the windfinders are in any dangerlosing them wouldnt hurt me the way losing the kin wouldbut wouldnt it be wonderful if they did decide to leave she did not expect that they wouldchanelle feared returning to the sea folk with the bargain unfulfilledyet it would be a bright spot in an otherwise miserable day if they did at least it seemed unlikely anything could darken the day further the thought sent a chill through her the light send nothing would darken it more arymilla pushed her plate of stew away with a grimace she had been offered her choice of beds for the nightarlene her maid was making the choice now the woman knew what she likedand the least she had expected was a decent meal but the mutton was fatty and definitely beginning to go rancid besides there had been too much of that lately this time the cook was going to be flogged she was unsure which of the nobles in this camp employed him just that he was supposed to be the best at handthe bestbut that did not matter he would be flogged to make an example and then sent away of course you could never trust a cook after he had been punished the mood in the tent was far from lively several of the nobles in the camp had hoped for invitations to dine with her but none stood high enough she was beginning to regret not asking one or two even some of naeans or elenias people they might have been entertaining her closest allies at table together and you might have thought they sat over funeral meats oh scrawny old nasin his thinning white hair uncombed was eating away heartily apparently not noticing that the meat was nearly rotten and giving her fatherly pats on the hand she met his smiles like a dutiful daughter the fool was wearing one of his flowerembroidered coats tonight the thing could have passed for a womans dressing robe happily his leers were all directed down the table at elenia the honeyhaired woman flinched her foxlike face paling whenever she glanced at him she controlled house sarand as if she were the high seat instead of her husband yet she feared that arymilla would still let nasin have his way with her that threat was unneeded now but it was well to have it to hand just in case yes nasin was happy enough in his futile pursuit of elenia but the others were sunk in gloom their plates were abandoned barely touched and they kept her two serving men trotting to refill wine cups she never liked trusting others servants at least the wine had not turned i still say we should make a heavier push lir grumbled drunkenly into his cup a whip of a man his red coat showing the wear of armor straps the high seat of baryn was ever eager to strike subtlety was simply beyond him my eyesandears report more armsmen entering the city every day through these gateways he shook his head and muttered something under his breath the man actually believed those rumors of dozens of aes sedai in the royal palace all these pinprick attacks do is lose men i agree karind said fiddling with a large golden pin enameled with the running red fox of anshar that was fastened to her bosom she was not much less intoxicated than lir her square face had a slackness about it we need to press home instead of throwing men away once were over the walls our advantage in numbers will pay off arymillas mouth tightened they might at least show her the respect due a woman who was soon to be queen of andor rather than disagreeing with her all the time unfortunately baryn and anshar were not bound to her so tightly as sarand and arawn unlike jarid and naean lir and karind had announced their support of her without publishing it in writing neither had nasin but she had no fear of losing him him she had wound around her wrist for a bracelet forcing a smile she made her voice jovial we lose mercenaries what else are mercenaries good for if not dying in place of our armsmen she held up her winecup and a lean man in her silvertrimmed blue hastened to fill it in fact he was so hasty that he spilled a drop on her hand her scowl made him snatch a handkerchief from his pocket to blot up the drop before she could pull her hand away his handkerchief the light only knew where that filthy thing had been and he had touched her with it his mouth writhed with fear as he retreated bowing and mumbling apologies let him serve out the meal he could be dismissed after we will need all of our armsmen when i ride against the borderlanders dont you agree naean naean twitched as though stuck with a pin slim and pale in yellow silk worked with silver patterns of arawns triple keys on the breast she had begun looking haggard in recent weeks her blue eyes drawn and tired all of her supercilious airs were quite gone of course arymilla she said meekly and drained her cup good she and elenia were definitely tamed but arymilla liked to check now and then to make sure neither was growing a new backbone if luan and the others will not support you what good will taking caemlyn do sylvase nasins granddaughter and heir spoke so seldom that the question came as a shock sturdy and not quite pretty she usually had a vapid gaze but her blue eyes appeared quite sharp at the moment everyone stared at her that seemed not to faze her a bit she toyed with a winecup but arymilla thought it no more than her second if we must fight the borderlanders why not accept luans truce so andor can field its full strength unhindered by divisions arymilla smiled she wanted to slap the silly woman nasin would be angered by that however he wanted her kept as arymillas guest to prevent his removal as high seatpart of him seemed aware that his wits were gone all of him intended holding on as high seat until he diedbut he did love her ellorien and some of the others will come to me yet child she said smoothly smoothness required some effort who did the chit think she was aemlyn arathelle pelivar they have grievances against trakand surely they would come once elayne and dyelin were out of the way those two would not survive caemlyns fall once i have the city they will be mine in any event three of elaynes supporters are children and conail northan is little more than a child i trust i can convince them to publish their support of me easily enough and if she could not master lounalt surely could a pity if children had to be handed over to him and his cords i will be queen by sunset of the day caemlyn falls to me isnt that right father nasin laughed spraying gobbets of halfchewed stew across the table yes yes he said patting arymillas hand you listen to your aunt sylvase do as she tells you shell be queen of andor soon his smile faded and an odd note entered his voice it might almost have been pleading remember you will be high seat of caeren after im gone after im gone you will be high seat as you say grandfather sylvase murmured inclining her head briefly when she straightened her gaze was as insipid as ever the sharpness must have been a trick of the light of course nasin grunted and went happily back to wolfing down the stew best ive had in days i think ill have another plate more wine here man cant you see my cups dry the silence around the table stretched in discomfort nasins more open displays of senility had a way of causing that i still say lir began finally only to cut off as a stocky armsman with marnes four silver moons on his chest entered the tent bowing respectfully the fellow made his way around the table and bent to whisper in arymillas ear master hernvil asks a word in private my lady everyone but nasin and his granddaughter pretended to concentrate on their wine certainly not attempting to eavesdrop he went on eating she watched arymilla blandfaced that sharpness must have been a trick of the light ill be but a few moments arymilla said rising she waved a hand indicating the food and wine enjoy yourselves until i return enjoy lir called for more wine outside she did not bother raising her skirts to keep them clear of the mud arlene would already have to clean them so what did a little more mud matter light showed in some tents but by and large the camp was dark beneath a half moon jakob hernvil her secretary waited a little away from the tent in a plain coat holding a lantern that made a yellow pool around him he was a little man and lean as if all the fat had been boiled from him discretion was bred in his bones and she ensured his loyalty by paying him enough that only the largest bribes could be of interest far more than anyone would offer a scrivener forgive me for interrupting your meal my lady he said with a bow but i was sure you would want to hear right away it was always a surprise hearing such a deep voice from such a tiny man they have agreed but they want the whole amount of gold first her lips compressed of their own accord the whole amount she had hoped to get off with paying only the first half after all who would dare dun her once she was queen draw up a letter to mistress andscale ill sign and seal it first thing in the morning transferring that much gold would require days and how long to have the armsmen ready she had never really paid attention to that sort of thing lir could tell her but she hated showing weakness tell them a week from tomorrow to the day that should be enough in a week caemlyn would be hers the throne would be hers arymilla by the grace of the light queen of andor defender of the realm protector of the people high seat of house marne smiling she went back inside to tell the others the wonderful news chapter eighteen news for the dragon enough loial rand said firmly thumbing tabac into his shortstemmed pipe from a goatskin pouch it was tairen leaf with a slightly oily taste from the curing but that was all that was to be had thunder rolled overhead slow and ponderous youll talk me hoarse with all these questions they were seated at a long table in one of the larger rooms in lord algarins manor house the remains of the midday meal pushed down to one end the servants were old for the most part and slower moving than ever since algarin left for the black tower the rain pouring down outside seemed to be slackening though strong gusts of wind still pelted the windows with raindrops hard enough to rattle the glass in the six yellowpainted casements many of those panes held bubbles some distorted what lay outside almost beyond recognition the table and chairs were simply carved no more elaborate than might be found in many farmhouses and the yellow cornices beneath the high beamed ceiling little more so the two fireplaces at either end of the room were broad and tall but of plain stone the andirons and firetools sturdy wrought iron and simple lord or no algarin was far from wealthy tucking the tabac pouch into his pocket rand strolled to one of the fireplaces and used small brass tongs from the mantel to lift a burning sliver of oak for lighting his pipe he hoped no one thought that strange he avoided channeling any more than absolutely necessary especially if anyone else was presentthe dizziness that hit him when he did was difficult to concealbut no one had mentioned it so far a gust of wind brought a squeaking as though tree branches had scraped across the windowpanes imagination the nearest trees were beyond the fields more than half a mile away loial had brought down a vinecarved chair from the ogier rooms that put his knees level with the tabletop so he had to lean forward sharply to write in his leatherbound notebook the volume was small for him little enough to fit neatly into one of his capacious coat pockets but still as large as most human books rand had seen fine hair decorated loials upper lip and a patch beneath his chin he was attempting a beard and mustaches though with only a few weeks growth it did not seem a very successful attempt so far but youve told me almost nothing really useful the ogier rumbled a drum booming its disappointment his tufted ears drooped even so he began wiping the steel nib of his polished wooden pen fatter than rands thumb and long enough to seem slender it fitted loials thick fingers perfectly you never mention heroics except by somebody else you make it all sound so everyday to hear you tell it the fall of iilian was as exciting as watching a weaver repair her loom and cleansing the true source you and nynaeve linked then you sat and channeled while everybody else was off fighting forsaken even nynaeve told me more than that and she claims to remember almost nothing nynaeve wearing all of her jeweled terangreal and her strange braceletandrings angreal shifted in her chair in front of the other fireplace then went back to watching alivia every so often she glanced toward the windows and tugged at her thick braid but for the most part she focused on the yellowhaired seanchan woman standing beside the doorway like a guard alivia gave a small brief smile of amusement the former damane knew nynaeves display was meant for her the intensity never left her hawkish blue eyes though it seldom had ever since her collar had been removed in caemlyn the two maidens squatting on their heels near her playing cats cradle harilin of the iron mountain taardad and enaila of the jarra chareen were making their own display shoufa wrapped around their heads and black veils hanging down their chests each had three or four spears stuck through the harness holding her bow case on her back and a bullhide buckler lying on the floor there were fifty maidens in the manor house several of them shaido and they all went about ready to dance the spears in a heartbeat perhaps with him they seemed torn between delight at providing a guard for him again and displeasure over how long he had avoided them as for himself he could not look at any of them without the litany of women who had died for him women he had killed starting up in his head moiraine damodred her above all her name was written inside his skull in fire liah of the cosaida chareen sendara of the iron mountain taardad lamelle of the smoke water miagoma andhilin of the red salt goshien desora of the musara reyn so many names sometimes he woke in the middle of the night muttering that list with min holding him and murmuring to him as if soothing a child he always told her he was all right and wanted to go back to sleep yet after he closed his eyes he did not sleep until the list had been completed sometimes lews therin chanted it with him min looked up from the volume she had open on the table one of herid fels books she devoured those and used the note he had sent rand before his murder the one where he said she was a distraction because she was so pretty as a bookmark her short blue coat embroidered with white flowers on the sleeves and lapels was cut to fit snugly over her bosom where her creamy silk blouse showed a touch of cleavage and her big dark eyes framed by dark ringlets to her shoulders held a pleased light he could feel her pleasure through the bond she liked him looking at her without a doubt the bond told her how much he liked looking oddly enough it said she liked looking at him too pretty he hummed thumbing his earlobe she was beautiful and tied to him tighter than ever she and elayne and aviendha how was he to keep them safe now he forced himself to smile back at her around his pipestem unsure how well the deception was working a touch of irritation had entered the bond from her end though why she should become irritable whenever she thought he was worrying about her was beyond him light she wanted to protect himt rand isnt very talkative loial she said no longer smiling her low almost musical voice held no anger but the bond told another story in fact sometimes hes about as talkative as a mussel the look she directed at rand made him sigh it seemed there would be a great deal of talking once they were alone together i cant tell you much myself but im sure cadsuane and venn will tell you anything you want to know others will too ask them if you want more than yes and no and two words besides stout little verin knitting in a chair beside nynaeve appeared startled to hear her name mentioned she blinked vaguely as though wondering why it had been cadsuane at the far end of the table with her sewing basket open beside her only took her attention away from her embroidery hoop long enough to glance at loial golden ornaments swayed dangling from the irongray bun atop her head it was only that a glance not a frown yet loials ears twitched aes sedai always impressed him and cadsuane more than any other oh i will min i will he said but rand is central to my book with no sand jar at hand he began blowing gently on the page of his notebook to dry the ink but loial being loial he still talked between puffs you never give enough detail rand you make me drag everything out of you why you never even mentioned being imprisoned in far madding until min did never mentioned it what did the council of nine say when they offered you the laurel crown and when you renamed it i cant think they liked that what was the coronation like was there feasting a festival parades how many forsaken came against you at shadar logoth which ones what did it look like at the end what did he feel like my book wont be very good without the details i hope mat and perrin give me better answers he frowned long eyebrows grazing his cheeks i hope theyre all right colors spun in rands head twin rainbows swirled in water he knew how to suppress them now but this time he did not try one resolved into a brief image of mat riding through forest at the head of a line of mounted folk he seemed to be arguing with a small dark woman who rode beside him taking his hat off and peering into it then cramming it back onto his head that lasted only moments then was replaced by perrin sitting over winecups in a common room or tavern with a man and a woman who wore identical red coats ornately trimmed with blue and yellow odd garments perrin looked grim as death his companions wary of him theyre well he said calmly ignoring a piercing look from cadsuane she did not know everything and he intended to keep it that way calm on the surface content blowing smoke rings inside was another matter where are they he thought angrily pushing down another appearance of the colors that was as easy as breathing now i need them and theyre off for a day at the ansaline gardens abruptly another image was floating his head a mans face and his breath caught for the first time it came without any dizziness for the first time he could see it clearly in the moments before it vanished a blueeyed man with a square chin perhaps a few years older than himself or rather he saw it clearly for the first time in a long while it was the face of the stranger who had saved his life in shadar logoth when he fought sammael worse he was aware of me lews therin said he sounded sane for a change sometimes he did but the madness always returned eventually how can a face appearing in my mind be aware of me if you dont know how do yon expect me to rand thought but i was aware of him as well it had been a strange sensation as if he were touching the other man somehow only not physically a residue hung on it seemed he only had to move a hairs breadth in any direction to touch him again i think he saw my face too talking to a voice in his head no longer seemed peculiar in truth it had not for quite a long time and now now he could see mat and perrin by thinking of them or hearing their names and he had this other face coming to him unbidden more than a face apparently what was holding conversations inside his own skull alongside that but the man had been aware and rand of him when our streams of balefire touched in shadar logoth it must have created some sort of link between us i cant think of any other explanation that was the only time we ever met he was using their socalled true power it had to be that i felt nothing saw nothing except his stream of balefire having bits of knowledge seem his when he knew they came from lews therin no longer seemed odd either he could remember the ansaline gardens destroyed in the war of the shadow as well as he did his fathers farm knowledge drifted the other way too lews therin sometimes spoke of emonds field as if he had grown up there does that make any sense to you oh light why do i have this voice in my head lews therin moaned why can i not die oh ilyena my precious ilyena i want to join you he trailed off into weeping he often did when he spoke of the wife he had murdered in his madness it did not matter rand suppressed the sound of the man crying pushed it down to a faint noise on the edge of hearing he was certain that he was right but who was the fellow a darkfriend for sure but not one of the forsaken lews therin knew their faces as well as he knew his own and now rand did too a sudden thought made him grimace how aware of him was the other man taveren could be found by their effect on the pattern though only the forsaken knew how lews therin certainly had never mentioned knowingtheir conversations were always brief and the man seldom gave information willinglyand nothing had drifted across from him on the subject at least lanfear and ishamael had known how but no one had found him that way since they had died could this link be used in the same fashion they could all be in danger more danger than usual as if the usual were not enough are you well rand loial asked worriedly screwing the leafengraved silver cap onto his ink jar the glass of that was so thick it could have survived anything short of being hurled against stone but loial handled it as though it were fragile in his huge hands it looked fragile i thought the cheese tasted off but you ate a good bit of it im fine rand said but of course nynaeve paid him no heed she was out of her chair and gliding down the room in a flash blue skirts swirling goose bumps popped out on his skin as she embraced saidar and stretched to lay her hands on his head an instant later a chill rippled through him the woman never askedl sometimes she behaved as if she were still the wisdom in emonds field and he would be heading back to the farm come morning youre not ill she said in tones of relief spoiled food was causing all sorts of sickness among the servants some of it serious people would have died except for the presence of ashaman and aes sedai to give healing reluctant to cost their lord scarce money by throwing food out despite all the admonitions cadsuane and nynaeve and the other aes sedai gave them they fed themselves things that should have been tossed on the midden heap a different tingling centered briefly around the double wound in his left side that wound is no better she said with a frown she had tried healing it succeeding no better than flinn had that did not sit well with her nynaeve took failure as a personal insult how can you even stand up you must be in agony he ignores it min said flatly oh yes there would be words it hurts no worse standing than sitting he told nynaeve gently taking her hands from his head simple truth so was what min had said he could not afford to let pain make him a prisoner one of the twinned doors creaked open to admit a whitehaired man in a worn yellow coat trimmed with red and blue that hung loosely on his bony frame his bow was halting a fault of his joints rather than disrespect my lord dragon he said in a voice nearly as creaky as the hinges lord logain has returned logain did not wait on invitations entering practically on the serving mans heels a tall man with dark hair curling to his shoulders and dark for a ghealdanin women likely thought him handsome yet there was a streak of darkness inside him as well he wore his black coat with the sword and the dragon on the high collar and a longhiked sword on his hip but he had made an addition a round enameled pin on his shoulder showing three golden crowns in u field of blue had the man adopted a sigil the old mans hairy eyebrows shot up in surprise and he looked to rand as if inquiring whether he wanted logain removed the news from andor is fair enough i suppose logain said tucking black gauntlets behind his sword belt he offered rand a minimal bow the slightest bending of his back elayne still holds caemlyn and arymilla still holds her siege but elayne has the advantage since arymilla cant even stop food getting in much less reinforcements no need to scowl i kept out of the city black coats arent exactly welcome there in any case the borderlanders are still in the same place you were wise to stay clear of them it seems rumor says there are thirteen aes sedai with them rumor says theyre looking for you has bashere gotten back yet nynaeve gave him a scowl and moved away from rand gripping her braid tightly aes sedai bonding ashaman was all very well in her book but not the reverse thirteen and looking for him he had stayed clear of the borderlanders because elayne did not welcome his helpinterference she called it and he had begun to see that she had the right of it the lion throne was hers to gain not his to givebut perhaps it was as well that he had the borderland rulers all had ties to the white tower and no doubt elaida was still eager to get her hands on him her and that mad proclamation about no one approaching him except through her if she believed that would force him to come to her she was a fool thank you that will be all ethin lord logain he asked as the serving man bowed himself out with a last disgruntled glance at logain rand thought the man would have tried had he told him to haul logain out the title is his by birth cadsuane said without looking up from her embroidery she would know she had helped capture him back when he was calling himself the dragon reborn him and taim both her hair ornaments bobbed as she nodded to herself phaw a minor lordling with a scrap of land in the mountains most of it all but straight up and down but king johanin and the crown high council stripped him of his lands and title after he became a false dragon small spots of color appeared in logains cheeks yet his voice was cool and composed they could take my estate but they could not take away who i am still seemingly intent on her embroidery needle cadsuane laughed softly verins knitting needles had stopped she was studying logain a plump sparrow studying an insect alivia had shifted her intense gaze to the man too and harilin and enaila seemed to be just going through the motions of their game min appeared to be reading still but each hand rested near the opposite cuff of her coatsleeves she kept some of her knives hidden there none of them trusted him rand frowned the man could call himself whatever he wanted so long as he did what he was supposed to but cadsuane prodded him and anyone else in a black coat nearly as much as she did rand himself he was unsure how far to trust logain either yet he had to work with the tools he had to hand is it done with logain here loial was uncapping his ink jar again more than half the black tower is in arad doman and illian i sent all the men with bonded aes sedai except those here as you ordered logain walked to the table while he talked found a blueglazed pitcher that still held wine among the plates and scraps and filled a greenglazed cup there was very little silver in the house you should have let me bring more men here the numbers tilt too much to aes sedai for my liking rand grunted since part of that is your doing you can live with it others will have to as well go on dobraine and rhuarc will send a soldier with a message as soon as they find anyone in charge of more than a village the council of merchants claim king alsalam still reigns but they wouldnt or couldnt produce him or say where he is they seem to be at one anothers throats themselves and bandar eban is more than half deserted and given over to the mob logain grimaced into his winecup gangs of strongarms provide what little order there is and they extort food and coin from the people they claim to protect and take whatever else they want including women the bond suddenly held whitehot rage and nynaeve growled in her throat rhuarc has set about putting an end to that but it was already turning into a battle when i left logain finished strongarms wont hold out long against aiel if dobraine cant find anyone in charge then he will have to be for the time being if alsalam was dead as seemed likely he would have to appoint a steward for the lord dragon in arad doman but who it would have to be someone the domani would accept the other man took a long swallow of wine taim wasnt pleased at me taking so many men out of the tower and not telling him where they were going i thought he was going to rip up your order he tried every trick to learn where you are oh he burns to know that his eyes were practically on fire i wouldnt put it past him to have had me put to the question if id been fool enough to meet him without company one thing pleased him though that i didnt take any of his cronies that was plain on his face he smiled a dark smile not amused there are fortyone of those now by the way hes given over a dozen men the dragon pin in the past few days and he has above fifty more in his special classes most of them men recruited just lately hes planning something and i doubt youll like it i told you to kill him when you had the chance lews therin cackled in mad mirth i told you and now its too late too late rand angrily expelled a stream of bluegray smoke give over he said meaning it for both logain and lews therin taim built the black tower till it nearly matches the white tower for numbers and it grows every day if hes a darkfriend the way you claim why would he do that logain met his stare levelly because he couldnt stop it from what ive heard even in the beginning there were men who could travel who werent his toadeaters and he had no excuse to do all the recruiting himself but hes made a tower of his own hidden inside the black tower and the men in it are loyal to him not you he amended the deserters list and sends his apologies for an honest mistake but you can wager all you own it was no mistake and how loyal was logain if one false dragon chafed at following the dragon reborn why not another he might think he had cause he had been far more famous as a false dragon than taim more successful gathering an army that swept out of ghealdan and nearly reached lugard on its way to tear half the known world had trembled at the name logain yet mazrim taim commanded the black tower while logain ablar was only another ashaman min still saw an aura of glory around him just how that glory was to be achieved was beyond her viewing however he took the pipe from his mouth and the bowl was hot against the heron branded into his palm he must have been puffing away furiously without being aware of it the trouble was taim and logain were lesser problems they had to wait the tools at hand he made an effort to keep his voice even taim took their names off the list thats the important thing if hes showing favoritism ill put an end to it when i have time but the seanchan have to come first and maybe tarmon gaidon too if logain growled slamming his cup down on the table so hard that it broke wine spread across the tabletop and dripped over the edge scowling he wiped his damp hand on his coat do you think im imagining things his tone grew more heated by the word or making them up do you think this is jealousy althor is that what you think you listen to me rand began raising his voice against a peal of thunder i told you i expected you and your friends in black coats to be civil to me my friends and my guests cadsuane said sternly but ive decided that must be expanded to include each other her head was still bent over her embroidery hoop but she spoke as if she were shaking a finger under their noses at least when i am present that means if you continue squabbling i may have to spank both of you harilin and enaila began laughing so hard they got the string of their game in a snarl nynaeve laughed too though she tried to hide it behind her hand light even min smiled logain bristled jaw tightening until rand thought he should hear the mans teeth grating he was trying hard not to bristle himself cadsuane and her bloody rules her conditions for becoming his advisor she pretended that he had askedtor them and every so often she added another to her list the rules were not precisely onerous though their existence was but her way of presenting them was always like a poke with a sharp stick he opened his mouth to tell her he was finished with her rules and with her too if need be taim very likely will have to wait on the last battle whatever hes about verin said suddenly her knitting a shapeless lump that might have been anything sat in her lap it will come soon according to everything ive read on the subject the signs are quite clear half the servants have recognized dead people in the halls people they knew alive its happened often enough that they arent frightened by it any longer and a dozen men moving the cattle to spring pasture watched a considerable town melt into mist just a few miles to the north cadsuane had raised her head and was staring at the stout brown sister thank you for repeating what you told us yesterday verin she said dryly verin blinked then took up her knitting again frowning at it as though she too were unsure what it was going to be min caught rands eyes shaking her head slowly and he sighed the bond held irritation and wariness the last a deliberate warning to him he suspected at times she seemed able to read his mind well if he needed cadsuane and min said he did then he needed her he just wished he knew what she was supposed to teach him aside from how to grind his teeth advise me cadsuane what do you think of my plan at last the boy asks she murmured setting her embroidery down beside her sewing basket all his schemes in motion some ive not been made privy to and now he asks very well your peace with the seanchan will be unpopular a truce he broke in and a truce with the dragon reborn will last only as long as the dragon reborn when i die everyone will be free to go to war with the seanchan again if they wish min slammed her book shut and folded her arms beneath her breasts dont you talk that way she said redfaced with anger the bond also carried fear the prophecies min he said sadly not sad for himself but for her he wanted to protect her her and elayne and aviendha but he would hurt them in the end i said dont you talk that way the prophecies dont say you have to die im not going to let you die rand althor elayne and aviendha and i wont let you she glared at alivia who her viewing had said would help rand die and her hands slid down her arms toward her cuffs behave min he said her hands shot away from her cuffs but she set her jaw and the bond suddenly was flooded with stubbornness light was he going to have to worry about min trying to kill alivia not that she was likely to succeedas well try throwing a knife at an aes sedai as at the seanchan womanbut she might get herself injured he was not sure alivia knew any weaves but those for weapons unpopular as i say cadsuane said firmly raising her voice she favored min with a brief frown before turning her attention back to rand her face was smooth composed an aes sedais face her dark eyes were hard like polished black stones especially in tarabon amadicia and altara but also elsewhere if you agree to allow the seanchan to keep what theyve already taken what lands will you give away next that is how most rulers will see matters rand dropped back into his chair stretching his legs in front of him and crossing his ankles it doesnt matter how unpopular it is i went through that doorframe terangreal in tear cadsuane you know about that golden ornaments bobbled as she nodded impatiently one of my questions for the aelfinn was how can i win the last battle a dangerous question to pose she said quietly touching on the shadow as it does supposedly the results can be quite unpleasant what was the answer the north and the east must be as one the west and the south must be as one the two must be as one he blew a smoke ring put another in the middle of it as it expanded that was not the whole of it he had asked how to win and survive the last part of his answet had been to live you must die not something he was going to bring up in front of min anytime soon in front of anyone except alivia for that matter now he just had to figure out how to live by dying at first i thought it meant i had to conquer everywhere but that wasnt what they said what if it means the seanchan hold the west and south as you could say they already do and theres an alliance to fight the last battle the seanchan with everybody else its possible she allowed but if youre going to make this truce why are you moving what seems to be a considerable army to arad doman and reinforcing what is already in illian because tarmon gaidon is coming cadsuane and i cant fight the shadow and the seanchan at the same time ill have a truce or ill crush them whatever the cost the prophecies say i have to bind the nine moons to me i only understood what that meant a few days ago as soon as bashere returns ill know when and where im to meet the daughter of the nine moons the only question now is how do i bind her and shell have to answer that he spoke matteroffactly now and then blowing a smoke ring for punctuation reactions varied loial just wrote very fast trying to capture every word while harilin and enaila went on with their game if the spears had to be danced they were ready alivia nodded fiercely doubtless hoping it would come to crushing those who had kept her wearing an a dam for five hundred years logain had found another winecup and filled it with the last of what was in the pitcher but he merely held the cup rather than drinking his expression unreadable now it was rand whom verin studied intently but then she had always been curious about him but why in the light would min feel bonedeep sadness and cadsuane stone cracks from a hard enough blow she said her face an aes sedai mask of calm steel shatters the oak fights the wind and breaks the willow bends where it must and survives a willow wont win tarmon gaidon he told her the door creaked open again and ethin tottered in my lord dragon three ogier have arrived they were most pleased to learn that master loial is here one of them is his mother my mother loial squeaked and even that sounded like a hollow wind gusting in caverns he leaped up so fast that his chair fell over backward wringing his hands ears wilting his head swung from side to side as if he were hunting for a way out besides the door what am i going to do rand the other two must be elder haman and erith what am i going to do mistress covril said she was most anxious to speak with you master loial ethin said in that creaky voice most anxious they are all damp from the rain but she said they will wait for you in the ogier sitting room upstairs what am i going to do rand you said you want to marry erith rand said as gently as he could gentleness was difficult except with min but my book my notes arent complete and ill never find out what happens next erith will take me back to stedding tsofu with her phaw cadsuane picked up her embroidery again and began working the needle delicately she was making the ancient symbol of aes sedai the dragons fang and the flame of tar valon melded into a disc black and white separated by a sinuous line go to your mother loial if shes covril daughter of ella daughter ofsoong you dont want to keep her waiting as i expect you know loial seemed to take cadsuanes words as a command he began wiping his pen nib again capping his ink jar but he did everything very slowly with his ears drooping every so often he moaned sadly half under his breath my book well verin said holding up her knitting for inspection i believe i have done all that i can here i think ill go find tomas the rain makes his knee ache though he denies it even to me she glanced at the window it does seem to be slowing and i think ill go find lan nynaeve said gathering her skirts the company is better where he is that with a sharp tug on her braid and a glare divided between alivia and logain the wind tells me a storm is coming rand and you know i dont mean rain the last battle rand asked how soon when it came to weather listening to the wind could sometimes tell her when the rains would come to the hour it may be and i dont know just remember a storm is coming a terrible storm overhead thunder rolled chapter nineteen vows uneasy loial watched nynaeve glide off down the lamplit corridor in one direction and verin in the other neither was much taller than his waist but they were aes sedai the fact knotted his tongue sufficiently that by the time he had worked up his nerve to ask one of them to accompany him both were out of sight around sharp corners the manor house was a rambling place added to over many years with no real overall plan that he could discern and hallways frequently met at odd angles he really wished he had an aes sedai for company when he faced his mother even cadsuane although she made him very nervous with how she was always pinching at rand sooner or later rand was going to explode he was not the same man loial first met in caemlyn or even the man he had left in cairhien the mood around rand was dark and stony now a dense patch of lions claw and treacherous ground underfoot the whole house felt that way with rand in it a lean grayhaired serving woman carrying a basket of folded towels gave a start then shook her head and muttered something under her breath before offering him a brief curtsy and walking on she made a small sidestep as though she was moving around something or someone he stared at the spot and scratched behind his ear maybe he could only see ogier dead not that he actually wanted to it was sad enough just knowing that human dead could no longer rest having the same confirmed for ogier would be enough to break his heart most likely they would appear only inside stedding in any case he would very much like to see a town vanish though not a real town but a town that was as dead as those spirits the humans claimed to see you might be able to walk its streets before it melted and see what people were like before the war of the hundred years or even the trolloc wars so verin said and she seemed to know a very great deal about it that would certainly be worth a mention in his book it was going to be a fine book scratching his beard with two fingersthe thing itchedhe sighed it would have been a fine book standing there in the corridor was only putting off the inevitable put off clearing the brush and you always find chokevine in it so the old saying went only he felt as though the chokevine was tight around him instead of a tree breathing hard he followed the serving woman all the way to the wide stairs that led up to the ogier rooms the staircase had two sturdy bannisters shoulderhigh on the grayhaired woman and stout enough to give a decent handhold he was often afraid just to brush against stair rails made for humans for fear he might break them one ran down the middle with the steps along the woodpaneled wall pitched for human feet those on the outside for ogier the woman was old as humans counted years yet she climbed more quickly than he and was scurrying down the corridor by the time he reached the top doubtless she was taking the towels to his mothers room and to elder hainans and eriths surely they would prefer to get dry before talking he would suggest that it would gain him time to think his thoughts seemed as sluggish as his feet and his feet felt like millstones there were six bedrooms built for ogier along the corridor which itself was properly scaled for themhis upstretched hands would have come a pace short of touching the ceiling beamsalong with a storeroom a bathing room with a large copper tub and the sitting room this was the oldest part of the house dating back nearly five hundred years a lifetime for a very old ogier but many lifetimes for humans they lived such brief lives except for aes sedai that had to be why they flitted about like hummingbirds but even aes sedai could be nearly as precipitous as the rest that was a puzzlement the sitting room door was carved with a great tree not ogier work yet finely detailed and instantly recognizable he stopped tugging his coat straight combing his hair with his fingers wishing he had time to black his boots there was an ink stain on his cuff no time to do anything about that either cadsuane was right his mother was not a woman to be kept waiting strange that cadsuane knew of her perhaps knew her by the way she had spoken covril daughter of ella daughter of soong was a famous speaker but he had not realized she was known outside light he was all but panting with anxiety trying to control his breathing he went in even here the hinges creaked the servants had been aghast when he asked after some oil to put on themthat was their task he was a guestbut they still had not gotten around to it themselves the highceilinged room was quite spacious with dark polished wallpapers and vinecarved chairs and small vinecarved tables and wroughtiron standlamps of a proper size their mirrored flames dancing above his head except for a shelf of books all old enough that the leather bindings were flaking and all of which he had read before only a small bowl of sung wood was ogier made a nice piece he wished he knew who had sung it but it was aged enough that singing to it had failed to raise so much as an echo yet everything had been made by someone who at least had been to a stedding the pieces would have looked at home in any dwelling of course the room looked nothing like a room in a stedding but lord algarins ancestor had made an effort to have his visitors feel comfortable his mother was standing in front of one of the brick fireplaces a strongfaced woman with her vineembroidered skirts spread to let the flames dry them he heaved a sigh of relief at seeing she was not as wet as he had expected although it put paid to suggesting they take the time to get dry their raincloaks must have developed leaks they did that after a time as the anseed oil wore off maybe her temper would not be as bad as he feared either whitehaired elder haman his flaring coat dark with damp in several large patches was examining one of the axes from the wall shaking his head over it its haft was as long as he was tall made during the trolloc wars or even before there were a pair of those the long axe heads inlaid with gold and silver and a pair of ornate pointed pruning knives with long shafts as well of course pruning knives sharp on one side and sawtoothed on the other always had long handles but the inlays and long red tassels indicated that these had been made for weapons too not the most felicitous choices for hanging in a room meant for reading or conversation or the quiet contemplation of stillness but loials eyes swept past his mother and elder haman to the other fireplace where erith small and almost fragile appearing was drying her own skirts her mouth was straight her nose short and wellrounded her eyes the exact color of a silverbells ripe seedpod in short she was beautiful and her ears sticking up through the glossy black hair that hung down her back curving and plump tipped with fine tufts that looked as soft as dandelion down they were the most gorgeous ears he had ever seen not that he would be crude enough to say so she smiled at him a very mysterious smile and his own ears quivered with embarrassment surely she could not know what he had been thinking could she rand said women could sometimes but that was human women so here you are his mother said planting her fists on her hips there were no smiles from her her brows were drawn down her jaw set if this was her better temper she might as well have been drenched i must say youve led me a merry chase but i have you in hand now and i do not mean to let you run what is that on your lip and your chin well you can shave those right off again dont you grimace at me son loial fingering the growth on his upper lip uneasily he tried to smooth his facewhen your mother named you son she was in no mood to trifle withbut it was hard he wanted wis beard and mustaches some might think it pretentious as young as he was but just the same a merry chase indeed elder haman said dryly hanging the axe back on its hooks he had long white mustaches that fell past his chin and a long narrow beard that hung to his chest true he was well above three hundred years old but it still seemed unfair a very merry chase first we walked to cairhien having heard you were there only you had gone after a stop at stedding tsofu we walked to caemlyn where young althor informed us you were in the two rivers and took us there but you were gone again to caemlyn it seemed his eyebrows rose almost to his hairline i began to think we were playing ringinthedell the people in emonds field told us how heroic you were erith said her high voice like music clutching her skirts with both hands ears fluttering with excitement she seemed about to bounce up and down they told us all about you fighting trollocs and myrddraal and going out among them by yourself to seal the manetheren waygate so no more could come i wasnt by myself loial protested waving his hands he thought his ears might fly from his head they were twitching so with embarrassment gaul was with me we did it together id never have reached the waygate without gaul she wrinkled her delicate nose at him dismissing gauls participation his mother sniffed her ears were rigid with distaste foolishness fighting in battles putting yourself in danger gambling all of it pure foolishness and there will be no more of it elder haman harrumphed ears twitching irritably and folded his hands behind his back he disliked being interrupted so we returned to caemlyn to find you gone and then to cairhien once more to find you gone yet again and you put yourself in danger again in cairhien loials mother broke in shaking a finger at him have you no sense at all the aiel said you were very brave at dumais wells erith murmured looking at him through her long eyelashes he swallowed hard her gaze made his throat feel tight he knew he should look away but how could he be demure when she was looking at him in cairhien your mother decided she couldnt stay away from the great stump any longer though why i cannot say since they arent likely to reach any sort of decision for another year or two so we set out to return to stedding shangtai in the hope we could find you later elder haman said all of that very fast glaring at the two women as if he thought they might break in on him again his beard and mustaches seemed to bristle loials mother gave another sniff sharper i expect to bring a decision very quickly in a month or two or id never have given over the search for loial even temporarily now that ive found him we can finish matters and be on our way without any more delay she took in elder haman who was frowning his ears slanted back and amended her tone he was an elder after all forgive me elder haman i meant to say if it pleases you will you perform the ceremony i believe that it does please me covril he said mildly much too mildly when loial heard that tone from his teacher with ears back he had always known that he had put a foot very badly wrong elder haman had been known to throw a piece of chalk at a pupil when he used that tone since i abandoned my students not to mention speaking to the great stump to follow you on this wild chase for that very reason i believe it does please me indeed erith you are very young shes past eighty old enough to marry loials mother said sharply folding her arms across her chest her ears twitched with impatience her mother and i reached agreement you yourself witnessed us signing the betrothal and loials dowry elder hamans ears tilted back a little further and his shoulders hunched as if he was gripping his hands together very hard behind his back his eyes never left erith i know you want to marry loial but are you sure you are ready taking a husband is a grave responsibility loial wished someone would ask him that question but that was not the way his mother and eriths had reached their agreement and only erith could stop it now if she wanted to did he want her to he could not stop thinking of his book he could not stop thinking of erith she certainly looked grave my weaving sells well and i am ready to buy another loom and take an apprentice but that may not be what you mean i am ready to tend a husband suddenly she grinned a lovely grin that divided her face in two especially one with such beautiful long eyebrows loials ears quivered and so did elder hamans if not so much women were very free in their talk among themselves so he had heard but usually they tried not to embarrass men with it usually his mothers ears actually trembled with amusement the older man cleared his throat this is serious erith come now if you are sure take his hands without hesitation she came to stand in front of loial smiling up at him as she took his hands in hers her small hands felt very warm his felt numb and cold he swallowed it really was going to happen erith daughter of iva daughter of alar elder haman said holding one hand palm down over each of their heads will you take loial son of arent son of halan as husband and vow under the light and by the tree to treasure esteem and love him so long as he lives to care for him and tend him and to guide his feet on the path they should follow under the light and by the tree i so vow eriths voice was firm and clear and her smile seemed to have grown wider than her face loial son of arent son of halan will you accept erith daughter of iva daughter of alar as wife and vow under the light and by the tree to treasure esteem and love her so long as she lives to care for her and to heed her guidance loial took a deep breath his ears trembled he wanted to marry her he did just not yet under the light and by the tree i so vow he said hoarsely then under the light and by the tree i declare you wed may the blessings of the light and the tree be upon you always loial looked down at his wife his wife she raised a hand and stroked slender fingers along his mustaches the beginnings of mustaches anyway you are very handsome and i think mustaches will be beautiful on you a beard too nonsense his mother said surprisingly she was dabbing at her eyes with a small lace handkerchief she was never emotional hes much too young for that sort of thing for a moment he thought eriths ears began to slant back that had to be his imagination he had had a number of long talks with hershe was a wonderful conversationalist though come to think of it for the most part she listened but what little she did say was always very cogentand he was sure she possessed no sort of temper at all he had no time to think on it in any event resting her hands on his arms she rose on tiptoes and he bent to rub his nose against hers in truth they nosed for longer than they should have with elder haman and his mother present but others faded from his thoughts as he inhaled his wifes scent and she his and the feel of her nose on his pure bliss lie cupped the back of her head and barely had the presence of mind not to finger her ear she tugged the tuft on one of his after a while a very long while it seemed voices intruded it is still raining covril you cannot seriously be suggesting we set out again when we have a sound roof over our heads and proper beds to sleep in for a change no i say no i will not sleep on the ground tonight or in a barn or worst of all in a house where my feet and knees hang over the end of the largest bed available there have been times ive seriously thought of refusing hospitality and to the pit with rudeness if you insist his mother said grudgingly but i want an early start come morning i refuse to waste an hour more than i must the book of translation must be opened as soon as possible loial jerked erect aghast thats what the great stump is discussing they cant do that not now we must leave this world eventually so we can come to it when the wheel turns his mother said striding to the nearest fireplace to spread her skirts again that is written now is exactly the right time and the sooner the better is that what you think elder haman loial asked worriedly no my boy not at all before we left i gave a speech of three hours that i think swayed a few minds in the right direction elder haman picked up a tall yellow pitcher and filled a blue cup but rather than drink he frowned into the tea your mother has swayed more i fear she may even get her decision in months as she says erith filled a cup for his mother then two more bringing one to him his ears quivered with embarrassment yet again he should have done that he had a great deal to learn about being a husband but he knew that much i wish i could address the stump he said bitterly you sound eager husband husband that meant erith was very serious it was almost as bad as being called son loial what would you say to the stump i wont have him embarrassed erith his mother said before he could open his mouth loial writes well and elder haman says he may have the makings of a scholar about him but he gets tonguetied before even a hundred besides he is only a boy elder hainan had said that loial wondered when his ears would stop quivering any married man may address the stump erith said firmly there was no doubt this time her ears definitely slanted back will you allow me to tend my own husband mother covril his mothers mouth moved but no sound came out and her eyebrows were halfway up her forehead he did not think he had ever seen her so taken aback though she must have expected this a wife always took precedence with her husband over his mother well husband what would you say he was not eager he was desperate he took a long swallow of the spicescented tea but his mouth felt just as dry afterward his mother was right the more people were listening the more he tended to forget what he intended to say and go off on tangents in truth he had to admit that sometimes he rambled a bit with only a few listeners just a bit now and then he knew the formsa child of fifty knew the formsyet he could not make the words come the few listening to him now were not just any few his mother was a famous speaker elder haman a noted one not to mention being an elder and there was erith a man wanted to stand well in his wifes eyes turning his back on them he strode to the nearest window and stood rolling the teacup between his palms the window was sized decently though the panes set in the carved casement were no larger than those in the rooms below the rain had dwindled to a drizzle falling from a gray sky and despite bubbles in the glass he could make out the trees beyond the fields pine and sourgum and the occasional oak all full of new growth algarins people tended their forest well clearing out the deadfall to rob wildfire of its tinder fire had to be used carefully the words came more easily now that he could not see the others watching him should he begin with the longing could they dare leave if they would begin dying in a handful of years no that question would have been addressed first thing and suitable answers found else the stump would have finished inside a year light if he did address the stump for a moment he saw the crowds standing all around him hundreds and hundreds of men and women waiting to hear his words perhaps several thousand his tongue tried to cling to the roof of his mouth he blinked and there was only the bubbled glass before him and the trees he had to do it he was not particularly brave whatever erith thought but he had learned about bravery watching humans watching them hang on no matter how strong the winds grew fight when they had no hope fight and win because they fought with desperate courage suddenly he knew what to say in the war of the shadow we did not huddle in our stedding hoping no trollocs or myrddraal would be driven to enter we did not open the book of translation and flee we marched alongside the humans and fought the shadow in the trolloc wars we neither hid in the stedding nor opened the book of translation we marched with the humans and fought the shadow in the darkest years when hope seemed gone we fought the shadow and by the war of the hundred years we had learned not to get ourselves tangled in human affairs his mother put in that was allowed speaking could turn into a debate unless the pure beauty of your words held the listeners she had once spoken from sunrise to sunset in favor of a very unpopular position without a single interruption and the next day no one had risen to speak against her he could not form beautiful sentences he could only say what he believed he did not turn from the window the war of the hundred years was a human affair and none of ours the shadow is our affair when it is the shadow that must be fought our axes have always grown long handles perhaps in a year or five or ten we will open the book of translation but if we do it now we cannot run away with any real hope of safety tarmon gaidon is coming and on that hangs the fate not only of this world but of any world we might flee to when fire threatens the trees we do not run away and hope that the flames will not follow us we fight now the shadow is coming like wildfire and we dare not run from it something was moving among the trees all along the line he could see a herd of cattle a very big herd if so that isnt bad his mother said much too plainspoken to carry any weight at a stedding stump much less the great stump of course but not bad go on trollocs he breathed that was what it was thousands of trollocs in black spiked mail spilling out of the trees at a run with scythecurved swords raised shaking their spiked spears some carrying torches trollocs as far as he could see to left and right not thousands tens of thousands erith pushed in beside him at the window and gasped so many are we going to die loial she did not sound afraid she sounded excited not if i can warn rand and the others he was already starting for the door only aes sedai and ashaman could save them now here my boy i think we may need these he turned just in time to catch the longhandled axe that elder haman tossed him the other mans ears were back all the way laid flat against his skull loial realized his own were too here erith his mother said calmly lifting down one of the pruning knives if they get inside we will try to hold them at the stairs you are my hero husband erith said as she took the knifes shaft in hand but if you get yourself killed i will be very angry with you she sounded as if she meant it and then he and elder haman were running down the corridor together pounding down the stairs bellowing at the tops of their lungs a warning and a battle cry that had not been heard in over two thousand years trollocs coming up axes and clear the field trollocs coming so i will take care of tear logain while you abruptly rand wrinkled his nose it was not that he actually smelled a rotting midden heap suddenly but he felt as if he did and the feeling was getting stronger shadowspawn cadsuane said quietly putting down her embroidery and rising his skin tingled as she embraced the source or maybe it was alivia walking briskly toward the windows after the green sister min stood drawing a pair of throwing knives from her coatsleeves at the same instant through the thick walls he faintly heard ogier shouting there was no mistaking those deep drumlike voices trollocs coming up axes and clear the field with an oath he leaped to his feet and ran to a window trollocs in the thousands came running through the light rain across the newly planted fields trollocs as tall as ogier and taller trollocs with rams horns and goats horns wolves snouts boars snouts trollocs with eagles beaks and crests of feathers muddy earth splashing beneath boots and hooves and paws silent as death they ran blackclad myrddraal galloped behind them cloaks hanging as if they were standing still he could see thirty or forty how many more on other sides of the house others had heard the ogiers cries or maybe just looked out a window lightning began to fall among the charging trollocs silvery bolts that struck with a roar and hurled huge bodies in every direction in other places the ground erupted in flames fountaining dirt and parts of trollocs heads arms legs wheeling through the air balls of fire struck them and exploded each killing dozens but on they ran as fast as horses if not faster rand could not see the weaves that drew some of those lightning bolts now that they were discovered the trollocs began to shout a wordless roar of rage in the thatchroofed outbuildings large sturdy barns and stables some of basheres saldaeans stuck their heads out and quickly pulled them back again drawing the doors shut behind them you told your aes sedai they could channel to defend themselves he said calmly do i look fool enough not to logain snarled at another window he already held saidin nearly as much as rand could draw he was weaving as fast as he could do you intend to help or just watch my lord dragon there was entirely too much sarcasm in that but now was not the time to bring it up drawing a deep breath rand gripped the casement on either side of the window against the dizziness that would comethe dragons goldenmaned heads on the backs of his hands seemed to writheand reached out to seize the power his head spun as saidin flooded into him icy flames and crumbling mountains a chaos trying to pull him under but blessedly clean he still felt the wonder of that his head spun and his stomach wanted to empty itself the odd illness that should have gone with the taint yet that was not why he clung to the casement even harder the one power filled himbut in that moment of dizziness lews therin had seized it away from him numb with horror he stared at the trollocs and myrddraal racing toward the outbuildings with the power in him he could make out the pins fastened to massive mailed shoulders the silver whirlwind of the ahffrait band and the bloodred trident of the kobal the forked lightning of the ghraemlan and the hooked axe of the alghol the iron fist of the dhaimon and the red bloodstained fist of the knomon and there were skulls the horned skull of the dhavol and the piled human skulls of the gharghael and the skull cloven by a scythecurved sword of the dhjinnen and the daggerpierced skull of the bhansheen trollocs liked skulls if they could be said to like anything it seemed the twelve principal bands might all be involved and some of the lesser he saw pins he did not recognize what seemed a staring eye a daggerpierced hand a manshape wrapped in flames they neared the outbuildings where swords were beginning to thrust through the thatch as the saldaeans tried to cut ways onto the roofs thatch was tough they would need to work desperately hard odd the thoughts that came when a madman who wanted to die might well kill you in the next heartbeat flows of air pushed the casement in front of him out in a shower of shattered glass and fragmented wood my hands lews therin panted why cant i move my hands i need to raise my hands earth air and fire went into a weave rand did not know six of them at once except that as soon as he saw the spinning he did know blossom of fire six vertical red shafts appeared among the trollocs ten feet tall and thinner than rands forearm the nearest trollocs would be hearing their shrill whine but unless memories had been passed down from the war of the shadow they would not realize they were hearing death lews therin spun the last thread of air and fire blossomed with a roar that shook the manor house each red shaft expanded in a heartbeat to a disc of flame thirty feet across horned heads and snouted heads flew into the air and pinwheeling arms booted legs and legs that ended in paws or hooves trollocs a hundred paces and more away from the explosions went down and only some got up again even as he was spinning those webs lews therin spun six others spirit touched with fire the weave for a gateway but then he added touches of earth so and so the familiar silveryblue vertical streaks appeared spaced out not far from the manor house ground rand knew well rotating intonot openings but the misty back of a gateway four paces by four rather than remaining open they rotated shut again opening and shutting continuously and rather than remaining fixed they sped toward the trollocs gateways and yet not deathgates as soon as the deathgates began to move lews therin knotted the webs a loose knotting that would hold only for minutes before allowing the whole weave to dissipate and began spinning again more deathgates more blossoms of fire rattling the walls of the house blowing trollocs apart flinging them down the first of the speeding deathgates struck the trollocs and carved through them it was not just the slicing edge of the constantly opening and closing gateways where a deathgate passed there simply were no trollocs remaining my hands the madman howled my hands slowly rand raised his hands stuck them through the opening immediately lews therin wove fire and earth in intricate combination and red filaments flashed from rands fingertips ten from each fanning out arrows of fire this he knew as soon as those vanished more appeared so fast that they seemed to flicker rather than actually go away trollocs struck by the filaments jerked as flesh and blood heated in a flash beyond boiling erupted jerked and fell holes blown entirely through their thick bodies often two or three behind fell victim as well before a filament died he spread his fingers and moved his hands slowly from side to side spreading death across the whole line blossoms of fire appeared that were not his weaving and deathgates slightly smaller than lews therins and arrows of fire that must have been logains the other ashaman were paying attention but few would be where they could see those last two webs spun trollocs fell by the hundreds the thousands riven by lightning bolts and balls of fire blossoms of fire and deathgates and arrows of fire the earth itself exploding beneath their feet yet on they raced roaring and waving their weapons myrddraal riding close behind blackbladed swords in hand as they reached the outbuildings some of the trollocs surrounded them pounding on the doors with their fists prying at the boards or the walls with their swords and spears tossing flaming torches onto the thatched roofs saldaeans up there working their horsebows as fast they could kicked the torches back down but some hung up on the edges of the roof and flames began catching even on damp thatch the fires rand thought at lews therin the saldaeans will burn do something lews therin made no reply only wove death as fast as he could and hurled it at the trollocs deathgates and arrows of fire a myrddraal riddled by half a dozen red filaments was flung from its saddle then another a third lost its head to an arrow of fire in an explosion of boiled blood and flesh but that one rode on waving its sword as if it did not know it was dead rand was seeking them out if the myrddraal were all killed the trollocs might well turn and run deathgates and arrows of fire only lews therin spun now the mass of trollocs was too close to the manor house for blossoms of fire some of the ashaman apparently did not realize that right away the room shook to great booms the whole manor house shook as if struck by huge sledgehammers shook as though about to shake apart and then there were no more explosions except where a fireball erupted or the ground itself exploded to throw trollocs like broken toys the sky seemed to rain lightning silverblue bolts struck continuously so close to the house that the hair on rands arms and chest tried to lift the hair on his head some of the trollocs succeeded in forcing open the doors to one of the barns and began flooding inside he shifted his hands cutting down those still outside with flickering red filaments that blew holes in them some had managed to get inside but those the saldaeans would have to deal with themselves on another barn and a stable flames were beginning to ripple up the thatch men coughing from the acrid smoke as they shot their bows listen to me lews therin the fire you must do something lews therin said nothing just spun his webs to kill trollocs and myrddraal logain rand shouted the fires put them out the other man did not answer either but rand saw the weaves that pulled the heat from the flames killing them they just vanished leaving behind cold blackened thatch where not even tendrils of smoke rose death walked among the trollocs but they were so close that even the explosions of fireballs rattled the house now suddenly there was a myrddraal afoot beside the window pale eyeless face as calm as an aes sedais black sword already stabbing toward him two thrown aiel spears took it in the chest and a throwing knife blossomed in its throat but it only staggered before resuming the thrust rand bunched his fingers together and just before the blade reached him a hundred arrows of fire ripped through the myrddraal flinging it back twenty paces to lie riddled and leaking black blood onto the ground myrddraal seldom died right away but this one never twitched hurriedly rand searched for more targets but he realized that lews therin had stopped channeling he could still feel the goose bumps that told him cadsuane and alivia held the power still feel saidin in logain but the other man was weaving no more webs either outside the ground lay carpeted with bodies and parts of bodies from the fields almost to the manor house walls within paces of them a few horses belonging to myrddraal still stood one holding up a foreleg as if it were broken a headless myrddraal staggered about flailing wildly with its sword and here and there a trolloc jerked or tried to lift itself and failed but nothing else moved its done he thought its done lews therin you can release saidin now harilin and enaila were standing on the table veiled and spears in hand min stood beside them her face grim a throwing knife in either hand the bond was full of fear and not for herself he suspected they had saved his life but he had to save it himself now a close run thing logain muttered if this had happened before i arrived a closerun thing he gave himself a shake and released the source turning away from his glassless window did you intend keeping these new weaves for your favorites like taim those gateways where did we send those trollocs i just copied your weave exactly it doesnt matter where they went rand said absently his attention was focused on lews therin the madman the bloody voice in his head drew a little deeper on the power let go man shadowspawn cant survive passing through a gateway i want to die lews therin said i want to join llyena if you really wanted to die why did you kill trollocs rand thought why kill that myrddraal people will find groups of dead trollocs and maybe myrddraal without a mark on them he said aloud i seem to remember dying lews therin murmured i remember how i did it he drew deeper still and small pains grew in rands temples not too many in any one place though the destination shifts every time a deathgate opens rand rubbed at his temples that pain was a warning he was close to the amount of saidin he could hold without dying or being burnt out you cant die yet he told lews therin we have to reach tarmon gaidon or the world dies a deathgate logain said his voice tinged with distaste why are you still holding the power he asked suddenly and so much if youre trying to show me that youre stronger than i am i already know it i saw how large your your deathgates were compared to mine and id say youre holding every drop of saidin that you can safely that certainly caught everyones attention min tucked her knives away and leapt down from the table the bond suddenly so full of fear it seemed to throb with it harilin and enaila exchanged worried glances then went back to staring out the windows they did not trust trollocs to be dead until the corpses were three days buried alivia took a step toward him frowning but he shook his head slightly and she turned back to her window though her frown remained cadsuane glided down the room her smooth face sternly composed what does he feel she demanded of min dont toy with me girl you know the cost of that i know that he bonded you and you know i know is he afraid hes never afraid min said except for me or she set her jaw stubbornly and folded her arms beneath her breasts fixing cadsuane with a glare that dared the green sister to do her worst by the tangled mix of emotions ranging from fear to shame that she tried to keep out of the bond and failed she had some idea of what cadsuanes worst could be im standing under your nose rand said if you want to know how i feel ask me lews therin he thought there was no answer and the saidin filling him did not slacken his temples began to throb well cadsuane said impatiently i feel right as well water lews therin but i have a rule for you cadsuane dont threaten min again in fact leave her alone altogether well well the boy shows some teeth golden birds and fish stars and moons swayed as she shook her head just dont show too many and you might ask the young woman whether she wants your protection strangely min had shifted her frown to him and the bond was threaded with irritation light it was bad enough that she did not like him worrying about her now she seemed to want to take on cadsuane singlehanded something he would not be eager to do himself we can die at tarmon gaidon lews therin said and suddenly the power drained out of him he released logain said as if he were suddenly on cadsuanes side i know she told him he whipped his head around in surprise min can deal with you in your own way if she wishes rand said starting for the door but dont threaten her yes he thought we can die at tarmon gaidon chapter twenty the golden crane the wind had died away as the rain diminished but gray clouds still hid the sun the fine drizzle was enough to dampen rands hair however and begin soaking into his goldembroidered black coat as he walked through the dead trollocs logain had spun a shield of air so that raindrops bounced from it or apparently slid down nothing to cascade around him but rand refused to risk lews therin seizing saidin again the man had said he could wait until the last battle to die but how far could you trust a madman on anything madman lews therin whispered am i any madder than you he cackled with wild laughter now and then nandera looked over her shoulder at rand a tall sinewy woman her graying hair hidden beneath her brown shoufa she led the maidens those on this side of the dragonwall at least but she had chosen to lead his bodyguard of maidens personally her green eyes all he could see of her sundark face above her black veil carried little expression yet he was sure she was worried over him not protecting himself from the rain maidens noticed what seemed out of the ordinary he hoped she would keep quiet you have to trust me lews therin said trust me oh light im pleading with a voice in my head i must be mad nandera and the rest of the fifty veiled maidens made a large ring around rand almost shouldertoshoulder prodding their spears into every trolloc and myrddraal they passed casually stepping over huge severed arms and legs severed heads bearing horns or tusks or sharp teeth occasionally a trolloc groaned or feebly tried to crawl awayor to lunge at them snarlingbut not for long war with trollocs was like war with rabid dogs you killed them or they killed you there was no parley no surrender no middle ground rain had kept the vultures away so far yet crows and ravens flapped everywhere black feathers glistening wetly and if any were the dark ones eyes it did not stop them alighting to pluck out trollocs eyes or see whether they could wrench loose some other gobbet enough of the trollocs had been torn apart that the birds had rich feasting none went near any dead myrddraal though and they shunned trollocs too near a myrddraal that indicated nothing beyond caution very likely the myrddraal smelled wrong to the birds a myrddraals blood would etch steel if left on it very long to ravens and crows it must have smelled like poison the surviving saldaeans shot the birds with arrows or skewered them on their sinuously curved swords or simply bludgeoned them with shovels or hoes or rakes anything that could make a handy clubin the borderlands leaving a crow or raven alive was unthinkable there they were all too often the dark ones eyesyet there were too many hundreds of blackfeathered shapes lay crumpled among the trollocs and for every corpse there seemed to be hundreds more squabbling loudly over the softer bits including pieces of their dead fellows the ashaman and aes sedai had long since given up trying to kill them all i dont like my men tiring themselves this way logain said his men or the sisters for that matter gabrelle and toveine will be near exhaustion by nightfall he had bonded the two aes sedai so he should know what if theres another attack all around the manor house and outbuildings brief fires flared so hot that people shielded their eyes against them as aes sedai and ashaman incinerated trolloc and myrddraal dead where they lay there were too many to afford the labor of gathering them into heaps with fewer than twenty aes sedai fewer than a dozen ashaman and maybe a hundred thousand trollocs it was going to be a long job very likely before it was done the stench of decay would be added to the already foul odors in the air the fetid coppery smell of shadowspawn the golden crane i blood the stink of whatever had been in the trollocs intestines when they were ripped open best not to think too closely on that there might not be a farmer or villager left alive between the manor house and the spine of the world that had to be where the trollocs had come from the waygate outside stedding shangtai at least loials home itself was safe neither trollocs nor myrddraal would enter a stedding unless driven and it required considerable driving would you rather let them rot where they are cadsuane inquired sounding as if she herself had no preference in the matter she held her green skirts up so the silk did not trail in the bloodsoaked mud or the offal that littered the ground yet she stepped over legs and around heads as casually as did the maidens she also had woven a parasol against the rain as had alivia although not until she saw the green do so rand had tried to make the sisters sworn to him teach the seanchan woman more about the power but to their minds that had nothing to do with their oaths of fealty she was safe to herself and seemed safe to others and they were content to leave matters as they were nynaeve had refused too because of mins viewing cadsuane had coolly informed him that she was not in the business of instructing wilders this truly would be a charnel house then min said her walk had a fetching sway to it though she was plainly trying not to think of what lay underfoot while avoiding planting a heeled blue boot on any of it at the same time and that made her stumble now and again she was getting wet too her ringlets beginning to cling to her head though the bond carried no hint of vexation only anger and that seemed directed at logain from the sharp stare she was giving him where would the servants go and the people who work the fields and stables and barns how would they live there wont be another attack rand said not until whoever sent this one learns it failed and maybe not then this is all they sent the myrddraal wouldnt have attacked piecemeal logain grunted but he could not argue with that rand looked back toward the manor house in some places dead trollocs lay right at the foundations none had made it inside but logain was right he thought surveying the carnage it had been a closerun thing minus the ashaman and aes sedai logain had brought the end might well have been different a very closerun thing and if there was another attack later plainly someone knew ishamaeis trick or that blueeyed man in his head really could locate him another attack would be larger that or come from some unexpected direction perhaps he should let logain bring a few more ashaman yon should have killed them lews therin wept too late now too late the source is clean now fool rand thought yes lews therin replied but are they am i rand had wondered that about himself half of the double wound in his side had come from ishamael the other half from padan fains dagger that carried the taint of shadar logoth they often throbbed and when they did they seemed alive the circle of maidens parted slightly to let through a whitehaired serving man with a long sharp nose who looked even frailer than ethin he was trying to shelter beneath a twotiered sea folk parasol missing half its fringe of all things but the aged blue silk had several ragged holes worn in it so small rivulets fell on his yellow coat and one on his head his thinning hair clung to his skull and dripped he seemed wetter than if he had gone without doubtless one of algarins forebears had obtained the thing somehow as a memento but the obtaining must have been a story in itself rand doubted the sea folk gave up a clan wavemistresss parasol lightly my lord dragon the old man said with a bow that spilled more water down his back verin sedai instructed me to give this to you straightaway from beneath his coat he produced a paper folded and sealed rand hastily stuffed it into a pocket of his own coat against the rain ink ran easily thank you but it could have waited till i returned to the house best you get back inside before youre soaked through completely she did say straightaway my lord dragon the fellow sounded offended she is aes sedai at rands nod he bowed again and started slowly back toward the manor house his back stiff with pride the parasol showering him with streams of water she was aes sedai everyone hopped for aes sedai even in tear where they were not much liked what did verin have to say that she needed to put in a letter thumbing the seal rand walked on his destination was one of the barns its thatched roof partially blackened this was the barn the trollocs had gotten into a burly fellow in a rough brown coat and muddy boots leaning against a jamb in the open doors straightened and for some reason hastily looked inside over his shoulder as rand approached the maidens spreading out to surround the barn he stopped dead in the doorway min and the others halting beside him logain growled an oath a pair of lanterns hanging from uprights that supported the loft gave a dim light enough to see that every single surface was thick with crawling flies even the strawcovered dirt floor as many more buzzed around in the air it seemed where did they come from rand asked algarin might not be wealthy yet his barns and stables were kept as clean as such places could be the burly man gave a guilty start he was younger than most of the servants in the house but his head was bald halfway back and creases bracketed his wide mouth fanned out from his eyes dont know my lord he muttered knuckling his forehead with a grimy hand he focused on rand so hard that it was plain he did not want to look into the barn i stepped to the door for a breath of fresh and when i turned around they was all over everything i thought i thought maybe theys dead flies rand shook his head in disgust these flies were all too alive not every saldaean defending this barn had died but all of the saldaean dead had been gathered here saldaeans disliked burials in rain none of them could say why but you just did not bury people while it was raining nineteen men lay in a neat row on the floor as neat as it could be when some were missing limbs or had their heads split open but they had been laid out carefully by their friends and companions their faces washed their eyes closed they were why he had come there not to say goodbye or anything sentimental he had not known any of these men more than to recognize a face here and there he had come to remind himself that even what seemed a complete victory had its cost in blood still they deserved better than to be crawling with flies i need no reminders lews therin growled im not you rand thought i have to harden myself logain get rid of these bloody things he said aloud youre harder than i ever was lews therin said suddenly he giggled if youre not me then who are you now im a flaming flywhisk logain muttered rand rounded on him angrily but alivia spoke in that slurred drawl before he could get a word out let me try my lord she asked in a manner of speaking but like an aes sedai she did not await permission his skin tingled with goose bumps as she embraced saidar and channeled flies always took shelter from even the lightest rain because one raindrop was enough to put a fly on the ground easy prey until its wings dried off yet suddenly the doorway was billowing with buzzing flies as if the rain were far preferable to the barn the air seemed solid with them rand batted flies away from his face and min covered her face with her hands the bond heavy with distaste but they were interested only in flight in moments they were all gone the balding man staring at alivia with his mouth hanging open suddenly coughed and spat out two flies onto his hand cadsuane gave him a look that snapped his mouth shut and sent his rough knuckle flying to his forehead just a look yet she was who she was so you watch she said to alivia her dark eyes were fixed on the seanchan womans face but alivia did not start or stammer she was much less impressed by aes scdai than most people and remember what i see i must learn somehow if i am to help the lord dragon i have learned more than you are aware of min made a sound in her throat very nearly a growl and the bond swelled with anger but the yellowhaired woman ignored her you are not angry with me she asked rand her voice anxious im not angry learn as much as you can youre doing very well she blushed and dropped her eyes like a girl startled by an unexpected compliment fine lines decorated the corners of her eyes but sometimes it was hard to remember that she was a hundred years older than any living aes sedai rather than half a dozen years younger than himself he had to find someone to teach her more rand althor min said angrily folding her arms beneath her breasts you are not going to let that woman your viewings are never wrong he broke in what you see always happens youve tried to change things and it never worked you told me so yourself min what makes you think this time can be different because it has to be different she told him fiercely she leaned toward him as though ready to launch herself at him because i want it to be different because it will be different anyway i dont know about everything ive seen people move on i was wrong about moiraine i saw all sorts of things in her future and shes dead maybe some of the other things i saw never came true either i must not be different this time lews therin panted you promised a faint scowl appeared on logains face and he shook his head slightly he could not like hearing min question her ability rand almost regretted telling him about her viewing of him though it had seemed harmless encouragement at the time the man had actually asked aes seclai to confirm mins ability though he had been wise enough to try to keep his doubting from rand i cannot see what makes this young woman so vehement for you boy cadsuane mused she pursed her lips in thought then shook her head ornaments swaying oh you re pretty enough i suppose but i just cannot see it to avoid another argument with minshe did not call them that she called them talking but he knew the differencerand took out verins letter and broke the blob of yellow sealing wax impressed with the head of a great serpent ring the brown sisters spidery hand covered most of the page a few letters blotted where raindrops had soaked the paper he walked closer to the nearest lantern it gave off a faint stink of spoiled oil as i said i have done what i can do here i believe that i can fulfill my oath to you better elsewhere so i have taken tomas and gone to be about it there are many ways to serve you after all and many needs i am convinced that you can trust cadsuane and you certainly should heed her advice but be wary of other sisters including those who have sworn fealty to you such an oath means nothing to a black sister and even those who walk in the light may interpret it in ways you would disapprove of you already know that few see that oath as invoking absolute obedience in all things some may find other holes so whether or not you follow cadsuanes advice and i repeat that you should follow mine be very wary it was signed simply verin he grunted sourly few thought the oath meant absolute obedience it was more like none they obeyed usually yet the letter was not always the spirit take verin herself she warned him against the others doing things he might disapprove of but she had not said where she was going or what she intended to do there was she afraid he might not approve maybe it was just aes sedai concealment sisters kept secrets as naturally as they breathed when he held out the letter to cadsuane her left eyebrow twitched slightly she must have been truly startled to show so much but she took the letter and held it where the lanterns light illuminated it a woman of many masks she said finally handing the page back but she gives good advice here what did she mean about masks he was about to ask her when loial and elder haman suddenly appeared in the doorway each carrying a longhandled axe with an ornately decorated head on his shoulder the whitehaired ogiers tufted ears were laid back his face grim and loials ears were flickering with excitement rand guessed it could be difficult to tell i trust we are not interrupting elder haman said his ears rising as he looked sadly at the line of bodies you are not rand told him sticking the letter back in his pocket i wish i could come to your wedding loial but oh thats done rand loial said he must be excited it was unlike him to interrupt my mother insisted there wont even be time for much of a wedding feast maybe none what with the stump and me having to the older ogier laid a hand on his arm what loial said looking at him oh yes of course well he scrubbed under his broad nose with a finger the size of a fat sausage something he was not supposed to be told even ogier had secrets it seemed rand fingered the letter in his pocket but then so did everyone else i promise you this rand loial said whatever happens i will be there with you at tarmon gaidon whatever happens my boy elder haman murmured i dont think you should he trailed off shaking his head and rumbling under his breath like a distant earthquake rand crossed the straw in three strides and offered his right hand smiling widely and with an ogier that meant very wide loial took it in a hand that enveloped his this close rand had to crane his neck to look up at his friends face thank you loial i cant tell you how much hearing that means to me but ill need you before then you need me loial ive sealed the waygates i know in caemlyn and cairhien illian and tear and i put a very nasty trap on the one that was cut open near fal dara but i couldnt find the one near far madding even when i know theres a waygate actually in a city i cant find it by myself and then there are all those cities that dont exist anymore i need you to find the rest for me loial or trollocs will be able to flood into every country at once and no one will know theyre coming until theyre in the heart of andor or cairhien loials smile vanished his ears trembled and his eyebrows drew down till the ends lay on his cheeks i cant rand he said mournfully i must leave first thing tomorrow morning and i dont know when ill be able to come outside again i know youve been out of the stedding a long time loial rand tried to make his voice gentle but it came out hard gentleness seemed a fading memory ill speak to your mother ill convince her to let you leave after youve had a little rest he needs more than a little rest elder haman planted the butt of his axe haft on the floor gripping the axe with both hands and directed a stern look at rand ogier were peaceful folk yet he looked anything but he has been outside more than five years far too long he needs weeks of rest in a stedding at the least months would be better my mother doesnt make those decisions anymore rand though truth to tell i think shes still surprised to realize it erith does my wife his booming voice put so much pride into that word that he seemed ready to burst with it his chest certainly swelled and his smile split his face in two and i havent even congratulated you rand said clapping him on the shoulder his attempt at heartiness sounded false in his own ears but it was the best he could manage if you need months then months you shall have but i still need an ogier to find those waygates in the morning ill take you all to stedding shangtai myself maybe i can convince someone there to do the job elder haman shifted his frown to his hands on the axe haft and began muttering again too softly to make out words like a bumblebee the size of a huge mastiff buzzing in an immense jar in the next room he seemed to be arguing with himself that might take time loial said doubtfully you know we dont like to make hasty decisions im not certain they will even let a human into the stedding because of the stump rand if i cant come back before the last battle you will answer my questions about what happened while i was in the stedding wont you i mean without making me drag everything out of you if i can i will rand told him if you can lews therin snarled you agreed we could finally die at tarmon gaidon you agreed madman hell answer questions to your hearts delight loial min said firmly if i have to stand over him the whole while anger suffused the bond she really did seem to know what he was thinking elder haman cleared his throat it seems to me that i myself am more accustomed to outside than almost anyone except the stonemasons um yes in fact i think i am likely to be the best candidate for your task phaw cadsuane said it seems you infect even ogier boy her tone was stern but her face was all aes sedai composure unreadable hiding whatever was passing behind those dark eyes loials ears went rigid with shock and he almost dropped his axe fumbling to catch it you but the stump elder haman the great stump i believe i can safely leave that in your hands my boy your words were simple yet eloquent um um my advice is dont try for beauty keep the simple eloquence and you may surprise quite a few including your mother it seemed impossible that loials ears could grow any stiffer but they did his mouth moved but no words came out so he was to speak to the stump what was so secret about that my lord dragon lord davram has returned it was elza penfell who escorted bashere into the barn she was a handsome woman in a dark green riding dress her brown eyes seemed to grow feverish when they found rand she at least was one he did not have to worry about elza was fanatical in her devotion thank you elza he said best you return to help with the cleanup theres a long way to go yet her mouth tightened slightly and her gaze took in everyone from cadsuane to the ogier with an air of jealousy before she offered a curtsy and left yes fanatical was the word bashere was a short slender man in a goldworked gray coat with the ivory baton of the marshalgeneral of saldaea tipped with a golden wolfs head tucked behind his belt opposite his sword his baggy trousers were tucked into turneddown boots that had been waxed till they shone despite a light splattering of mud his recent work had required as much formality and dignity as he could supply and he could supply a great deal even the seanchan must have heard his reputation by now gray streaked his black hair and the thick mustaches that curled around his mouth like downturned horns dark tilted eyes sad he walked right past rand with the rolling gait of a man more accustomed to a saddle than his own feet walked slowly along the line of dead men staring intently at each face impatient as rand was he gave him his time to mourn ive never seen anything like whats outside bashere said quietly as he walked a big raid out of the blight is a thousand trollocs most are only a few hundred ah kirkun you never did guard your left the way you should even then you need to outnumber them three or four times to be assured you wont go into their cookpots out there i think i saw a foreshadowing of tarmon gaidon a small part of tarmon gaidon lets hope it really is the last battle if we live through that i dont think well ever want to see another we will though theres always another battle i suppose that will be the case until the whole world turns tinker at the end of the row he stopped in front of a man whose lace was split almost down to his luxuriant black beard ahzkan here had a bright future ahead of him but you could say the same of a lot of dead men sighing heavily he turned to face rand the daughter of the nine moons will meet you in three days at a manor house in northern altara near the border of andor he touched the breast of his coat i have a map shes already near there somewhere but they say it isnt in lands they control when it comes to secrecy these seanchan make aes sedai look as open as village girls cadsuane snorted you suspect a trap logain eased his sword in its scabbard perhaps unconsciously bashere made a dismissive gesture but he eased his sword too i always suspect a trap it isnt that the high lady suroth still didnt want me or manfor to talk to anyone but her not anyone our servants were mutes just as when we went to ebou dar with loial mine had had her tongue cut out loial said in tones of disgust his ears tilting back his knuckles paled on the haft of his axe haman made a shocked sound his ears going stiff as fence posts altara just crowned a new king bashere went on but everybody in the tarasin palace seemed to be walking on eggshells and looking over their shoulders seanchan and altaran alike even suroth looked as though she felt a sword hovering above her neck maybe theyre frightened of tarmon gaidon rand said or the dragon reborn ill have to be careful frightened people do stupid things what are the arrangements bashere the saldaean pulled the map from inside his coat and walked back to rand unfolding it theyre very precise she will bring six suldam and damane but no other attendants alivia made a noise like an angry cat and he blinked before going on no doubt uncertain of a freed damane to say the least you can bring five people who can channel shell assume any man with you can but you can bring a woman who cant to make the honors even min was suddenly at rands side wrapping her arm around his no he said firmly he was not about to take her into a possible trap well talk about it she murmured the bond filling with stubborn resolve the most dire words a woman can say short of im going to kill you rand thought suddenly he felt a chill had it been him or lews therin the madman chuckled softly in the back of his head no matter in three days one difficulty would be resolved one way or another what else bashere lifting the damp cloth that lay across her eyes carefully so she did not catch the braceletandrings angreal in her hairshe wore that and her jeweled terangreal every waking moment nownynaeve sat up on the edge of her bed with men needing healing from dreadful wounds some missing a hand or an arm it had seemed petty to ask healing for a headache but the willow bark seemed to have worked as well only more slowly one of her rings set with a pale green stone that now appeared to glow with a faint internal light seemed to vibrate continually on her finger though it did not really move the pattern of vibrations was mixed a reaction to saidar and saidin being channeled outside for that matter someone could have been channeling inside cadsuane was sure it should be able to indicate direction but she could not say how ha for cadsuane and her supposed superior knowledge she wished she could say that to the womans face it was not that cadsuane intimidated hercertainly not she stood above cadsuane just that she wanted to maintain some degree of harmony that was the reason she held her tongue around the woman the rooms she shared with lan were spacious but also drafty with no casement fitting its window properly and over the generations the house had settled enough that the doors had been trimmed so they could close all the way making more gaps to let every breeze whistle through the fire on the stone hearth danced as though it were outdoors crackling and spitting sparks the carpet so faded she could no longer really make out the pattern had more holes burned in it than she could count the bed with its heavy bedposts and worn canopy was large and sturdy but the mattress was lumpy the pillows held more feathers that poked through than they did down and the blankets seemed almost more darns than original material but lan shared the rooms and that made all the difference that made them a palace he stood at one of the windows where he had been since the attack began staring down now at the work going on outside or perhaps studying the slaughter yard the manor house grounds had become he was so still he might have been a statue a tall man in a wellfitting dark green coat his shoulders broad enough to make his waist appear slender with the leather cord of his hadori holding back his shoulderlength hair black tinged with white at the temples a hardfaced man yet beautiful in her eyes he was let anyone else say what they would only they had best not say it in her hearing even cadsuane a ring bearing a flawless sapphire was cold on her right hand it seemed more likely he was feeling anger than hostility that ring did have a flaw in her estimation it was all very well to know someone nearby was feeling angry or hostile but that did not mean the emotion was directed at you its time for me to go back outside and lend a hand again she said as she stood not yet he told her without turning from the window ring or no ring his deep voice was calm and quite firm moiraine used to say a headache was sign she had been channeling too much thats dangerous her hand strayed toward her braid before she could snatch it down again as if he knew more about channeling than she well in some ways he did twenty years as moiraines warder had taught him as much as a man could know of saidar my headache is completely gone im perfectly all right now dont be petulant my love there are only a few hours till twilight plenty of work will be left tomorrow his left hand tightened on the hilt of his sword relaxed tightened only that hand moved her lips compressed petulant she smoothed her skirt furiously she was not petulant he seldom invoked his right to command in privatecurse those sea folk for ever thinking of such a thingbut when he did the man was unbending of course she could go anyway he would not try to stop her physically she was certain of that fairly certain only she did not intend to violate her marriage vows in the slightest way even if she did want to kick her beloved husbands shins kicking her skirts instead she went to stand beside him at the window and slip her arm through his his arm was rock hard though his muscles were hard wonderfully so but this was the hardness of tension as though he were straining to lift a great weight how she wished she had his bond to give her hints of what was troubling him when she laid hands on myrelle no best not to think of that hussy greens they simply could not be trusted with men outside not far from the house she could see a pair of those blackcoated ashaman and the sisters bonded to them she had avoided that whole lot as much as possiblethe ashaman for obvious reasons the sisters because they supported elaidayet you could not spend time in the same house with people even a house as large and rambling as algarins and avoid coming to recognize them arel malevin was a cairhienin who seemed even wider than he actually was because he stood barely chesthigh to lan donalo sandomere a tairen with a garnet in his left ear and his graystreaked beard trimmed to a point and oiled although she doubted very much that his creased leathery face belonged to a noble malevin had bonded aisling noon a fierceeyed green who peppered her speech with borderland oaths that sometimes made lan wince nynaeve wished she understood them but he refused to explain sandomeres captive was ayako norsoni a diminutive white with wavy waistlength black hair who was nearly as brownskinned as a domani she seemed shy a rarity among aes sedai both women wore their fringed shawls the captives almost always did perhaps as gestures of defiance but then they seemed to get on strangely well with the men often nynaeve had seen them chatting companionably hardly the behavior of defiant prisoners and she suspected that logain and gabrelle were not the only pair sharing a bed outside wedlock it was disgraceful suddenly fires bloomed below six enveloping dead trollocs in front of malevin and aisling seven in front of sandomere and ayako and she squinted against the blinding glare it was like trying to look at thirteen noonday suns blazing in a cloudless sky they were linked she could tell from the way the flows of saidar moved stiffly as though they were being forced into place rather than guided or rather the men were trying to force them that never worked with the female half of the power it was pure fire and the blazes were ferocious fiercer than she would have expected from fire alone but of course they would be using saidin as well and who could say what they were adding from that murderous chaos the little she could recall of being linked with rand left her with no desire ever again to go near that in just a few minutes the fires vanished leaving only low heaps of grayish ash lying on seared earth that looked hard and cracked that could not do the soil much good you cant find this very entertaining lan what are you thinking idle thoughts he said his arm hard as stone beneath her hand new fires flared outside share them with me she managed to put a hint of question in that he seemed amused by the nature of their vows yet he absolutely refused to follow the smallest instruction when they were alone requests he granted instantlywell most of the timebut the man would quietly leave his boots muddy till the mud flaked off if she told him not to track in mud unpleasant thoughts but if you wish the myrddraal and trollocs make me think of tarmon gaidon unpleasant thoughts indeed still staring out the window he nodded there was no expression on his facelan could teach aes sedai about hiding emotionsbut a touch of heat entered his voice its coming soon nynaeve yet althor seems to think he has forever to dance with the seanchan shadowspawn could be moving down through the blight while we stand here down through his mouth snapped shut down through malkier he had almost said dead malkier the murdered land of his birth she was sure of it he went on as if he had not paused they could scrike at shienar at the whole borderlands next week or tomorrow and althor sits weaving his seanchan schemes he should send someone to convince king easar and the others to return to their duty along the blight he should be marshaling all the force he can gather and taking it to the blight the last battle will be there and at shayol ghul the war is there sadness welled up in her yet she managed to keep it out of her voice you have to go back she said quietly at last he turned his head frowning down at her his clear blue eyes were so cold they held less of death than they had of that she was certain but they were still so cold my place is with you heart of my heart ever and always she gathered all of her courage and held on to it hard so hard that she ached she wanted to speak fast to get the words out before courage failed but she forced herself to a steady tone and an even pace a borderland saying i heard from you once death is lighter than a feather duty heavier than a mountain my duty lies here making sure alivia doesnt kill rand but i will take you to the borderlands your duty lies there you want to go to shienar you mentioned king easar and shienar and it is close to malkier he looked down at her for a long time but at last he exhaled softly and the tension left his arm are you sure nynaeve if you are then yes shienar in the trolloc wars the shadow used tarwins gap to move large numbers of trollocs just as it did a few years back when we sought the eye of the world but only if you are completely sure no she was not sure she wanted to cry to scream at him that he was a fool that his place was with her not dying alone in a futile private war with the shadow only she could not say any of that bond or no bond she knew he was torn inside torn between his love of her and his duty torn and bleeding as surely as if he had been stabbed with a sword she could not add to his wounds she could try to make sure he survived though would i make the offer if i wasnt sure she said dryly surprised at how calm she sounded i wont like sending you away but you have your duty and i have mine wrapping his arms around her he hugged her to his chest gently at first then harder until she thought he might squeeze all the air from her lungs she did not care she hugged him just as fiercely and had to pry her hands from his broad back when she was done at last light she wanted to weep and knew she must not as he began packing his saddlebags she hurriedly changed into a riding dress of yellowslashed green silk and stout leather shoes then slipped from the room before he was done algarins library was large a square highceilinged room lined with shelves haifa dozen cushioned chairs stood scattered around the floor and a long table and a tall maprack completed the furnishings the stone hearth was cold and the iron standlamps unlit but she channeled briefly to light three of them a hasty search found the maps she needed in the racks diamondshaped compartments they were as old as most of the books yet the land did not change greatly in two or three hundred years when she returned to their rooms lan was in the sitting room saddlebags on his shoulder warders colorshifting cloak hanging down his back his face was still a stone mask she took only time to get her own cloak blue silk lined with velvet and they walked in silence her right hand resting lightly on his left wrist out to the dimly lit stable where their horses were kept the air there smelled of hay and horses and horse dung as it always did in stables a lean balding groom with a nose that had been broken more than once sighed when lan told him they wanted mandarb and loversknot saddled a grayhaired woman began work on nynaeves stout brown mare while three of the aging men made a job of getting lans tall black stallion bridled and out of his stall i want a promise from you nynaeve said quietly as they waited mandarb danced in circles so that the plump fellow trying to lift the saddle onto the stallions back had to run trying to catch up an oath i mean it lan mandragoran we arent alone any longer what do you want my oath on he asked warily the balding groom called for two more men to help that youll ride to fal moran before you enter the blight and that if anyone wants to ride with you youll let him his smile was small and sad ive always refused to lead men into the blight nynaeve there were times men rode with me but i would not if men have ridden with you before she cut in men can ride with you again your oath on it or i vow ill let you ride the whole long way to shienar the woman was fastening the cinches on loversknots saddle but the three men were still struggling to get mandarbs saddle on his back to keep him from shaking off the saddle blanket how far south in shienar do you mean to leave me he asked when she said nothing he nodded very well nynaeve if thats what you want i swear it under the light and by my hope of rebirth and salvation it was very hard not to sigh with relief she had managed it and without lying she was trying to do as egwene wanted and behave as though she had already taken the three oaths on the oath rod but it was very hard dealing with a husband if you could not lie even when it was absolutely necessary kiss me she told him adding hastily that wasnt an order i just want to kiss my husband a goodbye kiss there would be no time for one later in front of everyone he said laughing youve always been so shy about that the woman was nearly done with loversknot and one of the grooms was holding mandarb as steady as he could while the other two hurriedly buckled the cinches theyre too busy to see anything kiss me or ill think youre the one whos his lips on hers shut off words her toes curled some time later she was leaning on his broad chest to catch her breath while he stroked her hair perhaps we can have one last night together in shienar he murmured softly it may be some time before were together again and ill miss having my back clawed her face grew hot and she pushed away from him unsteadily the grooms were done and staring very pointedly at the strawcovered floor but they might well be close enough to overhear i think not she was proud that she did not sound breathless i dont want to leave rand alone with alivia that long he trusts her nynaeve i dont understand it but there it is and thats all that matters she sniffed as if any man knew what was good for him her stout mare whickered uneasily as they rode among dead trollocs to a patch of ground not far from the stable that she knew well enough to weave a gateway mandarb a trained warhorse reacted not at all to the blood and the stench and the huge corpses the black stallion seemed as calm as his rider now that lan was on his back she could understand that lan had a very calming effect on her too usually sometimes he had exactly the opposite effect she wished they could have one more night together her face grew hot again dismounting she drew on saidar without using the angreal and wove a gateway just tall enough for her to lead loversknot through onto grassland dotted with thickets of blackspotted beech and trees she did not recognize the sun was a golden ball only a little down from its peak yet the air was decidedly cooler than in tear cold enough to make her gather her cloak in fact mountains topped with snow and clouds rose to the east and north and south as soon as lan was through she let the weave dissipate and immediately wove another gateway larger while she climbed into her saddle and settled the cloak around her again lan led mandarb a few steps westward staring land ended abruptly in what was obviously a cliff no more than twenty paces from him and from there ocean stretched to the horizon what is the meaning of this he demanded turning back this isnt shienar its worlds end in saldaea as far from shienar as you can get and still be in the botderlands i told you i would take you to the borderlands lan and i have remember your oath my heart because i surely will and with that she dug her heels in the mares flanks and let the animal bolt through the open gateway she heard him call her name but she let the gateway close behind her she would give him a chance to survive only a few hours past midday less than half a dozen tables were occupied in the large common room of the queens lance most of the welldressed men and women with clerks and bodyguards standing attentively behind them were there to buy or sell ice peppers which grew well in the foothills on the landward side of the banikhan mountains called the sea wall by many in saldaea weilin aldragoran had no interest in peppers the sea wall had other crops and richer my final price he said waving a hand over the table every finger bore a jeweled ring not large stones but fine a man who sold gems should advertise he traded in other things as wellfurs rare woods for cabinetmakers finely made swords and armor occasionally other things that offered a good returnbut gems brought in the greater part of his profit in any year ill come no lower the table was covered with a piece of black velvet the better to show off a good portion of his stock emeralds firedrops sapphires and best of all diamonds several of those were large enough to interest a ruler and none was small none held a flaw either he was known throughout the borderlands for his flawless stones accept it or someone else will the younger of the two darkeyed illianers across from him a cleanshaven fellow named pavil geraneos opened his mouth angrily but the older jeorg damentanis his graystreaked beard practically quivering laid a fat hand on geraneos arm and gave him a horrified look aldragoran made no effort to conceal his smile showing a little tooth he had been only a toddler when the trollocs swept down into malkier and he had no memories of that land at allhe seldom even thought of malkier the land was dead and goneyet he was glad he had let his uncles give him the badori at another table managan was in a shouting match with a dark tairen woman wearing a lace ruff and rather inferior garnets in her ears the pair of them nearly drowning out the young woman playing the hammered dulcimer on the low platform beside one of the tall stone fireplaces that lean young man had refused the badori as had gorenellin who was near aldragorans age gorenellin was bargaining hard with a pair of oliveskinned altarans one of whom had a nice ruby in his left ear and there was sweat on gorenellins forehead no one shouted at a man who wore the badori and a sword as aldragoran did and they tried to avoid making him sweat such men carried a reputation for sudden unpredictable violence if he had seldom been forced to use the sword at his hip it was widely known that he could and would i do accept master aldragoran damentanis said giving his companion a sidelong glare not noticing geraneos bared his teeth in what he probably hoped aldragoran would take for a smile aldragoran let it pass he was a merchant after all a reputation was a fine thing when it enhanced your bargaining power but only a fool went looking for fights the illianers clerk a weedy graying fellow and also illianer unlocked their ironstrapped coin box under the watchful eyes of their two bodyguards bulky men with those odd beards that left the upper lip bare in leather coats sewn with steel discs each carried a sword and stout cudgel at his belt aldragoran had a clerk at his own back a hardeyed saldaean who did not know one end of a sword from the other but he never used bodyguards guards on his premises to be sure but not bodyguards that only added its bit to his reputation and of course he had no need of them once damentanis had endorsed two lettersofrights and passed over three leather purses fat with goldaldragoran counted the coins but did not bother weighing them some of those thick crowns from ten different lands would be lighter than others yet he was willing to accept the inevitable lossthe illianers carefully gathered up the stones sorting them into washleather purses that went into the coin box he offered them more wine but the stout man declined politely and they departed with the bodyguards carrying the ironstrapped box between them how they were to protect anything burdened so was beyond him kayacun was far from a lawless town but there were more footpads abroad than usual of late more footpads more murderers more arsonists more of every sort of crime not to mention madness of the sort a man just did not want to think on still the gems were the illianers concern now ruthan had aldragorans coin box opena pair of bearers were waiting outside to carry itbut he sat staring at the lettersofrights and the purses half again what he had expected to get light coins from altara and murandy or no light coins at least half again this would be his most profitable year ever and all due to geraneos letting his anger show damentanis had been afraid to bargain further after that a wonderful thing reputation master aldragoran a woman said leaning on the table you were pointed out to me as a merchant with a wide correspondence by pigeon he noticed her jewelry first of course a matter of habit the slim golden belt and long necklace were set with very good rubies as was one of her bracelets along with some pale green and blue stones he did not recognize and so dismissed as worthless the golden bracelet on her left wrist an odd affair linked to four finger rings by flat chains and the whole intricately engraved held no stones but her remaining two bracelets were set with fine sapphires and more of the green stones two of the rings on her right hand held those green stones but the other two held particularly fine sapphires particularly fine then he realized she wore a fifth ring on that hand stuck against one of the rings with a worthless stone a golden serpent biting its own tail his eyes jerked to her face and he suffered his second shock her face framed by the hood of her cloak was very young but she wore the ring and few were foolish enough to do that without the right he had seen young aes scdai before two or three times no her age did not shock him but on her forehead she wore the kisain the red dot of a married woman she did not look malkieri she did not sound malkieri many younger folk had the accents of saldaea or kandor arafel or shienarhe himself sounded of saldaeabut she did not sound a borderlander at all besides he could not recall the last time he had heard of a malkieri girl going to the white tower the tower had failed malkier in need and the malkieri had turned their backs on the tower still he stood hurriedly with aes sedai courtesy was always wise her dark eyes held heat yes courtesy was wise how may i help you aes sedai you wish me to send a message for you via my pigeons it will be my pleasure it was also wise to grant aes sedai any favors they asked and a pigeon was a small favor a message to each merchant you correspond with tarmon gaidon is coming soon he shrugged uneasily that is nothing to do with me aes sedai im a merchant she was asking for a good many pigeons he corresponded with merchants as far away as shienar but i will send your message he would too however many birds it required only stoneblind idiots failed to keep promises to aes sedai besides which he wanted rid of her and her talk of the last battle do you recognize this she said fishing a leather cord from the neck of her dress his breath caught and he stretched out a hand brushed a finger across the heavy gold signet ring on the cord across the crane in flight how had she come by this under the light how i recognize it he told her his voice suddenly hoarse my name is nynaeve ti almeara mandragoran the message i want sent is this my husband rides from worlds end toward tarwins gap toward tarmon gaidon will he ride alone he trembled he did not know whether he was laughing or crying perhaps both she was his wife i will send your message my lady but it has nothing to do with me i am a merchant malkier is dead dead i tell you the heat in her eyes seemed to intensify and she gripped her long thick braid with one hand lan told me once that malkier lives so long as one man wears the hadori in pledge that he will fight the shadow so long as one woman wears the kisain in pledge that she will send her sons to fight the shadow i wear the kisain master aldragoran my husband wears the hadori so do you will lan mandragoran ride to the last battle alone he was laughing shaking with it and yet he could feel tears rolling down his cheeks it was madness complete madness but he could not help himself he will not my lady i cannot stand surety for anyone else but i swear to you under the light and by my hope of rebirth and salvation he will not ride alone for a moment she studied his face then nodded once firmly and turned away he flung out a hand after her may i offer you wine my lady my wife will want to meet you alida was saldaean but she definitely would want to meet the wife of the uncrowned king thank you master aldragoran but i have several more towns to visit today and i must be back in tear tonight he blinked at her back as she glided toward the door gathering her cloak she had several more towns to visit today and she had to be back in tear tonight truly aes sedai were capable of marvels silence hung in the common room they had not been keeping their voices low and even the girl with the dulcimer had ceased plying her hammers everyone was staring at him most of the outlanders had their mouths hanging open well managan gorenellin he demanded do you still remember who you are do you remember your blood who rides with me for tarwins gap for a moment he thought neither man would speak but then gorenellin was on his feet tears glistening his eyes the golden crane flies for tarmon gaidon he said softly the golden crane flies for tarmon gaidon managan shouted leaping up so fast he overturned his chair laughing aldragoran joined them all three shouting at the top of their lungs the golden crane flies for tarmon gaidon chapter twentyone within the stone the mud of the outer city gave way to paved streets at the walls of tear where the first thing rand noticed was the absence of guards despite the lofty stone ramparts with their towers the city was less defended than stedding shangtai where he and every other human had been gently but firmly refused entrance at first light here the archers balconies on the towers were empty the ironstrapped door of the squat gray guardhouse just inside the broad gates stood wide open and a hardfaced woman in rough woolens her sleeves shoved up her thin arms sat there at a wooden tub scrubbing clothes with a washboard she appeared to have taken up residence two small grubby children sucking their thumbs stared wideeyed past her at him and his companions at their horses at least taidaishar was a sight to stare at a sleek black stallion with a massive chest a horse that drew attention yet he had chosen to ride the animal anyway if the forsaken could find him as easily as they had at algarins manor house there was little point to hiding or at least to putting too much effort into it he wore black riding gloves to conceal the dragons heads on his hands and the herons branded into his palms his coat was dark gray wool without a stitch of embroidery the stallions saddle cloth simple and his swords hilt and scabbard had been covered in unworked boarhide ever since it came into his possession nothing to pull a second glance cadsuane in unadorned gray wool wore the hood of her dark green cloak well up to shield her aes sedai face but min nynaeve and alivia had no need for hiding though mins flowerembroidered red coat and snug breeches might attract a little notice not to mention her heeled red boots he had seen women in cairhien wearing clothes like that copying her yet it seemed unlikely that her fashion had spread to tear where modesty held sway in public at least nynaeve was wearing yellowslashed blue silk and all of her jewelry just partly concealed by her blue cloak but tear would be full of silks she had wanted to wear her shawl that was in her saddlebags though a little effort only the second thing he noticed was the sound a rhythmic racketing clatter accompanied periodically by a piercing whistle faint at first it seemed to be coming closer rapidly despite the early hour the streets he could see from the gates were crowded half the people in sight appeared to be sea folk the men barechested the women in bright linen blouses all wearing long sashes more colorful than those worn by tairen commoners every head appeared to be turned toward that sound children darted through the throng dodging carts most often pulled by oxen with wide horns racing toward the noise several welldressed men and women had dismounted from their sedan chairs and stood with the bearers to watch a forkbearded merchant with silver chains across the chest of his coat was half out of the window of a redlacquered coach shouting at his driver to manage the nervously dancing team while he strained for a better view whitewinged pigeons startled from pointed slate rooftops by a particularly sharp whistle suddenly wheeled into the air and two large flocks crashed into each other pelting the folk below with stunned birds every single bird fell a few people actually stopped staring toward the approaching noise and gaped at the sky a surprising number snatched up fallen birds and wrung their necks though and not just barefoot people in worn woolens a woman in silk and lace standing beside one of the sedan chairs quickly gathered half a dozen before gazing toward the noise with the birds dangling from her hands by their feet alivia made a startled sound is that ill luck or good she drawled it must be ill unless pigeons here are different nynaeve gave her a sour look but said nothing she had been very quiet since lan vanished the day before a subject on which she was doubly silent some of those people are going to die of hunger min said sadly the bond quivered with sorrow every last one i can see something about how can i die lews therin laughed i am taveren youre dead rand thought at him sharply people in front of him were going to starve and he laughed there was nothing to be done of course not when min spoke but laughing was another matter i am taveren me what else was happening in tear because of his presence his being taveren did not always have any effect at all but when it did the result could blanket an entire city best to get on with what he had come for before the wrong people figured out what things like pigeons flying into one another meant if the forsaken were sending armies of trollocs and myrddraal after him it was likely that darkfriends would take any opportunity to put an arrow through his ribs making little effort to hide was not the same as making no effort you might as well have brought the banner of light and an honor guard of thousands instead of six cadsuane murmured dryly eyeing the maidens who were trying to pretend they had nothing to do with rands party while standing in a wide circle around it sboufa covering their heads and veils hanging down their chests two were shaido fierceeyed whenever they looked at him the maidens spears were all on their backs stuck through the harness of their bowcases but only because rand had offered to leave them behind and take someone else otherwise nandera had insisted on at least a few maidens staring at him with eyes as hard as emeralds he had never considered refusing the only child of a maiden any maiden had ever known he had obligations to meet he gathered taidaishars reins and abruptly a large wagon full of machinery came into sight clanking and hissing wide ironstudded wheels striking sparks from the gray paving stones as it moved along the street as fast as a man could trot the machinery seemed to sweat steam a heavy wooden shaft swung up and down pushing another vertical shaft and gray woodsmoke drifted from a metal chimney but there was no sign of a horse just an odd sort of tiller in the front to turn the wheels one of the three men standing in the wagon pulled a long cord and steam rushed in a shrill whistle out of a tube atop a huge iron cylinder if the onlookers stared in awe and maybe covered their ears the forkbearded merchants team was in no such mood whinnying wildly they bolted scattering people as they ran and nearly pitching the man out on his head curses pursued them and several braying mules that galloped off with their drivers in bouncing carts sawing at the reins even a few oxen began to lumber along more quickly mins astonishment filled the bond controlling the black with his kneestrained as a warhorse taidaishar responded immediately chough he still snortedrand stared in amazement too it seemed master poel actually had made his steamwagon work but how did the thing get to tear he asked the air the last he had seen it had been at the academy of cairhien and seizing up every few paces its called a steamhorse my lord a barefoot dirtyfaced urchin in a ragged shirt said bouncing on the pavement even the sash holding up his baggy breeches seemed as much holes as cloth ive seen it nine times com heres only seen it seven a steamwagon doni his equally ragged companion put in a steamwagon neither of them could have been more than ten and they were gaunt rather than skinny their muddy feet torn shirts and holed breeches meant they came from outside the walls where the poorest folk lived rand had changed a number of laws in tear especially those that weighed heavily on the poor but he had been unable to change everything he had not even known how to begin lews therin began to maunder on about taxes and money creating jobs but he might as well have been spilling out words at random for all the sense he made rand muted the voice to a buzz a fly on the other side of a room four of them hitched together one behind the other pulled a hundred wagons all the way from cairhien doni went on ignoring the other boy they covered near a hundred miles every day my lord a hundred miles com sighed heavily there were six of them doni and they only pulled fifty wagons but they covered more than a hundred miles every day a hundred and twenty some days i heard and it was one of the steammen said it doni turned to scowl at him the pair of them balling up fists either way its a remarkable achievement rand told them quickly before they could begin trading blows here dipping into his coat pocket he pulled out two coins and tossed one toward each boy without looking to see what they were gold glittered in the air before the boys eagerly snatched the coins exchanging startled glances they went running out through the gates as fast as they could go no doubt fearful he would demand the coins back their families could live for months on that much gold min gazed after them with an expression of misery that the bond echoed even after she shook her head and smoothed her face what had she seen death probably rand felt anger but no sorrow how many tens of thousands would die before the last battle was done how many would be children he had no room left in him for sorrow very generous nynaeve said in a tight voice but are we going to stand here all morning the steamwagon was moving on out of sight quickly yet her plump brown mare was still blowing anxiously and tossing her head and she was having difficulty with the animal placid as it was by nature she was far from as good a rider as she thought herself for that matter mins mount an archnecked gray mare from algarins stables danced so that only mins firm redgloved grip on the reins kept her from running and alivias roan was trying to dance though the former damane controlled the animal as easily as cadsuane did her bay alivia sometimes displayed surprising talents damane were expected to ride well as they rode into the city rand took a last glance at the disappearing steamwagon remarkable was hardly the word a hundred wagons or only fiftyonlyincredible was more like it would merchants start using those things instead of horses it hardly seemed likely merchants were conservative folk not known for leaping at new ways of doing things for some reason lews therin began laughing again tear was not beautiful like caemlyn or tar valon and few of its streets could be called particularly broad but it was large and sprawling one of the great cities of the world and like most great cities a jumble that had grown up willynilly in those tangled streets tileroofed inns and slateroofed stables the roof corners slanted sharply stood alongside palaces with squared white domes and tall balconyringed towers that often came to points the heights of domes and towers gleaming in the earlymorning sun smithies and cutlers seamstresses and butchers fishmongers and rugweavers shops rubbed against marble structures with tall bronze doors behind massive white columns guild halls and bankers and merchants exchanges at this hour the streets themselves were still cast in deep shadows yet they bustled with that storied southern industry sedan chairs borne by pairs of lean men wove through the crowds almost as quickly as the children who raced about in play while coaches and carriages behind teams of four or six moved as slowly as the carts and wagons most drawn by large oxen porters trudged along their bundles slung beneath poles carried on two mens shoulders and apprentices carried rolled carpets and boxes of the masters handiwork on their backs hawkers cried their wares from trays or handbarrows pins and ribbons a few with roasted nuts and meat pies and tumblers or jugglers or musicians performed at nearly every intersection you would never have thought this city was the site of a siege not everything was peaceful though early morning or not rand saw obstreperous drunks being thrown out of inns and taverns and so many fistfights and men wrestling on the pavement that it seemed one pair was not well out of sight before the next came into view a good many obvious armsmen mingled in the crowd swords at their hips and the fat sleeves of their woolen coats striped in various house colors but even those wearing breastplates and helmets made no move to break up the rows a fair number of the fights involved armsmen with one another with sea folk with roughly clad fellows who might have been laborers or apprentices or shoulderthumpers soldiers with nothing to do grew bored and bored soldiers got drunk and fought he was glad to see the rebels armsmen bored the maidens drifting through the throng and still trying to pretend they had no association with rand drew puzzled looks and headscratching mainly from darkfaced sea folk though a gaggle ot children trailed after them gaping the tairens many of whom were not all that much fairer than the sea folk had seen aiel before and if they wondered why they had returned to the city it appeared they had different business at hand this morning and more important no one seemed to give rand or his other companions a second glance there were other mounted men and women in the streets most of them outlanders here a pale cairhienin merchant in a somber coat there an arafellin with silver bells fastened to his dark braids here a copperskinned domani in a barely opaque riding dress barely hidden by her cloak followed by a pair of hulking bodyguards in leather coats sewn with steel discs there a shienaran with his head shaved except for a gray topknot and his belly straining his buttons you could not move ten paces in tear without seeing outlanders tairen commerce had long arms which was not to say that he passed through the city without incident ahead of him a running bakers boy tripped and fell flinging his basket into the air and when the boy levered himself off the paving stones as rand rode by he stopped halfway up with his mouth hanging open staring at the long loaves standing on end near the basket propped together in a rough cone a fellow in his shirtsleeves drinking in a secondstory window of an inn overbalanced and toppled toward the street with a shriek that cut off when he landed on his feet not ten paces from taidaishar mug still in hand rand left him behind wideeyed and feeling at himself in wonderment ripples of altered chance were following rand spreading across the city not every event would be as harmless as the loaves or as beneficial as the man landing on his feet rather than his head those ripples could turn what should be a bruiseless tumble into broken bones or a broken neck lifelong feuds could be started by men speaking words they had never thought to hear come from their own lips women could decide to poison their husbands over trivial offenses they had tolerated complacently for years oh some fellow might find a rotting sack full of gold buried in his own basement without really knowing why he had decided to dig in the first place or a man might ask and gain the hand of a woman he had never before had the courage to approach but as many would find ruination as found good fortune balance min had called it a good to balance every ill he saw an ill to balance every good he needed to be done in tear and gone as soon as possible galloping in those crowded streets was out of the question but he picked up his pace enough that the maidens had to trot his destination had been in sight since long before he entered the city a mass of stone like a barren sheersided hill that stretched from the river erinin into the citys heart covering at least eight or nine marches a good square mile or more and dominating the citys sky the stone of tear was mankinds oldest stronghold the oldest structure in the world made with the one power in the last days of the breaking itself one solid piece of stone it was without a single join though better than three thousand years of rain and wind had weathered the surface to roughness the first battlements stood a hundred paces above the ground though there were arrowslits aplenty lower and stone spouts for showering attackers with boiling oil or molten lead no besieger could stop the stone from being supplied through its own wallshielded docks and it contained forges and manufactories to replace or mend every sort of weapon should its armories fall short its highest tower rearing over the very center of the stone held the banner of tear half red half gold with a slanting line of three silver crescents and so large that it could be made out plainly as it curled in a strong breeze it had to be strong to move that flag lower towers supported smaller versions but here they alternated with another rippling banner the ancient symbol of aes sedai blackandwhite on a field of red the banner of light the dragon banner some called it as if there were not another that bore that name the high lord darlin was flaunting his allegiance it seemed that was well alanna was in there and whether or not that was well he would have to learn he was not as sharply aware of her as before elayne and aviendha and min jointly bonded himhe thought he was not they had pushed her aside to take primacy somehow and she had told him she could sense little more of him than his presenceyet she still lay in the back of his head a bundle of emotions and physical sensations it seemed a long time since he had been near enough to her to sense those once again the bond with her felt an intrusion a wouldbe usurper of his bond to min and elayne and aviendha alanna was weary as if perhaps she had not been getting enough sleep lately and frustrated with strong streaks of anger and sulkiness were the negotiations going badly he would find out soon enough she would be aware he was in the city aware he was coming closer if little more min had tried to teach him a trick called masking that supposedly could hide him from the bond but he had never been able to make it work of course she admitted she had never been able to make it work either soon he found himself on a street that ran directly to the plaza that surrounded the stone on three sides but he had no intention of riding straight there for one thing every massive ironstrapped gate would be barred tight for another he could see several hundred armsmen at the foot of the street he expected there would be the same in front of every gate they hardly gave the impression of men besieging a fortress they seemed to be lounging about with no ordermany had their helmets off and their halberds propped against the buildings lining the street and serving women from nearby taverns and inns circulated among them selling mugs of ale or wine from traysyet it was highly unlikely they would remain complacent about anyone trying to enter the stone not that they could stop him of course he could sweep aside a few hundred men like so many moths he had not come to tear to kill anyone though not unless he had to so he rode into the stableyard of a tileroofed inn three stories of dark gray stone with a prosperous look the sign out front was freshly painted with of all things a rough approximation of the creatures encircling his forearms the artist apparently had decided the thing was inadequate as described though because he had added long sharp teeth and leathery ribbed wings wings they almost looked copied from one of those seanchan flying beasts cadsuane looked at the sign and snorted nynaeve looked at it and giggled so did min even after rand gave the barefoot stableboys silver to curry the horses they stared at the maidens harder than at the coins but no harder than the patrons stared in the dragons beamceilinged common room conversation trailed off when the maidens followed rand and the others inside spearpoints sticking up above their heads and bullhide bucklers in hand men and women most in plain if good quality wool turned in their lowbacked chairs to stare they seemed to be middling merchants and solid craftsfolk yet they gaped like villagers seeing a city for the first time the serving women in dark highnecked dresses and short white aprons stopped trotting and goggled over their trays even the woman playing a hammered dulcimer between the two stone fireplaces cold on this fine morning fell silent a very dark fellow with tightly curled hair at a square table beside the door seemed not to notice the maidens at all rand took him for one of the sea folk at first though he wore a peculiar coat without collar or lapels once white but now stained and wrinkled i tell you i have many many of the the worms that make yes make silk on a ship he said haltingly in an odd musical accent but i must have the the andberry yes andberry leaves to feed them we will be rich his companion waved a plump dismissive hand even while staring at the maidens worms he said absently everybody knows silk grows on trees walking deeper into the common room rand shook his head as the proprietor advanced to meet him worms the tales people could come up with to try prying coin out of somebody else agardo saranche at your service my lord my ladies the lean balding man said with a deep bow sweeping his hands wide not all tairens were dark by any means but he was nearly as fair complected as a cairhienin how may i serve his dark eyes kept drifting to the maidens and every time they did he tugged at his long blue coat as though it suddenly felt too tight we want a room with a good view of the stone rand said it is worms that make silk friend a man drawled behind him my eyes on it at that familiar accent rand spun to find alivia staring wideeyed and her face bloodless at a man in a dark coat who was just passing through the doorway into the street with an oath rand ran to the door but there were close to a dozen men in dark coats walking away from the inn any one of whom might have spoken there was no way to pick out one man of average height and width seen only from behind what was a seanchan doing in tear scouting for another invasion he would put paid to that soon enough but he turned from the door wishing he could have laid hands on the man knowing would be better than having to guess he asked alivia whether she had gotten a good look at the fellow but she shook her head silently her face was still pale she was ferocious when she talked of what she wanted to do to suldam yet it seemed just hearing the accents of her native land was enough to shake her he hoped that did not turn out to be weakness in her she was going to help him somehow and he could not afford her to be weak what do you know of the man who just left he demanded of saranche the one with the slurred way of talking the innkeeper blinked nothing my lord ive never seen him before you want one room my lord he ran his eyes over min and the other women and his lips moved as if he were counting if youre thinking of any impropriety master saranche nynaeve said indignantly tugging at the braid hanging from the cowl of her cloak you had best think twice and again before i box your ears min hissed softly and one hand drifted toward her other wrist before she checked the motion light but she was quick to reach for her knives what impropriety alivia asked in tones of puzzlement cadsuane snorted one room rand said patiently women can always find a reason to be indignant he thought or had that been lews therin he shrugged in discomfort and a touch of irritation that he only just managed to keep out of his voice your largest with a view of the stone we dont want it for long youll be able to rent it out again for tonight you may have to keep our horses a day or two though a look of relief crept over saranches narrow face though patently false rue filled his voice i regret that my largest room is taken my lord in fact all of my large rooms are taken but i will be more than happy to escort you up the street to the three moons and phaw cadsuane pushed back her hood enough to reveal her face and some of her golden hair ornaments she was all cool composure her gaze implacable i think you can find a way to make that room available boy i think you had better find a way pay him well she added to rand ornaments swaying on their chains that was advice not an order saranche took rands fat golden crown with alacrityit was doubtful the entire inn earned much more in a weekbut it was cadsuanes ageless face that sent him bounding up the staircase at the back of the common room to return in a handful of minutes and show them to a room on the second floor with dark polished paneling and a rumpled bed wide enough for three flanked by a pair of windows filled by the stone looming over the rooftops the previous occupant had been hustled out so quickly that he had left a woolen stocking crumpled at the foot of the bed and a carved horn comb on the washstand in the corner the innkeeper offered to have their saddlebags brought up and wine and seemed surprised when rand refused but one glance at cadsuanes face and he bowed his way out again hurriedly the room was fairly large as inn rooms went yet not compared to most chambers in algarins manor house much less in a palace especially not with near a dozen people filling the space the walls seemed to close in on rand his chest suddenly felt tight every breath came with difficulty the bond was suddenly full of sympathy and concern the box lews therin panted have to get out of the box keeping his eyes on the windowsbeing able to see the stone was a necessity and seeing open air between the dragon and the stone the open air above loosened his breathing a little just a littlekeeping his eyes fixed on the sky above the stone he ordered everyone to stand against the walls they obeyed with speed well cadsuane gave him a sharp look before gliding to the wall and nynaeve sniffed before flouncing over but the rest moved quickly if they thought he wanted space for safetys sake in a way he did having them out of his line of sight made the room seem a little larger only a little yet every inch was a blessed relief the bond was filled with concern must get out lews therin moaned have to get out stiffening himself against what he knew would come watchful of any attempt by lews therin rand seized the male half of the true source and saidin flooded into him had the madman tried to seize it first he had brushed it certainly touched it but it was rands mountains of flame collapsing in fiery avalanches tried to scour him away waves chat made ice seem warm tried to crush him in raging seas he gloried in it suddenly so alive it seemed he had been sleepwalking before he could hear the breath of everyone in the room could see that great banner atop the stone so clearly he almost thought he could make out the weave of the fabric the double wound in his side throbbed as if trying to rip itself out of his body but with the power filling him he could ignore that pain he thought he could have ignored a sword thrust yet with saidin came the inevitable violent nausea the almost overwhelming desire to double over and empty himself of every meal he had ever eaten his knees trembled with it he fought that as hard as he fought the power and saidin had to be fought ever and always a man forced saidin to his will or it destroyed him the face of the man from shadar logoth floated in his head for a moment he looked furious and near to sicking up without any doubt he was aware of rand in that moment and rand of him move a hair in any direction and they would touch no more than a hair whats the matter nynaeve demanded moving close and peering up at him in concern your face has gone all gray she reached for his head and his skin popped out in goose bumps he brushed her hands away im all right stand clear she stood there giving him one of those looks women carried in their belt pouches this one said she knew he was lying even if she could not prove it did they practice those looks in front of mirrors stand clear nynaeve hes all right nynaeve min said though her face had a touch of gray about it too and she had both redgloved hands pressed to her middle she knew nynaeve sniffed at him wrinkling her nose in disdain but she finally moved out of his way maybe lan had had enough and run away no not that lan would not leave her unless she told him to and then only for as long as was needful wherever he was nynaeve knew and likely had sent him there for reasons of her own aes sedai and their bloody secrets he channeled spirit touched with fire and the familiar vertical silvery slash appeared at the foot of the bed seemed to rotate into a dim view of massive columns in darkness light from the inn room gave all the illumination the opening standing inches above the floor was no larger than the door to the room yet as soon as it was fully open three of the maidens already veiled darted through pulling spears free and rands skin pebbled again as alivia leaped after them protecting him was a selfimposed duty but one she took as seriously as the maidens did there would be no ambush here though no dangers so he stepped through and down at the other end the gateway sat more than a foot above the huge gray slabs of stone that he had not wanted to damage any more than he already had this was the heart of the stone and with the power in him and the light spilling through the gateway from the room in the dragon he could see the narrow hole in one of those stones where he had driven callandor into the floor who draws it out shall follow after he had thought long and hard before sending narishma to bring callandor to him however the prophecies meant the man was to follow him narishma was otherwise occupied today a forest of immense redstone columns surrounded him stretching up into the dark that hid the unlit golden lamps and the vaulted ceiling and the great dome his boots echoed hollowly in the vast chamber and even the whispers of the maidens soft boots in this space the sense of confinement vanished min hopped down right behind himwith a throwing knife in either hand and her head swiveling eyes searching the darknessbut cadsuane standing at the edge of the gateway said i dont jump unless i absolutely have to boy she held out a hand waiting for him to take it he handed her down and she nodded thanks it could have been meant for thanks it could have meant you took your bloody time about it too a ball of light appeared over her upturned palm and a moment later alivia was balancing a globe of light too the pair created a pool of brightness that turned the surrounding darkness deeper nynaeve required the same courtesy and had the grace to murmur thanksshe quickly gained her own ball of lightbut when he offered a hand to one of the maidenshe thought it was sarendhra one of the shaido though all he could see of her face was blue eyes above her black veilshe grunted contemptuously and leaped down spear in hand followed by the other two he let the gateway close but held on to saidin despite the roiling in his stomach and head he did not expect to need to channel again before he left the stone yet he did not want to give lews therin another opportunity to seize the power either you have to trust me lews therin snarled if were going to make it to tarmon gaidon so we can die you have to trust me you told me once not to trust anyone rand thought including you only madmen trust no one lews therin whispered abruptly he began to weep oh why do i have a madman in my head rand pushed the voice away on striding through the tall arch that led from the heart he was surprised to find two defenders of the stone in ridged helmets and shining breastplates the puffy sleeves of their black coats striped in black and gold swords drawn they were staring at the archway with expressions that combined confusion with grim resolution doubtless they had been startled to see lights and hear footsteps echoing in a room with only one entrance an entrance they were guarding the maidens crouched spears coming up spreading out to either side slowly curling in toward the pair by the stone its him one of the men said sheathing his sword hurriedly stocky with a puckered scar that began on his forehead and journeyed across the bridge of his nose and down to his jaw he bowed deeply hands in steelbacked gauntlets spreading wide my lord dragon he said iagin handar my lord the stone stands i got this that day he touched the scar on his face an honorable wound handar and a day to remember rand told him as the other leaner man hastily put up his blade and bowed only then did the maidens lower their spears but their faces remained veiled a day to remember trollocs and myrddraal inside the stone the second time he had truly wielded callandor using the sword that was not a sword as it was meant to be used the dead lying everywhere a dead girl he could not make live again who could forget such a day i know i gave orders for the heart to be guarded while callandor was there but why are you still standing guard the two men exchanged puzzled looks you gave the order to set guards my lord dragon handar said and the defenders obey but you never said anything about callandor except that no one was to approach it unless they had proof they came from you suddenly the stocky man gave a start and bowed again more deeply still forgive me my lord if i seem to question you i dont mean to shall i summon the high lords to your apartments your rooms have been kept in readiness for your return no need rand told him darlin will be expecting me and i know where to find him handar winced the other man suddenly found something interesting on the floor to study you may require a guide my lord handar said slowly the corridors sometimes the corridors change so the pattern truly was loosening that meant the dark one was touching the world more than he had since the war of the shadow if it loosened too much before tarmon gaidon the age lace might unravel an end to time and reality and creation somehow he had to bring about the last battle before that happened only he did not dare not yet he assured handar and the other man that he needed no guide and the pair of them bowed yet again apparently accepting that the dragon reborn could do anything he said he could do in simple truth he knew he could locate alannahe could have pointed straight at herand she had moved since he first felt her to find darlin and inform him that rand althor was approaching he was sure min had named her as one he held in his hand yet aes sedai always found a way to play both ends against the middle they always had schemes of their own goals of their own witness nynaeve and verin witness any of them they hop when you say toad cadsuane said coolly pushing the cowl of her cloak down her back as they walked away from the heart that can be bad for you when too many people jump at your word she had the nerve to say that cadsuane bloody melaidhrin im fighting a war he told her harshly the nausea had his temper on edge that was part of the reason he was harsh the fewer people who obey the more chance ill lose and if i lose everybody loses if i could make everyone obey i would there were far too many who did not obey as it was or obeyed in their own way why in the light would min feel pity cadsuane nodded as i thought she murmured half to herself and what was that supposed to mean the stone had all the trappings of a palace from silk tapestries and rich runners in the corridors from tarabon and altara and tear itself to golden stands holding mirrored lamps chests standing against the stone walls might be for storing what the servants needed for cleaning yet they were of rare woods often elaborately carved and always with gilded banding niches held bowls and vases of sea folk porcelain thin as leaves and worth many times their weight in gold or massive gemstudded figures a golden leopard with ruby eyes trying to pull down a silver deer with pearlcovered antlers that stood a pace tall a golden lion that was even taller with emerald eyes and firedrops for claws others set so extravagantly with gems that no metal showed servants in blackandgold livery bowed or curtsied as rand climbed through the stone those who recognized him very deeply indeed some eyes widened at sight of the maidens trailing behind but their surprise never slowed their courtesies all the trappings of a palace yet the stone had been designed for war within as well as without wherever two corridors crossed murderholes dotted the ceiling between the tapestries arrowslits pierced the walls high up angled to cover the corridors in both directions and no flight of sweeping stairs but had arrowslits placed so the staircase could be swept by arrows or crossbow bolts only one assailant had ever succeeded in forcing a way into the stone the aiel and they had swept over the opposition too quickly for many of those defenses to come into play but any other enemy that managed to get inside the stone would pay a price in blood for every hallway except that traveling had changed warfare forever traveling and blossoms of fire and so much more that blood price would still be paid yet stone walls and high towers could no longer hold back an assault the ashaman had made the stone as obsolete as the bronze swords and stone axes men had often been reduced to in the breaking mankinds oldest stronghold was now a relic the bond with alanna led him up and up until he came to tall polished doors with golden leopards for door handles she was on the other side light but his stomach wanted to empty itself hardening himself he pulled open one of the doors and went in leaving the maidens to stand guard min and the others followed him in the sitting room was almost as ornate as his own apartments in the stone the walls hung with broad silk tapestries showing scenes of the hunt and battle the large patterned taraboner carpet on the floor worth sufficient gold to feed a large village for a year the black marble fireplace tall enough for a man to walk into and wide enough to hold eight abreast every piece of furnishing all massively made was elaborately carved crusted with gilt and dotted with gems as were the tall golden standlamps their mirrored flames adding to the light let in by the glasspaned ceiling a golden bear with ruby eyes and silver claws and teeth more than a pace high stood atop a gilded plinth on one side of the room while an identical plinth held an emeraldeyed rubytaloned eagle nearly as tall restrained pieces for tear seated in an armchair alanna looked up as he walked in and held out a golden goblet for one of the two young serving women in black and gold to fill with dark wine from a tall golden pitcher slender in a gray riding dress slashed with green alanna was beautiful enough that lews therin began humming to himself rand almost thumbed his earlobe before snatching his hand down suddenly unsure whether that gesture was his or the madmans she smiled but darkly and as her eyes swept across min and nynacve alivia and cadsuane the bond carried her suspicion not to mention anger and sulkiness the last two heightened for cadsuane and there was joy as well mixed in with all the rest when her gaze touched him not that it showed in her voice why who would have expected you my lord dragon she murmured with a hint of asperity in the title quite a surprise wouldnt you say my lord astoril so she had not warned anyone after all interesting a very pleasant surprise an elderly man in a coat with redandblue striped sleeves said as he rose to bow stroking his oiled beard trimmed to a point the high lord astoril damaras face was creased the hair that hung to his shoulders snow white and thinning but his back was straight and his dark eyes sharp ive been looking forward to this day for some time he bowed again to cadsuane and after a moment to nynaeve aes sedai he said very civil for tear where channeling if not aes sedai themselves had been outlawed before rand altered the law darlin sisnera high lord and steward in tear for the dragon reborn in a green silk coat with yellowstriped sleeves and goldworked boots was less than a head shorter than rand with closecut hair and a pointed beard a bold nose and blue eyes that were rare in tear those eyes widened as he turned from a conversation with caraline damodred near the fireplace the cairhienin noblewoman gave rand a jolt though he had expected to see her here the litany he used to forge his soul in fire almost started up in his head before he could stop it short and slim and pale with large dark eyes and a small ruby dangling onto her forehead from a golden chain woven into the black hair falling in waves to her shoulders she was the very image of her cousin moiraine of all things she wore a long blue coat embroidered in golden scrolls except for the horizontal stripes of red green and white that ran from neck to hem over snug green breeches and heeled blue boots it seemed the fashion had traveled after all she made a curtsy even so though it looked odd in that garb lews therin hummed even harder making rand wish the man had a face so he could hit him moiraine was a memory for hardening his soul not for humming at my lord dragon darlin said bowing stiffly he was not a man accustomed to offering the first courtesy he gave no bow for cadsuane just a sharp look before he seemed to dismiss her presence entirely she had kept him and caraline as guests for a time in cairhien he was unlikely to forget that or forgive at his gesture the two serving women moved quickly to offer wine as might have been expected cadsuane with her ageless face received the first goblet but surprisingly nynaeve got the second the dragon reborn was one thing a woman wearing the great serpent ring something else again even in tear throwing her cloak back cadsuane retreated to the wall it was unlike her to be retiring but then from there she could observe everyone at once alivia took a place by the door doubtless for much the same reason i am glad to see you better than when i saw you last darlin went on youve done me great honor though i may yet lose my head for it if your aes sedai make no more progress than they have do not be sulky darlin caraline murmured her throaty voice sounding amused men do sulk do they not min for some reason min barked a laugh what are you doing here rand demanded of the two people he had not expected to see he took a goblet from one of the serving women while the other hesitated between min and alivia min won out perhaps because alivias blue dress was plain sipping her wine min strolled over to caralineat a glance from the cairhienin woman darlin moved away grinningand the two women stood with their heads together whispering filled with the power rand could catch the occasional word his name darlins weiramon saniago also a high lord of tear was not short and he stood as straight as a sword yet there was something of a strutting rooster about him his graystreaked beard trimmed to a point and oiled practically quivered with pride hail to the lord of the morning he said bowing or rather he intoned it weiramon was a great one for intoning and declaiming why am i here my lord dragon he sounded puzzled at the question why when i heard that darlin was besieged in the stone what could i do but come to his aid burn my soul i tried to talk some of the others into accompanying me wed have put a quick end to estanda and that lot i vow he clutched a fist to demonstrate how he would have crushed the rebels but only anaiyella had the courage the cairhienin were a complete lot of lilyhearts caraline paused her talk with min to give him a look that would have had him hunting for the stab wound had he noticed it astoril pursed his lips and commenced a study of his wine the high lady anaiyella narencelona also wore a coat and snug breeches with heeled boots though she had added a white lace ruff and her green coat was sewn with pearls a close cap of pearls sat atop her dark hair a slim pretty woman she offered a simpering curtsy and somehow made it seem she wanted to kiss rands hand courage was not a word he would have applied to her nerve on the other hand my lord dragon she cooed i wish we could report complete success but my master of the horse died fighting the seanchan and you left most of my armsmen in illian still we managed to strike a blow in your name success a blow alannas scowl took in weiramon and anaiyella both before she twisted back around to face rand they landed at the stones docks with one ship but they put most of their armsmen and all the mercenaries they hired in cairhien ashore from the rest upriver with orders to enter the city and attack the rebels she made a sound of disgust the only result was a great many men dead and our negotiations with the rebels thrown back to the beginning anaiyellas simper took on a sickly twist my plan was to sortie from the stone and attack them from both sides weiramon protested darlin refused refused darlin was not grinning now he stood with his feet apart and looked a man who wished he had a sword in his hand rather than a goblet i told you then weiramon if i stripped the stone of defenders the rebels would still have outnumbered us badly too badly theyve hired every sellsword from the erinin to the bay of remara rand took a chair flinging one arm over the back the heavy arms had no supports at the front so his sword was no problem caraline and min seemed to have switched their talk to clothing at least they were fingering each others coats and he heard words like backstitch and biascut whatever that meant alannas gaze drifted between him and min and he felt disbelief warring with suspicion along the bond i left you two in cairhien because i wanted you in cairhien he said he trusted neither but they could cause small harm in cairhien where they were outlanders without power anger heated by nausea entered his voice you will make plans to return there as soon as possible as soon as possible anaiyellas simper grew more sickly and she cringed slightly weiramon was made of sterner stuff my lord dragon i will serve you where you command but i can serve best on my native soil i know these rebels know where they can be trusted and where as soon as possible rand snapped slamming his fist down on the chair arm hard enough to make the wood creak loudly one cadsuane said quite clearly and quite incomprehensibly i strongly suggest you do as he says lord weiramon nynaeve eyed weiramon blandly took a sip of wine he has a temper lately worse than ever and you dont want it directed at you cadsuane exhaled a heavy breath stay out of this girl she said sharply nynaeve glared at her opened her mouth then grimaced and closed it again gripping her braid she glided across the carpet to join min and caraline she had gotten very good at gliding weiramon studied cadsuane fora moment tilting back his head so he was staring down his nose as the dragon reborn commands he said finally so does weiramon saniago obey my ship can be readied to sail by tomorrow i wager will that suffice rand nodded curtly it would have to answer he was not about to waste a moment making a gateway to send this pair of fools where they belonged today theres hunger in the city he said eyeing the golden bearhow many days would that much gold feed tear the thought of food made his stomach clenchand waited tor a response that was quick in coming if not from the direction he expected darlin had cattle and sheep herded down to the city caraline said with some considerable warmth rand was the one getting the dagger look now these days she faltered for a moment though the heat never left her gaze these days meat is inedible two days after slaughter so he had the animals brought and wagons full of grain estanda and her companions seized it all for themselves darlin gave her a fond smile but his voice was apologetic ive tried three times but estanda is greedy it seems i saw no point in continuing to supply my enemies your enemies rand nodded at least the man was not ignoring the situation in the city there are two boys who live outside the walls doni and com i dont know any more name than that about age ten once the rebels are settled and you can leave the stone i would appreciate it if you found them and kept an eye on them min made a sound in her throat and the bond carried sadness so bleak it almost overwhelmed the burst of love that came with it so it must have been death she saw but she had been wrong about moiraine maybe this viewing could be changed by a taveren no lews therin growled her viewing must not change we have to die rand ignored him darlin appeared puzzled by the request but he acceded as what else was he to do when the dragon reborn made it rand was about to bring up the purpose of his visit when bera harkin another of the aes sedai he had sent to tear to deal with the rebels entered the room frowning over her shoulder as if the maidens had made some difficulty for her they might well have the aiel considered the aes sedai sworn to him to be wise ones apprentices and maidens took every opportunity to remind apprentices that they were not wise ones yet she was a stocky woman with brown hair cut close around a square face and despite her green silks lacking aes sedai agelessness she would have looked a farmwife a farmwife who ruled her house and farm with a firm hand though and would tell a king not to track mud into her kitchen she was green ajah after all with every scrap of green ajah pride and haughtiness she frowned at alivia too with all the disdain of aes sedai for wilder and that faded only to coolness when she caught sight of rand well i must say i shouldnt be surprised to see you considering whats happened this morning she said unpinning her simple silver cloak brooch she fastened it to her belt pouch and folded the cloak over her arm though it might have been the news that the others are no more than a day west of the erinin the others rand said quietly quietly and steely hard bera did not seem impressed she went on arranging the folds of her cloak the other high lords and ladies of course sunamon tolmeran all of them apparently theyre traveling hotfoot for tear as fast their armsmens horses can move rand leaped up so fast that his sword bound for a moment on the chair arm only a moment because the gilded wood weakened by his earlier blow split with a loud crack and the arm dropped to the carpet he never so much as glanced at it the fools the seanchan at the border with altara and they were coming back to tear doesnt anybody remember how to obey he thundered i want messengers sent to them immediately theyre to return to illian faster than they left or ill have the lot of them hanged two cadsuane said what in the light was she counting a bit of advice boy ask her what happened this morning i smell good news bera gave a little start at realizing cadsuane was in the room eyeing her sideways and cautiously she stopped fiddling with her cloak weve reached agreement she said as if the question had been asked tedosian and simaan were wavering as usual but hearne was nearly as adamant as estanda she shook her head i think tedosian and simaan might have come around sooner but some fellows with strange accents have been promising them gold and men seanchan nynaeve said alivia opened her mouth then closed it without speaking they might be bera allowed they keep clear of us and look at us like we were mad dogs that might bite any moment that sounds like what little ive heard of seanchan in any case less than an hour gone estanda suddenly began asking whether the lord dragon would restore her title and lands and they all collapsed right behind her the agreement is this darlin is accepted as steward in tear for the dragon reborn all laws you made remain unchanged and they pay for feeding the city for one year as a fine for rebellion in return they receive full restoration darlin is crowned king of tear and they swear fealty to him merana and rafela are preparing the documents for signatures and seals king darlin said incredulously caraline swayed over to take his arm restoration rand growled hurling his goblet aside in a spray of wine the bond carried caution a warning from min but he was too angry to pay heed the sickness twisting his insides twisted his rage too blood and bloody ashes i stripped them of lands and titles for rebelling against me they can stay commoners and swear fealty to me three cadsuane said and rands skin popped out in goose bumps an instant before something struck him across the bottom like a hardswung switch beras lips parted in shock and the cloak slid off her arm to the floor nynaeve laughed she smothered it quickly but she laughed dont make me have to keep reminding you about manners boy cadsuane went on alanna told me the terms you offered before she leftdarlin as steward your laws kept everything else on the tableand it seems theyve been met you can do as you wish of course but another piece of advice when the terms you offer are accepted hold to them else no one will trust you lews therin said sounding entirely sane for the moment rand glared at cadsuane fists clenched hard on the brink of weaving something that would singe her he could feel a welt on his bottom and would feel it more in the saddle it seemed to pulse and his anger pulsed with it she peered back calmly over her wine was there a hint of challenge in her gaze of daring him to channel the woman spent every moment in his presence challenging him the trouble was her advice was good he had given alanna those terms he had expected them to bargain harder gain more but they had gotten what he actually asked for more he had not thought of fines it seems your fortunes have risen king darlin he said one of the serving women curtsied and handed rand another goblet full of wine her face was as calm as any aes sedais you might have thought men arguing with sisters was a matter of every day with her all hail king darlin weiramon intoned sounding half strangled and after a moment anaiyella echoed him as breathless as if she had run a mile once she had talked of herself for a crown in tear but why would they want me as king darlin said scrubbing a hand through his hair or anyone thereve been no kings in the stone since moreina died a thousand years ago or did you demand that bera sedai bera straightened from picking up her cloak and began shaking it out it was their demand would be too strong their suggestion any of them would have leapt at the chance of a throne especially estanda anaiyella made a choking sound but of course they knew there was no hope of that this way they can swear to you instead of to the dragon reborn making it slightly less distasteful and if you are king caraline put in it means that steward in tear for the lord dragon becomes a lesser title she laughed throatily they may even tack on three or four more noble sounding titles to try pushing it down to obscurity bera pursed her lips as though she had been about to bring up that very point and would you marry a king caraline darlin asked ill accept the crown if you will though ill have to have a crown made min cleared her throat i can tell you how it should look if you like caraline laughed again and released darlins arm swaying away from him i will have to see you in it before i could answer that have mins crown made and if it makes you look pretty she smiled then perhaps i will consider it i wish you both the best rand said curtly but there are more important matters to go into right now min gave him a sharp look disapproval flooding the bond nynaeve gave him a sharp look what was that about you will accept that crown darlin and as soon as those documents are signed i want you to arrest those seanchan then gather every man in tear who knows one end of sword or halberd from the other ill arrange for ashaman to take you to arad doman and me my lord dragon weiramon asked avidly he all but quivered with eagerness managing to strut while standing still if there is fighting to be done i can serve you better there than languishing in cairhien rand studied the man and anaiyella weiramon was a bungling idiot and he trusted neither but he could not see what harm they could do with no more than a handful of followers very well you two may accompany the high lord that is king darlin anaiyella gulped as though she for one would rather return to cairhien but what am i supposed to do in arad doman darlin wanted to know the little ive heard of that land its a madhouse lews therin laughed wildly in rands head tarmon gaidon is coming soon rand said the light send not too soon you are going to arad doman to get ready for tarmon gaidon chapter twentytwo to make an anchor weep despite the pitching induced by the long blue rollers harine din togara sat very straight alongside her sister just ahead of their parasol bearers and the steersman at his long tiller shalon seemed intent on studying the twelve men and women working the oars or perhaps she was deep in thought there was plenty to think on of late not least this meeting harine had been summoned to but she let her thoughts drift blindly composing herself every time the first twelve of the athaan miere met since she had attained illian she had needed to compose herself before attending when she reached tear and found zaidas blue gull still anchored in the river she had been sure the woman was in caemlyn yet or at least trailing far behind her own wake a painful mistake that though in truth very little would have been altered had zaida been weeks behind not for harine at least no no thoughts of zaida the sun stood only a fist above the horizon in the east and several vessels of the shorebound were making for the long breakwater that guarded illians harbor one carried three masts and a semblance of a highrig all the major sails square yet he was squat and illhandled wallowing through the low rolling seas in fountains of spray rather than slicing them most were small and lowrigged their triangular sails nearly all highboomed some seemed quick enough but since the shorebound seldom sailed beyond sight of land and usually anchored at night for fear of shoals their quickness availed them little cargo that required true speed went to athaan miere ships at a premium price to be sure it was a small portion of what athaan miere carried in part because of the price in part because few things actually required their speed besides cargo hire guaranteed some profit but when the cargomaster traded on his own for the ship all of the profit went to vessel and clan as far as the eye could see to east and west along the coastline athaan miere ships lay at anchor rakers and skimmers soarers and darters most surrounded by bumboats so cluttered they looked like drunken shore festivals rowed out from the city the bumboats offered for sale everything from dried fruit to quartered beeves and sheep from iron nails and iron stock to swords and daggers from gaudy trinkets of illian that might catch a deckhands eye to gold and gems though the gold was usually a thin plate that wore off in a few months to show the brass beneath and the gems colored glass they brought rats too if not for sale anchored so long every ship was plagued by rats now rats and spoilage made sure there was always a market for the peddlers bumboats also surrounded the massive seanchanbuilt vessels dozens upon dozens of them that had been used in the escape that was what it was being called now the great escape from ebou dar say the escape and no one asked what escape you meant great bluffbowed things they were twice the beam of a raker and more some suitable for battering through heavy seas perhaps but strangely rigged and with odd ribbed sails too stiff for proper setting men and women were swarming over those masts and yards now altering the rigging to something more usable no one wanted the craft but the shipyards would require years to replace all of the vessels lost at ebou dar and the expense overly beamy or not those ships would see many years of use no sailmistress had any desire to sink into debt borrowing from the clan coffers when most if not all of her own gold was being salvaged by the seanchan in ebou dar not unless she had no other choice some unlucky enough to have neither their own ships nor one of the seanchans did have no other choice harines twelve passed the heavy wall of the breakwater thick with dark slime and long hairy weed that the breakers crashing against the gray stone failed to dislodge and the broad graygreen harbor of illian opened up before her ringed with deep expanses of marsh just turning from winter brown to green in patches where longlegged birds waded a line of mist drifted across the boat on a gentle breeze dampening her hair before it passed on up the harbor small fishing boats were pulling their nets along the edges of the marsh a dozen sorts of gull and tern wheeling overhead to steal what they could the city did not interest her beyond the long stone docks lined with trading craft but the harbor that broad nearly circular expanse of water was the greatest anchorage known and filled with shipping and river craft most waiting their turn at the docks it truly was filled by hundreds of vessels in every shape and size and not all of those ships belonged to the shorebound there were only rakers here those slender threemasters that could race porpoises rakers and three of the ungainly seanchan monstrosities they were the vessels of wavemistresses and of sailmistresses who formed the first twelve of each clan those that could be fitted into the harbor before there was no more room even lilians anchorage had its limits and the council of nine not to mention this steward in illian for the dragon reborn would have made trouble had the athaan miere begun crowding their trade abruptly a strong icy wind came up out of the north no it did not come up it just suddenly was there full strength whipping the harbor to choppy whitecaps and carrying a smell of pines and something earthy she knew little of trees but much of timbers used in building ships though she did not think there were many pines anywhere near to illian then she noticed the mist line while ships rocked and pitched under that southerly blast the mist continued its slow drift northward keeping her hands on her knees required effort she wanted very much to wipe the dampness out of her hair she had thought after shadar logoth that nothing ever would shake her again but she had seen too many oddities of late oddities that spoke of the world twisting as abruptly as it had come the wind was gone murmurs rose the stroke faltered and the number four port oar caught a crab splashing water into the boat the crew knew winds did not behave that way steady there harine said firmly steady give way together you shorebound ragpickers her deckmistress shouted from the bow lean and leathery jadein had leather lungs as well do i need to call the stroke for you the twin insults tightened some faces in anger others in chagrin but the oars began moving smoothly again shalon was studying the mist now asking what she saw what she thought would have to wait harine was not sure she wanted the answer heard by any of her crew they had seen enough to have them frightened already the steersman turned the twelve toward one of the bulky seanchan ships where any bumboat that ventured near was being chased away before the peddler could get out two words it was one of the largest of them with a towering sterncastle that had three levels three and the thing actually had a pair of balconies across the stern she would not care to see what a following sea driven by a cemaros or one of the aryth oceans soheens would do to those other twelves and a few eights waited their turn to sidle up to the vessel in the order of precedence of their passengers jadein stood up in the bow and bellowed shodein her voice carried well and a twelve that was approaching the ship circled away the others continued their waiting harine did not stand until the crew had backed oars and drawn them in on the starboard bringing the twelve to a smooth halt right where jadein could catch a dangling line and hold the small craft alongside the larger shalon sighed courage sister harine told her we have survived shadar logoth though the light help me i am unsure what we survived she barked a laugh more than that we survived cadsuane melaidhrin and i doubt anyone else here could do that shalon smiled weakly but at least she smiled harine scrambled up the rope ladder as easily as she could have twenty years before and was piped aboard by the deckmaster a squat fellow with a fresh scar running under the leather patch that covered where his right eye had been many had taken wounds in the escape many had died even the deck of this ship felt strange beneath her bare feet the planking laid in an odd pattern the side was manned properly however twelve barechested men to her left twelve women in bright linen blouses to her right all bowing till they were looking straight down at the deck she waited for shalon and the parasol bearers to join her before starting forward the vessels sailmistress and windfinder at the end of the rows bowed less deeply while touching hearts lips and foreheads both wore waistlong white mourning stoles that all but hid their many necklaces as did she and shalon the welcome of my ship to you wavemistress the sailmistress said sniffing her scent box and the grace of the light be upon you until you leave his decks the others await you in the great cabin the grace of the light be upon you also harine replied turane in blue silk trousers and a red silk blouse was stocky enough to make her windfinder serile look slender rather than average and she had a gimlet eye and a sour twist to her mouth but neither those nor the sniffing was meant for discourtesy turane was not that bold the gaze was the same she gave everyone her own vessel lay at the bottom of the harbor at ebou dar and the harbor did stink after the clean air of the open salt the great cabin ran nearly the whole length of the tall sterncastle a space clear of any furniture save for thirteen chairs and a table against the bulkhead that held tallnecked wine pitchers and goblets of yellow porcelain and two dozen women in brocaded silks could not come near filling it she was the last of the first twelve of the athaan miere to arrive and the reaction to her among the other wavemistresses was what she had come to expect lincora and wallein turned their backs very deliberately roundfaced niolle gave her a scowl then stalked over to refill her goblet lacine so slender that her bosom seemed immense shook her head as if wondering at harines presence others went on chatting as if she were not there all wore the mourning stoles of course pelanna strode across the deck to her the long pink scar down the right side of her square face giving her a dangerous look her tightly curled hair was nearly all gray the honor chain across her left cheek heavy with gold medallions recording her triumphs including one for her part in the escape her wrists and ankles still bore the marks of seanchan chains though hidden by her silks now i hope you are quite recovered harine the light willing she said tilting her head to one side and clasping her plump tattooed hands in mock sympathy not still sitting tender are you i put a cushion on your chair just in case she laughed uproariously looking to her windfinder but caire gave her a blank look as if she had not heard then added a faint laugh pelanna frowned when she laughed at anything she expected those under her to laugh as well the stately windfinder had her own worries however a daughter missing among the shorebound abducted by aes sedai there would be repayment for that one did not need to like caire or pelanna to know that was necessary harine favored the pair with a tight smile and brushed by pelanna closely enough that the woman had to step back or have her feet trodden on scowling as she did daughter of the sands harine thought sourly mareils approach brought a genuine smile however the tall slender woman her shoulderlength hair as much white as black had been her friend since they began as deckhands together on an aging raker with an ironhanded sailmistress embittered by her lack of prospects learning that mareil had escaped ebou dar and unharmed had been a joy she favored pelanna and caire with a frown tebreille her windfinder also grimaced at the pair but unlike them it was not because mareil demanded wristlicking sisters tebreille and caire shared a deep concern for talaan caires daughter yet beyond that either would have slit the others throat for a copper or better in their view seen her sister reduced to cleaning the bilges there was no hatred deeper than hatred between siblings dont let those mudducks peck at you harine mareils voice was deep for a woman but melodious she handed harine one of the two goblets she carried you did what you felt you had to do and the light willing all will come right against her will harines eyes went to the ringbolt set in one of the beams of the overhead it could have been removed by now she was sure it remained for the purpose of provoking her that strange young woman min had been right her bargain with the coramoor had been judged deficient giving away too much and demanding too little in return in this same cabin with the rest of the first twelve and the new mistress of the ships watching she had been stripped and hung by her ankles from that ringbolt stretched tight to another set in the deck then strapped until she howled her lungs out the welts and bruises had faded but the memory lingered however hard she tried to suppress it not howls for mercy or respite though never that else she would have had no alternative to stepping aside becoming just a sailmistress again while someone else was chosen wavemistress of clan shodein most of the women in this room believed she should have done so anyway after such a punishment perhaps even mareil but she had the other part of mins foretelling to bolster her courage she would be mistress of the ships one day in law the first twelve of the athaan miere could choose any sailmistress as mistress of the ships yet only five times in more than three thousand years had they reached outside their own number the aes sedai said mins peculiar visions always came true but she did not intend to gamble all will come right mareil the light willing she said eventually she just had to have the courage to ride out whatever came before as usual zaida arrived without ceremony striding in followed by shielyn her windfinder tall and slim and reserved and amylia the bosomy palehaired aes sedai zaida had brought back with her from caemlyn ageless face seeming permanently surprised her startling blue eyes very wide the aes sedai was breathing heavily for some reason everyone bowed but zaida paid the courtesies no heed in green brocades and white mourning stole she was short with a close cap of graying curls yet she managed to make herself seem every bit as tall as shielyn a matter of presence harine had to admit zaida had that and a coolness of thought that being caught by a cemaros on a lee shore could not shake in addition to returning with the first of the aes sedai agreed to in the bargain for use of the bowl of the winds she also had returned with her own bargain for land in andor under athaan miere law and where marines bargain had been judged wanting zaidas had found great favor that and the fact that she had come straight to illian via one of those peculiar gateways woven by her own windfinder were not the only reasons that she was now mistress of the ships but neither had hurt her cause harine herself thought this traveling overrated shalon could make a gateway now but making one to the deck of a ship without causing damage even on still waters like these especially from the deck of another ship was chancy at best and no one could make one large enough to sail a ship through very overrated the man has not arrived yet zaida announced taking the chair with its back to the large stern windows and arranging her long fringed red sash just so adjusting the angle of the emeraldstudded dagger thrust through the sash she was a very particular woman it was natural enough to want everything in its place on board a shiptidiness became a habit as well as a necessityyet she was exacting even by the usual standards the remaining chairs none fastened to the deck in proper fashion made two rows facing each other and the wavemistresses began taking their seats each womans windfinder standing behind her chair it appears he intends us to wait on him amylia see that the goblets are all filled ah it seemed the woman had put her foot wrong yet again amylia jumped then gathered her bronzecolored skirts to her knees and went racing for the table where the wine pitchers sat badly wrong it appeared harine wondered how long zaida would continue to allow her to wear dresses rather than trousers which were much more practical shipboard it would surely be a shock to her when they passed beyond sight of land and blouses were abandoned of the brown ajah amylia had wanted to study the athaan miere but she was given little time for study her purpose was to work and zaida saw that she did she was there to teach the windfinders all that the aes sedai knew she still dithered over that but shorebound instructors rare as they were ranked barely a whisker above the deckhands in the beginning the woman apparently had believed her dignity fully equal to zaidas if not moreand the deckmasters flail laid with some frequent regularity across her rump supposedly was changing her mind if slowly amylia had actually tried to desert three times strangely she did not know how to make a gateway knowledge that carefully was being kept from her and she should have known she was being watched too closely to bribe her way onto a bumboat well she was unlikely to try again reportedly she had been told that a fourth attempt would earn a public strapping this time followed by being hung by her ankles in the rigging no one would risk that shame surely sailmistresses and even wavemistresses had been reduced to deckhands and gone willingly after that eager to lose themselves and their disgrace in the mass of men and women hauling lines and handling sail removing the cushion from the seat of her chair and dropping it disdainfully on the deck harine took her place at the bottom of the lefthand row shalon at her back she was the least senior except for mareil seated across from her but then zaida would have sat only one chair farther up had she not gained the sixth fat golden earring for each ear and the chains that connected them her lobes might still be sore from the piercings a pleasant thought as he makes us wait perhaps we should make him wait when he finally does appear with an untouched goblet in hand she waved away the anxious aes sedai who scurried over to mareil foolish woman did she not know she should have served the mistress of the ships first and then followed with the wavemistresses by seniority zaida toyed with her piercework scent box hanging on a very heavy golden chain around her neck she wore a wide closefitting collar of heavy gold links too a gift from elayne of andor he comes from the coramoor she said dryly whom you were supposed to stick to like a barnacle her voice never hardened but every word cut at harine this man will be as close as i can come to speaking to the coramoor without dire need since you agreed he did not have to attend me more than three times in any period of two years because of you i must accept this mans discourtesy if he turns out to be a scabrous drunkard who must run to the rail and empty his stomach every second sentence the ambassador i send to the coramoor will be someone who knows how to obey her orders pelanna tittered and smirked she thought everyone was like herself shalon squeezed harines shoulder reassuringly but she did not need it stay with the coramoor there was no way she could explain to anyone even shalon cadsuanes rude methods of enforcing her will or her total lack of respect for harines dignity she had been an ambassador from the athaan miere in name and forced to dance to any tune the aes sedai piped she was willing to admit if only to herself that she had almost wept with relief when she realized that cursed woman was going to let her leave besides that girls visions always came true so the aes sedai said and they could not lie it was enough turane slipped into the cabin and bowed to zaida the coramoors emissary has arrived shipmistress he he stepped out of a gateway on the quarterdeck that created murmurs among the windfinders and amylia jerked as though she had felt the deckmasters flail again i hope he did not damage your deck too badly turane zaida said harine sipped wine to hide her small smile apparently the man was to be made to wait a little at least not at all shipmistress turane sounded surprised the gateway opened a good foot above the deck and he stepped through from one of the citys docks yes shalon whispered i can see how to do that she thought anything to do with the power was wonderful that must have a shock seeing a stone dock above your quarterdeck zaida said very well i will see whether the coramoor has sent me a scabrous drunkard send him in turane but do not rush amylia am i to get any wine before nightfall the aes sedai gasped and making little whimpers as if on the point of tears rushed to fetch a goblet as turane bowed and left light what had amylia done long moments passed and zaida had her wine well before a large man with dark hair curling to his broad shoulders entered the cabin he certainly was not scabrous nor did he appear drunk the high collar of his black coat held a silver pin in the shape of a sword on one side and on the other a redandgold pin shaped like one of the creatures that entwined the coramoors forearms a dragon yes that was what it was called a round pin fastened to his left shoulder showed three golden crowns against blue enamel a sigil perhaps was he a shorebound noble could the coramoor actually have done zaida honor in sending this man knowing rand althor as she did she doubted it had been intentional it was not that he tried to dishonor anyone yet he cared little for the honors of others he bowed to zaida handling the sword at his side smoothly but he failed to touch heart and lips and forehead still some shortcomings had to be overlooked with the shorebound i apologize if i arrive late shipmistress he said but it seemed unnecessary to come before all of your number were here he must have a very good looking glass to have observed that from the docks studying him up and down with a frown zaida sipped her wine you have a name i am logain he said simply half the women in the room exhaled sharply and most of the rest let their jaws drop more than one slopped wine from her goblet not zaida and not harine but the others logain that was a name known even to the athaan miere may i speak shipmistress amylia asked breathily she was clutching the porcelain pitcher so hard that harine feared it might shatter in her hands but the woman had learned enough sense to say no more until zaida nodded then words spilled from her in a breathless rush this man was a false dragon he was gentled for it how it is he can channel again i cannot know but he channels satdin saidin he is tainted shipmistress if you deal with him you will incur the wrath of the white tower i know enough zaida cut in you should be well aware by now how much i fear the wrath of the white tower but zaida held up a single finger and the aes sedais mouth snapped shut her lips twisting in a sickly fashion that one word might lead to her kissing the deckmasters sister again and she knew it what she says is true in part logain said calmly i am an ashaman but there is no taint any longer saidin is clean the creator decided to show us mercy it seems i have a question for her whom do you serve aes sedai egwene alvere or elaida aroihan wisely amylia kept her mouth shut for the next year she serves me logain zaida said firmly the aes sedai squeezed her pale eyes shut for a moment and when they opened again they were even wider than before impossible as that seemed and they held a look of horror was it possible she had believed zaida might relent and let her go early you can confine your questions to me the shipmistress went on but first i have two for you where is the coramoor i must send an ambassador to him and he must keep her close in accordance with the bargain remind him of that and what message do you bring from him a request for some service i suppose as to where he is i cannot say the man smiled slightly as if he had made a joke he smiled i demand zaida began but he cut her off provoking angry mutters and hot glares from the other women the fool seemed to think he was an equal to the mistress of the ships he wants his whereabouts kept secret for now shipmistress the forsaken have made efforts to kill him i am willing to take harine din togara with me however from what i heard i think he found her acceptable harine jerked so hard she spilled wine over the back of her hand then took another long swallow but no zaida would divorce amel and marry a ballast stone before she sent harine din togara as her ambassador still even the thought of it was enough to make her tongue stick to the roof of her mouth even becoming mistress of the ships might be insufficient recompense for being forced to endure cadsuane any longer studying logain with a stony face zaida told amylia to pour wine for him the aes sedai flinched and by the time she reached the table she was trembling so hard that the pitchers spout clattered on the rim of the goblet almost as much wine went onto the deck as inside the goblet strangely logain walked over to her and put his hands on hers to steady her was he one of those who could not leave others to do their own work youve nothing to fear from me amylia sedai he told her its been a long time since i ate anyone for breakfast she stared up at him with her mouth hanging open as though uncertain whether he was making a joke and the service he requests zaida said not a request shipmistress he had to straighten the pitcher to keep the goblet from overflowing taking the goblet he stepped away from amylia but she stood gaping at his back light but the woman found no end of ways to get into trouble a call on your side of the bargain with the coramoor among other things you promised him ships and he needs ships to carry food and other supplies to bandar eban from illian and tear that can be done zaida said not quite masking her relief though she shot a frown at harine pelanna glared as well of course but so did lacine and niolle and several others harine suppressed a sigh some of the details of the bargain were quite onerous she had to admit such as the requirement that the mistress of the ships be prepared to attend him up to three times in any two years the jendai prophecy said the athaan miere were to serve the coramoor yet few opinions of how they were to serve included the mistress of the ships going running when he called but the others had not been there bargaining with aes sedai convinced that she had no alternative to making whatever bargain she could truth of the light it was a wonder she had gotten as much as she had supplies for more than a million people shipmistress logain added as casually as if he were asking for another goblet of wine how many more i cannot say but bandar eban itself is starving the ships must arrive as soon as possible shock rippled through the cabin harine was not alone in taking a long drink of wine even zaidas eyes widened in amazement that might require more rakers than we possess she said at last unable to keep the incredulity from her voice logain shrugged as though that were of no account even so that is what he requires of you use other ships if you must zaida stiffened in her chair required bargain or no bargain that was imprudent language to use with her turane slipped into the cabin again and in breach of all protocol ran to zaida her bare feet slapping the deck bending close she whispered into the shipmistresss ear zaidas face slowly took on a look of horror she halfraised her scent box then shuddered and let it fall to her bosom send her in she said send her in immediately there is news to make an anchor weep she went on as turane raced from the cabin i will let you hear it from she who brought it you must wait she added when logain opened his mouth you must wait he had sufficient sense to hold his peace but not enough to hide his impatience stalking to the side of the cabin to stand with his mouth tight and his brows drawn down the young woman who entered and bowed deeply to zaida was tall and lean and she might have been lovely except that her face was haggard her blue linen blouse and green trousers looked as if they had been worn for days and she swayed on her feet with weariness her honor chain held only a handful of medallions as befitted her youth yet harine could see that no fewer than three commended acts of great courage i am cemeille din selaan long eyes shipmistress she said hoarsely sailmistress of the darter wind racer i sailed as fast as i could but i fear it is too late for anything to be done i stopped at every island between tremalking and here but i was always too late tears began to trickle down her cheeks yet she seemed unaware of them tell the first twelve your sad news in your own way at your own pace zaida said gently amylia give her wine not gently said at all the aes sedai leaped to obey almost three weeks ago cemeille said amayar on tremalking began asking the gift of passage to every island always a man and a woman to each island those who asked for aile somera requested they be put off in boats out of sight of land when they were told that the seanchan hold all of somera she took a full goblet from amylia nodding her thanks then drank deeply harine exchanged questioning glances with mareil who shook her head slightly no amayar had ever requested the gift of passage in harines memory though for them it truly was a gift with no gift expected in return and they avoided the salt keeping their small fishing boats close to shore so asking to be put off out of sight of land was as strange as asking passage but what could be so dire in this all of the amayar in the ports left even those owed money from the shipyards or the ropewalks but no one thought anything of it for two or three days the wine had not wet cemeilles throat enough to mitigate her hoarseness she scrubbed at the tears on her cheeks with the back of her hand not until we realized none had come back the governor sent people to the amayar villages and they found she squeezed her eyes shut the amayar were all dead or dying men womenher voice brokechildren funeral keening rose in the cabin and harine was surprised to realize that shrill sound was coming from her mouth too sad enough to make an anchor weep this should make the heavens sob no wonder the sailmistress was hoarse how many hours how many days had she cried since learning of this catastrophe how pelanna demanded when the keening died face distraught she leaned forward in her chair she was holding her scent box to her nose as if the scent could somehow ward off the stench of this news some sickness speak woman poison wavemistress cemeille replied she struggled to compose herself but tears still leaked down her face everywhere i have been it was the same they gave their children a poison that put them into a deep sleep from which they did not waken it seems there was not enough of that to go around so many of the adults took slower poisons some lived long enough to be found and tell the tale the great hand on tremalking melted the hill where it stood reportedly is now a deep hollow it seems the amayar had prophecies that spoke of the hand and when it was destroyed they believed this signaled the end of time what they called the end of illusion they believed it was time for them to leave this this illusionshe laughed the word bitterly we call the world have none been saved zaida asked none at all tears glistened on her cheeks too but harine could not fault her on that her own cheeks were wet none shipmistress zaida stood and tears or no tears she held the aura of command and her voice was steady the fastest ships must be sent to every island even to those of aile somera a way must be found when the salt first stilled after the breaking the amayar asked our protection from brigands and raiders and we owe them protection still if we can find only a handful who still live we still owe it this is as sad a story as i have ever heard logains voice sounded too loud as he walked back out in front of zaida but your ships are committed to bandar eban if you dont have enough rakers then you must use your other fast ships too all of them if necessary are you mad as well as heartless zaida demanded fists on her hips and feet apart she seemed to be standing on a quarterdeck her glare stabbed at logain we must mourn we must save who we can and mourn for the countless thousands we cannot save she might as well have smiled for all the effect her glares had on logain as he spoke it seemed to harine that the space turned chill and the light dimmed she was not the only woman to hug herself against that cold mourn if you must he said but mourn on the march for tarmon gaidon chapter twentythree call to a sitting w ith magla and salita out for the morning romanda had the patched brown tent to herself a blessed opportunity to read though the two mismatched brass lamps on the small table gave off a faint yet nosewrinkling scent of rancid oil one had to live with such things these days some might consider the flame the blade and the heart unseemly for one of her attainments and position as a girl in far madding she had been forbidden such booksbut it made an agreeable change from dry histories and terrifying reports of food spoilage she had seen a side of beef kept for months as fresh as the day the cow was slaughtered but now the keepings were failing one by one some had taken to muttering that there must be a flaw in egwenes creation yet that was arrant blather if a weave worked once then properly done it always worked barring something to disrupt the weave and egwenes new weaves always worked as claimed she had to give the woman that and try as they might and they had tried very hard no one could detect any interference it was as if saidar itself were failing it was unthinkable and inescapable worst of all no one could think of anything to do she certainly could not a brief interlude with tales of romance and adventure was much preferable to contemplating utter futility and the failure of what was by its very nature unfailing the novice straightening the tent had sense enough not to comment on her reading or to glance at the woodbound book twice bodewhin cauthon was quite pretty but she was an intelligent girl even so though she had something of her brother around the eyes and rather more of him in her head than she was willing to admit undoubtedly she was already hard on the path to the green or perhaps the blue the girl wanted to live adventure not just read about it as if an aes sedais life would not bring her more adventure than she wished without searching for it romanda felt no regret over the girls path the yellow would have plenty to choose from among more suitable novices there could be no question of accepting any of the older women of course yet that left a wealth of choice she tried to focus on the page she did enjoy the story of birgitte and gaidal cain the tent was not particularly large and was quite crowded it held a trio of hard canvas cots barely softened by thin mattresses stuffed with lumpy wool three ladderback chairs made by distinctly different hands a rickety washstand with a cracked mirror and a chipped blue pitcher standing in the white basin and along with the table made steady by a small block of wood under one leg brassbound chests for clothing bed linens and personal possessions as a sitter she could have had the space to herself but she liked being able to keep a close eye on magla and salita just because they all sat for the yellow was no reason to trust too far magla supposedly was her ally in the hall yet went her own way much too often and salita seldom did anything else still it made for inconvenience aside from crowding bodewhin had a great deal of work mainly putting away the dresses and slippers salita scattered across the tattered carpets after deciding they would not do that woman was frivolous enough for a green she went through her entire wardrobe every single morning likely she thought romanda would have her serving woman straightenshe always seemed to think aelmara was as much in her service as romandasbut aelmara had served romanda for years before she went into retirement not to mention helping her escape far madding after a slight misunderstanding a short time later there was no possibility she would require aelmara to look after another sister as well as herself she frowned at the book not seeing a word why in the light had magla insisted on salita back in salidar in truth magla had bandied several names about each more ridiculous than the last but had settled on salita once she decided the plump tairen had the best chance of being raised to a chair romanda had thrown her own support behind dagdara a far more suitable candidate not to mention one she thought she could sway without too much difficulty yet she herself had been trying for a chair while magla already held one that carried weight and no matter that romanda had previously held a chair longer than anyone in living memory well it was done and that was that what could not be cured must be endured nisao ducked into the tent the light of saidar around her winking out as she did so in the brief instant before the tentflap fell shut sarin her baldheaded stump of a warder was visible outside a hand resting on his sword hilt and his head swiveling plainly standing guard may i speak with you alone the diminutive sister said short enough to make sarin seem tall she always minded romanda of a largeeyed sparrow there was nothing tiny about her powers of observation or her intellect however she had been a natural choice for the council the ajahs created to try keeping an eye on egwene and it was certainly no fault of hers that said council had had little or no restraining effect on the woman of course nisao romanda casually closed the book and eased up to tuck it beneath the yellowtasseled cushion on her chair it would never do to have word get around that she was reading that it must be almost time for your next class bodewhin you dont want to be late oh no aes sedai sharina would be very upset spreading her white skirts in a deep curtsy the novice darted from the tent romanda compressed her lips sharina would be upset that woman was emblematic of all that was wrong with allowing those above eighteen into the novice ranks her potential was beyond incredible but that was beside the point sharina melloy was a disruption but how to be rid of her her and all the other women too old to have had their names written in the novice book in the first place provisions were strictly limited for putting a woman out once her name was in the book unfortunately over the years a number of women had been found to have lied about their age to gain entrance to the tower by a few years only in most cases but allowing them to remain had set precedents and egwene alvere had set another and worse there had to be some way to overcome it may i make us private nisao asked if you wish have you learned something about the negotiations despite egwenes capture talks continued under the pavilion at the foot of the bridge in darein or rather the semblance of talks they were a farce a dumbshow of obstinacy yet it was necessary to keep a close eye on the negotiators varilin had snatched most of that work to herself claiming gray ajah prerogative but magla found ways to wriggle into the matter whenever she could and so did saroiya and takima and faiselle worse than the fact that none of them seemed to trust the others to carry out the negotiationsor much at all for that matterat times all of them almost seemed to be negotiating for elaida well perhaps it was not that bad they held fast against the womans ridiculous demand that the blue ajah be dissolved and argued if not nearly with sufficient force for elaida stepping down but if sheand lelaine she was forced to admitdid not stiffen their backbones now and then they might well accede to some of elaidas other odious conditions light at times it was as if they had forgotten the entire purpose of marching on tar valon pour us tea she went on gesturing to a painted wooden tray sitting atop two stacked chests that held a silver pitcher and several battered pewter cups and tell me what youve heard the glow surrounded nisao briefly while she warded the tent and tied off the weave i know nothing of the negotiations she said filling two of the cups i want to ask you to speak to lelaine romanda took the proffered cup and used taking a slow swallow to give herself time for thought at least this tea had not yet turned lelaine what could there be about lelaine that required warding still anything that gave her leverage against the other woman would be useful lelaine seemed entirely too smug of late for her to be entirely comfortable about it she shifted on the seat cushion regarding what why dont you speak to her yourself we havent fallen as low as it seems the white tower has under elaida i have spoken to her or rather she has spoken to me and rather forcefully nisao sat down and set her cup on the table while she arranged her yellowslashed skirts with overly elaborate care she wore a small frown it seemed she was fiddling for time too lelaine demanded that i stop asking questions about anaiya and kairen she said finally according to her their murders are blue ajah business romanda snorted shifting again the books wooden cover was a hard lump beneath her its corners digging into her hip that is utter nonsense but why were you asking questions i dont recall you being inquisitive about such matters the other woman touched her cup to her lips but if she drank it was the tiniest sip lowering the cup she almost seemed to grow taller she sat up so straight a sparrow becoming a hawk because the mother ordered me to romanda kept her eyebrows from rising only with an effort so in the beginning she had accepted egwene for the same reason she suspected every other sitter had certainly lelaine had done so once she realized she could not attain the stole and staff herself a malleable young girl would be a puppet in the hands of the hall and romanda had fully intended to be the one pulling her strings later it had seemed obvious that siuan was the true puppeteer and there had been no way to stop her short of rebelling against a second amyrlin which surely would have shattered the rebellion against elaida she hoped lelaine had ground her teeth over that half as much as she had now egwene was in elaidas hands yet in several meetings she had remained cool and collected determined in her course of action and that of the sisters outside tar valons walls romanda found in herself a grudging respect for the girl very grudging but she could not deny it it had to be egwene herself the hall kept a tight fist on the dream terangreal and though no one could find the one leane had been loaned before that dire night she and siuan had been practically at each others throats there was no question of siuan slipping into telaranrhiod to tell the woman what to say was it possible that nisao had come to the same conclusion about egwene without seeing her in the unseen world that council had stuck very close to her that is reason enough for you nisao she could hardly slip the book back out without the other woman noticing she shifted again but there was no comfortable position on the thing she was going to have a bruise if this continued nisao twisted her pewter cup about on the tabletop but she still did not look away it is my major reason in the beginning i thought she would end up as your pet or lelaines later when it was clear she had evaded both of you i thought siuan must be holding the leash but i soon learned i was wrong siuan has been a teacher im sure and an advisor and perhaps even a friend but ive seen egwene call her up short no one has a leash on egwene alvere she is intelligent observant quick to learn and deft she may become one of the great amyrlins the birdlike sister gave a sudden brief laugh do you realize she will be the longest sitting amyrlin in history no one will ever live long enough to top her unless she chooses to step down early smiles faded to solemnity and perhaps worry not because she had skirted the edge of violating custom however nisao schooled her face well but her eyes were tight if we manage to unseat elaida that is hearing her own thoughts thrown back at her with emendations was unnerving a great amyrlin well it would take many years to see whether that came about but whether or not egwene managed that considerable and unlikely feat she would discover that the hall was much less amenable once her war powers expired romanda cassin certainly would be respect was one thing becoming a lapdog quite another standing on the pretext of straightening her deep yellow skirts she drew the book from beneath the cushion as she sat back down and tried to drop it surreptitiously it hit the carpet with a thud and nisaos eyebrows twitched romanda ignored that pulling the book under the edge of the table with her foot we will she put more confidence than she felt into that the peculiar negotiations and egwenes continuing imprisonment gave her pause forget the girls claims that she could undermine elaida from within though it seemed half her work had been done by others if her reporting on the situation in the tower was accurate but romanda believed because she had to believe she had no intention of living cut off from her ajah accepting penance until elaida thought her fit to be fully aes sedai again no intention of accepting elaida aroihan as amyrlin better lelaine than that and one argument in her own mind for raising egwene had been that it kept the stole and staff from lelaine no doubt lelaine had thought the same concerning her and i will inform lelaine in no uncertain terms that you can ask any questions you wish we must solve those murders and the murder of any sister is every sisters concern what have you learned so far not a proper question perhaps but being a sitter gave you certain privileges at least she had always believed it did nisao displayed no pique at being questioned no hesitation in answering very little i fear she said ruefully frowning at her winecup it seemed there must be some link between anaiya and kairen some reason they two were picked out but all ive learned so far is that they had been close friends for many years blues called them and another blue sister cabriana mecandes the three because they were so close but they were all closemouthed too no one recalls any of them talking about their own affairs except with one another in any event friendship seems a feeble motive for murder i hope i can find some reason why anyone would want to murder them especially a man who can channel but i confess its a small hope romanda furrowed her brow cabriana mecandes she paid little attention to the other ajahsonly the yellow had any truly useful function how could any of their passions compare to healingyet that name chimed a small gong in the back of her head why it would come to her or not it could not be important small hopes can grow surprising fruit nisao thats an old saying in far madding and its true continue your investigation in egwenes absence you may report what you learn to me nisao blinked and her jaw tightened briefly but whether or not reporting to romanda sat well with her there was little she could do but obey she could hardly claim interference in her affairs murder could not be one sisters affair besides magla might have gotten her ridiculous choice for the third yellow sitter yet romanda had secured the position of first weaver for herself easily after all she had been head of the yellow before she retired and even magla had been unwilling to stand against her the position carried much less power than she would have liked but at least she could count on obedience in most things from yellow sisters if not sitters at least as nisao untied her ward against eavesdropping and let it dissipate theodrin popped into the tent she was wearing her shawl spread across her shoulders and down her arms to display the long fringe as newly raised sisters often did the willowy domani had chosen brown after egwene granted her that shawl but the brown had not known what to do with her despite finally accepting her they had seemed ready to largely ignore her entirely the wrong thing so romanda had taken her in theodrin tried to behave as if she really were aes sedai yet she was a bright levelheaded girl for all that she spread her brown woolen skirts in a curtsy a small curtsy but a curtsy she was well aware that she had no right to the shawl until she had been tested and passed it would have been cruel not to make sure she understood lelaine has called a sitting of the hall she said breathlessly i couldnt find out why i ran to tell you but i didnt want to intrude while the ward was up and rightly not romanda said nisao if you will excuse me i must see what lelaine is about gathering her yellowfringed shawl from atop one of the chests holding her clothing she arranged it over her arms and checked her hair in the cracked mirror before herding the others outside and seeing them on their way it was not so much that she thought nisao would have looked for what had made that thud if left in the tent alone but it was better to take no chances aelmara would replace the book where it belonged with several similar volumes in the chest that held romandas personal possessions that had a very stout lock with only two keys one kept in her belt pouch the other in aelmaras the morning was crisp yet spring had arrived with a rush the dark clouds massing behind dragonmounts shattered peak would deliver rain rather than snow though not on the camp it was to be hoped many of the tents leaked and the camp streets were a bog already horse carts making deliveries splashed mud from their high wheels as they made new ruts driven by women for the most part and a few grayhaired men male access to the aes sedai camp was strictly limited now even so nearly every sister she saw glided along the uneven wooden walkways wrapped in the light oisaidar and followed by her warder if she had one romanda refused to embrace the source whenever she went outsidesomeone had to set an example of proper behavior with every sister in the camp on tenterhooksyet she was very conscious of the lack conscious of the lack of a warder too keeping most men out of the camp was all very well but a murderer was unlikely to pay any heed to the restriction ahead gareth bryne rode out of a crossing street a stocky man with mostly gray hair his breastplate strapped over a buffcolored coat and his helmet hanging from his saddle bow siuan was with him swaying on a plump shaggy mare and looking such a pretty girl that it was almost possible to forget she had been hardbitten and sharptongued as amyrlin easy to forget she was still an accomplished schemer blues always were the mare plodded along but siuan nearly fell off before bryne reached out to steady her at the edge of the blue quartersthe camp was laid out in rough approximation of the ajah quarters in the towerhe dismounted long enough to help her down then climbed back into his bays saddle and left her standing there holding the mares reins and gazing after him now why would she do that blacking the mans boots doing his laundry that relationship was abhorrent the blue should put an end to it and to the pit of doom with custom however strong custom should not be abused to hold all aes sedai up to ridicule turning her back on siuan she started toward che pavilion that served as their temporary hall of the tower as pleasant as it was to meet in the true hall not to mention under elaidas very nose few sisters could manage to put themselves to sleep at any hour so the pavilion must continue to serve she glided along the walkway without haste she was not about to be seen hurrying to answer lelaines call what could the woman want now a gong sounded magnified with the power so it carried across the camp clearlyanother of sharinas suggestionsand suddenly the walkways were crowded with novices hurrying to their next class or to chores all clustered by family those families of six or seven always attended class together did chores together in fact did everything together it was an effective way to manage so many novicesnearly fifty more had wandered into the camp in just the last two weeks pushing the total back near a thousand in spite of runaways and almost a quarter of those were young enough to be proper novices more than the tower had held in centuriesyet she wished it were not sharinas work the woman had not even suggested it to the mistress of novices she had organized the thing herself and presented it to tiana whole and complete the novices some of them graying or with lines in their faces so that it was difficult to think of them as children despite their white dresses squeezed to the edge of the walkway to let sisters pass while they offered curtsies but none stepped into the muddy street to make more room sharina again sharina had spread the word that she did not want to see the girls dirtying their nice white woolens unnecessarily it was enough to make romanda grind her teeth the novices who curtsied to her straightened hurriedly and practically ran ahead of her she spotted sharina herself talking to tiana who was shrouded in the glow of saidar doing all of the talking with tiana merely nodding now and then there was nothing disrespectful in sharinas demeanor but despite novice white with her creased face and gray hair in a tight bun on the back of her head she looked exactly what she was a grandmother and tiana had an unfortunately youthful appearance something about her bone structure and large brown eyes overwhelmed the ageless look of aes sedai lack of disrespect or no there was too much appearance of a woman instructing her granddaughter to suit romanda as she approached them sharina offered a proper curtsya very proper curtsy romanda had to admitand hurried off the other way to join her own family waiting for her were there fewer lines in her face than there had been well there was no saying what might happen when a woman began with the power at her age sixtyseven and a novice is she giving you difficulties she asked and tiana leaped as though an icicle had slid down the back of her dress the woman lacked the dignity the gravity necessary in a mistress of novices at times she seemed smothered by the number of her charges too and she was much too lenient besides accepting excuses where there could be none she recovered quickly however falling in beside romanda though she smoothed her dark gray skirts unnecessarily difficulties of course not sharina is the bestbehaved novice in the book truth to tell most are wellbehaved the greatest number sent to my study are mothers upset because their daughters are learning faster than they or have a higher potential or aunts with the same complaint of nieces they seem to believe the matter can be rectified somehow they can be surprisingly adamant about it until i set them straight about being adamant with any sister although a good many have been sent to me more than once i fear a handful still seem surprised that they can be switched is that so romanda said absently her eye had caught palehaired delana hurrying in the same direction grayfringed shawl looped over her arms and her socalled secretary striding at her side delana wore an almost somber dark gray but the saranov trollop was in blueslashed green silk that left half her bosom on display and fit much too snugly over hips that she rolled blatantly of late the pair of them seemed to have abandoned the story that halima was merely delanas servant indeed the woman was gesturing emphatically while delana merely nodded in the meekest manner imaginable meek it was always a mistake to choose a pillowfriend who did not wear the shawl especially if you were fool enough to let her take the lead sharina isnt only wellbehaved tiana continued blithely she is showing a great skill with nynaeves new way of healing like a number of the older novices most were village wise women of one sort or another though i dont see how that can have any bearing one was a noble in murandy romanda tripped over her own heel and staggered two steps arms flailing for balance before she could catch herself and gather her shawl tiana put a hand on her arm to steady her murmuring about the unevenness of the walkways planking but she shook it off sbarina had a gift for the new healing and a number of the older women she herself had learned the new way but while it was different enough from the old that the secondlearned weave limitation seemed not to apply she had no great gift for it not nearly what she had for the old method and why are novices being allowed to practice that tiana tiana flushed as well she should such weaves were much too complex for novices not to mention dangerous if misapplied done improperly healing could kill rather than cure the woman channeling as well as the patient i can hardly stop them from seeing healing done romanda she said defensively moving her arms as if adjusting a shawl she was not wearing there are always broken bones or some fool whos managed to cut himself badly not to mention all the illness we have to deal with lately most of the older women only have to see a weave once to have it down abruptly for a bare instant red returned to her cheeks smoothing her face she drew herself up and defensiveness fell away from her voice in any event romanda i shouldnt need to remind you that the novices and accepted are mine as mistress of novices i decide what they can learn and when some of those women could test for accepted today after only months when it comes to the power at least if i choose not to make them twiddle their thumbs idly it is my decision to make perhaps you should run to see whether sharina has any further instructions for you romanda said coldly spots of crimson staining her cheeks tiana turned on her heel and strode away without another word not quite forbidden rudeness but close even from behind she was the image of indignation her back stiff as an iron rod her steps quick well romanda was willing to admit she had come near rudeness herself but with cause trying to put the mistress of novices out of her mind she set out toward the pavilion again but had to restrain herself to keep from walking as fast as tiana sharina and several of the other older women should she rethink her position no of course not their names should never have been allowed in the novice book in the first place yet their names were there and it seemed they had mastered this wonderful new healing oh it was a tangled snarl she did not want to think about it not now the pavilion stood at the heart of the camp a muchpatched piece of heavy canvas surrounded by a walkway three times as wide as any of the others holding her skirts well up out of the mud she hurried across to it she did not mind haste when it got her out of the mud more quickly even so aelmara would have a time cleaning her shoes and her petticoats she thought as she let her skirts down decently concealing her ankles once more word of the hall sitting always drew sisters hoping for news of the negotiations or of egwene and a good fifty or more were already gathered around the pavilion with their warders or standing just inside behind where their sitters would sit even here most shone with the light of the power as if they were in any danger surrounded by other aes sedai she found herself with a strong urge to walk around the pavilion boxing ears that was impossible of course even if custom could be set aside which she had no desire to do a chair in the hall gave no authority for such a thing sheriam the narrow blue stole of the keeper vivid on her shoulders stood out in the crowd in part because there was a clear space around her other sisters were avoiding looking at her much less approaching her the flamehaired woman embarrassed many of the sisters appearing every time the hall was called to sit as she did the law was quite clear any sister could attend a sitting of the hall unless it was closed yet the amyrlin could not enter the hall of the tower without being announced by the keeper and the keeper was not allowed in without the amyrlin sheriams green eyes were tight as usual and she fidgeted in an unbecoming manner like a novice who knew she was due another visit to the mistress of novices at least she was not embracing the source and her warder was nowhere in sight before stepping beneath the pavilion romanda glanced over her shoulder and sighed the great bulk of black clouds behind dragonmount was gone not drifting apart simply gone entirely very likely there would be another wave of panic among the grooms and laborers and the serving women surprisingly the novices seemed to take these strange occurrences more in stride perhaps that was because they were trying to take their cues from the sisters but she suspected sharinas hand again what was she to do about the woman inside eighteen clothcovered boxes colored for the six ajahs represented in the camp made platforms for polished benches two slanting rows atop the layered carpets widening toward a box covered with stripes in all seven colors wisely egwene had insisted on including red despite considerable opposition where elaida seemed determined to divide every ajah from every other egwene was determined to hold them all together including the red the wooden bench atop that platform had the amyrlins sevenstriped stole laid across it no one claimed responsibility for placing it there but no one had removed it either romanda was uncertain whether it was meant to be a reminder of egwene alvere the amyrlin seat an echo of her presence or a reminder that she was absent and a prisoner how it was seen doubtless depended on the sister looking she was not the only sitter taking her time to answer lelaines call delana was there of course slumped on her bench and rubbing the side of her nose her watery blue eyes pensive once romanda had considered her levelheaded unsuitable for a chair but levelheaded at least she had not allowed halima to follow her into the hall and continue her harangue or rather at least halima had chosen not to no one who had heard the woman shouting at delana possessed any doubts who gave the orders there lelaine herself was already on her bench just below the amyrlins a slender hardeyed woman in blueslashed silk who rationed her smiles tightly which made it doubly odd that now and then she glanced toward the sevencolored stole and gave a small smile that smile made romanda uneasy and few things could do that moria in blue wool embroidered with silver was striding up and down in front of the bluecovered platforms was her frown because she knew why lelaine had called the hall and disapproved or because she was worried over not knowing i saw myrelle walking with llyw malind said hitching up her greenfringed shawl as romanda entered the pavilion and i dont think ive ever seen a sister looking so harassed despite the sympathy in her tone her eyes sparkled and her full lips quirked with amusement how did you ever talk her into bonding him i was there when someone suggested it to her and i vow she turned pale the man could almost pass for an ogier i expressed myself forcefully on duty faiselle stocky and squarefaced was forceful in everything in truth a hammer of a woman she mocked every tale of seductive domani i pointed out that llyw had been becoming more and more dangerous to himself and others since kairen died and i told her it couldnt be allowed to continue i made her see that as the only sister ever to save two other warders in the same circumstances she was the only choice to try doing it again ill admit i had to twist her arm a little but she eventually saw the right of the matter how under the light could you twist myrelles arm malind leaned forward eagerly romanda passed them by how could anyone have twisted myrelles arm no no gossip janya was on her bench for the brown squinting in thought at least she was squinting but the woman always seemed to be thinking of something else even when she was talking to you maybe her eyes were bad the rest of the benches still stood empty though romanda wished she had been more leisurely she would much rather have been the last to arrive than one of the first after a moments hesitation she approached lelaine would you care to give an idea of why you called the hall lelaine smiled down at her an amused smile yet unpleasant even so you might as well wait until we have enough sitters to proceed i dont care to repeat myself i will tell you this much it will be dramatic her eyes drifted to the striped stole and romanda felt a chill she did not let it show however merely taking her bench across from lelaine she could not help glancing uneasily at the stole herself was this some move to unseat egwene it seemed unlikely the other woman could say anything that would convince her to stand for the greater consensus or many of the other sitters since that would throw them back to the struggle between her and lelaine for control and weaken their position against elaida yet lelaines air of confidence was unnerving she schooled her features to calmness and waited there was nothing else to do kwamesa all but darted into the pavilion her sharpnosed face chagrined at not being first to arrive and joined delana salita appeared dark and cooleyed in yellowslashed green embroidered with yellow scrollwork on the bosom and suddenly there was a rush lyrelle glided in graceful and elegant in brocaded blue silk to take her place with the blues then saroiya and aledrin with their heads together the blocky domani seeming almost slender alongside the stout taraboner as they took their places on the white benches foxfaced samalin joined faiselle and malind and tiny escaralde scurried in she scurried the woman was from far madding too she should know better how to behave varilin is in darein i believe romanda said as escaralde climbed up beside janya but even if some others arrive later we have more than eleven are you content to begin lelaine or do you wish to wait i am content to begin do you wish a formal sitting lelaine smiled again she was being very free with those this morning they did nothing to warm her face that wont be necessary romanda she rearranged her skirts slightly but i ask that what is said here be sealed to the hall for the time being a murmur rose from the growing crowd of sisters standing behind the benches and those outside the pavilion even some of the sitters showed surprise if the sitting was not formal what need could there be to restrict knowledge of what was said so closely romanda nodded as though it were the most reasonable request in the world though let all depart who do not hold a chair aledrin will you make us private despite dark yellow hair of a silky texture and large liquid brown eyes the taraboner white fell short of pretty but she had a good head on her shoulders which was far more important standing she seemed uncertain whether she should speak the formal words and finally contented herself with weaving the ward against eavesdropping around the pavilion and holding it the murmuring faded as sisters and warders passed through that ward until the last was gone and silence fell they stood in ranks shouldertoshoulder on the walkway watching however the warders all crowded to the rear so everyone could see adjusting her shawl lelaine stood a green sister was brought to me when she came asking for egwene the green sitters stirred exchanging glances no doubt wondering why the sister was not brought to them instead lelaine affected not to notice not for the amyrlin seat for egwene alvere she has a proposal that meets some of our needs though she was reluctant to say very much of it to me moria will you bring her so she can present her proposal to the hall she resumed her seat moria left the pavilion still frowning and the crowd outside opened enough to let her through romanda could see sisters trying to question her but she ignored them disappearing across the street and into the blue ajah quarters romanda had a dozen questions she would have liked to ask in the interval but informal session or not questions would have been improper at this point the sitters did not wait in silence however at every ajah except the blue women stepped down so they could come together and speak in low voices except the blue and the yellow salita climbed down and walked over to romandas platform but romanda raised a hand slightly as soon as she opened her mouth what is there to discuss until we know what the proposal is salita the tairen sitters round face was as unreadable as a stone but after a moment she nodded and resumed her seat she was not unintelligent far from it just unsuitable at last moria returned leading a tall woman in dark green her dark hair pulled back severely from a stern ivory face and held by a silver comb and everyone climbed back to their benches three men with swords at their hips trailed after her through the watching sisters and into the pavilion unusual that very unusual when matters had been sealed to the hall romanda paid them little mind at first though she had had no real interest in warders since her last had died a good many years earlier but someone among the greens gasped and aledrin squeaked she actually squeaked and she was staring at the warders that had to be what they were and not only because they were heeling the green there was no mistaking a warders deadly grace romanda took a longer look and nearly gasped herself they were disparate men alike only in the way a leopard was like a lion but one a pretty sundark boy with his hair in belled braids garbed all in black wore a pair of pins on the tall collar of his coat a silver sword and a sinuous maned creature in red and gold she had heard enough descriptions to know she was looking at an ashaman an ashaman who had been bonded apparently gathering her skirts malind jumped down and rushed out into the crowd of sisters surely she was not frightened although romanda admitted to a hint of unease herself if only to herself you are not one of us janya said speaking up where she should not as always she leaned forward squinting at the newcome sister should i take it you have not come here to join us the greens mouth twisted in obvious distaste you take it correctly she said in a strong taraboner accent my name is merise haindehl and me i will stand with no sister who wishes to contend against other sisters while the world hangs in the balance our enemy it is the shadow not women who wear the shawl as we do mutters rose in the pavilion some angry some romanda thought shamed if you disapprove of what we do janya went on as if she had a right to speak before romanda why do you bring us any sort of proposal because the dragon reborn he asked cadsuane and cadsuane she asked me merise replied the dragon reborn the tension in the hall was suddenly palpable but the woman continued as if she were senseless to it properly it is not my proposal jahar speak to them the sundark youth stepped forward and as he passed her merise reached up to pat him on the shoulder encouragingly romandas respect for her rose to bond an ashaman was accomplishment enough to pat one as you might a hunting hound took a level of courage and selfconfidence she herself was unsure she possessed the boy strode to the center of the pavilion staring at the bench where the amyrlins stole lay then turned about slowly running his gaze over the sitters with an air of challenge it came to romanda that he was unafraid too an aes sedai held his bond he was alone and surrounded by sisters yet if there was a scrap of fear in him he had it under complete control where is egwene alvere he demanded i was ordered to lay the offer before her manners jahar merise murmured and his face colored the mother is unavailable at the moment romanda said smoothly you can tell us and we will tell her as soon as we can this offer comes from the dragon reborn and cadsuane but learning what that woman was doing in company with the dragon reborn was secondary instead of answering he snarled and spun to face merise a man just tried to listen in he said or maybe it was that forsaken who killed eben he is right aledrins voice was unsteady at least something touched my warding and it wasnt saidar hes channeling someone said incredulously a flurry broke out of sitters shifting on the benches and the light of the power enveloped several abruptly delana stood i need a breath of fresh air she said glowering at jahar as though she wanted to rip his throat out theres no need to be uneasy romanda said though she was not sure herself but delana wrapped in her shawl hurried from the pavilion malind passed her coming in as did nacelle a tall slender malkieri one of the handful remaining in the tower a good many had died in the years after malkier fell to the shadow letting themselves be pulled into schemes to avenge their native land and replacements had been few and far between since nacelle was not particularly intelligent but then greens did not need intelligence only courage this session has been sealed to the hall malind romanda said sharply nacelle needs only moments malind replied rubbing her hands together irritatingly she did not even bother to look at romanda keeping her eyes on the other green this is her first chance to test a new weave go ahead nacelle try it the glow of saidar appeared around the slim green shocking the woman neither asked permission nor told them what weave she intended although tight strictures held on what uses of the power were allowed in the hall channeling all of the five powers she wove around the ashaman something that seemed akin to the weave for detecting residues a thing romanda had small facility for nacelles blue eyes widened he is channeling she breathed or at least holding saidin romandas eyebrows climbed even lelaine gasped finding a man who could channel was always a matter of reading the residues of what he had done then arduously narrowing the suspects down to the true culprit or rather it had been this was truly wondrous or would have been before men who could channel started wearing black coats and strutting around openly still it negated one advantage those men had always had over aes sedai the ashaman seemed not to care his lip curled in what might have been a sneer can you tell what he is channeling she asked and disappointingly nacelle shook her head i thought id be able to but no on the other hand you there ashaman extend a flow toward one of the sitters nothing dangerous mind and do not touch her merise glowered at her fists planted on her hips maybe nacelle failed to realize he was one of her warders she certainly gestured at him in peremptory fashion a stubborn cast to his eyes jahar opened his mouth do it jahar merise said he is mine nacelle but i will let you give him an order this once nacelle looked shocked apparently she had failed to realize for the ashamans part that stubborn look remained yet he must have obeyed because nacelle clapped her hands delightedly and laughed saroiya she said excitedly you extended a flow toward saroiya the domani white am i right saroiyas coppery skin paled and gathering her whitefringed shawl around her she hastily slid back on her bench as far as she could for that matter aledrin edged away on her own bench tell her merise said jahar he can be stubborn but he is the good boy for all that the domani white jahar agreed reluctantly saroiya swayed as if she were going to fall over and he glanced at her contemptuously it was only spirit and its gone now saroiyas face darkened but whether from anger or embarrassment there was no telling a remarkable discovery lelaine said and im sure that merise will allow you to test further nacelle but the hall has business to conclude im certain you agree romanda romanda barely managed to stop herself from glaring lelaine overstepped herself too often if your demonstration is at an end she said you may withdraw nacelle the malkieri green was reluctant to go perhaps because she could tell from merises expression that there would be no further testingreally you would think a green of all people would be careful with any man who might be another sisters warderyet she had no choice of course what proposal does the dragon reborn have for us boy romanda asked once nacelle was on the other side of the warding this he said facing her proudly any sister who is faithful to egwene alvere may bond an ashaman to a total of fortyseven you cannot ask for the dragon reborn nor any man who wears the dragon but any soldier or dedicated you ask cannot refuse romanda felt as if all the breath had been squeezed from her lungs you will agree this meets our needs lelaine said calmly the woman must have known the gist of it from the start burn her i do romanda replied with fortyseven men who could channel surely they could expand their circles as far as they would go perhaps even a circle that included all of them if there were limits they would need to be worked out faiselle popped to her feet as if this were a formal sitting this must be debated i call for a formal session i see no need for that romanda told her without rising this is much better than what we previously agreed on there was no point in saying too much in front of the boy or merise what was her connection to the dragon reborn could she be one of the sisters said to have sworn oaths to him saroiya was on her feet before the last word left romandas mouth there is still the question of covenants to be sure we are in control we still have not agreed on those i should think the warder bond will make any other covenants moot lyrelle said dryly faiselle rose hurriedly and she and saroiya spoke atop each other the taint they stopped staring at each other suspiciously saidin is clean jahar said though no one had addressed him merise really should teach the boy how to behave if she was going to bring him before the hall clean saroiya said derisively it has been tainted for more than three thousand years faiselle put in sharply how can be it clean order romanda snapped trying to regain control order she stared at saroiya and faiselle until they resumed their seats then turned her attention to merise can i assume that you have linked with him the green simply nodded once she really did not like her present company and did not want to say a word more than necessary can you say that saidin is free of the taint the woman did not hesitate i can i took time to be convinced the male half of the power it is more alien than you can imagine not the inexorable yet gentle power ofsaidar but rather a raging sea of fire and ice whipped by a tempest yet i am convinced it is clean romanda let out a long breath a marvel to balance some of the horrors we are not formal but i call the question who stands to accept this offer she was on her feet as soon as she finished but no faster than lelaine and janya beat both of them in moments everyone was on her feet save saroiya and faiselle outside the warding heads turned as sisters doubtless began discussing what might have just been voted on the lesser consensus standing the offer to bond fortyseven ashaman is accepted saroiyas shoulders slumped and faiselle exhaled heavily she called for the greater consensus in the name of unity but it did not surprise her when the pair remained firmly on their benches after all they had fought approaching the ashaman at every turn struggled despite law and custom to impede it even after it had been decided on in any event it was done and without need of even a temporary alliance bonding would last a lifetime of course yet it was better than any sort of alliance that implied too much equality a peculiar number fortyseven janya mused may i question your warder merise thank you how did the dragon reborn come to that number jahar a very good question romanda thought in the shock of achieving what they needed without any requirement for partnership it had eluded her jahar drew himself up as if he had anticipated this and dreaded answering his face remained hard and cold though fiftyone sisters have been bonded by ashaman already and four of us are bonded to aes sedai fortyseven makes the difference there were five of us but one died defending his aes sedai remember his name eben hopwil remember him there was a stunned silence from the benches romanda felt a lump of ice in her middle fiftyone sisters bonded by ashaman it was an abomination manners jahar merise snapped do not make me tell you again shockingly he rounded on her they need to know merise they need to know turning back he ran his gaze along the benches his eyes seemed hot he had been dreading nothing he had been angry and still was eben was linked with his daigian and beldeine with daigian controlling the link so when they found themselves facing one of the forsaken all he could do was shout shes channeling saidin and attack her with his sword and despite what she did to him ruined as he was he managed to hang on to life hang on to saidin long enough for daigian to drive her off so you remember his name eben hopwil he fought for his aes sedai long after he should have been dead when he fell silent no one spoke until escaralde finally said very quietly we will remember him jahar but how did fiftyone sisters come to be bonded to ashaman she leaned forward as if his answer would be pitched as low the boy shrugged still angry it was of no matter to him ashaman bonding aes sedai elaida sent them to destroy us the dragon reborn has a standing order that no aes sedai can be harmed unless she tries to harm one of us first so taim decided to capture and bond them before they had the chance so they were elaidas supporters should that make a difference somehow it did a little but any sisters held by ashaman brought it all back to a matter of equality and that was intolerable i have another question for him merise moria said and waited until the green nodded twice now you did speak as if a woman did channel saidin why that do be impossible murmurs of agreement rippled around the pavilion it might be impossible the boy replied coolly but she did it daigian told us what eben said and she couldnt detect anything at all even while the woman was channeling it had to be saidin suddenly that small chime sounded again in the back of romandas head and she knew where she had heard the name cabriana mecandes we must order the arrest of delana and halima immediately she said she had to explain of course not even the amrylin seat could order the arrest of a sitter without explanation the murders with saidin of two sisters who had been close friends of cabriana a woman halima had claimed friendship with as well a female forsaken who channeled the male half of the power they were hardly convinced especially lelaine not until a thorough search of the camp turned up no trace of either woman they had been seen walking toward one of the traveling grounds with delana and her serving woman both carrying large bundles and scurrying along behind halima but they were gone chapter twentyfour honey in the tea egwene knew from the start that her strange captivity would be difficult yet she believed that embracing pain as the aiel did would be the easiest part after all she had been beaten severely when she paid her toh to the wise ones for lying strapped by one after another in turn so she had experience but embracing pain did not mean just giving way to it rather than fighting you had to draw the pain inside of you and welcome it as a part of you aviendha said you must be able to smile and laugh with joy or sing while the worst of the pain still gripped you that was not so easy at all that first morning before dawn in silvianas study she did her best while the mistress of novices plied a hardsoled slipper on her bared bottom she made no effort to stifle her sobs when they came or later her wordless howls when her legs wanted to kick she allowed them to flail until the mistress of novices trapped them under one of hers awkwardly because of silvianas skirts and then she let her toes drum the floor while her head tossed wildly she tried to draw the pain inside her to drink it in like breath pain was as much a part of life as breathing that was how the aiel saw life but oh light it hurt when she was finally allowed to straighten after what seemed a very long time she flinched when her shift and dress fell against her flesh the white wool seemed heavy as lead she attempted to welcome the scalding heat it was hard though so very hard still it seemed that her sobbing stopped very quickly of its own accord and her flow of tears dried up rapidly she did not snivel or writhe she studied herself in the mirror on the wall with its fading gilt how many thousands of women had peered into that mirror over the years those who were disciplined in this room were always required to study their own reflection afterward and think over why they had been punished but that was not why she did it her face was still red yet already it looked calm despite the painful heat in her bottom she actually felt calm perhaps she should try singing perhaps not plucking a white linen handkerchief from her sleeve she carefully dried her cheeks silviana studied her with a look of satisfaction before replacing the slipper in the narrow cabinet opposite the mirror i think i got your attention from the start or id have gone harder she said dryly patting the bun on the back of her head i doubt i will see you again soon in any case you may like to know that i asked questions as you requested melare had already begun asking the woman is leane sharif though the light knows how trailing off shaking her head she pulled her chair back around behind the writing table and sat she was most anxious about you more so than about herself you may visit her in your free time if you have any free time ill give instructions shes in the open cells and now you had better run if you want anything to eat before your first class thank you egwene said and turned toward the door silviana sighed heavily no curtsy child dipping her pen in the silvermounted ink jar she began to write in the punishment ledger a neat precise hand i will see you at midday it seems you will eat both of your first two meals back in the tower standing egwene could have left it there but in the night while waiting for the sitters to gather in the hall in telaranrhiod she had decided on the fine line she must walk she meant to fight yet she had to do it while appearing to go along to some extent at least within the limits she set herself refusing every order would mean appearing merely obstinateand perhaps would get her confined to a cell where she would be uselessbut some commands she must not obey if she was to maintain any scrap of dignity and that she had to do more than scraps she could not allow them to deny who she was however hard they insisted the amyrlin seat curtsies to no one she said calmly knowing full well the reaction she would get silvianas face hardened and she took up her pen again i will see you at the dinner hour as well i suggest you leave without speaking further unless you wish to end spending the entire day over my knee egwene left without speaking and without curtsying a fine line like a wire suspended over a deep pit but she had to walk it to her surprise alviarin was pacing up and down in the hall outside wrapped in her whitefringed shawl and hugging herself staring at something in the unseen distance she knew the woman was no longer elaidas keeper if not why she had been removed so suddenly spying in telaranrhiodgave only glimpses and snatches it was an uncertain reflection of the waking world in so many ways alviarin must have heard her yowling but strangely egwene felt no shame she was fighting an odd battle and in battle you took wounds the normally icy white did not appear so cool today in fact she seemed quite agitated her lips parted and her eyes hot egwene offered her no courtesies yet alviarin only gave her a baleful glare before entering silvianas study a fine line a little down the corridor a pair of reds stood watching one roundfaced the other slender both cooleyed with shawls draped along their arms so the long red fringe was displayed prominently not the same pair who had been there when she woke but they were not present by happenstance they were not precisely guards and then again they were not precisely not guards she did not curtsy to these either they watched her without expression before she had taken more than half a dozen steps along the redandgreen floor tiles she heard a womans pained howling start up behind her hardly muffled at all by the heavy door to silvianas study so alviarin was taking a penance and not doing well to be shrieking at the top of her lungs so soon unless she also was trying to embrace pain which seemed unlikely egwene wished she knew why alviarin was undergoing penance if it was an imposed penance a general had scouts and eyesandears to inform him on his enemy she had only her own eyes and her own ears and what little she could learn in the unseen world any scrap of knowledge might prove useful though so she must dig for every one possible breakfast or no breakfast she returned to her tiny room in the novice quarters long enough to wash her face in cool water at the washstand and comb her hair that comb which had been in her belt pouch was among the few personal belongings she retained in the night the clothes she had been wearing when captured vanished replaced by novice white but the dresses and shifts that hung from pegs on the white wall truly were hers stored away when she was raised accepted they still carried small tags stitched with her name sewn into their hems the tower was never wasteful you never knew when a new girl would fit an old set of clothes but having nothing to wear save novice white did not make her a novice whatever elaida and the others believed not until she was sure that her face was no longer red and she looked as collected as she felt did she leave when you had few weapons your appearance could be one the same two reds were waiting on the railed gallery to shadow her the dining hall where novices ate lay on the lowest level of the tower to one side of the main kitchen it was a large whitewalled chamber plain though the floor tiles showed all the ajah colors and filled with tables each of which could accommodate six or eight women on small benches a hundred or more whiteclad women were sitting at those tables chattering away over breakfast elaida must be very set up over their number the tower had not held so many novices in years doubtless even news of the tower breaking had been enough to put the thought of going to tar valon into some heads egwene was not impressed these women filled barely half the dining hall if that and there was another like it one floor up closed now for centuries once she gained the tower that second kitchen would be opened again and the novices still would need to eat by shifts something unknown since well before the trolloc wars nicola caught sight of her as soon as she walked inthe woman appeared to have been watching for herand nudged the novices to either side silence slid across the tables in a wave and every head turned as egwene glided down the central aisle she looked neither to left nor right halfway to the kitchen door a short slim novice with long dark hair suddenly stuck out a foot and tripped her catching her balance just short of falling on her face she turned coolly another skirmish the young woman had the pale look of a cairhienin this close egwene could be sure that she would be tested for accepted unless she had other failings but the tower was good at rooting out such things what is your name she said alvistere the young woman replied her accent confirming her face why do you want to know so you can carry tales to silviana it will do you no good everyone will say they saw nothing a pity that alvistere you want to become aes sedai and give up the ability to lie yet you want others to lie for you do you see any inconsistency in that alvisteres face reddened who are you to lecture me i am the amyrlin seat a prisoner but still the amyrlin seat alvisteres big eyes widened and whispers buzzed through the room as egwene walked on to the kitchen they had not believed she would still claim the title while garbed in white and sleeping among them as well to disabuse them of that notion quickly the kitchen was a large highceilinged room with graytiled floors where the roasting spits in the long stone fireplace were still but the iron stoves and ovens radiated enough heat that she would have begun perspiring immediately had she not known how to ignore it she had labored in this kitchen often enough and it seemed certain she would again dining halls surrounded it on three sides for the accepted and for aes sedai as well as novices laras the mistress of the kitchens was waddling about sweatyfaced in a spotless white apron that could have made three novice dresses waving her long wooden spoon like a scepter as she directed cooks and undercooks and scullions who scurried for her as fast as they would have for any queen perhaps faster a queen would be unlikely to give anyone a smack with her scepter for moving too slowly a great deal of the food seemed to be going onto trays sometimes worked silver sometimes carved wood and perhaps gilded that women carried away through the door to the sisters main dining hall not kitchen serving women with the white flame of tar valon on their bosoms but dignified women in wellcut woolens with an occasional touch of embroidery sisters personal servants who would make the long climb back to the ajah quarters any aes sedai could eat in her own rooms if she wished though it meant channeling to warm the food again yet most enjoyed company at meals at least they had that steady stream of women carrying out clothcovered trays was a confirmation that the white tower was spiderwebbed with cracks she should have felt pleasure at that elaida stood on a platform that was ready to crumble beneath her but the tower was home all she felt was sadness and anger at elaida too that one deserved to be pulled down simply for what she had done to the tower since gaining the stole and staff laras gave her one long look drawing in her chin until she had a fourth then returned to brandishing her spoon and looking over an undercooks shoulder the woman had helped siuan and leane escape once so her loyalties to elaida were weak would she help another now she was certainly making every effort to avoid looking in egwenes direction again another undercook who likely did not know her from any other novice a smiling woman still working on her second chin handed her a wooden tray with a large stout cup of steaming tea and a thick whiteglazed plate of bread olives and crumbly white cheese that she carried back into the dining hall silence fell again and once more every eye centered on her of course they knew she had been summoned to the mistress of novices they were waiting to see whether she would eat standing she wanted very much to ease herself onto the hard wooden bench but she made herself sit down normally which reignited the flames of course not as strongly as before yet strong enough to make her shift before she could stop herself strangely she felt no real desire to grimace or squirm to stand yes but not the other the pain was part of her she accepted it without struggle she tried to welcome it yet that still seemed beyond her she tore a piece of breadthere were weevils in the flour here too it appearedand slowly the conversation in the room started up again quietly because novices were expected not to make too much noise at her table also the talk resumed though no one made any effort to include her that was just as well she was not here to make friends among the novices nor to have them see her as one of themselves no her purpose was far different leaving the hall with the novices after returning her tray to the kitchen she found another pair of reds waiting for her one was katerine alruddin vulpine in copiously redslashed gray a mass of raven hair falling in waves to her waist and her shawl looped over her elbows drink this katerine said imperiously extending a pewter cup in one slim hand all of it mind the other red dark and squarefaced adjusted her shawl impatiently and grimaced apparently she disliked acting as a serving woman even by association or perhaps it was dislike for what was in the cup suppressing a sigh egwene drank the weak forkroot tea looked and tasted like water tinged a faint brown with just a hint of mint almost a memory of mint rather than the taste itself her first cup had been soon after waking the red sisters on duty eager to be done with shielding and about their own business katerine had let the hour slip a little yet even without this cup she doubted she would have been able to channel very strongly for some time yet certainly not with enough strength to be useful i dont want to be late for my first class she said handing the cup back katerine took it though she seemed surprised to realize that she had egwene glided on after the novices before the sister could object or remember to call her down for failing to curtsy that first class in a plain windowless room where ten novices occupied benches for thirty or more was every bit the disaster she expected not a disaster for her however no matter the outcome the instructor was idrelle menford a lanky hardeyed woman who had already been accepted when egwene first came to the tower she still wore the white dress with the seven bands of color at hem and cuffs egwene took a seat at the end of a bench once again without consideration for her tenderness that had lessened though not very far drink in the pain standing on a small dais ac the front of the room idrelle looked down her long nose with more than a spark of satisfaction at seeing egwene in white once more it almost softened her frown a fixture with idrelle you have all gone beyond making simple balls of fire she told the class but lets see what our new girl is capable of she used to think a great deal of herself you know several of the novices tittered make a ball of fire egwene go on child a ball of fire that was one of the earliest things novices learned what was she about opening herself to the source egwene embraced saidar let it rush into her the forkroot allowed only a trickle a thread where she was accustomed to torrents yet it was the power and trickle or no it brought all of the life and joy of saidar all the heightened awareness of herself and the room around her awareness of herself meant her smarting bottom suddenly felt freshly slippered again but she did not shift breathe in the pain she could smell the faint aroma of soap from the novices morning wash see a tiny vein pulsing on idrelles forehead part of her wanted to clout the womans ear with a flow of air but given the amount of the power she commanded now idrelle would barely feel it instead she channeled fire and air to produce a small ball of green fire that floated in front of her a pale pitiful thing it was actually transparent very good idrelle said sarcastically all yes she had just wanted to begin by showing the novices how weak egwenes channeling was release saidar now class egwene added a blue ball then a brown and a gray making them spin around one another release the source idrelle said brusquely a yellow ball joined the others a white and finally a red ball quickly she added rings of fire one inside the other around the whirling balls red came first this time because she wanted it smallest green last and largest had she been able to choose an ajah it would have been the green seven rings of fire rotated no two in the same direction around seven balls of fire that carried out an intricate dance at the heart pale and thin they might be yet it was an impressive display beyond dividing her flows fourteen ways juggling with the power was not all that much easier than juggling with your hands stop that idrelle shouted stop it the glow of saidar enveloped the teacher and a switch of air struck egwene hard across the back i said stop it the switch struck again then again egwene calmly kept the rings spinning the balls dancing after silvianas hardswung slipper it was easy to drink in the pain of idrelles blows if not to welcome it would she ever be able to smile while she was being beaten katerine and the other red appeared in the doorway what is going on in here the ravenhaired sister demanded her companions eyes widened when she saw what egwene was doing it was very unlikely that either of them could divide their flows so far the novices all popped to their feet and curtsied when the aes sedai entered of course egwene remained seated idrelle spread her banded skirts looking flustered she wont stop she wailed i told her to but she wont stop that egwene katerine ordered firmly egwene maintained her weaves until the woman opened her mouth again only then did she release saidar and stand katerines mouth snapped shut and she took a deep breath her face retained its aes sedai serenity but her eyes glittered you will run to silvianas study and tell her that you disobeyed your instructor and disrupted a class go pausing long enough to straighten her skirtswhen she obeyed she must not do so with any appearance of eagerness or hasteegwene squeezed past the two aes sedai and glided up the hallway i told you to run katerine said sharply behind her a flow of air struck her still sensitive bottom accept the pain another blow drink in the pain like breath a third hard enough to stagger her welcome the pain unhand me jezrail katerine snarled ill do no such thing the other sister said with a strong tairen accent you go too far katerine a swat or two is permitted but punishing her further belongs to the mistress of novices light at this rate youll leave her unable to walk before she reaches silviana katerine breathed heavily very well she said at last but she can add disobeying a sister to her list of offenses i will inquire egwene so dont think you can let it slip your mind when she stepped into the mistress of novices study silvianas eyebrows rose in surprise again so soon fetch the slipper from the cabinet child and tell me what youve done now after two more classes and two more visits to silvianas studyshe refused to be made mock of and if an accepted did not want her doing a thing better than the accepted herself could the woman should not ask her to do it at allplus her foreordained midday appointment between the sternfaced woman decided that she was to have healing to begin each day else youll soon be too bruised to spank without bringing blood but dont think this means i am going easy on you if you require healing three times a day ill just spank all the harder to make up if need be ill go to the strap or the switch because i will make your head straight child believe me on that those three classes leaving three very embarrassed accepted had another result her teaching was shifted to sessions alone with aes sedai something normally reserved for accepted that meant climbing the long tapestrylined spiraling corridors to the ajah quarters where sisters stood at the entrances like guards they were guards in truth visitots from other ajahs were unwelcome to say the least in fact she never saw any aes sedai near the quarters of another ajah except for sitters she seldom saw sisters in the hallways outside the quarters other than in groups always wearing their shawls usually with warders following close behind but this was not like the fear that gripped the encampment outside the walls here it was always sisters of the same ajah together and when two groups passed they cut each other dead if they did not glare in the worst of summer the tower remained cool yet the air seemed feverish and gelid when sisters of different ajahs came too close even the sitters she recognized walked quickly the few who realized who she was gave her long studying looks but most appeared distracted pevara tazanovni a plumply pretty sitter for the red almost walked into her one dayshe was not going to jump aside even for sittersbut pevara hurried on as if she had not noticed another time doesine alwain boyishly slim if elegantly dressed did the same while deep in conversation with another yellow sister neither glanced at her twice she wished she had some idea who the other yellow was she knew the names of the ten ferrets sheriam and the others had sent into the tower to try undermining elaida and she very much would have liked to make contact with them but she did not know their faces and asking after them would only draw attention to them she hoped one of them would pull her aside or hand her a note but none did her battle would have to be fought alone except for leane unless she overheard something that put faces to some of those names she did not neglect leane of course her second night back in the tower she went down to the open cells after supper despite her bonedeep weariness those halfdozen rooms in the first basement were where women who could channel were held if not to be closely confined each held a large cage of iron latticework that ran from stone floor to stone ceiling with a space around it four paces wide and iron standlamps to provide light at leanes cell two browns were sitting on benches against the wall with a warder a wideshouldered man with a beautiful face and touches of white at his temples he looked up when egwene walked in then returned to honing his dagger on a stone one of the browns was felaana bevaine slender with long yellow hair that gleamed as if she brushed it several times a day she stopped writing in a leatherbound notebook on a lapdesk long enough to say in a raspy voice oh its you is it well silviana said you can visit child but dont give her anything without showing it to dalevien or me and dont make any fuss she promptly returned to her writing dalevien a stocky woman with gray streaking her short dark hair never looked up from her comparison of the text of two books one held open on either knee the glow oi saidar shone around her and she was maintaining a shield on leane but there was no reason for her to look once it had been woven egwene lost no time in rushing to thrust her hands through the iron lattice and clasp leanes silviana told me they finally believe who you are she said laughing but i didnt expect to find you in such luxury it was luxury only when held up alongside the small dark cells where a sister might be held for trial with rushes on the floor for a mattress and a blanket only if you were lucky yet leanes accommodations did appear reasonably comfortable she had a small bed that looked softer than those in the novice quarters a ladderback chair with a tasseled blue cushion and a table that held three books and a tray with the remains of her supper there was even a washstand though the white pitcher and bowl both had chips and the mirror was bubbled and a privacy screen opaque enough that she would be only a shadowy shape behind it hid the chamber pot leane laughed too oh i am very popular she said briskly even the way she stood seemed languorous the very image of a seductive domani despite plain dark woolens but that brisk voice remained from before she had decided to remake herself as she wanted to be ive had a steady stream of visitors all day from every ajah except the red even the greens try to convince me to teach them how to travel and they mainly want to get their hands on me because i claim to be green now she shivered much too ostentatiously for it to be real that would be as bad as being back with melare and desala dreadful woman desala her smile faded away like mist in a noonday sun they told me theyd put you in white better than the alternatives i suppose they give you forkroot me too surprised egwene glanced toward the sister holding the shield and leane snorted custom if i werent shielded i could swat a fly and not hurt it but custom says a woman in the open cells is always shielded but they just let you wander around otherwise not exactly egwene said dryly there are two reds waiting outside to escort me to my room and shield me while i sleep leane sighed so im in a cell you are being watched and were both full of forkroot tea she cast a sidelong look at the two browns felaana was still intent on her writing dalevien turned pages in the two books on her knees and began muttering under her breath the warder must have intended to shave with that dagger he was honing it so keen his main attention seemed to be on the doorway though leane lowered her voice so when do we escape we dont egwene told her and related her reasons and her plan in a near whisper while watching the sisters out of the corner of her eye she told leane everything she had seen and done it was hard to tell how many times she had been spanked that day and how she had behaved during but necessary to convince the other woman that she would not be broken i can see any sort of raid is out of the question but i had hoped the warder shifted and leane cut off but he was merely sheathing his dagger folding his arms across his chest and stretching his legs out he leaned back against the wall his eyes on the doorway he looked as if he could be on his feet in the blink of an eye laras helped me escape once she went on softly but i dont know that she would do it again she shivered and there was nothing fake about it this time she had been stilled when laras helped her and siuan escape she did it for min more than for siuan or me anyway are you certain about this a hard woman silviana brehon fair so i hear but hard enough to break iron are you absolutely certain mother when egwene said that she was leane sighed again well well be two worms gnawing at the root then wont we it was not a question she visited leane every night that exhaustion failed to drag her to her bed straight after supper and found her astonishingly sanguine for a prisoner confined to a cell leanes stream of visiting sisters was continuing and she slipped the tidbits egwene suggested into every conversation those visitors could not order an aes sedai punished even one held in the open cells though a few grew angry enough to wish they could and besides hearing those things from a sister carried more weight than hearing them from one they saw as a novice leane could even argue openly at least until the visitors stalked out but she reported that many did not a few agreed with her cautiously hesitantly perhaps on one point and not others but they agreed almost as important to leane at least some of the greens decided that since she had been stilled and thus was no longer aes sedai for a time she had the right to ask admission to any ajah once she was a sister again not all by any means but few was better than none egwene began to think that leane in her cell was having more effect than she was roaming free well free after a fashion she was not exactly jealous this was important work they were doing and it did not matter which of them did it better so long as it got done but there were times when it made the trek to silvianas study much harder still she had successes of a sort that first afternoon in bennae nalsads cluttered sitting room books stood in haphazard stacks everywhere on the floor tiles and the shelves were full of bones and skulls and the preserved skins of animals birds and snakes along with stuffed examples of some of the smaller specimens a large brown lizard was perched on the huge skull of a bear so still you would have thought it stuffed as well until it blinkedthat first afternoon the shienaran brown asked her to perform an exhaustive set of weaves one after the other bennae sat in a highbacked chair on one side of the brownstreaked marble fireplace egwene with decided discomfort in one on the other she had not been invited to sit but neither had bennae objected egwene performed each weave as asked until bennae casually asked for the weave for traveling and then she merely smiled and folded her hands in her lap the sister leaned back and adjusted her deep brown silk skirts a hair bennaes eyes were blue and sharp her dark hair caught in a silver net liberally streaked with gray ink stains marked two of her fingers and another smudged the side of her nose she held a porcelain cup of tea but she had not offered any to egwene i think there is little of the power that remains for you to learn child especially considering your wonderful discoveries egwene inclined her head accepting the compliment some of those things truly were her discoveries and it hardly mattered now in any case but that hardly means you have nothing to learn you had few novice classes before you were the brown frowned at egwenes white dress and cleared her throat and fewer lessons as well later tell me if you can what mistakes did shein chunla make that caused the third war of garens wall what were the causes of the great winter war between andor and cairhien what caused the weikin rebellion and how did it end most of history seems to be the study of wars and the important parts of that are how and why they began and how and why ended a great many wars would never have taken place if people had paid attention to the mistakes others had made well shein didnt make any mistakes egwene said slowly but youre right i do have a lot to learn i dont even know the names of those other wars rising she poured herself a cup of tea from the silver pitcher on the side table aside from the ropework silver tray the tabletop held a stuffed lynx and the skull of a serpent that was as big as a mans skull bennae frowned but not for the tea she hardly seemed to notice that what do you mean shein didnt make any mistakes child why she bungled the situation as badly as ever ive heard of well before the third war of garens wall egwene said returning to her chair shein was doing exactly as the hall told her and nothing they didnt she might be lacking in other areas of history but siuan had tutored her thoroughly in the mistakes made by other amyrlins and this particular question gave her an opening sitting down normally took a great effort what are you talking about she tried running the tower with an iron hand never a compromise on anything running roughshod over any opposition the hall grew tired of it but they couldnt settle on a replacement so rather than deposing her they did worse they left her in place and forced a penance on her whenever she tried to issue an order of any kind any kind at all she knew she was going on sounding as if she were the one giving a lecture but she had to get it all out not easing herself on the hard wood of the chair seat was difficult welcome the pain the hall ran shein and the tower but they mishandled a great deal themselves largely because each ajah had its own goals and there was no hand to shape them into a goal for the tower sheins reign was marked by wars all over the map eventually the sisters themselves got tired of the halls bungling in one of the six mutinies in tower history shein and the hall were pulled down i know she supposedly died in the tower of natural causes but in fact she was smothered in her bed in exile fiftyone years later after the discovery of a plot to put her back on the amyrlin seat mutinies bennae said incredulously six of them exiled and smothered its all recorded in the secret histories in the thirteenth deposi tory though i suppose i shouldnt have told you that egwene took a sip of tea and grimaced it was all but rancid no wonder bennae had not touched hers secret histories a thirteenth depository if such a thing existed and i think i would know why should you not have told me because by law the existence of the secret histories as well as their contents can be known only to the amyrlin the keeper and the sitters them and the librarians who keep the records anyway even the law itself is part of the thirteenth depository so i guess i shouldnt have told that either but if you can gain access somehow or ask someone who knows and will tell you youll find out im right six times in the history of the tower when the amyrlin was dangerously divisive or dangerously incompetent and the hall failed to act sisters have risen up to remove her there she could not have planted the seed deeper with a shovel or driven it home more bluntly with a hammer bennae stared at her for a long moment then raised the cup to her lips she spluttered as soon as the tea touched her tongue and began dabbing at the spots on her dress with a delicate laceedged handkerchief the great winter war she said huskily as she set the cup on the floor beside her chair began late in the year six hundred seventyone she did not mention secret records or mutinies again but she did not have to more than once during the lesson she trailed off frowning at something beyond egwene and egwene had little doubt what it was later that day lirene doirellin said yes elaida made a vital mistake there pacing up and down in front of her sitting rooms fireplace the cairhienin sister was only a little shorter than egwene but the nervous way her eyes darted gave her the air of a hunted thing a sparrow fearful of cats and convinced there were lots of cats in the vicinity her dark green skirts had only four discreet slashes of red though she had been a sitter once that proclamation of hers on top of trying to kidnap him could not have been better calculated to keep the althor boy as far from the tower as he can stay oh she has made mistakes elaida has egwene wanted to ask about rand and the kidnapping kidnappingbut lirene left no opening as she went on about elaidas many mistakes all the while pacing back and forth her eyes darting and her hands twisting unconsciously egwene was unsure whether or not that session could be called a success but at least it was not a failure and she had learned something not all of her forays went so well of course this is not a discussion pritalle nerbaijan said her tone was utterly calm yet her tilted green eyes were heated her rooms looked more those of a green than a yellow with several bared swords hanging on the walls and a silk tapestry showing men fighting trollocs she was gripping the hilt of the dagger at her woven silver belt not a simple belt knife a dagger with a blade near a foot long and an emerald capping its pommel why she had agreed to lecture egvvene was a mystery given her dislike of teaching perhaps because it was egwene you are here for a lesson on the limits of power a very basic lesson suitable for a novice egwene wanted to shift on the threelegged stool that pritalle had given her for a seat but instead she concentrated on the smarting focused on drinking it in on welcoming it the day had already seen three visits to silviana and she could sense a fourth coming with the midday meal an hour off yet i merely said that if shemerin could be reduced from aes sedai to accepted then elaidas power has no limits at least she thinks it doesnt but if you accept that then it really doesnt pritalles grip tightened on the daggers hilt until her knuckles showed white yet she seemed unaware since you think you know better than i she said coolly you can visit silviana when we finish a partial success perhaps egwene did not think pritalles anger was for her i expect proper behavior out of you serancha colvine told her firmly another day the word to describe the gray sister was pinched a pinched mouth and a pinched nose that constantly seemed to be detecting a bad smell even her pale blue eyes seemed pinched with disapproval she might well have been pretty otherwise do you understand i understand egwene said sitting down on the stool that had been placed in front of seranchas highbacked chair the morning was cool and a small fire burned on the stone hearth drink in the pain welcome the pain an incorrect response serancha said the correct response would have been a curtsy and i understand serancha sedai i intend to make a list of your failures for you to carry to silviana when were done well begin again do you understand child i understand egwene said without rising aes sedai serenity or no aes sedai serenity seranchas face turned purple in the end her list covered four pages in a tight cramped hand she spent more time writing than she did lecturing not a success and then there was adelorna bastine the saldaean green somehow managed stateliness in spite of being slim and no taller than egwene and she had a regal commanding air that might have been intimidating had egwene let it i hear you make trouble she said picking up an ivorybacked hairbrush from a small inlaid table beside her chair if you try to make trouble with me youll learn that i know how to use this egwene did learn without trying three times she went across adelornas lap and the woman did indeed know how to use a hairbrush for more than brushing her hair that managed to stretch an hour lecture to two may i go now egwene said at last calmly drying her cheeks as well as she could with a handkerchief that was already damp breathe in the pain absorb the fire im supposed to fetch water up for the red and i dont want to be late adelorna frowned at her hairbrush before returning it to the table that egwene had overset twice with her kicking then she frowned at egwene studying her as if trying to see inside her skull i wish cadsuane were in the tower she murmured i think shed find you a challenge there seemed a touch of respect in her voice that day was a turning point in some ways for one thing silviana decided that egwene was to receive healing twice each day you seem to invite being beaten child its pure stubbornness and i wont put up with it you will face reality the next time you visit me well see how you like the strap the mistress of novices folded egwenes shift over her back then paused are you smiling did i say something amusing i just thought of something funny egwene said nothing of consequence not of consequence to silviana anyway she had realized how to welcome the pain she was fighting a war not a single battle and every time she was beaten every time she was sent to silviana it was a sign that she had fought another battle and refused to yield the pain was a badge of honor she howled and kicked as hard as ever during that slippering but while she was drying her cheeks afterward she hummed quietly to herself it was easy to welcome a badge of honor attitudes among the novices began to shift by the second day of her captivity it seemed that nicolaand areina who was working in the stables and often came to visit nicola they seemed so close that egwene wondered whether they had become pillowfriends always with their heads together and smiling mysterious smiles nicola and areina had regaled them all with tales of her very inflated tales the two women had made her seem a combination of every legendary sister in the histories along with birgitte silverbow and amaresu herself carrying the sword of the sun into battle half of them seemed in awe of her the others angry with her for some reason or outright scornful foolishly some tried to emulate her behavior in their classes but a flurry of visits to silviana quelled that at the midday meal of the third day nearly two dozen novices ate standing up and redfaced with embarrassment nicola among them and alvistere surprisingly that number dropped to seven at supper and on the fourth day only nicola and the cairhienin girl did so and that was the end of that she expected some might resent the fact that she continued to refuse to bend while they had been put back on the straight and narrow so quickly but to the contrary it only seemed to decrease the number who were angry or scornful and increase the respect no one tried to become her friend which was just as well white dress or no white dress she was aes sedai and it was improper for an aes sedai to befriend a novice there was too much risk the girl would start feeling above herself and get into trouble for it novices began coming to her for advice for help learning their lessons though only a handful at first but the number grew day by day she was willing to help them learn which was usually just a matter of strengthening a girls confidence or convincing a young woman that caution was wise or taking them patiently through the steps of a weave that was giving trouble novices were forbidden to channel without an aes sedai or accepted present though they nearly always did in secret anyway but she was a sister she refused to help more than one at a time however word of groups would surely leak out and she would not be the only one sent to silviana she would make that trip as often as necessary but she did not want to earn it for others and as for advice with the novices kept strictly clear of men advice was easy though strains between pillowfriends could be as harsh as anything men ever caused one evening returning from yet another session with silviana she overheard nicola talking to two novices who could not have been more than fifteen or sixteen egwene hardly remembered being that young it seemed a lifetime ago marah was a stocky murandian with mischievous blue eyes namene a tall slim domani who giggled incessantly ask the mother nicola said a few of the novices had taken to calling egwene that though never where anyone not wearing white could hear they were foolish but not utter fools shes always willing to give advice namene giggled nervously and wriggled i wouldnt want to bother her besides marah said a lilt in her voice they say she always gives the same advice she does and good advice it is too nicola held up one hand to tick off fingers obey the aes sedai obey the accepted work hard then work harder gliding on toward her room egwene smiled she had been unable to make nicola behave properly while she was openly amyrlin but it seemed she might have succeeded while masquerading as a novice herself remarkable there was one more thing she could do for them comfort them impossible as it seemed at first the interior of the tower sometimes changed people got lost trying to find rooms they had been to dozens of times women were seen walking out of walls or into them often in dresses of oldfashioned cut sometimes in bizarre garb dresses that seemed simply lengths of brightly colored cloth folded around the body embroidered anklelength tabards worn over wide trousers stranger things still light when could any woman have wanted to wear a dress that left her bosom completely exposed egwene was able to discuss it with siuan in telaranrhiod so she knew that these things were signs of the approach of tarmon gaidon an unpleasant thought yet there was nothing to be done about it what was was and it was not as if rand himself was not a herald of the last battle some of the sisters in the tower must have known what it all meant too but wrapped up in their own affairs they made no effort to comfort novices who were weeping with fright egwene did the world is full of strange wonders she told coride a palehaired girl who was sobbing facedown on her bed only a year younger than herself coride was most definitely still a girl despite a year and a half in the tower why be surprised if some of those wonders appear in the white tower what better place she never mentioned the last battle to these girls that was hardly likely to be any comfort but she walked into a wall coride wailed raising her head her face was red and blotchy and her cheeks glistened damply a wall and then none of us could find the classroom and pedra couldnt either and she got cross with us pedra never gets cross she was frightened too ill wager pedra didnt start crying though egwene sat down on the edge of the girls bed and was pleased that she did not wince novice mattresses were not noted for softness the dead cant harm the living coride they cant touch us they dont even seem to see us besides they were initiates of the tower or else servants here this was their home as much as it is ours and as for rooms or hallways not being where theyre supposed to be just remember that the tower is a place of wonders remember that and they wont frighten you it seemed feeble to her but coride wiped her eyes and swore she would never be frightened again unfortunately there were a hundred and two like her not all so easily comforted it was enough to make egwene angrier at the sisters in the tower than she already had been her days were not all lessons and comforting novices and being punished by the mistress of novices though the last did take up an unfortunate amount of each day silviana had been right to doubt that she would have much free time novices were always given chores often it was makework since the tower had well over a thousand serving men and women without counting laborers but physical work helped build character so the tower had always believed plus it helped keep the novices too tired to think of men supposedly she was loaded down with chores beyond what the novices were given though some were assigned by sisters who considered her a runaway others by silviana in the hope that weariness would dull the edge of her rebellion daily alter one meal or another she scrubbed dirty pots with coarse salt and a stiff brush in the workroom off the main kitchen from time to time laras would put her head in but she never spoke and she never used her long spoon even when egwene was massaging the small of her back aching from being headdown in a large kettle rather than scrubbing laras dealt out smacks aplenty to scullions and undercooks who tried to play pranks on egwene as was customary with novices sent to work in the kitchen supposedly that was just because as she announced loudly every time she gave a thwack they had plenty of time to play when they were not supposed to be working but egwene noticed that laras was not so quick when someone goosed one of the true novices or tipped a cup of cold water down the back of her neck it seemed she did have an ally of sorts if she could only figure out how to make use of her she hauled water in buckets hanging from the ends of a pole balanced across her shoulders to the kitchen to the novices quarters to the accepteds quarters all the way up to the ajahs quarters she carried meals to sisters in their rooms raked garden paths pulled weeds ran errands for sisters attended sitters swept floors mopped floors scrubbed floors on her hands and knees and that was only a partial list she never shirked at these tasks and only in part because she would not give anyone an excuse to call her lazy in a way she viewed them as penance for not having prepared properly before turning the harbor chain to cuendillar penances were to be borne with dignity as much dignity as anyone can have while scrubbing a floor anyway besides visiting the accepteds quarters gave her a chance to see how they viewed her there were thirtyone in the tower but at any given time some were teaching novices and others taking lessons of their own so she seldom found more than ten or twelve in their rooms around the ninetiered well surrounding a small garden word of her arrival always spread quickly though and she never lacked an audience at first many of them tried to overwhelm her with orders especially mair a plump blueeyed arafellin and asseil a slim taraboner with pale hair and brown eyes they had been novices when she came to the tower and already jealous of her quick rise to accepted when she left with them every second sentence was fetch that or carry this there for all of them she was the novice who had caused so much difficulty the novice who thought she was the amyrlin seat she carried pails of water till her back ached uncomplaining yet she refused to obey their commands which earned her more visits to the mistress of novices of course as the days passed as her continual trips to silvianas study showed no effect however that flow of commands dwindled and finally ceased even asseil and mair had not really been trying to be mean only to behave as they thought they should in the circumstances and they were at a loss as to what to do with her some of the accepted showed signs of fright at the dead walking and the interior of the tower changing and whenever she saw a bloodless face or teary eyes she would say the same things she told the novices not addressing the woman directly which might have gotten her back up rather than soothing her but as if talking to herself it worked as well with accepted as with novices many gave a start when she began or opened their mouths as though to tell her to be quiet yet none did and she always left a thoughtful expression behind the accepted continued to come out onto the stonerailed galleries when she entered but they watched her in silence as though wondering what she was eventually she would teach them what she was them and the sisters too attending sitters and sisters a woman in white standing quietly in the corner quickly became part of the furniture even when she was notorious if they noticed her they changed their conversation yet she overheard many snippets often of plots to avenge some slight given or wrong done by another ajah oddly most of the sisters seemed to see the other ajahs inside the tower as more their enemies than they did the sisters in the camp outside the city and the sitters were not much better it made her want to slap them true it boded well for relations when the other sisters returned to the tower but still she did pick up other things the unbelievable disaster that had befallen an expedition sent against the black tower some of the sisters seemed not to believe it yet they appeared to be trying to convince themselves it could not have happened more sisters captured after a great battle and somehow forced to swear fealty to rand she had already had inklings of that and she could not like it any more than she did sisters being bonded by ashaman being tawren or the dragon reborn was no excuse no aes sedai had ever before sworn fealty to any man the sisters and sitters argued over who was to blame with rand and the ashaman at the head of the list but one name came up again and again elaida do avriny aroihan they talked of rand too of how to find him before tarmon gaidon they knew it was coming despite their failure to console the novices and accepted and they were desperate to lay hands on him sometimes she risked a comment a mention of shemerin being stripped of the shawl against all custom a suggestion that elaidas edict regarding rand was the best way in the world to make him dig in his heels she offered sympathy for the sisters captured by the ashaman for those taken at dumais wellswith elaidas name dropped inor regretted the neglect that saw garbage rotting in the once pristine streets of tar valon there was no need to mention elaida there they knew who was responsible for tar valon at times those comments earned her still more trips to silvianas study and more chores besides yet surprisingly often they did not she made careful note of the sisters who merely told her to be quiet or better still said nothing some even nodded agreement before they caught themselves some of those chores led to interesting encounters on the morning of her second day she was using a longhandled bamboo rake to fish detritus from the ponds of the water garden there had been a rainstorm the night before and the heavy winds had deposited leaves and grasses in the ponds among the bright green lily pads and budding water irises and even a dead sparrow that she calmly buried in one of the flower beds a pair of reds stood on one of the arching pond bridges leaning on the lacy stone railing and watching her and the fish swirling below them in a flurry of red and gold and white a halfdozen crows burst up out of one of the leatherleafs and silently winged their way north crows the tower grounds were supposed to be warded against crows and ravens the reds did not seem to have noticed she was squatting on her heels beside one of the ponds washing the dirt from her hands after burying that pitiful bird when alviarin appeared her whitefringed shawl wrapped tightly around her as if the morning were still windy rather than bright and fair this was the third time she had seen alviarin and every time she had been alone rather than in company with other whites she had seen clusters of whites in the hallways though was there a clue in that if so she could not imagine to what unless alviarin was being shunned by her own ajah for some reason surely the rot had not gone that deep eyeing the reds alviarin approached egwene along the coarse gravel path that wound among the ponds you have fallen far she said when she was close you must feel it keenly egwene straightened and blotted her hands on her skirt then picked up the rake im not the only one she had had another session with silviana before dawn and when she left the womans study alviarin had been waiting to go in again that was a daily ritual for the white and the talk of the novices quarters with every tongue speculating on the why of it my mother always says dont weep over what cant be mended it seems good advice under the circumstances faint spots of color appeared in alviarins cheeks but you seem to be weeping a good deal endlessly by all reports surely you would escape that if you could egwene caught another oak leaf on the broom and brushed it off into the wooden pail of damp leaves at her feet your loyalty to elaida isnt very strong is it why do you say that alviarin said suspiciously glancing at the two reds who appeared to be paying more mind now to the fish than egwene she stepped closer inviting lowered voices egwene fished at a long strand of grass that had to have come all the way from the plains beyond the river should she mention the letter this woman had written to rand practically promising him the white tower at his feet no that piece of information might prove valuable but it seemed the sort of thing that could only be used once she stripped you of the keepers stole and ordered your penance thats hardly an inducement to loyalty alviarins face remained smooth yet her shoulders relaxed visibly aes sedai seldom showed so much she must feel under phenomenal strain to be so little in control of herself she darted a look at the reds again think on your situation she said in near a whisper if you want an escape from it well you may be able to find one i am content with my situation egwene said simply alviarins eyebrows quirked upward in disbelief but with another glance at the redsone was watching them now rather than the fish she glided away a very fast glide on the verge of breaking into a trot every two or three days she would appear while egwene was doing chores and while she never openly offered help with an escape she used that word frequently and she began to show frustration when egwene refused to rise to her bait bait it was to be sure egwene did not trust the woman perhaps it was that letter surely designed to draw rand to the tower and into elaidas clutches or maybe it was the way she kept waiting for egwene to make the first move to beg possibly likely alviarin would try to set conditions then in any case she had no intention of escaping unless there was no other choice so she always gave the same response i am content with my situation alviarin began grinding her teeth audibly when she heard that on the fourth day she was on her hands and knees scrubbing blueandwhite floor tiles when the boots of three men accompanied by a sister in elaborately redembroidered gray silk passed her a few paces on the boots stopped that be her a mans voice said in the accents of illian she did be pointed out to me i think me i will speak to her shes only another novice mattin stepaneos the sister told him you wanted to walk in the gardens egwene dipped her scrub brush in the bucket of soapy water and began another stretch of tiles fortune stab me cariandre this may be the white tower but i do still be the lawful king of illian and if i want to speak to herwith you for chaperone all very proper and decentthen i will speak with her i did be told she did grow up in the same village with althor one set of boots blacked till they glistened approached egwene only then did she stand the dripping brush in one hand she used the back of the other to brush her hair out of her face she refrained from knuckling the small of her back much as she wanted to mattin stepaneos was stocky and almost entirely bald with a neatly trimmed white beard in the illianer fashion and a heavily creased face his eyes were sharp and angry armor would have suited him better than the green silk coat embroidered with golden bees on the sleeves and lapels just another novice he murmured i think you be mistaken cariandre the plump red her lips compressed left the two serving men with the flame of tar valon on their chests and joined the balding man her disapproving gaze touched egwene briefly before shifting to him shes a muchpunished novice who has a floor to scrub come the gardens should be very pleasant this morning what be pleasant he said do be talking to someone other than aes sedai and only of the red ajah at that since you do manage to keep me from any others on top of which the servants you did give me might as well be mutes and i think me the tower guards do have orders to hold their tongues around me as well he fell silent as two more red sisters approached nesita plump and blue eyed and mean as a snake with the itch nodded companionably to cariandre while barasine handed egwene the by now all too familiar pewter cup the red seemed to have custody of her in a wayat least her watchers and minders were always redsand they seldom let much more than the promised hour pass before someone appeared with the cup of forkroot tea she drained it and handed it back nesita seemed disappointed that she did not protest or refuse but there seemed little point she had once and nesita had helped pour the vile stuff down her throat using a funnel she had ready in her belt pouch that would have been a fine show of dignity in front of martin stepaneos he watched the silent exchange with puzzled interest though cariandre plucked at his sleeve urging him again to his walk in the gardens sisters bring you water when you thirst he asked when barasine and nesita glided away a tea they think will improve my mood she told him you look well mattin stepaneos for a man elaida had kidnapped that tale was the talk of the novices quarters too cariandre hissed and opened her mouth but he spoke up first his jaw tight elaida did save me from murder by althor he said the red nodded approvingly why would you think yourself in danger from him egwene asked the man grunted he did murder morgase in caemlyn and colavaere in cairhien he destroyed half the sun palace killing her i did hear and i did hear of tairen high lords poisoned or stabbed to death in cairhien who can say what other rulers he did murder and destroy the bodies cariandre nodded again smiling you might have thought him a boy reciting his lessons did the woman have no understanding of men he certainly saw it his jaw grew harder still and his hands clenched into fists for a moment colavaere hanged herself egwene said making sure she sounded patient the sun palace was damaged later by someone trying to kill the dragon reborn maybe the forsaken and according to elayne trakand her mother was murdered by rahvin rand has announced his support for her claims to both the lion throne and the sun throne he hasnt killed any of the cairhienin nobles rebelling against him or the high lords in rebellion in fact he named one of them his steward in tear i think that is quite cariandre began pulling her shawl up onto her shoulders but egwene went on right over her any sister could have told you all that if she wanted to if they were speaking to one another think why you see only red sisters have you seen sisters of any two ajahs speaking youve been kidnapped and brought aboard a sinking ship that is more than enough cariandre snapped right atop egwenes last sentence when you finish scrubbing this floor you will run to the mistress of novices and ask her to punish you for shirking and for showing disrespect to an aes sedai egwene met the womans furious gaze calmly i have barely enough time after i finish to get clean before my lesson with kiyoshi could i visit silviana after the lesson cariandre shifted her shawl seemingly taken aback by her calmness that is a problem for you to work out she said at last come mattin stepaneos you have helped this child shirk long enough there was no time to change out of her damp dress or even comb her hair after leaving silvianas study not if she were to have any hope of being on time for kiyoshi without running which she refused to do that made her late and it turned out that the tall slender gray was a stickler for both punctuality and neatness which put her back yelping and kicking under silvianas hardswung strap little more than an hour later quite aside from embracing pain something else helped see her through that the memory of mattin stepaneos thoughtful expression as cariandre led him off down the corridor and how he twice looked back over his shoulder at her she had planted another seed enough seeds planted and perhaps what sprouted from them would splinter those cracks in the platform beneath elaida enough seeds would bring elaida down early on her seventh day of captivity she was carrying water up the tower again to the white ajah quarters this time when she suddenly stopped in her tracks feeling as if she had been punched in her stomach hard two women in grayfringed shawls were walking down the spiraling corridor toward her trailed by a pair of warders one was melavaire someinellin a stout cairhienin in fine gray wool with white flecking her dark hair the other with blue eyes and dark honey hair was beonin so youre the one who betrayed me egwene said angrily a thought occurred to her how could beonin have betrayed her after swearing fealty you must be black ajah melavaire drew herself up as much as she could which was not very far since she was inches shorter than egwene and planted her fists on her ample hips as she opened her mouth to deliver a blast egwene had had one lesson from her and while she was a kindly woman usually when she became angry she could be fearsome beonin laid a hand on the other sisters plump arm let me speak to her alone please melavaire i trust you will speak sharply melavaire said in a stiff voice to even think of making such a charge to even mention some things shaking her head in disgust she retreated a little up the corridor followed by her warder squat and even wider than she a bear of a man though he moved with the expected warder grace beonin gestured and waited until her own warder a lean man with a long scar on his face joined them she adjusted her shawl several times me i betrayed nothing she said quietly i would not have sworn to you except that the hall it would have had me birched if it learned the secrets you knew perhaps more than once even reason enough to swear no i never pretended to love you yet i maintained that oath until you were captured but you are no longer amyrlin yes not as a captive not when there was no hope of rescuing you when you refused rescue and you are a novice once more so that oath it has two reasons to hold no longer the talk of rebellion it was wild talk the rebellion is finished the white tower it will soon be whole again and i will not be sorry to see it so lifting the pole from her shoulders egwene set down the pails of water and folded her arms beneath her breasts she had tried to maintain a calm demeanor since being capturedwell except when she being punishedbut this encounter would have tried a stone you explain yourself at great length she said dryly are you trying to convince yourself it wont do beonin it wont do if the rebellion is finished where is the flood of sisters coming to kneel before elaida and accept her penance light what else have you betrayed everything it seemed likely she had visited elaidas study a number of times in telaranrhiod but the womans correspondence box had always been empty now she knew why sharp spots of red appeared in beonins cheeks i tell you i havebetrayed n she finished with a strangled grunt and put a hand to her throat as if it refused to let the lie leave her tongue that proved she was not black ajah but it proved something more you betrayed the ferrets are they all down in the basement cells beonins eyes flashed up the corridor melavaire was talking with her warder his head bent close to hers squat or not he was taller than she beonins tervail was watching her with a worried expression the distance was too far for any of the three to have overheard but beonin stepped closer and lowered her voice elaida she is having them watched though i think the ajahs they keep what they see to themselves few sisters want to tell elaida any more than they must it was necessary you understand i could hardly return to the tower and keep them secret it would have been discovered eventually then youll have to warn them egwene could not keep her voice clear of her disdain this woman split hairs with a razor she took the thinnest excuse to decide her oath no longer applied and then she betrayed the very women she had helped choose blood and bloody ashes beonin remained silent for a long moment fiddling with her shawl but at last she said surprisingly i have already warned meidani and jennet they were the two grays among the ferrets i have done what i can for them the others they must sink or swim by themselves sisters have been assaulted for simply going too near another ajahs quarters me i will not walk back to my rooms clad only in my shawl and the welts just to try think of it as a penance egwene cut in light sisters assaulted things were even worse than she had thought she had to remind herself that wellmanured ground would help her seeds to grow beonin glanced up the hallway again and tervail took a step toward her before beonin shook her head her face was smooth despite the color staining her cheeks but inside she must have been in turmoil you know i could send you to the mistress of novices yes she said in a tight voice i hear you spend half of each day squealing for her i think you would dislike more visits yes egwene smiled at her not two hours earlier she had managed to smile the moment silvianas strap stopped falling this was much harder and who can say what i might squeal about oaths perhaps the color drained from the other womans cheeks leaving her face bloodless pale no she did not want that getting out you may have convinced yourself i am no longer amyrlin beonin but its time to start convincing yourself that i still am you will warn the others whatever the cost to yourself tell them to stay away from me unless i send word otherwise theyve had more than enough attention drawn to them but from now on youll seek me out every day in case i have instructions for them i have some now quickly she listed the things she wanted them to bring up in conversation shemerin being stripped of the shawl elaidas complicity in the disasters at the black tower and dumais wells all the seeds she had been planting they would not be planted one by one now but broadcast by handfuls me i cannot speak for other ajahs beonin said when she finished but in the gray sisters speak of most of these things often the eyesandears they are busy of late secrets elaida hoped to hold they are coming out i am sure it must be the same in the others perhaps it is not necessary for me to warn them and deliver my instructions beonin egwene lifted the pole back onto her shoulders shifting it to the most comfortable position she could find two or three of the whites would use a hairbrush or slipper on her and send her to silviana if they thought her slow embracing pain even welcoming it did not mean seeking it out unnecessarily remember its a penance ive set you i will do as you say beonin said with obvious reluctance her eyes hardened suddenly but it was not for egwene it would be enjoyable to see elaida pulled down she said in an unpleasant voice before hurrying away to join melavaire that shocking meeting turned into an unexpected victory left egwene feeling very good about the day and no matter that ferane did turn out to think she had been slow the white sitter was plump but she had an arm as strong as silvianas that night she dragged herself down to the open cells after supper despite wanting her bed in the worst way aside from lessons and howling under silvianas strapthe last time just before supper most of the rest of the day had been given to hauling water her back and shoulders ached her arms ached her legs she was swaying on her feet with weariness strangely she had not had one of those wretched headaches since being taken prisoner nor any of those dark dreams that left her disturbed even though she could never remember them but she thought she might be heading for a fine headache tonight that would make telling true dreams difficult and she had had some fine ones lately about rand mat perrin even gawyn though most dreams of him were just that three white sisters she knew in passing were guarding leaner nagora a lean woman with pale hair worn in a roll on her nape who sat very straight to make up for her lack of stature norine lovely with her large liquid eyes but often as vague as any brown and miyasi tall and plump with irongray hair a stern woman who brooked no nonsense and saw nonsense everywhere nagora surrounded by the light of saidar held the shield on leane but they were arguing over some point of logic that egwene could not make out from the little she heard she could not even tell whether there were two sides to the argument or three there were no raised voices no shaken fists and their faces remained smooth aes sedai masks but the coldness in their voices left no doubt that had they not been aes sedai they would have been shouting if not trading blows she might as well not have existed for all the attention they paid her entrance watching the three from the edge of her eye she moved as close to the iron latticework as she could and gripped it with both hands to steady herself light she was tired i saw beonin today she said softly shes here in the tower she claimed her oath to me no longer held because i was no longer the amyrlin seat leane gasped and stepped near enough that she was brushing the iron bars she betrayed us the inherent impossibility of dissimulated structures is a given nagora said firmly her voice was an icy hammer a given she denies it and i believe her egwene whispered but she admitted betraying the ferrets elaida is only having them watched for the moment but i told beonin to warn them and she said she would she said she had already warned meidani and jennet but why would she betray them and then tell them about it and she said she would like to see elaida pulled down why would she flee to elaida if she still wants her brought down she as much as admitted no one else has abandoned our cause im missing something and im too tired to see what it is a yawn that she barely managed to cover with a hand cracked her jaw dissimulated structures are implied by four of the five axioms of sixthorder rationality miyasi said just as firmly strongly implied socalled sixthorder rationality has been discarded as an aberration by anyone with intellect norine put in a touch sharply but dissimulated structures are fundamental to any possibility of understanding what is happening right here in the tower every day reality itself is shifting changing day by day leane glanced at the whites some always thought elaida had spies among us if beonin was one her oath to you would have held her until she could convince herself you were no longer amyrlin but if her reception here wasnt what she expected it might have changed her loyalties beonin was always ambitious if she didnt get her due as she sees matters she spread her hands beonin always expected her due and perhaps a little more logic is always applicable to the real world miyasi said dismissively but only a novice would think the real world can be applied to logic ideals must be first principles not the mundane world nagora snapped her mouth shut with a dark look as if she felt words had been snatched right off her tongue coloring faintly norine rose and glided away from the benches toward egwene the other two followed her with their eyes and she seemed to feel their gazes shifting her shawl uncomfortably first one way than another child you look exhausted go to your bed now egwene wanted nothing more than her bed but she had a question to be answered first only she had to be careful the three whites were all paying attention now leane do the sisters who visit you still ask the same questions i told you to go to your bed norine said sharply she clapped her hands together as if that would somehow make egwene obey yes leane said i see what you mean perhaps there can be a measure of trust a small measure egwene said norine planted her fists on her hips there was little coolness in her face or her voice and no vagueness at all about her since you refuse to go to your bed you can go to the mistress of novices and tell her you disobeyed a sister of course egwene said quickly turning to go she had her answerbeonin had not passed on traveling and that meant she likely had not passed on anything else perhaps there could be a little crustand besides nagora and miyasi were advancing on her the last thing she wanted was to be dragged bodily to silvianas study something miyasi at least was quite capable of she had even stronger arms than ferane on the morning of her ninth day back in the tower before first light doesine herself came to egwenes small room to give her her morning dose of healing outside rain was falling with a dull roar the two reds who had been watching over her sleep gave her her forkroot frowning at doesine and hurried away the yellow sitter snorted in contempt when the door closed behind them she used the old method of healing that made egwene gasp as though doused in an icy pond and left her ravenously eager for breakfast as well as free of the pain in her bottom that actually felt peculiar you could adapt to anything over time and a bruised bottom already seemed normal but the use of the old way the way used every time she had been given healing since being captured reaffirmed that beonin had kept some secrets though how she had managed it was still a mystery beonin herself had only said that most sisters thought the tales of new weaves were merely rumors you dont mean to bloody surrender do you child doesine said while egwene was pulling her dress over her head the womans language was very much at odds with her elegant appearance in goldembroidered blue with sapphires at her ears and in her hair should the amyrlin seat ever surrender egwene asked as her head popped out at the top of her dress she doubled her arms behind her to do up the buttons of whitedyed horn doesine snorted again though not in contempt egwene thought a brave course child still my wager is that silviana will bloody well have you sitting straight and walking right before much longer but she left without calling egwene down for naming herself the amyrlin seat egwene had yet another appointment with the mistress of novices before breakfastshe had not missed a day so farand following a determined effort to undo doesines work in one go her tears ceased as soon as silvianas strap stopped falling when she lifted herself off the end of the writing table where a leather pad was attached just for bending over its surface worn down by who knew how many women and her skirt and shift fell against her fiery skin she felt no urge to flinch she accepted the painful heat welcomed it warmed herself with it as she would have warmed her hands in front of a fireplace on a cold winter morning there seemed a strong resemblance between her bottom and a blazing fireplace right at that moment yet looking into the mirror she saw an unruffled face redcheeked but calm how could shemerin have been reduced to accepted she asked wiping her tears away with her handkerchief ive inquired and theres no provision for it in tower law how often have you been sent to me because of those inquiries silviana asked hanging the splittailed strap in the narrow cabinet alongside the leather paddle and the limber switch id think you would have given over long since im curious how when theres no provision no provision child silviana said gently as if explaining to a child in truth but no prohibition either a loophole that well we wont go into that youd only find a way to get yourself another strapping with it shaking her head she took her seat behind the writing table and rested her hands on the tabletop the problem was that shemerin accepted it other sisters told her to ignore the edict but once she realized pleading wouldnt change the amyrlins mind she moved into the accepteds quarters egwenes stomach growled loudly anxious for breakfast but she was not done she was actually having a conversation with silviana a conversation however odd the topic but why would she run away surely her friends didnt stop trying to talk sense into her some talked sense silviana said dryly others she moved her hands like the pans of a balance scale first one up then the other others tried to force her to see sense they sent her to me nearly as often as you are sent i treated her visits as private penances but she lacked your she stopped abruptly leaning back in her chair and studying egwene over steepled fingers well now you actually have me chatting not prohibited certainly yet hardly proper in these circumstances go on to breakfast she said picking up her pen and opening the silver cap of her ink jar ill mark you down for midday again since i know you have no intention of curtsying the faintest hint of resignation tinged her voice when egwene entered the novices dining hall the first novice to see her stood and suddenly there was a loud scraping of benches on the colorful floor tiles as the others rose too they stood there at their benches in silence as egwene walked down the center aisle toward the kitchen suddenly ashelin a plump pretty girl from altara darted into the kitchen before egwene reached the kitchen door ashelin was back with a tray in her hands that held the usual thick cup of steaming tea and plate of bread olives and cheese egwene reached for the tray but the oliveskinned girl hurried to the nearest table and set it down in front of an empty bench offering a suggestion of a curtsy as she backed away lucky for her neither of egwenes escorts this morning had chosen that moment to peer into the dining hall lucky for all those novices on their feet a cushion rested on the bench in front of egwenes tray a tattered thing that was more patches in different colors than original material but still a cushion egwene picked it up and set it on the end of the table before sitting down welcoming the pain was easy she basked in the warmth of her own fires a soft susurration gusted through the room a collective sigh only when she popped an olive into her mouth did the novices sit she almost spat it out againit was not far short of spoiledbut she was famished after her healing so she spat only the pit into the palm of her hand and deposited it on the plate washing the taste away with a sip of tea there was honey in the tea novices got honey only on special occasions she tried not to smile as she cleaned her plate and clean it she did even picking up crumbs of bread and cheese with a dampened finger not smiling was difficult though first doesinea sitterthen silvianas resignation now this the two sisters were far more important than the novices or the honey but they all indicated the same thing she was winning her war chapter twentyfive attending elaida goldembossed leather folder under her arm tarna kept to the central core of the tower as she climbed toward elaidas apartments although it meant using a seemingly endless series of staircasestwice those stairs were not located where she remembered them but so long as she continued upward she would reach her destinationrather than the gently spiraling corridors on the stairs she met no one but occasional liveried servants who bowed or curtsied before hurrying on about their tasks in either of the spiraling hallways she would have to pass the entrances to the ajah quarters and perhaps encounter other sisters her keepers stole allowed her to enter any ajahs quarters yet she avoided all except the red save when duty called among sisters of the other ajahs she was all too aware that her narrow stole was red all too aware of hot eyes watching her from cold faces they did not unnerve herlittle did she took the shifting interior of the tower in stridebut still she thought matters had not gone so far that anyone would actually attack the keeper yet she took no chances retrieving the situation was going to be a long hard struggle whatever elaida thought and an assault on the keeper might make it irretrievable besides not having to watch over her shoulder allowed her to think on pevaras troubling question one she had not considered before suggesting the bonding of ashaman who in the red actually could be trusted with the task hunting men who could channel led red sisters to look askance at all men and a fair number hated them a surviving brother or father might well escape hatred a favorite cousin or uncle but once they were all gone so was affection and trust and there was another matter of trust bonding any man violated custom strong as law even with tsutamas blessings who might run to elaida when bonding ashaman was broached she had removed three more names from her mental list of possibilities by the time she reached the entrance to elaidas apartments only two floors below the top of the tower after almost two weeks her list of those she could be certain of still contained only a single name and that one was impossible for the task elaida was in her sitting room where the furnishings were all gilt and ivory inlays and the large patterned carpet was one of tears finest creations she was sitting in a lowbacked chair before the marble fireplace sipping wine with meidani seeing the gray was no surprise despite the early hour meidani dined with the amyrlin most nights and visited often during the day by invitation elaida her sixstriped stole wide enough to cover her shoulders was regarding the taller woman over her crystal goblet a darkeyed eagle regarding a mouse with big blue eyes meidani emeralds at her ears and on a wide collar around her slim throat seemed very conscious of that gaze her full lips smiled but they seemed tremulous the hand not holding her goblet moved constantly touching the emerald comb over her left ear patting her hair covering her bosom which was largely exposed by her snug bodice of brocaded silverygray silk her bosom was hardly excessive yet her slenderness made it seem so and she appeared about to pop free of the garment the woman was garbed for a ball or a seduction the morning reports are ready mother tarna said bowing slightly light she felt as if she had intruded on lovers you wont mind leaving us meidani even the smile elaida directed at the yellowhaired woman was predatory of course not mother meidani set her goblet on the small table beside her chair and leaped to her feet offering a curtsy that nearly had her out of her dress of course not she scurried from the room breathing hard her eyes wide when the door closed behind her elaida laughed we were pillowfriends as novices she said rising and i believe she wants to renew the relationship i may let her she might reveal more on the pillows than shes let slip so far which is nothing truth to tell she strode to the nearest window and stood staring down toward where her fantastical palace would rise to overtop the tower itself eventually if sisters could be convinced to work on it again the heavy rain that had begun during the night was still falling and it seemed unlikely she could see anything of that palaces foundations all that had been completed so far help yourself to wine if you wish tarna kept her face smooth with an effort pillowfriends were common among novices and accepted but girlhood things should be left behind with girlhood not all sisters saw it so certainly galina had been quite surprised when tarna refused her advances after gaining the shawl she herself found men far more attractive than women most seemed heavily intimidated by aes sedai to be sure especially if they learned you were red ajah but over the years she had come across a few who were not that seems odd mother she said putting the leather folder down on the side table that held an ornately wrought golden tray bearing a crystal wine pitcher and goblets she appears frightened of you filling a goblet she sniffed the wine before sipping the keepings seemed to be working for now elaida had finally agreed that that weave at least must be shared almost as if she knew that you know about her being a spy of course shes afraid of me sarcasm dripped heavily from elaidas voice but then hardened to stone i want her afraid i intend to put her through the mangle by the time i have her birched shell tie herself to the birching frame if i order it if she knew i knew tarna shed be fleeing instead of delivering herself into my hands still staring out into the rainstorm elaida sipped at her wine have you any news of the others no mother if i could inform the sitters of why theyre to be watched no elaida snapped spinning to face her her dress was such a mass of intricate red scrollwork that the embroidery all but hid the gray silk beneath tarna had suggested that less flaunting of her former ajahshe had phrased it more diplomatically but that was what she meantmight help bring the ajahs together again yet elaidas eruption of fury had been sufficient to keep her quiet on the topic since what if some of the sitters are working with them i wouldnt put it past them those ridiculous talks continue at the bridge despite my orders no i wouldnt put it past them at all tarna inclined her head over her goblet accepting what she could not change elaida refused to see that if the ajahs disobeyed her order to break off the talks they were unlikely to spy on their own sisters at her command without knowing why saying so would only result in another tirade though elaida stared at her as if to make sure she was not going to argue the woman seemed harder than ever and more brittle a pity the rebellion in tarabon failed she said at last theres nothing to be done about it i suppose but she mentioned it frequently at odd moments since word came that the seanchan were reasserting their grip on that country she was not so resigned as she pretended i want to hear some good news tarna is there any word of the seals on the dark ones prison we must make sure no more get broken as if tarna did not know that not that the ajahs have reported mother and i dont think they would hold that back she wished she had those last words back as soon as they were spoken elaida grunted the ajahs released only trickles of what their eyesandears told them and she resented that bitterly her own eyesandears were concentrated in andor how is the work coming at the harbors slowly mother with the flow of trade stifled the city was already feeling hunger it would begin starving soon unless the harbor mouths were cleared even cutting away the portion of the southharbor chain that was still iron had proved not enough to allow sufficient ships in to feed tar valon once tarna was able to convince her of the necessity elaida had ordered the chain towers dismantled so those huge pieces of cuendillar could be removed like the city walls however the towers had been built and strengthened with the power and only the power could disassemble them it was far from easy the original builders had done good work and those wards seemed not to have weakened a hair reds are doing most of the work for the time being sisters from other ajahs come now and then but only a few i expect that will change soon though they knew the necessity of the work however much they might resent itno sister could like having to labor in that fashion the reds doing most of it certainly grumbled enoughbut the order had come from elaida and these days that resulted in footdragging elaida breathed heavily then took a long drink she seemed to need it her hand gripped the goblet so hard that tendons stood out on its back she advanced across the patterned silk carpet as if she meant to strike at tarna they defy me again again i will have obedience tarna i will have it write out an order and once i sign and seal it post it in every ajahs quarters she stopped almost nosetonose with tarna her dark eyes glittering like a ravens the sitters of any ajah that fails to send its fair share of sisters to work on the chain towers will take a daily penance from silviana until the matter is rectified daily and the sitters of any ajah that sends sisters to those those talks will do the same write it out for me to sign tarna drew a deep breath penances might work and they might not depending on how set the sitters were and the ajah headsshe did not think things had gone so wrong that they might refuse to accept penance at all that would be an end to elaida for sure perhaps an end to the tower but posting the order publicly not allowing the sitters a scrap to hide behind and maintain their dignity was the wrong way to go about it in truth it might well be the very worst way if i may make a suggestion she began as delicately as she could manage she had never been known for delicacy you may not elaida cut in harshly she took another long drink draining her goblet and glided across the carpet to refill it she drank too much of late tarna had even seen her drunk once how is silviana doing with the alvere girl she said as she poured egwene spends near enough half of every day in silvianas study mother she was careful to keep her tone neutral this was the first time elaida had asked after the young woman since her capture nine days ago so much i want her tamed to the towers harness not broken i doubt she will be broken mother silviana will be careful of that and then there was the girl herself that was not for elaidas ears though tarna had been shouted at more than enough she had learned to avoid subjects that only resulted in shouting advice and suggestions unoffered were no more useless than advice and suggestions untaken and elaida almost never took either egwenes stubborn but i expect she must come around soon the girl had to galina beating tamas block out of her had not expended a tenth of the effort silviana was putting into egwene the girl had to yield to that soon excellent elaida murmured excellent she looked over her shoulder her face a mask of serenity her eyes still glittered though put her name on the roster to attend me in fact have her attend me tonight she can serve supper for meidani and me it will be as you command mother it seemed yet another visit to the mistress of novices was inevitable but no doubt egwene would earn just as many of those if she never came near elaida and now your reports tarna elaida sat down again and crossed her legs replacing her barely touched goblet on the tray tarna took up her folder and sat in the chair meidani had been using the redone wards appear to be keeping rats out of the tower mother for how long was another question she checked those wards herself every day but ravens and crows have been seen in the tower grounds so the wards on the walls must be the midday sun cast dappled light through the leafy branches of the tall trees mostly oak and leatherleaf and sourgum with a smattering of cottonwoods and massive pines apparently there had been a fierce windstorm some years back because fallen timber scattered about here and there but all stretched in the same general direction provided good seating with only a little hatchet work to hack away a few limbs sparse undergrowth allowed a good view in all directions and not far off a small clear stream splashed over mossy stones it would have been a good campsite if mat had not been intent on covering as much ground as he could every day but it did just as well as a place to rest the horses and eat the damona mountains still lay at least three hundred miles to the east and he intended to reach them in a week vanin said he knew a smugglers passpurely by hearsay of course just something he had overheard by chance but he knew right where to find itthat would have them inside murandy two days after that much safer than trying to go north into andor or south toward illian in either direction the distance to safety would be further and the chance of encountering seanchan greater mat gnawed the last scrap of meat from a rabbits hind leg and tossed the bone on the ground balding lopin darted in stroking at his beard in consternation to pick it up and drop it in the pit he and nerim had made in the mulchcovered forest floor though the pit would be dug up by animals within a halfhour after their departure mat moved to wipe his hands on his breeches tuon nibbling at a grouse leg on the other side of the low fire gave him a very direct look her eyebrows raised while the ringers of her free hand wiggled at selucia who had ravaged half a grouse by herself the bosomy woman did not reply but she sniffed loudly meeting tuons gaze he deliberately wiped his hands on his breeches he could have gone over to the stream where the aes sedai were washing their hands but no ones clothing was going to be pristine by the time they reached murandy in any case besides when a woman named you toy all the time it was natural to take any chance to let her know you were nobodys toy she shook her head and waggled her fingers again this time selucia laughed and mat felt his face heat he could imagine two or three things she might have said none of which he would have enjoyed hearing setalle sitting on the end of his log made sure he heard some of them anyway reaching an agreement with the onetime aes sedai had not shifted her attitudes a hair she might have said men are pigs she murmured without lifting her eyes from her embroidery hoop or just that you are her dark gray riding dress had a high neck but she still wore her snug silver necklace with the marriage knife hanging from it she may have said youre a mudfooted country lout with dirt in your ears and hay in your hair or she might have said i think i see the direction youre going he told her through gritted teeth tuon giggled though the next instant her face belonged on an executioner once more cold and stern pulling his silvermounted pipe and goatskin tabac pouch from his coat pocket he thumbed the bowl full and lifted the lid on the box of strikers at his feet it fascinated him the way fire just sprang up spikes of it darting in all directions at first when he scratched the lumpy redandwhite head of a striker down the rough side of the box he waited until the flame burned away from the head before using it to light his pipe pulling the taste and smell of sulphur into his mouth once had been enough for him he dropped the burning stick and ground it firmly under his boot the mulch was still damp from the last rain to fall here but he took no chances with fire in woods in the two rivers men turned out from miles around when the woods caught fire sometimes hundreds of marches burned even so the strikers they should not be wasted aludra said lifting her eyes from the small stones board balanced atop a nearby log thom stroking his long white mustaches continued to contemplate the crosshatched board he rarely lost at stones yet she had managed to win two games from him since they left the show two out of a dozen or more but thorn took care with anyone who could defeat him even once she swept her beaded braids back over her shoulders me i must be in the same place for two days to make more men always find ways to make work for women yes mat puffed away if not contentedly at least with some degree of pleasure women a delight to look at and a delight to be with when they were not finding ways to rub salt into a mans hide it seemed six up and a half dozen down it truly did most of the party had finished eatingthe best part of two grouse and one rabbit were all that remained on the spits over the fire but they would be taken along wrapped in linen the hunting had been good during the mornings ride yet there was no certainty the afternoon would be as profitable and flatbread and beans made a poor meal those who had finished were taking their ease or in the case of the redarms checking the hobbled packhorses better than sixty of them on four leads buying so many in maderin had been expensive but luca had rushed into town to take care of the bargaining himself once he heard about a merchant dead in the street he almostalmost but not quitehad been ready to give them packhorses from the shows animals to be rid of mat after that many of the animals were loaded with aludras paraphernalia and her supplies luca had ended up with the greater part by far of mats gold one way and another mat had slipped a fat purse to petra and clarine too but that was friendship to help them buy their inn a little sooner what remained in his saddlebags was more than enough to see them comfortably to murandy though and all he needed to replenish it was a common room where dice were being tossed leilwin with a curved sword hanging from a broad leather strap that slanted across her chest and domon with a shortsword on one side of his belt and a brassstudded cudgel on the other were chatting with juilin and amathera on yet another log close by leilwinhe had come to accept that that was the only name she would stomachmade a point of showing that she would not avoid tuon or selucia or lower her eyes when they met though she had to steel herself visibly to carry it off juilin had the cuffs of his black coat turned back a sign he felt among friends or at least people he could trust the onetime panarch of tarabon still clutched the thiefcatchers arm tightly but she met leilwins sharp blue eyes with little flinching in fact she often seemed to gaze at the other woman with something approaching awe seated crosslegged on the ground and unmindful of the dampness noal was playing snakes and foxes with olver and spinning wild tales about the lands beyond the aiel waste about some great coastal city that foreigners were not allowed to leave except by ship and the inhabitants were not allowed to leave at all mat wished they would find another game to play every time they brought out that piece of red cloth with its spiderweb of black lines it reminded him of his promise to thorn reminded him the bloody eelfinn were inside his head somehow and maybe the flaming aelfinn too the aes sedai came up from the stream and joline stopped to talk with blaeric and fen bethamin and seta trailing along behind hesitated until a gesture from the green sent them to stand behind the log where teslyn and edesina sat as far apart as they could manage with uncut branches between and began reading small leatherbound books taken from their belt pouches both bethamin and seta stood behind edesina the yellowhaired former suldam had come round in spectacular and painful fashion painful for her and for the sisters when she first hesitantly asked them to teach her too at supper the night before they refused they were only teaching bethamin because she had already channeled seta was too old to become a novice she had not channeled and that was that so she duplicated whatever it was that bethamin had done and had all three leaping about the cookfire and squealing in showers of dancing sparks for as long as she could hold onto the power they agreed to teach her then at least joline and edesina did teslyn still was having none of any suldam former or not all three of them took a hand in switching her though and she had spent the morning continually easing herself in her saddle she still looked afraid of the one power and maybe of the aes sedai but strangely her face somehow seemed content too how to understand that was beyond mat he should have felt content himself he had avoided a charge of murder avoided riding blindly into a seanchan trap that would have killed tuon and left the gholam behind for good this time it would be following lucas show and luca had been warned for whatever good that would do in well under two weeks he would be over the mountains into murandy the need to figure out how to get tuon back to ebou dar safely no easy task at all now especially since he would have to guard against aes sedai trying to spirit her away would mean that much longer to look at her face and to try puzzling out what went on behind those big beautiful eyes he should have been as happy as a goat in a corn crib he was far from it for one thing all those swordcuts he had received in maderin hurt some of them were inflamed though he had managed to keep that from anyone so far he hated being fussed over nearly as much as he hated anyone using the power on him lopin and nerim had sewed him up as well as they could and he had refused healing despite attempted bullying by all three aes sedai he had been surprised that joline of all people tried to insist but she did and flung up her hands in disgust when he failed to relent another surprise had been tuon dont be foolish toy she had drawled in his tent standing over him arms folded beneath her breasts while lopin and nerim plied their needles and he gritted his teeth her proprietary air very much a woman making sure her property was repaired properly had been enough to make him grind his teeth never mind the needles or that he was down to his smallclothes she had just walked in and refused to leave short of manhandling and he had felt in no condition to manhandle a woman he suspected might be able to break his arm this healing is a wonderful thing my mylen knows it and i taught it to my others too of course many people are foolish about having the power touch them half my servants would faint at the suggestion and most of the blood too i shouldnt be surprised but i wouldnt have expected it of you if she had a quarter his experience of aes sedai she would have they had ridden off up the road from maderin as if setting out for lugard then taken to the forest as soon as the last farms were out of sight the moment they entered the trees the dice started up in his head again that was the other thing that soured his mood those bloody dice drumming inside his head for two days there hardly seemed any way they could stop here in the forest what kind of momentous event could happen in the woods still he had stayed well clear of the small villages they had passed sooner or later the dice would stop though and he could only wait for it tuon and selucia headed for the stream to wash wiggling their fingers at one another rapidly talking about him he was sure when women started putting their heads together you could be sure amathera screamed and every head whipped around toward her mat spotted the cause as quickly as juilin did a blackscaled snake a good seven feet long wriggling quickly away from the log juilin was seated on leilwin cursed and leaped to her feet drawing her sword but no faster than juilin who tugged his shortsword free of its scabbard and started after the snake so swiftly that his conical red cap fell off let it go juilin mat said its heading away from us let it go the thing probably had a den under that log and had been surprised to come out and find people luckily blacklances were solitary snakes juilin hesitated before deciding that comforting a shivering amathera was more important than chasing a snake what kind is it anyway he said folding her in his arms he was a city man after all mat told him and for a moment he looked as though he meant to go after it again wisely he decided against blacklances were quick as lightning and with a shortsword he would have needed to get close anyway amathera was clinging to him so hard he would have had a time getting free of her taking his hat from the butt of his ashandarei which was driven pointdown into the ground mat settled it on his head daylights wasting he said around his pipestem time we were moving on dont dawdle over there tuon your hands are clean enough he had tried calling her precious but since her claim of victory back in maderin she refused to acknowledge that he had even spoken when he did she did not hurry in the slightest of course by the time she returned drying her small hands on a small piece of toweling that selucia would drape across the pommel of her saddle to dry nerim and lopin had filled in the refuse pit wrapped the remains of the meal and tucked them into nerims saddlebags and doused the fire with water brought from the stream in folding leather buckets ashandarei in hand mat was ready to mount pips a strange man who lets poisonous serpents go tuon said from the fellows reaction i assume a blacklance is poisonous very he told her but snakes dont bite anything they cant eat unless theyre threatened he put a foot in the stirrup you may kiss me toy he gave a start her words not spoken softly had made them the object of every eye selucias face was so stiffly expressionless her disapproval could not have been plainer now he said when we stop tonight we could take a stroll alone by tonight i may have changed my mind toy call it a whim for a man who lets poisonous snakes go maybe she saw one of her omens in that taking off his hat and sticking the black spear back into the ground he took the pipe from between his teeth and planted a chaste kiss on her full lips a first kiss was nothing to be rough with he did nor want her to think him pushy or crude she was no tavern maid to enjoy a bit of slap and tickle besides he could almost feel all those eyes watching someone snickered selucia rolled her eyes tuon folded her arms beneath her breasts and looked up at him through her long eyelashes do i remind you of your sister she asked in a dangerous tone or perhaps your mother somebody laughed more than one somebody in fact grimly mat tapped the dottle from his pipe on the heel of his boot and stuffed the warm pipe into his coat pocket he hung his hat back on the ashandarei if she wanted a real kiss had he really thought she would not fill his arms slim she was to be sure and small but she filled them very nicely indeed he bent his head to hers she was far from the first woman he had kissed he knew what he was about surprisinglyor then again perhaps not so surprisinglyshe did not know she was a quick pupil though very quick when he finally released her she stood there looking up at him and trying to catch her breath for that matter his breath came a little raggedly too metwyn whistled appreciatively mat smiled what would she think of what plainly was her first real kiss ever he tried not to smile too widely though he did not want her to think he was smirking she laid fingers against his cheek i thought so she said in that slow honey drawl youre feverish some of your wounds must be infected mat blinked he gave her a kiss that had to have curled her toes and all she said was that his face was hot he bent his head againthis time she would bloody well need help to stay standingbut she put a hand against his chest lending him off selucia fetch the box of ointments i got irom mistress luca she commanded selucia went scurrying for tuons blackandwhite mount we dont have time for that now mat said ill smear on something tonight he might as well have kept his mouth shut strip off toy she said in the same tone she had used with her maid the ointment will sting but i expect you be brave i am not going to riders coming harnan announced he was already in his saddle on a dark bay gelding with white forefeet holding the lead to one of the strings of packhorses one of thems vanin mat swung up onto pips for a better vantage a pair of horsemen were approaching at a gallop dodging around fallen trees when they had to aside from recognizing chel vanins dun there was no mistaking the man himself nobody else who was that wide and sat his saddle like a sack of suet could have maintained his seat at that pace without any apparent effort the man could have stayed in the saddle on a wild boar then mat recognized the other rider whose cloak was flailing behind him and felt as if he had been punched in the belly he would not have been surprised in the least had the dice stopped then but they kept bouncing off the inside of his skull what in the light was talmanes bloody well doing in altara the two riders slowed to a walk short of mat and vanin reined in to let talmanes approach alone it was not shyness there was nothing shy about vanin he leaned lazily on the tall pommel of his saddle and spat to one side through a gap in his teeth no he knew mat would not be best pleased and he meant to stay clear vanin brought me up to date mat talmanes said short and wiry with the front of his head shaved and powdered the cairhienin had the right to wear stripes of color across his chest in considerable number but a small red hand sewn to the breast of his dark coat was its only decoration unless you counted the long red scarf tied around his left arm he never laughed and seldom smiled but he had his reasons i was sorry to hear about nalesean and the others a good man nalesean they all were yes they were mat said keeping a tight rein on his temper i assume egwene never came to you for help getting away from those fool aes sedai but what in the bloody flaming light are you doing here well maybe he did not have such a tight rein after all at least tell me you havent brought the whole bloody band three hundred bloody miles into altara with you egwene is still the amyrlin the other man said calmly straightening his cloak another red hand larger marked that you were wrong about her mat she really is the amyrlin seat and she has those aes sedai by the scruff of the neck though some of them might not know it yet the last i saw she and the whole lot of them were off to besiege tar valon she might have it by now they can make holes in the air like the one the dragon reborn made to take us near salidar the colors spun in mats head resolving for an instant into rand talking to some woman with gray hair in a bun atop her head an aes sedai he thought but his anger blew the image away like mist all that talk of the amyrlin seat and tar valon attracted the sisters of course they heeled their horses up beside mat and tried to take over well edesina hung back a little the way she did when teslyn or joline had the bit in her teeth but the other two who do you be talking about teslyn demanded while joline was still opening her mouth egwene there did be an accepted named egwene alvere but she be a runaway egwene alvere is the one aes sedai talmanes said politely the man was always polite to aes sedai and she is no runaway she is the amyrlin seat my word on it edesina made a sound that would have been called a squeak coming from anyone but an aes sedai later for that mat muttered joline opened her mouth again angrily later i said that was not enough to stop the slender green but teslyn laid a hand on her arm and murmured something and that was joline still glared daggers though promising to drag out everything she wanted to know later the band talmanes oh no i only brought three banners of horse and four thousand mounted crossbowmen i left three banners of horse and five of foot a little short of crossbows in murandy with orders to move north to andor and the masons banner of course handy to have masons ready to hand if you need a bridge built or the like mat squeezed his eyes shut for a moment six banners of horse and five of foot and a banner of masons the band had only been two banners counting horse and foot when he left them in salidar he wished he had back half the gold he had handed over to luca so freely how am i supposed to pay that many men he demanded i couldnt find enough dice games in a year well as to that i made a small deal with king roedran finished with now and not before timei think he was about ready to turn on us i will explain laterbut the bands coffers hold a years pay and more besides sooner or later the dragon reborn will give you estates and grand ones he has raised men to rule nations so i hear and you grew up with him this time he did not fight the colors as they resolved into rand and the aes sedai it was an aes sedai for sure a hard woman she looked if rand tried to give him any titles he would stuff them down rands bloody throat is what he would do mat cauthon had no liking for nobleswell a few like talmanes were all right and tuon never forget tuonand he certainly had no bloody desire to become one thats as may be was all he said though selucia cleared her throat loudly she and tuon moved their horses up beside mat and tuon was so straight in her mares saddle so cooleyed coldfaced and regal that he expected selucia to start proclaiming her titles she did nothing of the sort instead she shifted on her dun and scowled at him eyes like blue coals in a fire then cleared her throat again very loudly ah tuon mat said allow me to present lord talmanes delovinde of cairhien his family is distinguished and ancient and he has added honors to its name the little woman inclined her head perhaps all of an inch talmanes this is tuon so long as she called him toy she would get no titles from him selucia glared eyes hotter than ever impossible as that seemed talmanes blinked in surprise though and bowed very low in his saddle vanin pulled the sagging brim of his hat lower half hiding his face he still avoided looking directly at mat so it seemed the man had already told talmanes exactly who tuon was growling under his breath mat leaned from the saddle to snatch his hat from the spear and pull up the ashandarei he clapped the hat on his head we were ready to move on talmanes take us to where your men are waiting and well see if we can have as good luck avoiding seanchan on the way out of altara as you had on the way in we saw a good many seanchan talmanes said turning his bay to fall in beside pips though most of the men we saw seemed to be altaran they have camps scattered everywhere it seems luckily we saw none of those flying creatures i have heard tell of but there is a problem mat there was a landslide i lost my rear guard and some of the packhorses the pass is well and truly blocked mat i sent three men to try climbing over with the orders sending the band to andor one broke his neck and another his leg mat stopped pips short im guessing this is the same pass vanin was talking about talmanes nodded and vanin waiting to fall in farther back said bloody right it was passes dont grow on trees not in mountains like the damonas he was no respecter of rank then youll have to find another one mat told him ive heard you can find your way blindfolded at midnight it should be easy for you flattery never hurt besides he had heard that about the man vanin made a sound like he was swallowing his tongue find another pass he muttered find another pass the man says you dont just go find another pass in new mountains like the damonas why do you think i only knew the one he was shaken to admit that much before this he had been adamant that he had only heard of it what are you talking about mat demanded and vanin explained at great length for him an aes sedai explained it to me once you see theres old mountains they was there before the breaking maybe on the bottom of the sea or the like they have passes all over broad and gentle you can ride into those and as long you keep your head and your direction and have enough supplies sooner or later you come out the other side and then theres mountains made during the breaking the fat man turned his head and spat copiously passes in those are narrow twisty things and sometimes they arent really what youd call passes at all ride into one of those and you can wander around till your food runs out trying to find a way to the other side loss of that pass is going to hurt a lot of folks who use it for what you might call untaxed goods and menll die before they find a new one that gets them all the way through we go into the damonas with that pass gone likely well all die too them as doesnt turn back in time and hasnt gotten their heads so turned around they cant find the way back mat looked around at tuon the aes sedai at olver they were all depending on him to get them to safety but his safe route out of altara was not there any more lets ride he said i have to think he had to bloody think for all he was worth chapter twentysix as if the world were fog toy set a fast pace through the forest but tuon rode close behind himwith selucia at her side of courseso she could listen in on him and talmanes her own thoughts interfered with eavesdropping however so he had grown up with the dragon reborn had he the dragon reborn and he had denied knowing anything at all of the man that was one lie of his she had failed to catch and she was good at catching lies in seandar the undetected lie might be the one that killed you or sent you to the sale block as property had she known of his prevarication she might have slapped his face rather than allowing him to kiss her now that had been a shock one she was not sure she had recovered from yet selucia had described being kissed by a man but the actuality made the other womans descriptions pale no she had to listen you left estean in charge toy erupted so loudly that a covey of gray doves burst from cover in the thin undergrowth with a mournful whirring sound the mans a fool not too much of a fool to listen to daerid talmanes replied calmly he did not seem a man to get overly excited he kept a careful watch head swiveling constantly every so often he scanned the sky through the thick branches overhead too he had only heard of raken yet he watched for them his words were even crisper and quicker than toys and difficult to follow these people all spoke so fast carlomin and reimon are not fools matat least reimon is only a fool sometimesbut neither will they listen to a commoner no matter how much more he knows about warfare than they do edorion will but i wanted him with me that red hand symbol talmanes wore was intriguing more than intriguing much more of an old and distinguished house was he but toy was the one he remembered hawkwings face that seemed utterly impossible yet his denial of it had plainly been a lie as plain as the spots on a leopard could the red hand be toys sigil but if so what about his ring she had almost fainted when she first saw that well she had come as close to it as she had since childhood thats going to change talmanes toy growled i let it go on too long as it is if reimon and the others command banners now that makes them bannergenerals and you a lieutenantgeneral daerid commands five banners and that makes him a lieutenantgeneral too reimon and the others will obey his orders or they can go home come tarmon gaidon im not going to have my skull split open because they bloody refuse to listen to somebody who doesnt have bloody estates talmanes turned his horse to ride around a patch of briars and everyone followed the tangled vines seemed to have particularly long thorns and hooked besides they will not like it mat but they will not go home either you know that have you any ideas yet how we are to get out of altara im thinking on it toy muttered im thinking on it those crossbowmen he exhaled heavily that wasnt wise talmanes for one thing theyre used to marching on their own feet half of them will have all they can do to stay in the saddle if were moving fast and were going to have to they can be useful in woods like these or anywhere they have plenty of cover but if were on open ground with no pikes theyll be ridden down before they can loose a second flight in the distance a lion coughed in the distance but it was still enough to make the horses whicker nervously and dance a few steps toy leaned forward on his geldings neck and appeared to whisper in the animals ear it quieted immediately so that had not been another of his fanciful tales after all remarkable i picked men who could ride mat talmanes said once his bay stopped frisking and they all have the new crank a touch of excitement entered his voice now even restrained men tended to warmth over weapons three turns of the crank his hands moved in a quick circle demonstrating and the bowstring is latched with a little training a man can get off seven or eight quarrels in a minute with a heavy crossbow selucia made a small sound in her throat she was right to be startled if talmanes was telling the truth and he had no reason to lie that tuon could find then she had to obtain one of these marvelous cranks somehow with one for a pattern artisans could make more archers could shoot faster than crossbowmen but they took longer to train too there were always more crossbowmen than archers seven toy exclaimed incredulously that would be more than useful but i never heard of such thing ever he muttered that as if it had some special significance then shook his head how did you come by it seven or eight there was a mechanic in murandy who wanted to take a wagonload of things he had invented up to caemlyn there is a school of some sort there for scholars and inventors he needed money for the journey and he was willing to teach the bands armorers to make the things smother your enemy with arrows at every opportunity it is always better to kill your enemies far off than close at hand selucia held her hands up so tuon could see them slim fingers moving quickly what is this band they speak of she used the proper form inferior to superior yet her impatience was almost palpable impatience with everything that was happening tuon kept few secrets from her but some seemed advisable for the present she would not put it past selucia to return her to ebou dar forcibly so she would not be breaking her word a shadows duties were many and sometimes required paying the final sacrifice she did not want to have to order selucias execution she replied in the imperative form toys personal army obviously listen and we may learn more toy commanding an army seemed very odd he was charming at times even witty and amusing but often a buffoon and always a rapscallion he had seemed very much in his element as tylins pet yet he had seemed in his element among the shows performers too and with the marathdamane and the two escaped damane and in the hell that had been such a disappointment not even one fight events later had not compensated for that getting swept up in a street brawl was hardly the same as seeing fights in a hell which admittedly had been far more boring than rumor heard in ebou dar had made it seem toy had displayed an unexpected side of himself in that street brawl a formidable man though with a peculiar weakness for some reason she found that strangely endearing good advice he said absently tugging at the black scarf tied around his neck she wondered about the scar he took such pains to hide that he did was understandable why had he been hanged and how had he survived she could not ask she did not mind lowering his eyes a littlein fact it was enjoyable making him writhe it took so little effortbut she did not want to destroy him at least not for the moment do you not recognize it talmanes said it is from your book king roedran has two copies in his library he has it memorized the man thinks it will make him a great captain he was so pleased with how our bargain worked out that he had a copy printed and bound for me toy gave the other man a mystified look my book the one you told us about mat fog and steel by madoc comadrin oh that book toy shrugged i read it a long time ago tuon gritted her teeth her fingers flashed when will they stop talking of hooks and go back to interesting things perhaps if we listen we may learn more selucia replied tuon glared at her but the woman wore such an innocent look that she could not maintain her scowl she laughedsoftly so as not to let toy realize how close behind him she wasand selucia joined in softly toy had fallen silent though and talmanes seemed content to leave it so they rode in silence save for the sounds of the forest birds singing strange blacktailed squirrels chittering on branches tuon set herself to watching for omens but nothing caught her eye brightfeathered birds darted among the trees once they spotted a herd of perhaps fifty tall lean cattle with very long horns that stuck out almost straight to either side the animals had heard them coming and were squared up facing them a bull tossed his head and pawed at the ground toy and talmanes led the careful way around the herd keeping their distance she looked over her shoulder the redarmswhy were they called that she would have to ask toythe redarms were leading the packhorses but gorderan had raised his crossbow and the others had arrows nocked to their bows so these cattle were dangerous there were few omens concerning cattle and she was relieved when the herd dwindled behind them she had not come all this way to be killed by a cow or to see toy killed by one after a time thom and aludra came up to ride beside her the woman glanced at her once then looked straight ahead the taraboners face framed by those brightly beaded braids was always wooden when she looked at her or selucia so clearly she was one of those who refused to accept the return she was watching toy and she looked satisfied as if something had been confirmed for her perhaps why had toy brought her along surely not for her fireworks those were pretty enough but they could not compare with sky lights performed by even a halftrained damane thom merrilin was much more interesting patently the whitehaired old man was an experienced spy who had sent him to ebou dar the white tower seemed the most obvious candidate he spent little time around the three who called themselves aes sedai but a welltrained spy would not give himself away in that fashion his presence troubled her until the last aes sedai was leashed the white tower was something to be wary of despite everything she still had troubling thoughts at times that somehow toy was part of a white tower plot that was impossible unless some of the aes sedai were omniscient yet the thought sometimes came to her a strange coincidence wouldnt you say master merrilin she said encountering part of toys army in the middle of an altaran forest he stroked his long mustaches with a knuckle failing to mask a small smile hes taveren my lady and you can never tell what will happen around a taveren its always interesting when you travel with one of those mat has a tendency to find what he needs when he needs it sometimes before he knows he needs it she stared at him but he seemed serious hes tied to the pattern that was how the word would translate what is that supposed to mean the old mans blue eyes widened in astonishment you dont know but its said artur hawkwing was the strongest taveren anyone had ever seen perhaps as strong as rand althor id have thought you of all people would well if you dont you dont taveren are people the pattern shapes itself around people who were spun out by the pattern itself to maintain the proper course of the weaving perhaps co correct flaws that were creeping in one of the aes sedai could explain better than i as if she would have conversation with a marathdamane or worse a runaway da mane thank you she told him politely i think ive heard enough taveren ridiculous these people and their endless superstitions a small brown bird surely a finch flew out of a tall oak and circled widdershins three times above toys head before flying on she had found her omen stay close to toy not that she had any intention of doing otherwise she had given her word playing the game as it had to be played and she had never broken her word in her life little more than an hour after setting out as a bird warbled ahead selucia pointed out the first sentry a man with a crossbow up in the thick branches of a spreading oak cupping a hand to his mouth not a bird then more birdcalls heralded their advance and soon they were riding through a tidy encampment there were no tents but the lances were neatly stacked the horses picketed on scattered lines among the trees near to the blankets of the men who would ride them with a saddle or packsaddle at every animals head it would not take long for them to break camp and be on the march their fires were small and gave off little smoke as they rode in men in dull green breastplates with that red hand on their coatsleeves and red scarves tied to their left arms began rising to their feet she saw grizzled faces with scars and fresh young faces all with their eyes on toy and expressions she could only call eager a growing murmur of voices rose rustling through the trees like a breeze its lord mat lord mat is back lord mats found us lord mat tuon exchanged glances with selucia the affection in those voices was unfeigned that was rare and often went with a commander who had a slack hand at discipline but then she expected any army of toys to be a ragtag affair full of men who spent their time drinking and gambling only these men looked no more ragtag than any regiment that had crossed a mountain range and ridden several hundred miles no one looked unsteady on his feet with drink mostly we camp during the day and move at night to avoid being seen by the seanchan talmanes said to toy just because we have seen none of those flying beasts does not mean some might not be around most of the seanchan seem to be farther north or farther south but apparently they have a camp not thirty miles north of here and rumor says there is one of the creatures there you seem pretty well informed toy said studying the soldiers they passed he nodded suddenly as if he had reached a decision he seemed grim and could it be resigned i am that mat i brought half the scouts and i also signed some altarans who were fighting the seanchan well most of them seem to have been stealing horses more than anything else but some were willing to give that up for a chance to really fight them i think i know where most of the seanchan camps are from the malvide narrows south to here suddenly a man began to sing in a deep voice and others joined in the song spreading rapidly therere some delight in ale and wine and some in girls with ankles fine but my delight yes always mine is to dance with jak o the shadoivs every man in the camp was singing now thousands of voices roaring the song well toss the dice however they fall and snuggle the girls be they short or tall then follow lord mat whenever he calls to dance withjak o the shadows they finished with shouts laughing and clapping one another on the shoulder who under the light was this jak o the shadows reining in toy raised the hand holding his odd spear that was all yet silence spread through the soldiers so he was not soft with discipline there were a few other reasons for soldiers to be fond of their officers but the most common seemed unlikely to apply to toy of all people lets not let them know were here until we want them to know toy said loudly he was not orating just making sure his voice carried and the men heard repeating his words over their shoulders to be passed back to men beyond the sound of his voice were a long way from home but i mean to get us home so be ready to move and move fast the band of the red hand can move faster than anybody else and were going to have to prove it there was no cheering but plenty of nods turning to talmanes he said do you have maps the best to be found talmanes replied the band has its own mapmaker now master roidelle already had good maps of everything from the aryth ocean to the spine of the world and since we crossed the damonas he and his assistants have been making new maps of the country we crossed they even marked a map of eastern altara with what we have learned of the seanchan most of those camps are temporary though soldiers heading somewhere else selucia shifted in her saddle and tuon signed patience in high imperative form a command she kept her face smooth but inside she was furious knowing where soldiers were gave clues to where they were going there had be some way to burn that map that would be as important as laying hands on one of the crossbow cranks ill want to talk with master roidelle too toy said soldiers came to take the horses and for a while all seemed confusion and milling about a gaptoothed fellow took akeins reins and tuon gave him explicit instructions on caring for the mare he returned her a sour look along with his bow commoners in these lands seemed to believe themselves equal to everyone selucia gave the same sort of instructions to the lanky young man who took rosebud she thought that an appropriate name for a dressers horse the young man stared at selucias chest until she slapped him hard he only grinned and led the dun away rubbing his cheek tuon sighed that was all very well for selucia but for herself striking a commoner would lower her eyes for months soon enough though she was settled on a folding stool with selucia at her back and stout lopin presented them with tin cups full of dark tea bowing quite properly to selucia as well as to her not deeply enough but the balding man did try her tea was honeyed to perfection lightly but then he had served her often enough to know how she liked it activity bustled about them talmanes had a brief reunion with grayhaired nerim who apparently was his serving man and happy to be reunited with him at least the thin mans normally mournful countenance actually flashed a momentary smile that sort of thing should have been done in private leilwin and domon allowed master charin to lead olver off to explore the camp with juilin and therathom and aludra went too to stretch their legsthen deliberately took stools close by leilwin even went so far as to stare unblinking at tuon for a long moment selucia made a low sound very like a growl but tuon ignored the provocation and gestured mistress anan to bring her stool over beside her eventually the traitors would be punished and the thief the property restored to its rightful owners and the marathdamane leashed but those things had to wait on what was more important three more officers appeared young noblemen with that red hand on their dark silk coats and had their own reunion with toy with a great deal of laughing and hitting each other on the shoulder which they seemed to take as a sign of fondness she soon had them sorted out edorion was the dark lean man with the serious expression except when smiling reimon the broadshouldered fellow who smiled a great deal and carlomin the tall slender one edorion was cleanshaven while reimon and carlomin both had dark beards that were trimmed to points and glistened as if oiled all three made much over the aes sedai bowing deeply they even bowed to bethamin and seta tuon shook her head ive told you often enough its a different world than youre used to mistress anan murmured but you still dont quite believe it do you just because a thing is a certain way tuon replied doesnt mean it should be that way even if it has been for a long time some might say the same of your people my lady some might tuon let it rest there though she usually enjoyed her private conversations with the woman mistress anan argued against leashing marathdamane as might be expected and even against keeping dacovae of all things yet they were discussions rather than arguments and tuon had made her concede a few points she had hopes of bringing the woman around eventually not today though she wanted her mind focused on toy master roidelle appeared a graying roundfaced man whose bulk strained his dark coat followed by six fitappearing younger men each carrying a long cylindrical leather case i brought all the maps of altara i have my lord he told talmanes in a musical accent as he bowed did everyone in these lands speak as if racing to get the words out some cover the whole country they do some no more than a hundred square miles the best are my own of course those i made these past weeks lord mat will tell you what he wants to see talmanes said shall we leave you to it mat but toy was already telling the mapmaker what he wanted the map marked with the seanchan camps in short order it was sorted out from the others in one of the cases and spread on the ground with toy squatting on his heels beside it master roidelle sent one of his assistants running to fetch him a stool he would have burst his coat buttons trying to imitate toy and likely have fallen over besides tuon stared at that map hungrily how to get her hands on it exchanging glances and laughing as if being snubbed were the funniest thing in the world talmanes and the other three men strolled toward tuon the aes sedai gathered around the map on the ground until toy told them to quit peering over his shoulder they moved off a little bethamin and seta heeling them at a distance and began talking quietly among themselves occasionally glancing in his direction if toy had been paying any heed to their expressions especially jolines he might have been worried in spite of the incredible terangreal mistress anan said he carried were about here right he said marking a spot with his finger master roidelle murmured that they were so this is the camp where the raken supposedly is the flying beast another murmur of assent good what kind of camp is it how many men are there reportedly its a supply camp my lord for resupplying patrols the young man returned with another folding stool and the stout man eased himself down with a grunt supposedly about a hundred soldiers mostly altaran and about two hundred laborers but im told there can be as many as five hundred more soldiers at times a careful man master roidelle talmanes made one of those odd bows with one foot forward and the other three mirrored him my lady talmanes said vanin told me of your circumstances and the promises lord mat made i just want to tell you he keeps his word that he does my lady edorion murmured always tuon motioned him to step aside so she could continue to watch toy and he did so with a surprised glance at toy and another for her she gave him a stern look the last thing she wanted was for these men to start imagining things not everything had fallen out as it had to yet there was still a chance this could all go awry is he a lord or is he not she demanded excuse me talmanes said but would you say that again i apologize i must have dirt in my ears she repeated herself carefully but it still took them a minute to puzzle out what she had said burn my soul no reimon said finally with a laugh he stroked his beard except to us lord enough for us he dislikes nobles for the most part carlomin said i count it an honor to be among the few he doesnt dislike an honor reimon agreed edorion contented himself with nodding soldiers master roidelle toy said firmly show me where the soldiers are and more than any few hundred what is he doing tuon said frowning he cant think to sneak this many men out of altara even if he knows where every last soldier is there are always patrols and sweeps by raken again they took their time before answering perhaps she should try speaking very fast weve seen no patrols in better than three hundred miles and norakenno raken edorion said quietly he was studying her too late to stop his imaginings reimon laughed again if i know mat hes planning us a battle the band of the red hand rides to battle again its been too long if you ask me selucia sniffed and so did mistress anan tuon had to agree with them a battle wont get you out of altara she said sharply in that case talmanes said hes planning us a war the other three nodded agreement as if that were the most normal thing under the light reimon even laughed he seemed to think everything was humorous three thousand toy said youre sure sure enough man sure enough will do vanin can locate them if they havent moved too far tuon looked at him squatting there by the map moving his fingers over its surface and suddenly she saw him in a new light a buffoon no a lion stuffed into a horsestall might look like a peculiar joke but a lion on the high plains was something very different toy was loose on the high plains now she felt a chill what sort of man had she entangled herself with after all this time she realized she had hardly a clue the night was cool enough to send a small shiver through perrin whenever the breeze gusted despite his furlined cloak a halo around the fat crescent moon said there would be more rain before long thick clouds drifting across the moon made the pale light dim and strengthen dim and strengthen yet it was enough for his eyes he sat stepper just inside the edge of the trees and watched the cluster of four tall gray stone windmills in a clearing atop the ridge their pale sails gleaming and shadowed by turns as they rotated the machinery of the windmills groaned loudly it seemed doubtful the shaido even knew they should grease the works of the things the stone aqueduct was a dark bar stretching east on high stone arches past abandoned farms and railfenced fieldsthe shaido had planted too early with this much raintoward another ridge and the lake beyond maiden lay one more ridge west he eased the heavy hammer in its loop on his belt maiden and faile in a few hours he would add a fiftyfourth knot to the leather cord in his pocket he cast his mind out are you ready snowy dawn he thought are you close enough yet wolves avoided towns and with shaido hunting parties in the surrounding forest during the day they stayed farther from maiden than usual patience young bull came the reply touched with irritation but then snowy dawn was irascible by nature a scarred male of considerable age for a wolf who had once killed a leopard by himself those old injuries sometimes kept him from sleeping very long at a stretch two days from now you said we will be there now let me try to sleep we must hunt well tomorrow since we cannot hunt the day after they were images and smells rather than words of coursetwo days was the sun crossing the sky twice and hunt a pack trotting with noses into the breeze blended with the scent of deerbut perrins mind converted the images to words even as he saw them in his head patience yes haste spoiled the work but it was hard now that he was so close very hard a form appeared from the dark door at the base of the nearest windmill and waved an aiel spear back and forth overhead the groaning had convinced him the windmills must still be desertedthey had been when the maidens scouted them earlier and no one would put up with that noise any longer than they had tobut he had sent gaul and some of the maidens to be sure one way or another lets go mishima he said gathering his reins its done one way or another how can you make out anything the seanchan muttered he avoided looking at perrin whose golden eyes would be glowing in the night that had made the scarred man jump the first time he saw it he did not smell amused tonight he smelled tense but he called softly over his shoulder bring the carts ahead quickly now quickly and be quiet about it or ill have your ears perrin heeled his dun stallion forward without waiting on the others or the six highwheeled carts liberally greased axles made them as silent as carts could be they still sounded noisy to him the cart horses hooves squelching in the mud the carts themselves creaking as wood flexed and rubbed but he doubted anyone else could have heard them fifty paces off and maybe not closer at the top of the gentle slope he dismounted and let steppers reins fall a trained warhorse the stallion would stand there as if hobbled so long as his reins hung down the windmill heads squealed turning slightly as the breeze shifted the slowly spinning arms were long enough that perrin could have touched one by jumping when it swung low he stared toward the last ridge that hid maiden nothing grew there taller than a bush nothing moved in the darkness just one ridge between him and faile the maidens had come outside to join gaul all of them still veiled there was no one gaul said not quietly this close the grinding of the windmills gears would have swallowed quiet words the dust has not been disturbed since i was here last sulin added perrin scratched his beard just as well had they needed to kill shaido they could have carried away the bodies but the dead would have been missed and it would have drawn attention to the windmills and aqueduct it might have started someone thinking about the water help me get the lids off gaul there was no need for him to do that it would save only minutes but he needed to be doing something gaul simply stuck his spear through the harness holding his bowcase to join the others on his back the aqueduct ran along the ground on the ridgetop between the four windmills and stood shoulderhigh on perrin less on gaul who climbed over just beyond the last pair of windmills bronze handles on either side allowed them to lift off heavy pieces of stone two feet wide and five feet long until they had cleared a stretch of six feet what the opening was used for he did not know there was another like it on the other side maybe to work on the flaps that made sure water flowed only one way or to get inside to repair any leaks he could see small ripples of motion as it streamed toward maiden filling more than half the stone channel mishima joined them and dismounted to stand peering uncertainly at sulin and the maidens he probably believed the night hid his expression he smelled wary now he was followed quickly by the first of the redcoated seanchan soldiers scrambling up the muddy slope each carrying two middlingsized jute sacks middling but not heavy each contained only ten pounds eyeing the aiel suspiciously the wiry woman set her sacks down and slashed one open with her dagger a handful of fine dark grains spilled on the muddy ground do that over the opening perrin said make sure every grain goes into the water the wiry woman looked to mishima who said firmly do as lord perrin commands arrata perrin watched as she emptied the sack into the aqueduct hands lifted over her head the dark grains floated away toward maiden he had dropped a pinch into a cup of water hating to waste even that and they took some time to absorb enough water to sink long enough to reach the big cistern in the town he hoped and if not they could steep in the aqueduct itself the cistern would still turn to forkroot tea eventually the light send it would be strong enough with luck maybe even strong enough to affect the algaidsiswai the wise ones who could channel were his target but he would take any advantage he could gain the light send it did not grow strong faster than he expected if those wise ones began staggering too soon they might puzzle out the cause before he was ready but all he could do was go ahead as if he knew exactly that and pray by the time the second sack was being poured into the stone channel the others began crowding up the slope first came seonid a short woman holding her dark divided skirts up out of the mud shifting his attention from the maidens to her mishima made one of those small gestures to ward off evil strange that they could believe a thing like that worked the soldiers lined up with their sacks stared at her wideeyed for the most part and shifted their feet the seanchan were none too easy about working with aes sedai her warders furen and teryl were at her heels each with a hand resting on his sword hilt they were just as uneasy about the seanchan the one was dark with gray streaking his curly black hair the other fair and young with curled mustaches yet they were alike as two beans tall lean and hard rovair kirklin came a little behind them a compact man with dark receding hair and a glum expression he did not like being separated from masuri all three of the men had small bundles containing food strapped to their backs and fat waterskins hanging from their shoulders a lanky man rested his sacks on the side of the opening as the wiry woman headed downslope to fetch more the carts were piled high with them remember perrin told seonid the biggest danger will be getting from the cistern to the fortress youll have to use the guardwalk on the wall and there might be shaido in the town even at this hour gralina had seemed unsure on that thunder boomed hollowly in the distance then again maybe youll have rain to hide you thank you she said icily her moonshadowed face was a mask of aes sedai serenity but her scent spiked with indignation i would not have known any of that if you had not told me the next moment her expression softened and she laid a hand on his arm i know you are worried about her we will do what can be done her tone was not exactly warmit never wasbut not so chill as before and her scent had mellowed to sympathy teryl lifted her up onto the edge of the aqueductthe seanchan emptying forkroot into the thing a tall fellow with almost as many scars as mishima nearly dropped his sackand she grimaced faintly before swinging her legs over and lowering herself into the water with a small gasp it must have been cold ducking her head she moved out of sight toward maiden furen climbed in after her then teryl and finally rovair they had to bend sharply to fit under the roof of the aqueduct elyas clapped perrin on the shoulder before hoisting himself up should have trimmed my beard short like yours to keep it out of that he said gazing down at the water that graying beard ruffled by the breeze spread across his chest for that matter his hair gathered at the back of his neck with a leather cord hung to his waist he carried a small bundle of food and a waterslcin too still a cold bath helps a man keep his mind off his troubles i thought that was for keeping your mind off women perrin said he was in no mood for joking but he could not expect everyone to be as grim as he was elyas laughed what else causes a mans troubles he disappeared into the water and tallanvor replaced him perrin caught his dark coatsleeve no heroics mind he had been of two minds about letting the man be part of this no heroics my lord tallanvor agreed for the first time in a long time he looked eager the smell of him quivered with eagerness but there was an edge of caution in it too that caution was the only reason he was not back in their camp i wont put maighdin at risk or the lady faile i just want to see maighdin that much quicker perrin nodded and let him go he could understand that part of him wanted to climb into the aqueduct too to see faile again that much quicker but every piece of the work had to be done properly and he had other tasks besides if he were actually inside maiden he was not sure he could restrain himself from trying to find her he could not catch his own scent of course but he doubted there was any caution in it now the windmill heads turned again with loud squeaks as the wind shifted back at least it never seemed to die up here any stoppage of the water flow would be disastrous the ridgetop was becoming crowded now twenty of failes hangerson were waiting their turn at the aqueduct all that remained save the two who were spying on masema the women wore mens coats and breeches and had their hair cut short except for a tail at the back in imitation of the aiel though no aiel would have worn a sword as they did many of the tairen men had shaved their beards because aiel did not wear them behind them fifty two rivers men carried halberds and unstrung bows their bowstrings safely tucked away inside their coats and each with three bristling quivers tied to his back along with a parcel of food every man in the camp had volunteered for this and perrin had had to let them choose lots he had considered doubling the number or more hangerson and two rivers men had their bundles of food and their waterskins the constant flow of seanchan soldiers continued carrying full sacks up the slope and empty sacks back down they were disciplined when a man slipped in the mud and fell as happened with some regularity there was no cursing or even mutters they just got up and went ahead selande darengil wearing a dark coat with six horizontal stripes of color across the chest stopped to offer perrin her hand she only came up to his chest but elyas claimed she handled the sword at her hip credibly perrin no longer thought she and the others were foolswell not all the timein spite of their attempts to copy aiel ways with differences of course the tail of dark hair at selandes nape was tied with a length of dark ribbon there was no fear in her scent only determination thank you for allowing us to be part of this my lord she said in that precise cairhienin accent we will not let you down or the lady faile i know you wont he said shaking her hand there had been a time when she had been pointed about serving faile and not him he shook the hand of every one of them before they climbed into the aqueduct they all smelled determined so did ban alseen who commanded the two rivers men going into maiden when faile and the others come wedge the outer doors shut ban perrin had told him this before but he could not help repeating himself then see if you can get them back up the aqueduct that fortress had not kept the shaido out the first time and if anything went wrong he doubted it would keep them out this time either he did not mean to renege on his bargain with the seanchanthe shaido were going to pay for what they had done to faile and besides he could not leave them behind to continue ravaging the countryside but he wanted her out of harms way as soon as possible ban propped his bowstave and halberd against the aqueduct and hoisted himself up to reach a hand down inside when he lowered himself back to the ground he wiped his damp hand on his coat then rubbed the side of his prominent nose below the water its coated with something feels like pond slime were going to have a hard enough time getting down that last slope without sliding the whole way lord perrin much less trying to climb it again i expect the best thing is to wait in that fortress till you reach us perrin sighed he had thought of sending ropes but they would have needed nearly two miles of it to span that last slope a lot to be carried and if any shaido spotted the butt end of it in the maiden end of the aqueduct they would search every nook and cranny in the town a small risk perhaps yet the bitter loss that might result made it loom large ill be there as fast as i can ban i promise you that he shook hands with every one of them too lanternjawed tod alcaar and leof torfinn with a white streak through his hair where a scar ran given to him by trollocs young kenly maerin who was making a stab at growing a beard again unfortunately and bili adarra who was almost as wide as perrin if a hand shorter bili was a distant cousin and some of the closest kin perrin had living he had grown up with many of these men though some were a few years older than he some were a few years younger too by now he knew the men from down to deven ride and up to watch hill as well as he did those from around emonds field he had more reason than faile alone to reach that fortress as fast as he could had allora a lean rellow with thick mustaches like a taraboner was the last of the two rivers men as he climbed into the aqueduct gaul appeared face still veiled and four spears gripped in the hand that held his bullhide buckler he put a hand on the edge of the aqueduct and leapt up to sit on the stone coping youre going in perrin said in surprise the maidens can do any scouting you need perrin aybara the big aiel glanced over his shoulder toward the maidens perrin thought he scowled though it was hard to be sure because of the black veil that hid all but his eyes i heard them talking when they thought i was not listening unlike your wife and the others chiad is properly gaishain bain too but i care nothing about her chiad still has the rest of her year and a day to serve after we rescue her when a man has a woman as gaishain or a woman a man sometimes a marriage wreath is made as soon as white is put off it is not uncommon but i heard the maidens say they would reach chiad first to keep her from me behind him sulins finger flashed in maiden handtalk and one of the others slapped a hand over her mouth as if stifling laughter so they had been goading him maybe they were not so hard against his suit for chiad as they pretended or maybe there was something perrin was missing aiel humor could be rough gaul slipped into the water he had to bend almost parallel to the surface to get under the aqueducts top perrin stared at the opening so easy to follow gaul turning away was hard the line of seanchan soldiers still snaked up and down the slope mishima im going back to my camp grady will take you to yours when youre done here do what you can to blur the tracks before you go very well my lord ive told off some men to scrape grease from the axles and grease these windmills they sound as if they could seize up any minute we can do those at the far ridge too taking up steppers reins perrin looked up at the slowturning sails slow but steady they had never been made to turn fast and if some shaido decide to come out here tomorrow and wonder where the fresh grease came from mishima regarded him for a long moment his face halfhidden by moonshadows for once he did not seem put off by glowing yellow eyes his scent he smelled as if he saw something unexpected the bannergeneral was right about you he said slowly what did she say youll have to ask her my lord perrin rode down the slope and back to the trees thinking how easy it would be to turn around gallenne could handle everything from here it was all laid out except that the mayener believed every battle climaxed with a grand charge of horse and preferably began with one too how long would he stick to the plan arganda was more sensible but he was so anxious for queen alliandre that he might well order that charge as well that left himself the breeze gusted hard and he pulled his cloak around him grady elbows on his knees was in a small clearing sitting on a halfworked mossy stone that was partially sunken into the ground and no doubt left over from building the aqueduct a few others like it stood around the breeze kept his scent from perrins nose he did not look up until perrin drew rein in front of him the gateway they had used to come here still stood open showing another clearing among tall trees not far from where the seanchan were now camped it might have been easier to have had them set up close to perrins camp but he wanted to keep the aes sedai and wise ones as far from the suldam and damane as possible he was not afraid of the seanchan breaking tylees word but the aes sedai and wise ones practically came down with the pip just thinking about damane probably the wise ones and annoura would stay their hands for the time being probably masuri he was not so sure of in a number of ways better to keep a few leagues between them for as long as it could be managed are you all right grady the mans weathered face seemed to have new lines in it that might have been a trick of moonshadows cast by the trees but perrin did not think so the carts had passed through the gateway easily but was it a little smaller than the first he had seen grady make just tired a little my lord grady said wearily he remained seated with his elbows on his knees all this traveling weve been doing lately well i couldnt have held the gateway open long enough for all those soldiers to ride through yesterday thats why ive taken to tying them off perrin nodded both of the ashaman were tired channeling took strength out of a man as surely as swinging a hammer all day at a forge more so in truth the man with the hammer could keep going far longer than any ashaman that was why the aqueduct was the route into maiden and not a gateway why there would be no gateway to bring faile and the others out again much as perrin wished there could be the two ashaman only had so much more left in them until they could rest and that little had to be used where it was needed most light but that was a hard thought only if grady or neald fell one gateway short of what was needed a lot of men were going to die a hard decision im going to need you and neald the day after tomorrow that was like saying he needed air without the ashaman everything became impossible youre going to be busy then another gross understatement busy as a onearmed man plastering a ceiling my lord are you up to it have to be dont i my lord perrin nodded again you did what had to be done send me back to our camp after you return mishima and his people to his you and the maidens can sleep there if youd like that would spare grady a little against two days from now dont know about the maidens my lord but id as soon come on home tonight he turned his head to look at the gateway without rising and it dwindled in the reverse of how it had opened the view through it seeming to rotate as it narrowed finishing with a vertical slash of silvery blue light that left a faint purplish bar in perrins vision when it winked out those damane fair make my skin crawl they dont want to be free how would you know that i talked to some of them when none of those suldam was close by soon as i brought up maybe theyd like those leashes off just hinting like they started screaming for the suldam the damae were crying and the suldam petting them and stroking them and glaring daggers at me fair made my skin crawl stepper stamped an impatient hoof and perrin patted the stallions neck grady was lucky those suldam had let him go with a whole hide whatever happens with the damane grady it wont be this week or next and it wont be us who fixes it so you let the damane be we have a job of work in front of us that needs doing and a deal with the dark one to do it he pushed the thought away anyway it had grown hard to think of tylee khirgan being on the dark ones side or mishima you understand that i understand my lord im just saying it makes my skin crawl at last another silvery blue slash appeared widening into an opening that showed a clearing among large widely spaced trees and a low stone outcrop leaning low on steppers neck perrin rode through the gateway winked out behind him and he rode on through the trees until he came to the large clearing where the camp lay near what had once been the tiny village of brytan a collection of fleariddled hovels that the most rainsoaked night could not tempt a man into the sentries up in the trees gave no warnings of course they recognized him he wanted nothing so much as he wanted his blankets right then well faile certainly but lacking her he wanted to be alone in the dark likely he would fail to find sleep again but he would spend the night as he had so often before thinking of her remembering her short of the tenpace wide thicket of sharpened stakes that surrounded the camp though he reined in a raken was crouched just outside the stakes its long gray neck lowered so a woman in a hooded brown coat could scratch its leathery snout her hood hung down her back revealing shortcropped hair and a hard narrow face she looked at perrin as if she recognized him but went right on scratching the saddle on the creatures back had places for two riders a messenger had come it seemed he turned into one of the narrow angled lanes through the stakes that had been left to allow horses through just not quickly most everybody had turned in already he sensed movement on the horselines in the heart of the camp likely some of the cairhienin grooms or farriers but the patched canvas tents and small huts of woven evergreen branches now long since brown lay dark and quiet nothing moved among the low aiel tents and only a few sentries walking up and down in the nearest mayener section of the camp the mayeners and ghealdanin put little trust in the two rivers men in the trees his tall redstriped tent was alight however and the shadows of a number of people shifted on the tent walls when he climbed down in front of the tent athan chandin appeared to take the reins and knuckle his forehead while he hunched a sort of bow athan was a good bowshot or he would not have been here but he had a truckling manner perrin went in unpinning his cloak there you are berelain said brightly she must have dressed hastily because her long black hair looked as though it had had just a lick and a promise from a brush but her highnecked gray riding dress appeared neat and fresh her serving women never let her don anything unless it was freshly ironed she held out a silver winecup for breane to refill from a longnecked wine pitcher which the cairhienin woman did with a grimace failes maid disliked berelain with a passion berelain seemed not to notice though forgive me for entertaining in your tent but the bannergeneral wanted to see you and i thought id keep her company shes been telling us about some whitecloaks balwer was standing unobtrusively in a cornerthe birdlike little man could be as unnoticeable as a lizard on a branch when he wished to bebut his scent sharpened at the mention of whitecloaks tylee her shoulders straining a coat like that of the flier made a straightlegged bow while keeping one eye on annoura she seemed to believe the aes sedai might turn into ravening wild dogs at any moment perrin thought she smelled of distress though none showed on her dark face my lord i have two pieces of news i felt i had to bring you immediately have you begun putting the forkroot into the towns water i have he said worriedly tossing his cloak down atop one of the brassbanded chests tylee sighed i told you i would id have done it two days ago if that fool woman in almizar hadnt dragged her heels so whats happened forgive me lini announced but i was roused from my blankets and i would like to return to them does anyone require anything else of me tonight there were no curtsies or my lords from the frailappearing woman with her white hair in a loose braid for sleeping unlike with berelain her brown dress looked hastily donned unusual for her her scent was crisp and sharp with disapproval she was one of those who believed the ridiculous tale that perrin had slept with berelain on the very night after faile had been captured she managed to avoid looking at him while her gaze swept around the tents interior ill have some more wine aram announced holding out his cup grimfaced and haggard in a redstriped coat his eyes hollow he was attempting to lounge in one of the folding camp chairs but the sword strapped to his back made leaning against the giltedged back impossible breane started toward him he s had enough lini said sharply and breane turned away lini had a firm hand with failes servants aram muttered an oath and leaped to his feet tossing his cup down on the flowered carpet that served as a floor i might as well go somewhere i wont have some old woman nagging at me every time i take a drink he gave perrin a sullen glare before stalking out of the tent doubtless on his way to masemas camp he had pleaded to be one of the party sent into maiden but his hot head could not be trusted with that you can go lini berelain said breane can look after us well enough a snort was the acknowledgment lini gaveshe made it sound almost delicatebefore she stalked out stiffbacked and reeking of disapproval and still not looking at perrin forgive me my lord tylee drawled in careful tones but you seem to run your household more loosely than im accustomed to its our way bannergeneral perrin said picking up arams cup no need to dirty another nobody around here is property if that sounded sharp so be it he had come to like tylee after a fashion but these seanchan had ways that would make a goat gag he took the pitcher from breaneshe actually tried to hold onto it for a moment frowning at him as if she would deny him a drinkand poured for himself before handing it back she snatched the pitcher out of his hand now what happened what about these whitecloaks i sent raken out scouting as far as they could go just before dawn and again just after sunset one of the fliers tonight turned back sooner than expected she saw seven thousand children of the light on the move not fifty miles from my camp on the move toward you perrin frowned at his wine instead of drinking seven thousand seems a very exact count to make in the dark it seems these men they are deserters annoura broke in at least the bannergeneral sees them so in gray silk she appeared as neat as if she had spent an hour dressing her thrusting nose made her look like a crow wearing beaded braids as she peered at tylee and the bannergeneral a particularly interesting bit of carrion she held a winecup but it seemed untouched i have heard rumors that pedron niall died fighting the seanchan but apparently eamon valda who replaced niall swore fealty to the seanchan empress tylee mouthed may she live forever under her breath perrin doubted anyone but himself heard balwer opened his mouth too but closed it again without speaking the whitecloaks were a bugbear to him something over a month ago however the gray sister went on galad damodred killed valda and led seven thousand whitecloaks to leave the seanchan cause a pity he became enmeshed with whitecloaks but perhaps some good has come of it in any case it appears there is a standing order that these men are all to be killed as soon as found i have summed it up nicely yes bannergeneral tylees hand twitched as if it wanted to make one of those signs against evil thats a fair summing up she said to perrin not annoura the seanchan woman seemed to find speaking to an aes sedai difficult except the part about good coming of it oathbreaking and desertion can never be called good i take it theyre not moving toward you or youd have said perrin put a hint of question into that though there was no question in his mind north tylee answered theyre heading north balwer half opened his mouth again then shut it with a click of teeth if you have advice perrin told him then give it but i dont care how many whitecloaks desert the seanchan faile is the only thing i care about and i dont think the bannergeneral will give up the chance to collar three or four hundred more damane to chase after them berelain grimaced annouras face remained smooth but she took a long swallow of her wine none of the aes sedai felt very complacent about that part of the plan none of the wise ones did either i will not tylee said firmly i think ill take some wine after all breane took a deep breath before moving to comply and a hint of fear entered her scent apparently the tall dark woman intimidated her i wont deny i would enjoy a chance to strike a blow at the whitecloaks balwer said in that dryasdust voice but in truth i feel i owe this galad damodred a debt of gratitude perhaps his grudge was against this valda personally in any case you have no need of my advice here events are in motion in maiden and if they werent i doubt youd hold back even a day nor would i have advised it my lord if i may be so bold i am quite fond of the lady faile you may perrin told him bannergeneral you said two pieces of news the seanchan took the proffered winecup from breane and looked at him so levelly it was clear she was avoiding a glance at the others in the tent may we speak alone she asked quietly berelain glided across the carpet to rest a hand on his arm and smile up at him annoura and i dont mind leaving she said light how could anyone believe there was anything between him and her she was as beautiful as ever true yet the scent that had minded him of a hunting cat was so long gone from her smell that he barely remembered it the bedrock of her scent was patience and resolve now she had come to accept that he loved faile and only faile and she seemed as determined to see faile freed as he was you can stay he said whatever you have to say bannergeneral you can say in front of everyone here tylee hesitated glancing at annoura there are two large parties of aiel heading toward maiden she said at last reluctantly one to the southeast one to the southwest the moratraken estimate they could be there in three days suddenly everything seemed to ripple in perrins sight he felt himself ripple breane gave a cry and dropped the pitcher the world rippled again and berelain clutched his arm tylees hand seemed frozen in that odd gesture thumb and forefinger forming a crescent everything rippled for a third time and perrin felt as if he were made of fog as if the world were fog with a high wind coming berelain shuddered and he put a comforting arm around her she clung to him trembling silence and the scent of fear filled the tent he could hear voices being raised outside and they sounded afraid too what was that tylee demanded finally i dont know annouras face remained serene but her voice was unsteady light i have no idea it doesnt matter what it was perrin told them he ignored their stares in three days it will all be over thats all that matters faile was all that mattered the sun stood short of its noonday peak but faile already felt harassed the water for sevannas morning bathshe bathed twice a day nowhad not been hot enough and faile had been beaten along with everyone else although she and auiandre had only been there to scrub the womans back more than twenty wetlander gaishain had begged to be allowed to swear fealty just since sunrise three had suggested rising up pointing out that there were more gaishain in all these tents than shaido they had seemed to listen when she pointed out that nearly all of the aiel knew how to use a spear while most of the wetlanders were farmers or craftsfolk few had ever held a weapon and fewer still used one they had seemed to listen but this was the first day anyone had suggested such a thing right after swearing usually they took several days to work themselves around to it the pressure was building toward a slaughter unless she could thwart it and now this it is only a game faile bashere rolan said towering over her as they walked along one of the muddy streets that wound through the shaido tents he sounded amused and a very small smile curved his lips a beautiful man to be sure a kissing game you said she shifted the lengths of striped toweling folded over her arm to draw his attention i have work to do and no time for games especially kissing games she could see a few aiel several of them men staggering drunk even at this hour but most of the people in the street were wetlanders wearing dirty gaishain robes or children splashing happily in the mud puddles left by the nights heavy rain the street was thronged with men and women in mudstained white carrying baskets or buckets or pots some actually went about chores there were so many gaishain in the camp that there really was not enough work to go around that would not stop a shaido from ordering what were seen as idle hands to some work or other if those hands stuck out of white sleeves however even if it was makework to avoid having to dig useless holes in muddy fields or scrub pots that were already clean a good many of the gaishain had taken to carrying something that made them look as if they were working that did not help anyone avoid the real work but it did help avert the other kind faile did not have to worry about that with most of the shaido not so long as she wore those thick golden chains around her waist and neck but the necklace and belt were inadequate for deterring wise ones she had scrubbed clean pots for some of them and sometimes had been punished for not being available when sevanna wanted her thus the toweling we could start with a kissing game children play he said though the forfeits in that are sometimes embarrassing in the game adults play the forfeits are fun losing can be as pleasant as winning she could not help laughing the man certainly was persistent suddenly she saw galina hurrying through the crowd in her direction holding her white silk robes up out of the mud eyes searching avidly faile had heard the woman was allowed clothing again as of this morning of course she had never been without the tall necklace and wide belt of gold and firedrops a cap of hair less than an inch long covered her head and of all things a large red bow was pinned in it it seemed unlikely that was by the womans choice only a face faile could not put an age to convinced her that galina really was aes sedai beyond that she was unsure of anything about her except the danger she presented galina spotted her and stopped dead hands kneading her robes the aes sedai eyed rolan uncertainly ill have to think on it rolan she was not about co chase him away until she was sure of galina i need time to think women always want time to think think on forgetting your troubles in the pleasure of a harmless game the finger he drew softly down her cheek before walking away made her shiver to aiel touching someones cheek in public was as much as a kiss it surely had felt like a kiss to her harmless somehow she doubted that any game that involved kissing rolan would end with just kissing luckily she would not have to find outor hide anything from perrinif galina proved true if the aes sedai darted to her as soon as rolan was gone where is it galina demanded seizing her arm tell me i know you have it you must have it the woman sounded almost pleading theravas tteatment of her had shattered that fabled aes sedai composure faile shook off her grip first tell me again that you will take my friends and me with you when you go tell me straight out and tell me when you are going dont you dare talk to me that way galina hissed faile saw black flecks floating in her vision before she realized that she had been slapped to her surprise she slapped the other woman back as hard as she could staggering her she refrained from putting a hand to her stinging face but galina rubbed her own cheek her eyes wide with shock faile steeled herself perhaps for a blow with the power or something worse but nothing happened some of the passing gatshain stared at them but none stopped or even slowed anything that looked like a gathering of gaishain would draw shaido eyes and earn punishments for everyone involved tell me she said again i will take you and your friends with me galina practically snarled snatching her hand down i leave tomorrow if you have it if not sevanna will know who you are within the hour well that was certainly speaking straight out its hidden in the town ill get it for you now but as she turned galina grabbed her arm again the aes sedais eyes darted and she lowered her voice as if suddenly concerned about being overheard she sounded frightened no ill take no chances on anyone seeing youll give it to me tomorrow morning in the town well meet there in the south end of the town ill mark the building with a red scarf faile blinked the southern half of maiden was a burnedout shell why there she asked incredulously because no one goes there fool because no one will see us galinas eyes were still darting tomorrow morning early fail me and youll regret it gathering the skirts of her silk robe she scurried away into the crowd faile frowned as she watched the woman go she should have felt exultation but she did not galina seemed almost a wild thing unpredictable still aes sedai could not lie there seemed no way for her to wriggle out of her promise and if she found one there were still her own plans for an escape though those seemed no further along if much more dangerous than they had when first begun which left rolan and his kissing games galina had to prove true she had to chapter twentyseven a plain wooden box the midday altaran sun was warm though a gusting breeze sometimes whipped rands cloak they had been on the hilltop for two hours now a great mass of dark clouds creeping down from the north above bluegray haze spoke of rain to come and a cooling andor lay only a few miles in that direction across low forested hills of oak and pine leatherleaf and sourgum that border had seen countless generations of cattle raids going in both directions was elayne watching it rain in caemlyn that lay a good hundred and fifty leagues east too far for her to be more than a faint presence in the back of his head aviendha in arad doman was fainter still he had not considered that the wise ones would take her along still she would be safe among tens of thousands of aiel as safe as elayne behind caemlyns walls taidaishar stamped a hoof and tossed his head eager to be moving rand patted the big blacks neck the stallion could reach the border in under an hour but their way was west today a short way west in just a short while now he had to impress at todays meeting and he had chosen his garb with care the crown of swords sat on his head for more reason than making an impression though half the small swords nestled among the wide band of laurel leaves pointed down making it uncomfortable to wear giving constant reminders of its weight in gold and in responsibility a small chip in one of those laurel leaves dug at his temple to remind him of the battle against the seanchan where it had been made a battle lost when he could not afford to lose his dark green silk coat was embroidered in gold on the sleeves shoulders and high collar a goldinlaid buckle in the shape of a dragon fastened his swordbelt and he had the dragon scepter in hand a twofoot length of spearhead with a long greenandwhite tassel below the polished steel point if the daughter of the nine moons recognized it for part of a seanchan spear she must also see the dragons that maidens had carved winding around the remaining haft today he wore no gloves the goldenmaned dragonheads on the backs of his hands glittered metallically in the sun however high she stood among the seanchan she would know whom she faced a fool lews therins wild laughter echoed inside his head a fool to walk into a trap rand ignored the madman it might be a trap but he was ready to spring it if it was it was worth the risk he needed this truce he could crush the seanchan but at what cost in blood and in time he might not have he glanced north again the sky above andor was clear except for a few high white clouds drifting wisps the last battle was coming he had to take the risk min toying with the reins of her gray mare nearby was feeling smug and that irritated him she had inveigled a promise from him in a weak moment and refused to release him he could just break it he should break it as if she had heard his thoughts she looked at him her face surrounded by dark shoulderlength ringlets was smooth but the bond suddenly carried suspicion and hints of anger she seemed to be trying to suppress both yet she adjusted the cuffs of her ornately embroidered red coat the way she did when checking her knives of course she would not use one of her blades on him of course not a womans love can be violent lews therin murmured sometimes they hurt a man worse than they think they have worse than they mean to sometimes theyre even sorry afterwards he sounded sane for the moment but rand shoved the voice down you should let us scout farther out rand althor nandera said she and the two dozen other maidens on the sparsely wooded hilltop wore their black veils up some had their bows in hand and arrows nocked the rest of the maidens were among the trees well out from the hill keeping watch against unpleasant surprises the land is clear all the way to the manor house but this still smells of a trap to me there had been a time when words like manor and house sounded awkward on her tongue she had been a long time in the wetlands now though nandera speaks truth alivia muttered sullenly heeling her roan gelding closer apparently the goldenhaired woman still resented the fact that she would not be going with him but her reaction to hearing her native accents in tear made that impossible she admitted having been shaken but claimed it had been the surprise of the thing he could not chance it though you cannot trust any of the high blood especially not a daughter of the empress may she her mouth snapped shut and she smoothed her dark blue skirts unnecessarily grimacing at what she had almost said he trusted her literally with his life but she had too many deepburied instincts to risk putting her facetoface with the woman he was going to meet the bond carried anger with no effort to suppress it now min disliked seeing alivia near him it smells of a trap to me too bashere said easing his sinuously curved sword in its scabbard he was plainly clad in burnished helmet and breastplate his gray silk coat alone marking him out from the eightyone saldaean lancers arrayed around the hilltop his thick downcurved mustaches almost bristled behind the facebars of his helmet id give ten thousand crowns to know how many soldiers she has out there and how many damane this daughter of the nine moons is the heir to their throne man he had been shocked when alivia revealed that no one in ebou dar had mentioned it to him as if it were of no importance they may claim their control ends far south of here but you can wager she has at least a small army to see to her safety and if our scouts find this army rand replied calmly can we be sure they wont be seen nandera made a scornful sound best not to assume youre the only one with eyes he told her if they think were planning to attack them or kidnap the woman everything falls apart maybe that was why they had kept their secret the imperial heir would be a more tempting target for a kidnapping than a mere highranking noblewoman you just keep watch to make sure they dont catch us by surprise if it all goes wrong bashere you know what to do besides she may have an army but so do i and not so small bashere had to nod at that aside from the saldaeans and the maidens the hilltop was crowded with ashaman and aes sedai and warders better than twentyfive all told and as formidable a group as any small army they mingled with surprising ease and few outward signs of tension oh toveine a short copperyskinned red was scowling at logain but gabrelle a dusky brown with sooty green eyes was talking with him quite companionabiy perhaps even coquettishly that might have been the reason for toveines scowl though disapproval seemed more likely than jealousy adrielle and kurin each had an arm around the others waist though she was tall enough to overtop the domani ashaman and beautiful where he was plain and had gray at his temples not to mention that he had bonded the gray against her will beldeine new enough to the shawl that she simply looked like any young saldaean woman with slightly tilted brown eyes reached out every now and then to touch manfor and he smiled at her whenever she did her bonding of him had been a shock but apparently the yellowhaired man had been more than willing neither had asked rand his opinion before the bonding strangest of all perhaps were jenare pale and sturdy in a gray riding dress embroidered with red on the skirts and kajima a clerkish fellow in his middle years who wore his hair like narishma in two braids with silver bells at the ends she laughed at something kajima said and murmured something that made him laugh in turn a red joking with a man who could channel maybe taim had effected a change for the better whatever he had intended and maybe rand althor was living in a dream too aes sedai were famous for their dissembling but could a red dissemble that far not everyone felt agreeable today ayakos eyes seemed almost black as she glared at rand but then considering what happened to a warder when his aes sedai died the darkcomplected little white had reason to fear sandomere going into possible danger the ashaman bond differed from the warder bond in some respects but in others it was identical and no one yet knew the effects of an ashamans death on the woman he had bonded elza was frowning at rand too one hand on the shoulder of her tall lean warder fearil as if she were gripping a guard dogs collar and thinking of loosing him not against rand certainly but he worried for anyone she thought might be threatening him he had given her orders about that and her oath should see them obeyed yet aes sedai could find loopholes in almost anything merise was speaking firmly to narishma with her other two warders sitting their horses a little way off there was no mistaking the way the sternfaced woman gestured as she spoke leaning close to him so she could speak in a low voice she was instructing him about something rand disliked that in the circumstances yet there seemed little he could do merise had sworn no oaths and she would ignore him when it came to one of her warders or much of anything else for that matter cadsuane was watching rand too she and nynaeve were wearing all of their terangreal jewelry nynaeve was making a good try at aes sedai calm she seemed to practice that a great deal since sending lan wherever she had sent him half the hilltop separated her plump brown mare from cadsuanes bay of course nynaeve would never admit it but cadsuane intimidated her logain rode up between rand and bashere his black gelding prancing the horse was almost the exact shade of his coat and cloak the sun is almost straight overhead he said time we go down there was only a mere hint of question in that the man chafed at taking orders he did not wait on a reply sandomere he called loudly narishma merise held narishma by his sleeve for another moment of instructions before letting him ride over which made logain scowl sundark narishma with his dark belled braids looked years younger than rand though he was a few years older in truth sitting his dun as straight as a sword he nodded to logain as to an equal producing another scowl sandomere spoke a quiet word to ayako before mounting his dapple and she touched his thigh once he was in the saddle wrinkled with receding hair and a graystreaked beard trimmed to a point and oiled he made her appear youthful rather than ageless he wore the redandgold dragon on his high black collar now as well as the silver sword every ashaman on the hill did even manfor he had only recently been raised to dedicated but he had been one of the first to come to the black tower before there was a black tower most of the men who had begun with him were dead even logain had not denied he deserved it logain had enough sense not to call cadsuane or nynaeve but they rode to join rand anyway placing themselves to either side of him each briefly eyeing him faces so smooth they might have been thinking anything their eyes met and nynaeve looked away quickly cadsuane gave a faint snort and min came too his one more to balance the honors a man should never give promises in bed he opened his mouth and she arched an eyebrow looking at him very directly the bond felt full of something dangerous you stay behind me once we get there he told her not at all what he had intended to say danger faded to what he had come to recognize as love there was wry amusement in the bond too for some reason i will if i want to you woolheaded sheepherder she said with more than a little asperity just as il the bond would not tell him her true feelings hard as those might be to decipher if were going to do this fool thing lets get it done with cadsuane said firmly and heeled her dark bay down the hill a short distance from the hill farms began to appear along a meandering dirt road through the forest hardpacked by long years of use but still carrying a slick of mud from the last rainfall the chimneys of thatched stone houses smoked with the midday mealcooking sometimes girls and women sat out in the sun at their spinning wheels men in rough coats walked in the stonewalled fields checking their sprouting crops amid boys hoeing weeds the pastures held brownandwhite cattle or blacktailed sheep usually watched by a boy or two with bows or slings there were wolves in these forests and leopards and other things that enjoyed the taste of beef and mutton some people shaded their eyes to peer at the passersby doubtless wondering who these finely dressed folk were who had come to visit the lady deirdru surely there could be no other reason for their presence heading toward the manor house and so far from anywhere important no one seemed agitated or frightened though just going about their days work rumors of an army in the region surely would have upset them and rumors of that sort spread like wildfire strange the seanchan could not travel and arrive without news speeding ahead of them it was very strange he felt logain and the other two men seize saidin filling themselves with it logain held almost as much as he could have himself narishma and sandomere somewhat less they were the strongest among the other ashaman though and both had been at dumais wells logain had proven he could handle himself in other places other battles if this was a trap they would be ready and the other side would never know it until too late rand did not reach for the source he could feel lews therin lurking in his head this was no time to give the madman a chance to get hold of the power cadsuane nynaeve youd better embrace the source now he said were getting close ive been holding saidar since back on that hill nynaeve told him cadsuane snorted and gave him a look that called him an idiot rand stilled a grimace before it could begin his skin felt no tingling no goosebumps they had masked their ability and with it shielded him from sensing the power in them men had had few advantages over women when it came to channeling but now they had lost those few while women retained all of theirs some of the ashaman were trying to puzzle out how to duplicate what nacelle had created to find a weave that would allow men to detect womens weaves but so far without success well it would have to be dealt with by someone else he had all he could manage on his plate at the moment the farms continued some alone in a clearing others clustered three or four or five together if they followed the road far enough they would reach the village of kings crossing in a few miles where a wooden bridge spanned a narrow river called the reshalle but well short of that the road passed by a large clearing marked by a pair of tall stone gateposts though there were neither gates nor fence a hundred paces or more beyond it at the end of a mudslicked clay lane lay lady deidrus manor two stories of thatchroofed gray stone saved from looking a large farmhouse only by the gateposts and the tall twinned doors at the front the stables and outbuildings had the same practical appearance sturdy and unornamented there was no one in sight no stablemen no servant on her way to fetch eggs no men in the fields that flanked the lane the houses tall chimneys stood smokeless it did smell of a trap but the countryside was quiet the farmers unruffled there was only one way to find out rand turned taidaishar in through the gateposts and the others followed min did not heed his warning she pushed her gray in between taidaishar and nynaeves mare and grinned at him the bond carried nervousness but the woman grinned when he was halfway to the house the doors opened and two women came out one in dark gray the other in blue with red panels on her breast and anklelength skirts sunlight glinted off the silvery leash connecting them two more appeared and two more until three pairs stood in a row to either side of the door as he reached the threequarter point another woman stepped into the doorway very dark and very small dressed in pleated white her head covered by a transparent scarf that fell over her face the daughter of the nine moons she had been described to bashere right down to her shaven head a tension in his shoulders he had not been aware of melted that she was actually here did away with the possibility of a trap the seanchan would not risk the heir to their throne in anything so dangerous he drew rein and dismounted one of them is channeling nynaeve said just loudly enough for him to hear as she climbed down from her saddle i cant see anything so shes masked her ability and inverted the weaveand i wonder how the seanchan learned tbatlbut shes channeling only one there isnt enough for it to be two her terangreal could not tell whether it was saidin or saidar being channeled but it was unlikely to be a man i told you it was trap lews therin groaned i told you rand pretended to check his saddle girth can you tell which one he asked quietly he still did not reach saidin there was no telling what lews therin might do in these circumstances if he managed to grab control again logain was fiddling with his girth too and narishma was watching sandomere check one of the dapples hooves they had heard the small woman was waiting in the doorway very still but no doubt impatient and likely offended by their apparent interest in their horses no cadsuane replied grimly but i can do something about it once were closer her golden hair ornaments swayed as she tossed her cloak back as though unmasking a sword stay behind me he told min and to his relief she nodded her face wore a small frown and the bond carried worry not fear though she knew he would protect her leaving the horses standing he started toward the suldam and damane with cadsuane and nynaeve a little distance to either side of him logain hand resting on his sword hilt as if that were his real weapon strode along on the other side of cadsuane narishma and sandomere beyond nynaeve the small dark woman began walking toward them slowly holding her pleated skirts up off the damp ground abruptly no more than ten paces away she flickered for an instant she was taller than most men garbed all in black surprise on her face and though she still wore the veil her head was covered with shortcut wavy black hair only an instant before the small woman returned her step faltering as she let her white skirts fall but another flicker and the tall dark woman stood there her face twisted in fury behind the veil he recognized that face though he had never seen it before lews therin had and that was enough semirhage he said in shock before he could stop the word and suddenly everything seemed to happen at once he reached for the source and found lews therin clawing for it too each of them jostling the other aside from reaching it semirhage flicked her hand and a small ball of fire streaked toward him from her fingertips she might have shouted something an order he could not leap aside min stood right behind him frantically trying to seize saidin he flung up the hand holding the dragon scepter in desperation the world seemed to explode in fire his cheek was pressed against the damp ground he realized black flecks shimmered in his vision and everything seemed faintly hazy as if seen through water where was he what had happened his head felt stuffed with wool something was prodding him in the ribs his sword hilt the old wounds were a hard knot of pain just above that slowly he realized he was looking at the dragon scepter or what was left of it the spearpoint and a few inches of charred haft lay three paces away small dancing flames were consuming the long tassel the crown of swords lay beyond it abruptly it came to him that he could feel saidin being channeled his skin was goose bumps all over from saidar being wielded the manor house semirhage he tried to push himself up and collapsed with a harsh cry slowly he pulled a left arm that seemed all pain up where he could see his hand see where his hand had been only a mangled blackened ruin remained a stub sticking out of a cuff that gave off thin streamers of smoke but the power was still being channeled around him his people were fighting for their lives they might be dying min he struggled to rise and fell again as though thinking of her had summoned her min was crouching over him trying to shield him with her body he realized the bond was full of compassion and pain not physical pain he would have known if she had the smallest injury she was feeling pain for him lie still she said youve youve been hurt i know he said hoarsely again he reached for saidin and for a wonder this time lews therin did not try to interfere the power filled him and that gave him the strength to push himself to his feet onehanded preparing several very nasty weaves as he did so careless of his muddy coat min gripped his good arm as though she were trying to hold him upright but the fighting was over semirhage was standing stiffly with her arms at her sides her skirts pressed against her legs doubtless wrapped up in flows of air the hilt of one of mins knives stood out from her shoulder and she must have been shielded too but her dark beautiful face was contemptuous she had been a prisoner before briefly during the war of the shadow she had escaped from high detention by frightening her jailers to the point that they actually smuggled her to freedom others had been injured more seriously a short dark suldam and tall palehaired damane linked by an adam lay sprawled on the ground staring up at the sun with already glazed eyes and another pair were on their knees and clinging to one another blood running down their faces and matting their hair the other pairs stood as stiffly as semirhage and he could see the shields on three of the damane they looked stunned one of the suldam a slender darkhaired young woman was weeping softly narishmas face was bloodied too and his coat appeared singed so did sandomeres and a bone jutted through his left coatsleeve white smeared with red until nynaeve firmly pulled his arm straight and guided the bone back into place grimacing in pain he gave a guttural groan she cupped her hands around his arm over the break and moments later he was flexing his arm and moving his fingers and murmuring thanks logain appeared untouched as did nynaeve and cadsuane who was studying semirhage the way a brown might study an exotic animal never before seen suddenly gateways began opening all around the manor house spilling out mounted ashaman and aes sedai and warders veiled maidens and bashere riding at the head of his horsemen an ashaman and aes sedai in a ring of two could make a gateway considerably larger than those rand could alone so someone had managed to give the signal a red sunburst in the sky every ashaman was full of saidin and rand assumed the aes sedai were equally full ofsaidar the maidens began spreading out into the trees aghan hamad search the house bashere shouted matoun form the lancers theyll be on us as soon as they can two soldiers thrust their lances into the ground and leapt down to run inside drawing their swords while the others began arraying themselves in two ranks ayako flung herself from her saddle and rushed to sandomere not even bothering to hold her skirts out of the mud merise rode to narishma before swinging down right in front of him and taking his head in her hands without a word he jerked his back arching and nearly pulling his head free as she healed him she had little facility with nynaeves method of healing ignoring the turmoil nynaeve gathered her skirts in bloodied hands and hurried to rand oh rand she said when she saw his arm im so sorry i ill do what i can but i cant fix it the way it was her eyes were filled with anguish wordlessly he held out his left arm it throbbed with agony strangely he could still feel his hand it seemed he should be able to make a fist with the fingers that were no longer there his goose bumps intensified as she drew more deeply on saidar the tendrils of smoke vanished from his cuff and she gripped his arm above the wrist his entire arm began tingling and the pain drained away slowly blackened skin was replaced by smooth skin that seemed to ooze down until it covered the small lump that had been the base of his hand it was a miraculous thing to see the scarletandgold scaled dragon grew back too as much as it could ending in a bit of the golden mane he could still feel the whole hand im so sorry nynaeve said again let me delve you for any other injuries she asked but did not wait of course she reached up to cup his head between her hands and a chill ran through him theres something wrong with your eyes she said with a frown im afraid to try fixing that without studying on it the smallest mistake could blind you how well can you see how many fingers am i holding up two i can see fine he lied the black flecks were gone but everything still seemed seen through water and he wanted to squint against a sun that appeared to glare ten times brighter than it had the old wounds in his side were knotted with pain bashere climbed down from his compact bay in front of him and frowned at the stump of his left arm unbuckling his helmet he took it off and held it under his arm ac least youre alive he said gruffly ive seen men hurt worse me too rand said ill have to learn the sword all over again though bashere nodded most forms required two hands rand bene to pick up the crown of illian but min released his arm and hurriedly handed the crown to him he settled it on his head ill have to work out new ways to do everything you must be in shock nynaeve said slowly youve just suffered a grievous injury rand maybe youd better lie down lord davram have one your men bring a saddle to put his feet up hes not in shock min said sadly the bond was full of sadness she had taken hold of his arm as if to hold him up again he lost a hand but theres nothing to do about it so hes left it behind already woolheaded fool nynaeve muttered her hand still smeared with sandomeres blood drifted toward the thick braid hanging over her shoulder but she yanked it back down youve been hurt badly its all right to grieve its all right to feel stunned its normal i dont have time he told her mins sadness threatened to overflow the bond light he was all right why did she feel so sad nynaeve muttered half under her breath about woolhead and fool and manstubborn but she was not finished those old wounds in your side have broken open she almost growled you arent bleeding badly but you are bleeding maybe i can finally do something about them but as hard as she triedand she tried three timesnothing changed he still felt the slow trickle of blood sliding down his ribs the wounds were still a throbbing knot of pain finally he pushed her hand gently away from his side youve done what you can nynaeve its enough fool she did growl this time how can it be enough when youre still bleeding who is the tall woman bashere asked he understood at least you did not waste time on what could not be mended they didnt try passing her off as the daughter of the nine moons did they not after telling me she was a little thing they did rand replied and explained briefly semirhage bashere muttered incredulously how can you be sure shes anath dorje not not what you called her a honeyskinned suldam said loudly in a twangy drawl her dark eyes were tilted and her hair was streaked with gray she looked the eldest of the suldam and the least frightened it was not that she did not look afraid but she controlled it well shes the high ladys truthspeaker be silent falendre semirhage said coldly looking over her shoulder her gaze promised pain the lady of pain was good at delivering on her promises prisoners had killed themselves on learning it was she who held them men and women who managed to open a vein with teeth or fingernails falendre did not seem to see it though you dont command me she said scornfully youre not even sojhin how can you be sure cadsuane demanded those golden moons and stars birds and fishes swung as she moved her piercing gaze from rand to semirhage and back semirhage saved him the effort of thinking up a lie hes insane she said coolly standing there stiff as a statue mins knife hilt still sticking out beside her collarbone and the front of her black dress glistening with blood she might have been a queen on her throne graendal could explain it better than i madness was her specialty i will try however you know of people who hear voices in their heads sometimes very rarely the voices they hear are the voices of past lives lanfear claimed he knew things from our own age things only lews therin telamon could know clearly he is hearing lews therins voice it makes no difference that his voice is real however in fact that makes his situation worse even graendal usually failed to achieve reintegration with someone who heard a real voice i understand the descent into terminal madness can be abrupt her lips curved in a smile that never touched her dark eyes were they looking at him differently logains face was a carved mask unreadable bashere looked as though he still could not believe nynaeves mouth hung open and her eyes were wide the bond for a long moment the bond was full of numbness if min turned away from him he did not know whether he could stand it if she turned away it would be the best thing in the world for her but compassion and determination as strong as mountains replaced numbness and love so bright he thought he could have warmed his hands over it her grip on his arm tightened and he tried to put a hand over hers too late he remembered and snatched the nub of his hand away but not before it had touched her nothing in the bond wavered by a hair cadsuane moved closer to the taller woman and looked up at her facing one of the forsaken seemed to faze her no more than facing the dragon reborn did youre very calm for a prisoner rather than deny the charge you give evidence against yourself semirhage shifted that cold smile from rand to cadsuane why should i deny myself pride dripped from every word i am semirhage someone gasped and a number of the suldam and damane started trembling and weeping one suldam a pretty yellowhaired woman suddenly vomited down the front of herself and another stocky and dark looked as if she might cadsuane simply nodded i am cadsuane melaidhrin i look forward to long talks with you semirhage sneered she had never lacked courage we thought she was the high lady falendre said hurriedly and haltingly at the same time her teeth seemed near to chattering but she forced words out we thought we were being honored she took us to a room in the tarasin palace where there was a a hole in the air and we stepped through to this place i swear it on my eyes we thought she was the high lady so no army rushing toward us logain said you could not have told from his tone whether he was relieved or disappointed he bared an inch of his sword and thrust it back into its scabbard hard what do we do with them he jerked his head toward the suldam and damane send them to caemlyn like the others we send them back to ebou dar rand said cadsuane turned to stare at him her face was a perfect mask of aes sedai serenity yet he doubted she was anywhere near serene inside the leashing of damane was an abomination that aes sedai took personally nynaeve was anything but serene angryeyed gripping her braid in a tight blooddaubed fist she opened her mouth but he spoke over her i need this truce nynaeve and taking these women prisoner is no way to get one dont argue thats what theyd call it including the damane and you know it as well as i do they can carry word that i want to meet the daughter of the nine moons the heir to the throne is the only one who can make a truce stand i still dont like it she said firmly we could free the damane the others will do as well for carrying messages the damane who had not been weeping before burst into tears some of them cried to the suldam to save them nynaeves face took on sickly cast but she threw up her hands and gave over arguing the two soldiers bashere had sent into the house came out young men who walked with a rolling motion more accustomed to saddles than their own feet hamad had a luxuriant black beard that fell below the edge of his helmet and a scar down his face aghan wore thick mustaches like basheres and carried a plain wooden box with no lid under his arm they bowed to bashere free hands swinging their swords clear the house is empty my lord aghan said but theres dried blood staining the carpets in several rooms looks like a slaughter yard my lord i think whoever lived here is dead this was sitting by the front door it didnt look like it belonged so i brought it along he held out the box for inspection within lay coiled adam and a number of circlets made of segmented black metal some large some small rand started to reach in with his left hand before he remembered min caught the movement and released his right arm so he could scoop up a handful of the black metal pieces nynaeve gasped you know what these are he asked theyre adam for men she said angrily egeanin said she was going to drop the thing in the ocean we trusted her and she gave it to somebody to copy rand dropped the things back into the box there were six of the larger circlets and five of the silvery leashes semirhage had been prepared no matter who he brought with him she really thought she could capture all of us that thought should have made him shiver he seemed to feel lews therin shiver no one wanted to fall into semirhages hands she shouted for them to shield us nynaeve said but they couldnt because we were all holding the power already if we hadnt been if cadsuane and i hadnt had our terangreal i dont know what would have happened she did shiver he looked at the tall forsaken and she stared back utterly composed utterly cold her reputation as a torturer loomed so large that it was easy to forget how dangerous she was otherwise tie off the shields on the others so theyll unravel in a few hours and send them to somewhere near ebou dar for a moment he thought nynaeve was going to protest again but she contented herself with giving her braid a strong tug and turning away who are you to ask for a meeting with the high lady falendre demanded she emphasized the title for some reason my name is rand althor im the dragon reborn if they had wept at hearing semirhages name they wailed at hearing his ashandarei slanted across his saddle mat sat pips in the darkness among the trees and waited surrounded by two thousand mounted crossbowmen the sun was not long down and events should be in motion the seanchan were going to be hit hard tonight in half a dozen places some small and some not so small but hard in every case moonlight filtering through the branches overhead gave just enough illumination for him to make out tuons shadowed face she had insisted on staying with him which meant selucia was at her side on her dun of course glaring at him as usual there were not enough moonshadows to obscure that unfortunately tuon must be unhappy about what was to happen tonight yet nothing showed on her face what was she thinking her expression was all the stern magistrate your scheme do entail a good deal of luck teslyn said not for the first time even shadowed her face looked hard she shifted in her saddle adjusting her cloak it be coo late to change everything but this part can be abandoned certainly he would have preferred to have bethamin or seta neither bound by the three oaths and both knowing the weaves damane used for weapons something that horrified the aes sedai not the weaves just that bethamin and seta knew them at least he thought he would leilwin had flatly refused to fight any seanchan except to defend herself bethamin and seta might have done the same or found at the last minute that they could not act against their countrymen in any case the aes sedai had rejected allowing the two women to be involved and neither had opened her mouth once that was said that pair were too meek around aes sedai to say boo to a goose grace favor you teslyn sedai but lord mat is lucky captain mandevwin said the stocky oneeyed man had been with the band since the first days in cairhien and he had earned the gray streaks in his hair hidden now beneath his greenpainted helmet an openfaced footmans helmet in battles against tear and andor before that i remember times we were outnumbered with enemies on every side and he danced the band around them not to slip away mind but to beat them beautiful battles a beautiful battle is one you dont have to fight mat said more sharply than he intended he did not like battles you could get holes poked in you in a battle he just kept getting caught in them that was all most of that dancing around had been trying to slip away but there would be no slipping away tonight or for many days to come our part of it is important teslyn what was keeping aludra burn her the attack at the supply camp must be under way already just strong enough that the soldiers defending it would think they could hold until help arrived strong enough to make them sure they needed help the others would be full strength from the start to overwhelm the defenders before they knew what was on them i mean to bloody the seanchan bloody them so hard and fast and often that theyre reacting to what were doing instead of making their own plans as soon as the words left his tongue he wished he had phrased that another way tuon leaned close to selucia and the taller woman put her scarfcovered head down to exchange whispers it was too dark for their bloody fingertalk but he could not hear a word they were saying he could imagine she had promised not to betray him and that had to cover trying to betray his plans yet she must wish she had that promise back he should have left her with reimon or one of the others that would have been safer than letting her stay with him he could have if he had tied her up her and selucia both and probably setalle as well that bloody woman still took tuons side every time mandevwins bay stamped a hoof and he patted the animals neck with a gauntleted hand you cannot deny there is battle luck when you find a weakness in your enemys lines that you never expected that should not be there when you find him arrayed to defend against attack from the north only you are coming from the south battle luck rides on your shoulder my lord i have seen it mat grunted and resettled his hat on his head irritably for every time a banner got lost and blundered into a bloody chink in the enemys defenses there were ten when it just was not bloody where you expected when you bloody well needed it that was the truth of battle luck one green nightflower a man called from above two both green scrapings told of him climbing down hurriedly mat heaved a small sigh of relief the raken was away and headed west he had counted on thatthe nearest large body of soldiers loyal to the seanchan lay westand even cheated by riding as far west as he dared just because you were sure your opponent would react in a certain way did not mean he would reimon would be overrunning the supply camp any minute smothering the defenders with ten times their number and securing muchneeded provisions go vanin he said and the fat man dug his heels in sending his dun off into the night at a canter he could not outpace the raken but so long as he brought word in time time to move mandevwin a lean fellow dropped the last distance from a lower limb carefully cradling a looking glass that he handed up to the cairhienin get mounted londraed mandevwin said stuffing the looking glass into the cylindrical leather case tied to his saddle connl form the men by fours a short ride took them to a narrow hardpacked road winding through low hills that mat had avoided earlier there were few farms and fewer villages in this area but he did not want to spread rumors of large parties of armed men not until he wanted them to spread anyway now he needed speed and rumor could not outrun him in tonights business most of the farmhouses they trotted by were dark shapes in the moonlight lamps and candles already extinguished the thud of hooves and the creak of saddle leather were the only sounds aside from the occasional thin reedy cry of some night bird or an owls hooting but two thousand or so horses made a fair amount of noise they passed through a small village where only a handful of thatchroofed houses and the tiny stone inn showed any light but people stuck their heads out of doors and windows to gape doubtless they thought they were seeing soldiers loyal to the seanchan there seemed to be few of any other kind remaining in most of altara somebody raised a cheer but he was a lone voice mat rode alongside mandevwin with tuon and the other women behind and now and then he looked over his shoulder not to make sure she was still there strange as it was he had no doubt she would keep her word not to escape even now and not to make sure she was keeping up the razor had an easy stride and she rode well pips could not have outrun akein had he tried no he just liked looking at her even by moonlight maybe especially by moonlight he had tried kissing her again the night before and she had punched him in the side so hard that at first he thought she had broken one of his shortribs but she had kissed him just before they started out this evening only once and said not to be greedy when he attempted a second the woman melted in his arms while he was kissing her and turned to ice the moment she stepped back what was he to make of her a large owl passed overhead wings flapping silently would she see some omen in that probably he should not be spending so much time thinking about her not tonight in truth he was depending on luck to some extent the three thousand lancers vanin had found mostly altarans with a few seanchan might or might not be those master roidelle had marked on his map though they had not been too far from where he placed them but there was no telling for sure in which direction they had moved since northeast almost certainly toward the malvide narrows and the molvaine gap beyond it seemed that except for the last stretch the seanchan had taken to avoiding the lugard road for moving soldiers doubtless to conceal their numbers and destinations in the country roads certain was not absolutely sure however if they had not moved too far this was the road they would use to reach that supply camp if but if they had ridden farther than he expected they might use another road no danger there just a wasted night their commander might decide to cut straight across the hills too that could prove nasty if he decided to join this road at the wrong point about four miles beyond the village they came to a place where two gently sloping hills flanked the road and he called a halt master roidelles own maps were fine but those he had from other men were the work of masters too roidelle acquired only the best mat recognized this spot as if he had seen it before mandevwin wheeled his horse around admar eyndel take your men up the north slope madwin dongal the south slope one man in four to hold horses hobble the horses mat said and put the feedbags on to stop whinnying they were facing lancers if it all turned sour and they tried to run those lancers would ride them down like they were hunting wild pigs a crossbow was no good from horseback especially if you were trying to get away they had to win here the cairhienin stared at him any expression hidden by the facebars of his helmet but he did not hesitate hobble the horses and put on their nosebags he ordered every man on the line tell off some to keep watch north and south mat told him battle luck can run against you as easily as in your favor mandevwin nodded and gave the order the crossbowmen divided and rode up the thinly treed slopes their dark coats and dull green armor fading into the shadows burnished armor was all very well for parades but it could reflect moonlight as well as sunlight according to talmanes the hard part had been convincing the lancers to give up their bright breastplates and the nobles their silvering and gilding the foot had seen sense straight off for a time there was the rustle of men and horses moving across the mulch moving through brush but finally silence fell from the road mat could not have told there was anyone on either slope now he just had to wait tuon and selucia kept him company and so did teslyn a gusting breeze had sprung up from the west that tugged at cloaks but of course aes sedai could ignore such things though teslyn held hers shut selucia let the gusts take her cloak where it would oddly but tuon took to holding hers closed with one hand you might be more comfortable among the trees he told her theyll cut the wind for a moment she shook with silent laughter im enjoying watching you take your ease on your hilltop she drawled mat blinked hilltop he was sitting pips in the middle of the bloody road with flaming gusts cutting through his coat like winter was coming back what was she talking about hilltop have a care with joline teslyn said suddenly and unexpectedly she be childish in some ways and you do fascinate her the way a shiny new toy do fascinate a child she will bond you if she can decide how to convince you to agree perhaps even if you do no realize you be agreeing he opened his mouth to say there was no bloody flaming chance of that but tuon spoke first she cannot have him she said sharply drawing a breath she went on in amused tones toy belongs to me until i am through playing with him but even then i wont give him to a marathdamane you understand me tessi you tell rosi that thats the name i intended to give her you can tell her that too the sharp gusts might not have affected teslyn but she shivered at hearing her damane name aes sedai serenity vanished as rage contorted her face what i do understand give over mat cut in both of you im in no mood to listen to the pair of you trying to jab each other with needles teslyn stared at him indignation plain even by moonlight why toy tuon said brightly youre being masterful again she leaned over to selucia and whispered something that made the bosomy woman give a loud guffaw hunching his shoulders and pulling his cloak around him he leaned on the high pommel of his saddle and watched the night for vanin women he would give up all of his luckwell halfif he could understand women what do you think you can achieve with raids and ambushes teslyn said again not for the first time the seanchan will only send enough soldiers to hunt you down she and joline had kept trying to stick their noses into his planning and so had edesina to a lesser extent until he chased them away aes sedai thought they knew everything and while joline at least did know something of war he had not needed advice aes sedai advice sounded an awful lot like telling you what to do this time he decided to answer her im counting on them sending more soldiers teslyn he said still watching for vanin the whole army they have in the molvaine gap in fact enough of it anyway theyre more likely to use that than any other everything thom and juilin picked up says their big push is aimed at illian i think the army in the gap is to guard against anything coming at them out of murandy or andor but theyre the stopper in the jar for us i mean to pull that stopper out so we can pass through after several minutes of silence he looked over his shoulder the three women were just sitting their horses and watching him he wished he had enough light to make out their expressions why were they bloody staring he settled back to looking for vanin yet it seemed he could feel their eyes on his back perhaps two hours by the shifting of the fat crescent moon went by with the wind slowly picking up strength it was enough to take the night beyond cool into cold periodically he tried to make the women take shelter among the trees but they resisted stubbornly he had to remain to catch vanin without having to shoutthe lancers would be close behind the man perhaps very close if their commander was a foolbut they did not he suspected that teslyn refused because tuon and selucia did that made no sense but there it was as for why tuon refused he could not have said unless it was because she liked to listen to him arguing himself hoarse eventually the wind brought the sound of a running horse and he sat up straight in his saddle vanins dun cantered out of the night the bulky man as always an improbable sight in a saddle vanin drew rein and spat through a gap in his teeth theyre a mile or so behind me but theres maybe a thousand more than there was this morning whoevers in charge knows his business theyre pushing hard without blowing their horses if you be outnumbered two to one teslyn said perhaps you will reconsider i dont intend to give them a standup fight mat broke in and i cant afford to leave four thousand lancers loose to make trouble for me lets join mandevwin the kneeling crossbowmen on the slope of the northern hill made no sound when he rode through their line with the women and vanin just shuffled aside to let them through he would have preferred at least two ranks but he needed to cover a wide front the sparse trees did cut the wind but not by much and most of the men were huddled in their cloaks still every crossbow he could see was drawn with a bolt in place mandevwin had seen vanin arrive and knew what it meant the cairhienin was pacing just behind the line until mat appeared and swung down from pips mandevwin was relieved to hear that he no longer needed to keep a watch to his rear he merely nodded thoughtfully at hearing of a thousand more lancers than expected and sent a man racing off to bring the watchers down from the crest to take their places in the line if mat cauthon took it in stride so would he mat had forgotten that about the band they trusted him absolutely once that had almost made him break out in a rash tonight he was glad of it an owl hooted twice somewhere behind him and tuon sighed is there an omen in that he asked just for something to say im glad you are finally taking an interest toy perhaps i will be able to educate you yet her eyes were liquid in the moonlight an owl hooting twice means someone will die soon well that put a bloody end to conversation soon enough the seanchan appeared four abreast and leading their horses at a trot lances in hand vanin had been right about their commander knowing his job cantered for a time then led at a trot horses could cover a lot of ground quickly fools tried to gallop long distances and ended with dead or crippled horses only the first forty or so wore the segmented armor and strange helmets of seanchan a pity that he had no idea how the seanchan would feel about casualties to their altaran allies losses to their own would catch notice though when the middle of the column was right in front of him a deep voice on the road suddenly shouted banner halt those two words carried the familiar slurred drawl of the seanchan the men in segmented armor stopped sharply the others straggled to a halt mat drew breath now that had to be taveren work they could hardly have been better placed if he had given the order himself he rested a hand on teslyns shoulder she flinched slightly but he needed to get her attention quietly banner the deep voice shouted mount below soldiers moved to obey now mat said quietly the foxhead went cold on his chest and suddenly a ball of red light was floating high above the road bathing the soldiers below in an unearthly glow they had only a heartbeat to gape along the line below mat a thousand crossbow strings gave what sounded like one loud snap and a thousand bolts streaked into the formation punching through breastplates at that short range knocking men from their feet sending horses rearing and screaming just as a thousand more struck from the other side not every shot struck squarely but that hardly mattered with a heavy crossbow men went down with shattered legs with legs ripped half off men clutched at the stumps of ruined arms trying to stem the flow of blood men screamed as loudly as the horses he watched a crossbowman nearby as the fellow bent to fasten the paired hooks of the bulky boxlike crank hanging from a strap at the front of his belt to his crossbow string as the man straightened the cord streamed out of the crank but once he was erect he set the crank on the butt of the upended crossbow moved a small lever on the side of the box and began to work the handles three quick turns with a rough whirring sound and the string caught on the latch into the trees the deep voice shouted close with them before they can reload move some tried to mount to ride into the attack and others dropped reins and lances to draw swords none made it as far as the trees two thousand more bolts slashed into them cutting men down punching through men to kill men behind or topple horses on the hillside men began working their cranks furiously but there was no need on the road a horse kicked feebly here and there the only men moving were frantically trying to use whatever they had to hand for tourniquets to keep from bleeding to death the wind brought the sound of running horses some might have riders there were no more shouts from the deep voice mandevwin mat shouted were done here mount the men we have places to be you must stay to offer aid teslyn said firmly the rules of war do demand it this is a new kind of war he told her harshly light it was silent on the road but he could still hear the screaming theyll have to wait for their own to give them aid tuon murmured something half under her breath he thought it was a lion can have no mercy but that was ridiculous gathering his men he led them down the north side of the hill there was no need to let the survivors see how many they were in a few hours they would join up with the men from the other hill and in a few hours more with carlomin before sunrise they were going to hit the seanchan again he intended to make them run to pull that bloody stopper for him chapter twentyeight in maiden just before first light faile was fastening the wide belt of golden links around her waist for the last time when dairaine entered the small already crowded peaked tent where they all slept outside the sky would be starting to turn gray but inside it might still have been night failes eyes had adapted to the darkness though the slender little woman with black hair that spilled to her waist in waves was frowning around her yawns she had stood just below the high seat of her house in cairhien but she had been wakened in the night because sevanna could not sleep and wanted to be read to sevanna enjoyed dairaines voice and likely the tales she carried of supposed misdeeds among sevannas gaishain the cairhienin woman was never chosen out as one of those who had failed to please her hands went to her golden collar then hesitated when she took in faile alliandre and maighdin already dressed and on their feet i forgot to put the book back in the proper place she said in a voice like crystal chimes turning back toward the tentflap sevanna will have me beaten if she sees it out of place when she wakes shes lying maighdin growled and dairaine darted for outside that was enough to convince faile she grabbed the womans cowl and hauled her back into the tent dairaine opened her mouth to scream but alliandre clapped her hand over it and the three of them wrestled the woman to the blanketstrewn groundcloth it took all three dairaine was small but she writhed like a snake tried to claw at them to bite while the other two held the woman down faile produced the second knife she had secured a quite serviceable dagger with a ridged steel hilt and a blade longer than her hand and began slicing strips from one of the blankets how did you know alliandre said struggling to contain one of dairaines arms while keeping her mouth covered without being bitten maighdin had taken care of the womans legs by sitting on them and had her other arm twisted to her shoulder blades dairaine still managed to twist if uselessly she was frowning but when she spoke her face went smooth i could just make it out if she were really worried about being beaten shed have frowned harder not stopped the goldenhaired woman was not a very skilled ladys maid yet she was a very observant one but what made her suspicious maighdin shrugged maybe one of us looked surprised or guilty though i cant say how she could have noticed without any light soon enough they had dairaine trussed up with her ankles and wrists tied together behind her back she would not wriggle far like that a wadded length torn from her shift and tied in place with another piece of blanket served for a gag that let her emit only grunts she twisted her head to glare up at them faile could not see her face very well but the womans expression had to be either glaring or pleading and dairaine only pleaded with shaido she used her position as one of sevannas gaishain to bully gaishain who were not and her talecarrying to bully those who were the trouble was they could not leave her here someone might come at any moment to summon one of them to serve sevanna we can kill her and hide the body alliandre suggested smoothing her long hair it had become disarrayed in the struggle where maighdin said combing her own sungold hair with her fingers she did not sound a ladys maid speaking to a queen prisoners were equals in their captivity or else they aided their captors it had taken time to teach alliandre that it has to be somewhere she wont be found for at least a day sevanna might send men after galina to bring us back if were suspected of killing one of her belongings she vested that word with all the scorn it would bear and i dont trust galina not to let them bring us back dairaine began struggling against her bonds again and grunting harder than ever maybe she had decided to plead after all we arent going to kill her faile told them she was being neither squeamish nor merciful there simply was nowhere they could be sure a body would remain hidden long enough not that they could reach without being seen im afraid our plans have changed a little wait here ducking outside where the sky was indeed beginning to pearl she found what had made dairaine suspicious bain and chiad were there in their plain white robes as expected to escort them as far as the meeting place rolan and his friends might not be done breakfasting yetshe hoped they were not they might do something foolish and ruin everythingand bain and chiad had volunteered to divert any men who tried to interfere with them she had not been able to make herself ask how they intended to do that some sacrifices deserved a veil of secrecy and all of a hearts gratitude two gaishain holding wicker baskets were not enough to rouse suspicion in the cairhienin woman but thirty or forty gaishain were crowding the narrow muddy lane through the gaishain tents aravines plump plain face watched her from a white cowl and lusaras beautiful one alvon was there with his son theril in their robes of muddy tentcloth and alainia a plump amadician silversmith in dirty coarse white linen and dormin a stocky cairhienin bootmaker and corvila a lean weaver from right here in altara and they represented not a tenth part of those who had sworn to her but a gathering of gaishain this large would have planted suspicion in a stone at least when added to the three of them being dressed dairaine likely had heard who had been summoned to sevanna this morning how had they learned she was leaving today it was too late to worry about that if any shaido knew they would all have been dragged from the tent before this what are you doing here she demanded we wanted to see you go my lady theril said in his rough barely intelligible accents we were very careful to come by ones and twos lusara nodded happily and she was not the only one well we can say goodbye now faile said firmly no need to tell them how close they had come to ruining the escape until i come back for you if her father would not give her an army then perrin would his friendship with rand althor would provide it light where was he no she had to be glad he had not caught up yet had not gotten himself killed trying to sneak into the camp and rescue her she had to be glad and not think of what might be delaying him now go before someone sees you here and runs to tell tales and dont talk to anyone about this her adherents were safe enough otherwise she would already be chained but there were too many like dairaine among the gaishain and not only among the longheld cairhienin some people naturally set to licking wrists wherever they were they bowed or curtsied or knuckled their foreheads just as if nobody might be poking their heads out to see and scattered in every direction with chagrined expressions they really had expected to watch her leave she had no time to fritter away on exasperation hurrying to bain and chiad she hastily explained the situation inside the tent they exchanged glances when she finished and put down the baskets to free fingers for maiden handtalk she avoided looking at their hands since they plainly wanted privacy not that she could have understood much in any case their hands moved very fast flamehaired bain with her dark blue eyes stood nearly half a hand taller than she grayeyed chiad just a finger taller they were her close friends but they had adopted each other as firstsisters and that created bonds closer than any friendship we will take care of dairaine saighan chiad said at last but it means you must go into the town alone faile sighed but there was no helping it perhaps rolan was already awake he could be watching her that minute he always seemed to appear out of nowhere when she needed him surely he would not interfere with her leaving not when he had promised to take her when he himself left yet he still had hopes so long as she wore white him and his kissing games he might want to keep her in gaishain robes a little longer when men wanted to help they always thought their way was the only way bain and chiad ducked into the small peaked tent and alliandre and maighdin came out there really was not room inside for five maighdin went around the side of the tent and returned with a basket like those the other women had been carrying dirty gaishain robes bulged out of the top of each making them appear loads of laundry but beneath were dresses that came near enough fitting a hatchet a sling cords for making snares flint and steel packets of flour meal dried beans salt and yeast a few coins they had been able to find everything they would need to make their way west to find perrin galina would take them out of the camp but there was no saying which direction her aes sedai business would take her then they had to be selfreliant from the start faile would not put it past the aes sedai to abandon them as soon as she was able maighdin stood over her basket with an air of determination her jaw set and her eyes firm but alliandres face was wreathed in smiles try not to look so happy faile told her wetlander gaishain seldom smiled and never so joyfully alliandre tried to moderate her expression but every time she smoothed her smiles away they crept back were escaping today she said its hard not to smile youll stop if some wise one sees you and decides to find out why youre happy were hardly likely to meet a wise one among the gaishain tents or in maiden the woman said through a smile determined or not maighdin nodded agreement faile gave up in truth she felt a little giddy herself in spite of dairaine they were escaping today bain came out of the tent holding the tentflap for chiad who was carrying on her back a blanketwrapped bundle just large enough to be a small woman doubledup chiad was strong but she had to lean forward a little to support the weight why is she so still faile asked she had no fear they had killed dairaine they were fierce about following the rules for gaishain and violence was forbidden but that blanket could have been full of wood for all that it moved bain spoke softly an amused light in her eyes i stroked her hair and told her i would be very upset if i had to hurt her simple truth considering how much toh even slapping her would cost me chiad chuckled i think dairaine saighan thought we were threatening her i think she will be very quiet and very still until we let her go she shook with silent laughter aiel humor was still a mystery to faile she knew they would be punished severely for this though aiding an escape attempt was dealt with as harshly as trying to escape you have all my gratitude she said you and chiad both now and forever i have great toh she kissed bain lightly on the cheek which made the woman blush as red as her hair of course aiel were almost prudishly restrained in public in some ways bain glanced at chiad and a faint smile appeared on her lips when you see gaul tell him chiad is gaishain to a man with strong hands a man whose heart is fire he will understand i need to help her carry our burden to a safe place may you always find water and shade faile bashere she touched failes cheek lightly with her fingertips one day we will meet again going over to chiad she took one end of the blanket and they hurried away carrying it between them gaul might understand but faile did not not the heart of fire anyway and she doubted that manderics hands interested chiad in the slightest the man had bad breath and started getting drunk as soon as he woke unless he was going on a raid or hunting but she put gaul and manderic out of her mind and shouldered her basket they had wasted too much time already the sky was beginning to take on the appearance of actual daylight and gaishain were stirring among the wildly diverse tents of the camp close on maidens walls scurrying off to be about some chore or at least carrying something to give a semblance of working but none paid any mind to three women in white carrying baskets of laundry toward the towns gates there always seemed to be laundry to be done even for sevannas gaishain there were far too many wetlander gaishain for faile to know everyone and she saw no one she knew until they came on arrela and lacile shifting from foot to foot with baskets on their shoulders taller than most aiel women and dark arrela kept her black hair cut as short as any maiden and strode like a man when she walked lacile was short and pale and slim and had red ribbons tied in her hair which was not much longer her walk was graceful in robes and had been a scandalous sway when she had worn breeches their sighs of relief were nearly identical though we thought something had happened arrela said nothing we couldnt handle faile told her where are bain and chiad lacile asked anxiously they have another task faile said we go alone they exchanged glances and their sighs were far from relieved this time of course rolan would not interfere not with them getting away of course not the ironstrapped gates of maiden stood open shoved back against the granite walls as they had since the city fell rust had turned the broad iron straps brown and the hinges were so rusty that pushing the gates shut again might be impossible pigeons nested in the gray stone towers flanking them now they were the first to arrive at least faile could see no one ahead of them down the street as they walked through the gates she retrieved her dagger from the pockec inside her sleeve and held it with the blade pressed against her wrist pointing up her arm the other women made similar motions if not so deftly without bain and chiad and hoping that rolan and his friends were otherwise occupied they had to provide their own protection maiden was not as dangerous for a womanfor a gaishain woman shaido who tried to prey on their own got short shriftnot as dangerous as the shaido portion of the camp yet women had been assaulted there sometimes by groups of men the light send if they were accosted it was only by one or two one or two they might catch by surprise and kill before they realized these gaishain had teeth if there were more than two they would do what they could but an aiel weaver or potter was as dangerous as most trained armsmen baskets or no baskets they walked on their toes heads swiveling ready to spring in any direction this part of the town had not been burned yet it had a look of desolation broken dishes and potter crunched beneath their soft white boots bits of clothing cut off men and women made gaishain still littered the gray paving stones those sorry bedraggled rags had lain first in the snow and then in the rain for well over a month and she doubted any ragpicker would have gathered them now here and there lay childrens toys a wooden horse or a doll whose paint was beginning to flake dropped by the very young who had been allowed to flee like the very old the ill and infirm slateroofed buildings of wood or stone along the street showed gaping holes where their doors and windows had been along with anything the shaido considered valuable or useful the town had been stripped of every easily removable piece of wood and only the fact that tearing down houses was less efficient than cutting firewood in the surrounding forests had spared the wooden structures themselves those openings minded faile of eye sockets in skulls she had walked along this street countless times yet this morning they seemed to be watching her they made her scalp crawl halfway across the town she looked back toward the gates no more than a hundred and fifty paces behind the street was still empty for the moment but soon the first whiteclad men and women would materialize with their water buckets fetching water was a task that began early and lasted all day they had to hurry now turning down a narrower side street she started to walk faster although she had trouble keeping her basket balanced the others must have been having the same difficulty yet no one complained they had to be out of sight before those gaishain appeared there was no reason for any gaishain entering the town to leave the main street until they reached the cistern below the fortress an attempt to curry favor or just a careless word could send shaido into the town hunting for them and there was only one way out short of climbing onto the walls and dropping ten paces to the ground hoping that no one broke a leg at a now signless inn three stories of stone and empty windows she darted into the common room followed by the others lacile set down her basket and pressed herself against the doorframe to keep watch up the street the beamceilinged room was bare to the dusty floorboards and the stone fireplaces were missing their andirons and firetools the railing had been stripped from the staircase at the back of the room and the door to the kitchen was gone too the kitchen was just as empty she had checked pots and knives and spoons were useful faile lowered her basket to the floor and hurried to the side of the staircase it was a sturdy piece of work of heavy timbers and made to last for generations tearing it down would have been nearly as hard as tearing down a house she felt underneath along the top of the wide outer support and her hand closed on the wristthick not quite glassy rod it had seemed as good a hiding place as she could find a place no one would have any reason to look but she was surprised to find she had been holding her breath lacile remained by the doorway but the others hurried to faile without their baskets at last alliandre said gingerly touching the rod with her fingertips the price of our freedom what is it an angreal faile said or perhaps a terangreal i dont know for certain except that galina wants it very badly so it must be one or the other maighdin put her hand on the rod boldly it could be either she murmured they often have an odd feel so ive been told anyway she claimed never to have been to the white tower but faile was not so sure as she once had been maighdin could channel but so weakly and with so much difficulty that the wise ones saw no danger in letting her walk free well as free as any gaishain was her denials might well be a matter of shame faile had heard that women who had been put out of the tower because they could not become aes sedai sometimes denied ever having gone in order to hide their failure arrela gave a shake of her head and backed away a step she was tairen and despite traveling with aes sedai she was still uncomfortable over the power or anything to do with it she looked at the smooth white rod as if at a red adder and licked her lips galina might be waiting on us she might get angry if we make her wait long is the way still clear lacile faile asked as she stuck the rod far down into her basket arrela exhaled heavily clearly as relieved at having the thing out of her sight as she had been to see faile earlier yes the cairhienin replied but i do not understand why she still stood so that one eye could peek around the corner of the doorframe the first gaishain should be coming for water by now maybe something has happened in the camp maighdin said suddenly her face was grim and her knife was in her hand a woodenhandled affair with a chipped and pitted blade faile nodded slowly maybe something such as dairaine having been found already she could not tell where faile and the others had been going but she might have recognized some among the waiting gaishain how long would they hold out if put to the question how long would alvon hold out if theril were theres nothing we can do about it in any case galina will get us out even so when they left the inn they ran carrying the baskets in front of them and trying to hold up their long robes so they did not trip faile was not the only one to look over her shoulder frequently and stumble she was not sure whether or not she was relieved to finally see gaishain carrying buckets on yokes drift across the crossing of the towns main street she certainly did not slow down they did not have far to run in moments the smell of charred wood that had faded from the rest of maiden began to grow the southern end of maiden was a ruin they halted at the edge of the devastation and edged around a corner so they would not be seen by anyone glancing down the street from where they stood to the southern wall near two hundred paces marched roofless shells with blackened stone walls interspersed with piles of charred beams washed clean of ash by the rains in places not even the heaviest timbers remained only on the south side of this street were there any structures even close to whole this was where the fire that raged after the shaido took the city had been finally stopped half a dozen buildings stood without roofs though the lower floors looked intact and twice as many were leaning piles of black timbers and halfburned boards that appeared on the edge of collapse there maighdin said pointing east along the street a long length of red cloth fluttered in the breeze where she pointed it was tied to a house that seemed ready to fall in walking to it slowly they rested their baskets on the paving stones the red cloth fluttered again why would she want to meet us here alliandre muttered that could cave in if anybody sneezed she rubbed at her nose as though the word had given her the urge it is quite sound i inspected it galinas voice behind them jerked failes head around the woman was striding toward them plainly from one of the sound buildings on the north side of the street after so long seeing her in that belt and collar of gold and firedrops she looked odd without them she still wore her white silk robes but the absence of the jewelry was convincing galina had not somehow managed to turn truth on its head she was leaving today why not in one of the sound buildings faile demanded or right here because i dont want anyone to see it in my hands galina said walking past her because no one will look inside that ruin because i say so she stepped through what had been a doorway ducking under a heavy charred roof beam that slanted across the opening and immediately turned to her right and began descending stairs dont dawdle faile exchanged looks with the other women this was more than passing strange if shell get us out of here alliandre growled snatching up her basket im willing to hand her the thing in a privy still she waited on faile to pick up her own basket and lead the way charred timbers and blackened boards hung low over the stone stairs that led downward but galinas ease at entering reassured faile the woman would not risk being buried alive or crushed at the very moment she finally gained the rod bars and beams of light filtering through gaps in the wreckage gave enough illumination to show that the basement was quite clear despite the treacherous nature of what lay above large barrels stacked along one stone wall most scorched and with staves sprung from the heat said this had been an inn or a tavern or perhaps a wine merchants shop the area around maiden had produced a great deal of mediocre wine galina stood in the middle of the gritcovered stone floor in a small beam of light her face was all aes sedai calm her agitation of the previous day completely subdued where is it she said coolly give it to me faile set her basket down and shoved her hand deep inside when she brought out the white rod galinas hands twitched faile extended the rod toward her and she reached for it almost hesitantly if she had not known better faile would have said she was afraid to touch it galinas fingers closed around the rod and she exhaled heavily she jerked the rod away before faile could release it the aes sedai seemed to be trembling but her smile was triumphant how do you intend to get us away from the camp faile asked should we change our clothes now galina opened her mouth then suddenly raised her free hand palm out her head tilted toward the stairs as if listening it may be nothing she said softly but its best if i check wait here and be quiet be quiet she hissed when faile started to speak lifting the hem of her silk robes the aes sedai scurried to the stairs and started up like a woman uneasy about what she might find at the top her feet passed out of sight behind the sagging boards and beams did any of you hear anything faile whispered they all shook their heads maybe shes holding the power ive heard that can she wasnt maighdin interrupted ive never seen her embracing suddenly wood groaned overhead and with a thunderous crash charred beams and boards collapsed sending out blinding billows of black dust and grit that sent faile into paroxysms of coughing the smell of charring suddenly was as thick in the air as it had been the day maiden burned something falling from above hit her shoulder hard and she crouched trying to protect her head someone cried out she heard other falling objects hit the basements stone floor boards or pieces of boards nothing made a loud enough noise to be a roof beam or a heavy joist eventuallyit seemed like hours it might have been minutes the rain of debris stopped the dust began to thin quickly she looked around for her companions and found them all huddling on the floor with their arms around their heads there seemed to be more light than before a little more some of the gaps overhead were wider now a trickle of blood ran down alliandres face from her scalp everyone was dusted with black from head to foot is anyone injured faile asked finishing with a cough the dust had not cleared completely and her throat and tongue felt coated with it the stuff tasted like charcoal no alliandre said touching her scalp gingerly a scrape thats all the others denied injury as well though arrela seemed to be moving her right arm carefully no doubt they had all suffered bruises and faile thought her left shoulder was going to be black and blue shortly but she would not count that a real injury then her eyes fell on the stairs and she wanted to weep wreckage from above filled the whole space where the staircase had been they might have been able to squeeze through some of the gaps overhead faile thought she could reach them standing on arrelas shoulders but she doubted she could pull herself through with one good arm or that arrela could and if either managed she would be in the middle of a burnedout ruin and likely as not to make the rest of the thing fall in too no alliandre moaned not now not when we were so close rising she rushed as near to the rubble as she could get almost pressing against it and began to shout galina help us were trapped channel and lift the boards away clear a path for us to get out galina galina galina she sagged against the tangle of timbers shoulders shaking galina she wept galina help us galinas gone faile said bitterly the woman would have answered if she was still above or had any intention of aiding them with us trapped down here maybe dead she has the perfect excuse for leaving us behind anyway i dont know whether an aes sedai could move some of those timbers if she tried she did not want to mention the possibility that galina had arranged that excuse herself light she should never have slapped the woman it was too late for selfrecrimination though what are we going to do now arrela asked dig ourselves out faile and maighdin said at the same instant faile looked at the other woman in surprise her maids dirty face wore a queens resolve yes alliandre said straightening she turned around and if runnels of teartracks marked the dust on her face no new tears appeared she really was a queen and could not like being shamed by the courage of a ladys maid well dig ourselves out and if we fail if we fail i will not die wearing thht unfastening her golden belt she flung it contemptuously into a corner of the basement her golden collar followed well need those to make our way through the shaido camp faile said gently galina may not be taking us out but i intend leaving today dairaine made that imperative bain and chiad could not keep her hidden long or as soon we can dig out anyway well pretend weve been sent to pick berries she did not want to step on her liegewomans bold gesture though however we dont need to wear them now removing her belt and collar she righted her basket and set them atop the dirty gaishain robes the others emulated her alliandre retrieved her own belt and collar with a rueful laugh at least she could laugh again faile wished she could the jumble of charred timbers and halfburned boards filling the staircase resembled one of those blacksmiths puzzles her perrin enjoyed almost everything seemed to be propping up something else worse the heavier timbers might be beyond all of them working together but if they could clear enough for them to be able to crawl through writhing between the thick beams it would be dangerous that crawl but when a dangerous path was your only route to safety you had to take it a few boards came away easily and were piled at the back of the basement but after that everything had to be chosen with care examined to see whether anything would fall if it were removed hands feeling back as far as they could go into the tangle groping for nails that might have caught trying not think about the whole pile shifting and trapping an arm crushing it only then could they begin pulling sometimes two of them together tugging harder and harder until the piece suddenly gave that work went slowly with the great pile occasionally groaning or shifting slightly everyone darted back holding their breath when that happened nobody moved again until they were sure the snarl of timbers was not going to collapse the work became the focus of their world once faile thought she heard wolves howling wolves generally made her think of perrin but not this time the work was all then alliandre wrenched a charred board free and with a great groan the mass began to shift toward them everyone ran toward the back of the basement as the pile fell in with a deafening rumble sending up more billows of dust when they stopped coughing and could see again dimly with dust still hanging in the air perhaps a quarter of the basement was filled all of their work undone and worse the jumble was leaning toward them precariously groaning it sagged a little more toward them and stopped everything about it said the first board pulled free would bring the whole mass down on their heads arrela began to cry softly tantalizing gaps admitted sunlight and allowed them to see the street the sky but nothing anyone could wriggle through even lacile faile could see the red scarf galina had used to mark the building it fluttered for a moment in the breeze staring at the scarf she seized maighdins shoulder i want you to try to make that scarf do something the wind wouldnt make it do you want to attract attention alliandre said hoarsely its far more likely to be shaido than anyone else better that than dying down here of thirst faile replied her voice harsher than she wanted she would never see perrin again then if sevanna had her chained she would at least be alive for him to rescue he would rescue her she knew it her duty now was to keep the women who followed her alive and if that meant captivity so be it maighdin i might spend all day trying to embrace the source and never succeed the sunhaired woman said in dull tones she stood slumped staring at nothing her face suggested that she saw an abyss beneath her feet and if i do embrace it i can almost never weave anything faile loosened her grip on maighdin and smoothed her hair instead i know its difficult she said soothingly well in truth i dont know ive never done it but you have and you can do it again our lives depend on you maighdin i know the strength thats in you ive seen it time and again there is no surrender in you i know you can do it and so do you slowly maighdins back straightened and despair slid off her face she might still see the abyss but if she fell she would fall without flinching ill try she said for a long while she stared up at the scarf then shook her head dejectedly the source is there like the sun just beyond the edge of sight she whispered but every time i try to embrace it its like trying to catch smoke with my fingers faile hastily pulled the gaisbain robes from her basket and another careless of the gold belts and collars falling to the stone floor sit down she said arranging the robes in a pile make yourself comfortable i know you can do it maighdin pressing the other woman down she folded her legs and sat beside her you can do it alliandre said softly sitting down on maighdins other side yes you can lacile whispered joining them i know you can arrela said as she lowered herself to the floor time passed with maighdin staring at the scarf faile whispered encouragement and held onto hope hard suddenly the scarf went rigid as if something had pulled it taut a wondrous smile appeared on maighdins face as the scarf began to swing back and forth like a pendulum six seven eight times it swung then it fluttered in the breeze and fell limp that was marvelous faile said marvelous alliandre said you re going to save us maighdin yes arrela murmured youre going to save us maighdin there were many kinds of battle sitting on the floor whispering encouragement maighdin fighting to find what she could seldom find they fought for their lives while the scarf swung then fell to the breeze swung and fell limp but they fought on galina kept her head down and tried not to hurry as she made her way out of maiden past the streams of whiteclad men and women carrying empty buckets into the town and full buckets back out she did not want to attract attention not without that cursed belt and necklace she had donned the things when she dressed in the night while therava was still asleep but it had been such a pleasure to remove them and hide them with the clothes and other things she had secreted away for her escape that she could not resist besides therava would have been angered to wake and find her missing she would have ordered a watch for her little lina and everyone marked her by those jewels well they would pay to help her return to the tower now return to her rightful place that arrogant faile and the other fools were dead or asgood as and she was free she stroked the rod hidden in her sleeve and shivered with delight free she did hate leaving therava alive but if anyone had entered the womans tent and found her with a knife through her heart galina would have been the first suspect besides images rose in her head of her bending stealthily over the sleeping therava the womans own belt knife in hand of theravas eyes snapping open meeting hers in the darkness of her screaming of her hand opening nervelessly to drop the knife of her begging of therava no no it would not have been that way certainly not she had left therava alive of necessity not because she was not for any other reason suddenly wolves howled wolves in every direction a dozen or more her feet stopped of their own accord a motley collection of tents surrounded her walled tents peaked tents low aiel tents she had walked right through the gaishain portion of the camp without realizing it her eyes rose to the ridge west of maiden and she flinched thick fog curled along the whole length of it concealing the trees as far as she could see in either direction the town walls hid the ridge to the east yet she was sure there would be thick fog there too the man had come the great lord preserve her she had been just in time well he would not find his fool wife even if he managed to survive whatever he was about to try nor would he find galina casban thanking the great lord that therava had not forbidden her to ridethe woman had much preferred dangling the possibility that she might be allowed if she groveled sufficientlygalina hurried toward her hidden stores let the fools who wanted to die here die she was free free chapter twentynine the last knot perrin stood just below the ridgetop near the edge of the fog and studied the encampment and stonewalled town below two hundred paces of fairly steep slope sparsely dotted with low brush down to level ground perhaps seven hundred more of cleared ground to the first tents then better than a mile to the town it seemed so close now he did not use his looking glass a glint off the lens from the sun just peeking over the horizon a fingernail edge of goldenred might ruin everything the grayness around him curled but did not really move with the breeze even when it gusted and made his cloak stir the dense mist on the far ridge obscuring the windmill there seemed too still as well if you studied it a while how long before someone among those tents noticed there was nothing to be done for it the fog felt like any fog damp and a little cool but somehow neald had fixed these mists in place before he went off to his other tasks the sun would not burn them off even at noonday or so the ashaman claimed everything would be done by noon one way or another but perrin hoped the man was right the sky was clear and the day looked to be warm for early spring only a few shaido seemed to be outside in the camp relatively speaking but thousands of whiteclad figures bustled about among the tents tens of thousands his eyes ached to find faile among them his heart ached to see her but he could as well try to pick out one particular pin from a barleybasket of them spilled on the ground instead he stared at the towns gates standing wide open as they had every time he had gazed on them invitingly wide they called to him soon faile and her companions would know it was time to head for those gates and the towered fortress that bulked at the north end of the town she might be at chores if the maidens were right about how the prisoners would be treated as gaishain but she would know to slip away and go to the fortress she and her friends and likely alyse as well whatever her scheme with the shaido the aes sedai would not want to remain on a battleground a second sister in the fortress might come in handy the light send it did not come to that he had planned with care for every eventuality he could imagine down to outright disaster yet this was no blacksmiths puzzle however much he wished it were the twisted iron pieces of a blacksmiths puzzle moved only in certain ways move them in the right way and the puzzle came apart people could move in a thousand ways sometimes in directions you never believed possible till it happened would his plans stand up when the shaido did something unexpected they would do it almost certainly and all he could do in return was hope it would not lead to that disaster with a last longing look at maidens gates he turned and walked back up the ridge inside the fog even he could not see ten paces but he soon found dannil lewin among the trees on the ridgetop lean to the point of skinny with a pickaxe for a nose and thick mustaches in the taraboner style dannil stood out even when you could not see his face clearly other two rivers men were shapes beyond him growing dimmer and dimmer with distance most were squatting or sitting on the ground resting while they had the chance jori congar was trying to entice some of the others into a game of dice but he was quiet about it so perrin let it pass no one was accepting the offer anyway jori was uncommon lucky with his dice dannil made a leg when he saw perrin and murmured my lord the man had been spending too much time with failes people he called it acquiring polish whatever that was supposed to mean a man was not a piece of brass make sure nobody does anything woolhead foolish like i just did dannil sharp eyes below might spot movement near the edge of the fog and send men to investigate dannil coughed discreetly into his hand light he was getting as bad as any of those cairhienin and tairens as you say my lord ill keep everybody back my lord balwers dry voice said out of the mist ah there you are my lord the little stick of a man appeared followed by two larger shapes though one was not much taller they halted at a gesture from him indistinct forms in the fog and he came on alone masema has put in an appearance below my lord he said quietly folding his hands i thought it best to keep haviar and nerion out of his sight and his mens under the circumstances i dont believe he is suspicious of them i think he has anyone he is suspicious of killed but out of sight out of mind is best perrins jaw tightened masema was supposed to be beyond the eastern ridge with his army if it could be called that he had counted those menand a few womenas they shuffled uneasily through gateways made by the two ashaman and they were twenty thousand if they were one masema had always been vague about their numbers and perrin had not had an accurate count until last night ragged and dirty only one here or there wore a helmet much less a breastplate but every hand had gripped sword or spear or axe halberd or crossbow the women included the women among masemas followers were worse than the men by far and that was saying something for the most part the lot of them were only good for terrorizing people into swearing to follow the dragon rebornthe colors whirled in his head and were shattered by his angerthat and murdering them if they refused they had a better purpose today maybe its time for haviar and nerion to start staying away from masemas people for good he said jf you wish it my lord but in my judgment they still are as safe as any man can be doing what they do and theyre eager baiwer tilted his head a curious sparrow in a branch they havent been corrupted if thats what you fear my lord thats always a danger when you send a man to pretend to be what he isnt but i have a keen nose for the signs keep them close baiwer after today with luck there might not be much of masemas army left to spy on in any case there might not even be a masema to worry about perrin scrambled down the brushy reverse slope past where the mayener and ghealdanin lancers were waiting beside their horses in the thick mist streamered lances propped on their shoulders or steel heads driven into the ground the winged guards redpainted helmets and breastplates might have been safe enough on the ridgetop but not the ghealdanins burnished armor and since gallenne and arganda both bristled if one was favored over the other both waited here the fog extended quite some distanceneald claimed that was intentional but the man had smelled surprised and pleased when he realized what he had doneso perrin was still walking through grayness when he reached the bottom of the ridge where all of the highwheeled carts stood in a line with horses hitched the dim figures of the cairhienin cart drivers moved about them checking harness tightening the ropes that held the canvas covers on masema was waiting and perrin wanted nothing so much as to chew off the mans arm but he spotted the stout shape of basel gill beside one of the carts and headed that way lini was with him wrapped in a dark cloak and breane with her arm around the waist of lamgwin perrins hulking manservant master gill snatched off his brimmed hat to reveal thin graying hair combed back over a bald spot that it failed to cover lini sniffed and pointedly avoided looking at perrin while pretending to adjust her cowl she smelled of anger and fear master gill just smelled of fear its time for you to start north master gill perrin said when you reach the mountains follow them until you strike the jehannah road with luck well catch you up before you reach the mountains but if not send alliandres servants off to jehannah then you head east through the pass then north again well be as close behind you as we can if his plan did not go too far awry light he was a blacksmith not a soldier but even tylee had finally agreed it was a good plan i will not leave this spot until i know that maighdin is safe lini told the fog her thin voice a reed of iron and the lady faile of course master gill rubbed a hand back over his head my lord lamgwin and i were thinking maybe we could help out the lady faile means a great deal to us and maighdin maighdin is one of our own i know one end of a sword from the other and so does lamgwin he was wearing one belted around his bulk yet if he had handled a sword these past twenty years perrin would eat the whole great length of that belt breanes grip on lamgwin tightened but the big man patted her shoulder and rested his other hand on the hilt of a shortsword the fog obscured his scarred face and sunken knuckles he was a tavern brawler though a good man even so but never a swordsman youre my shambayan master gill perrin said firmly its your duty to get the cart drivers and grooms and servants to safety yours and lamgwins now go on with you and see to it the stout man nodded reluctantly breane breathed a small sigh of relief when lamgwin knuckled his forehead in acquiescence perrin doubted that the man could have heard the sigh though lamgwin put his arm around her and murmured comforting words lini was not so compliant back stiff as a rod she addressed the fog again i will not leave this spot until i know perrin slapped his hands together with a loud crack startling her into looking at him in surprise all you can do here is catch the ague from standing in the damp that and die if the shaido manage to break through ill bring faile out ill bring maighdin and the others out he would or die himself in the attempt there was no point saying that though and reason not to they had to believe in their bones that he would be following with faile and the rest and you are going north lini faile will be upset with me if i let anything happen to you master gill you make sure she rides with you if you have to tie her up and put her in the back of a cart master gill jerked crumpling his hat between his hands he smelled of alarm suddenly and lini of pure indignation amusement filled lamgwins scent and he rubbed at his nose as though concealing a smile but strangely breane was indignant too well he had never claimed to understand women if he could not understand the woman he was married to which he could not half the time then it was unlikely he ever would understand the rest of them in the end lini actually climbed up beside the driver of a cart without having to be forced though she slapped away master gills hand when he tried to assist her and the line of carts began to trundle off northward though the fog behind one of the carts laden with the wise ones tents and possessions marched a cluster of whiteclad gaishain meek even now men and women with their cowls up and their eyes lowered they were shaido taken at cairhien and in a few months they would put off white and return to their clan perrin had had them watched discreetly despite the wise ones assurances that they would adhere to jietoh in this regard whatever others they abandoned yet it appeared the wise ones were right they still numbered seventeen none had tried to run off and warn the shaido beyond the ridge the carts axles had been greased liberally but they still creaked and squealed to his ears with luck he and faile would catch up to them shy of the mountains as the strings of spare horses began to pass him on long leads held by mounted grooms a maiden appeared in the mist coming down the line of carts slowly she resolved into sulin shoufa around her neck to bare her short white hair and black veil hanging down onto her chest a fresh slash across her left cheek would add another scar to her face unless she accepted healing from one of the sisters she might not maidens seemed to have odd attitudes about wise ones apprentices or maybe it was just that these apprentices were aes sedai they even saw annoura as an apprentice though she was not the shaido sentries to the north are dead perrin aybara she said and the men who were going out to replace them they danced well for shaido you took casualties he asked quietly elienda and briain woke from the dream she might have been speaking of the weather rather than two deaths among women she knew we all must wake eventually we had to carry aviellin the last two miles she will need healing so she would accept it ill send one of the aes sedai with you he said looking around in the fog aside from the line of horses passing him he could see nothing as soon as i can find one they found him almost as he spoke annoura and masuri striding out of the fog leading their horses with berelain and masema his shaven head glistening damply even in the mist there was no mistaking the rumpled nature of the mans brown coat or the crude darn on the shoulder none of the gold his followers looted stuck to his hands it all went to the poor that was the only good that could be said of masema but then a fair number of the poor that gold went to feed had been made poor by having their possessions stolen and their shops or farms burned by masemas people for some reason berelain was wearing the coronet of the first of mayene this morning the golden hawk in flight above her brow though her riding dress and cloak were plain dark gray beneath her light flowery perfume her scent was patience and anxiety as odd a combination as perrin had ever smelled the six wise ones were with them too dark shawls draped over their arms folded kerchiefs around their temples holding back their long hair with all their necklaces and bracelets of gold and ivory they made berelain appear simply dressed for once aram was one of their number as well the wolfhead pommel of his sword rising above one redstriped shoulder and the fog could not hide the absence of his habitual glower the man gravitated toward masema and seemed almost to bask in some light that masema gave off perrin wondered whether he should have sent aram with the carts but if he had he was sure aram would have leaped off and sneaked back as soon as he was out of perrins sight he explained aviellins need to the two aes sedai but to his surprise when masuri said she would come fairhaired edarra raised a hand that stopped the slim brown in her tracks annoura shifted uncomfortably she was no apprentice and uneasy over seonid and masuris relationship with the wise ones they tried to include her in it and sometimes succeeded janina will see to it edarra said she has more skill than you masuri sokawa masuris mouth tightened but she kept silent the wise ones were quite capable of switching an apprentice for speaking up at the wrong time even if she did happen to be an aes sedai sulin led janina a flaxenhaired woman who never seemed to be ruffled by anything off into the fog janina striding as quickly as sulin despite her bulky skirts so the wise ones had learned healing had they that might be useful later in the day the light send it was not needed often watching the pair disappear into the murk masema grunted the thick mist hid the everburning intensity of his deepset eyes and obscured the triangular white scar on his cheek but his scent was full in perrins nose hard and sharp as a freshly stropped razor yet twitching in a frenzy that smell of madness sometimes made him think his nose must bleed from breathing it bad enough you use these blasphemous women who do what only the lord dragon blessed be his name may do masema said his voice full of the heat that the fog concealed in his eyes the colors spinning in perrins head turned into a brief image of rand and min and a tall man in a black coat an ashaman and he felt a shock right down to his boots rands left hand was gone no matter whatever had happened had happened and today his business lay elsewhere but if they know healing masema continued it will be that much harder to kill the savages a pity you wont let the seanchan leash all of them his sidelong glance at annoura and masuri said he included them despite the fact both had visited him in secret more than once they regarded him with aes sedai calm though masuris slim hands moved once as if to smooth her brown skirts she said she had changed her mind and now believed the man must be killed so why was she meeting him why was annoura why did masema allow them he more than hated aes sedai perhaps answers could be found now that haviar and nerion no longer needed protection behind masema the wise ones stirred firehaired carelle who looked as if she possessed a temper though she did not actually stroked the hilt of her belt knife and nevarin who could have given nynaeve lessons in getting angry gripped hers masema should have felt those eyes boring into his back but his scent never shifted insane he might be but never a coward you wanted to speak to lord perrin my lord prophet berelain said gently though perrin could smell the strain of her smile masema stared at her i am simply the prophet of the lord dragon not a lord the lord dragon is the only lord now his coming has shattered all bonds and destroyed all titles king and queens lords and ladies are but dust beneath his feet those whirling hues threatened again but perrin crushed them what are you doing here he demanded there was no way to soften moments with masema the man was as hard as a good file youre supposed to be with your men you risked being seen by coming here and youll risk it again going back i dont trust your people to hold for five minutes without you there to stiffen their spines theyll run as soon as they see the shaido coming their way they are not my people aybara they are the lord dragons people light being around masema meant having to stomp on those colors every few minutes i left nengar in charge he has fought more battles than you have dreamed of including against the savages i also gave the women orders to kill any man who tries to run and have let it be known that i will hunt down anyone who escapes the women they will hold to the last man aybara you sound as if youre not going back perrin said i intend to stay close to you fog might hide the heat in masemas eyes but perrin could feel it a pity if any misfortune should befall you just as you reclaim your wife so a small part of his plan had unraveled already a hope really rather than part of the plan if all else went well the shaido who managed to flee would carve a way through masemas people without more than slowing a step but instead of taking a shaido spear through his ribs masema would be keeping an eye on him without any doubt the mans bodyguard was not far off in the fog two hundred or so ruffians better armed and better mounted than the rest of his army perrin did not look at berelain but the scent of her worry had strengthened masema had reason to want both of them dead he would warn gallenne that his primary task today would be protecting berelain from masemas men and he would have to watch his own back off in the fog a brief flash of silverblue light appeared and he frowned it was too early yet for grady two figures coalesced out of the mist one was neald not strutting for once in fact he stumbled his face looked tired burn him why was he wasting his strength this way the other was a young seanchan in lacquered armor with a single thin plume on the peculiar helmet he carried beneath his arm perrin recognized him gueye arabah a lieutenant tylee thought well of the two aes sedai gathered their skirts as if to keep him from brushing against them though he went nowhere near them for his part he missed a step when he came close enough to make out their faces and perrin heard him swallow hard he smelled skittish of a sudden arabahs bow included perrin and berelain and he frowned slightly at masema as though wondering what such a ragged fellow was doing in their company masema sneered and the seanchans free hand drifted toward his sword hilt before he stopped it they seemed touchy folk seanchan did but arabah did not waste time bannergeneral khirgans compliments my lord my lady first moratraken report those bands of aiel are moving faster than expected they will arrive some time today possibly as soon as noon the group to the west is perhaps twentyfive or thirty thousand the one to the east larger by a third about half of them are wearing white and there will be children of course but that is still a lot of spears to have behind you the bannergeneral wishes to know if you would like to discuss altering the deployments she suggests moving a few thousand of the altaran lancers to join you perrin grimaced there would be at least three or four thousand algaldshwai with each of those bands a lot of spears to have at his back for certain sure neald yawned how are you feeling neald oh im ready to do whatever needs doing i am my lord the man said with just a hint of his usual jauntiness perrin shook his head the ashaman could not be asked to make one gateway more than necessary he prayed that they would not fall one short by noon well be done here tell the bannergeneral we go ahead as planned and pray that nothing else went amiss he did not add that aloud though out in the fog wolves howled an eerie cry that rose all around maiden it was truly begun now youre doing wonderfully maighdin faile croaked she felt lightheaded and her throat was dry from encouraging the woman everyones throat was dry by the slant of the light coming through the gaps overhead it was near midmorning and they had been talking without cease for most of that they had tried tapping the unbroken barrels but the wine inside was too rancid even for wetting lips now they were taking turns with the encouragement she was sitting alongside her sunhaired maid while the others rested against the back wall as far from that leaning jumble of boards and timbers as they could get youre going to save us maighdin above them the red scarf was just visible through that narrow gap in the tangle it had hung limply for some time now except when the breeze caught it maighdin stared at it fixedly her dirty face glistened with sweat and she breathed as if she had been running hard suddenly the scarf went taut and began to swing once twice three times then the breeze sent it fluttering and it fell maighdin continued to stare that was beautiful faile said hoarsely the other woman was getting tired more time was passing between each success and the successes were lasting a shorter time it was abruptly a face appeared beside the scarf one hand gripping the length of red for a moment she thought she must be imagining it aravines face framed by her white cowl i see her the woman said excitedly i see the lady faile and maighdin theyre alive voices raised a cheer quickly stilled maighdin swayed as if she might fall over but a beautiful smile wreathed her face faile heard weeping behind her and wanted to weep with joy herself friends had found them not shaido they might escape yet pushing herself to her feet she moved closer to the leaning pile of charred rubble she tried to work moisture into her mouth but it was thick were all alive she managed in husky voice how in the light did you find us it was theril my lady aravine replied the scamp followed you despite your orders and the light bless him for it he saw galina leave and the building fall in and he thought you were dead he sat down and cried a voice protested in rough amadician accents and aravine turned her head for a moment i know someone whos been crying when i see him boy you just be thankful you stopped to cry when he saw the scarf move my lady he came running for help you tell him theres no shame in tears faile said tell him ive seen my husband cry when tears were called for my lady aravine said hesitantly he said galina pulled on a timber when she came out it was set like a lever he said he said she made the building collapse why would she do that alliandre demanded she had helped maighdin to her feet and half supported her to reach failes side lacile and arrela joined them alternating between tears and laughter alliandres face was a thunderhead faile grimaced how often in the last few hours had she wished she had that slap back galina had promised could the woman be black ajah that doesnt matter now one way or another ill see her repaid how was another matter galina was aes sedai after all aravine how many people did you bring can you large hands took aravine by the shoulders and moved her aside enough talk rolans face appeared in the gap shoufa around his neck and veil hanging onto his chest rolan we cannot clear anything with you standing there faile bashere this thing may fall in when we start go to the other end and huddle against the far wall what are you doing here she demanded the man chuckled he chuckled you still wear white woman do as you are told or when i have you out of there i will smack your bottom soundly and then maybe we will soothe your tears with a kissing game she showed him her teeth hoping he did not take it for a grin but he was right about them needing to move away so she led her companions across the boardstrewn stone floor to the far end of the basement where they crouched against the wall she could hear voices muttering outside likely discussing exactly how to go about clearing a path without making the rest of the building collapse on her head all this for nothing alliandre said bitterly how many shaido do you suppose are up there wood scraped loudly and with a groan the leaning pile of rubble leaned inward a little more the voices began again i havent any idea faile told her but they must all be meradhi not shaido the shaido did not mingle with the brotherless there might be some hope in that surely rolan would let her go once he learned about dairaine of course he would and if he remained stubborn in that case she would do whatever was necessary to convince him perrin would never have to find out wood scraped on wood again and once more the heap of burned timbers and boards tilted inward a little further the fog hid the sun but perrin estimated it must be near midmorning grady would be coming soon he should have been there by now if the man had grown too tired to make another gateway no grady would come soon but his shoulders were as tight as if he had been working a forge for a full day and longer i tell you i dont like this one bit gallenne muttered in the thick mist his red eyepatch was just another shadow his heavychested bay nosed his back impatient to be moving and he patted the animals neck absently if masema really wants to kill the lady first i say we finish him now we outnumber him we can overwhelm his bodyguard in minutes fool arganda growled glancing off to his right as if he could see masema and his men through the curling grayness unlike the mayener he had put on his silvered helmet with its three fat white plumes it and his breastplate worked in gold and silver glistened with condensation fog or no fog his armor seemed almost to glow you think we can kill two hundred men without making a sound shouts will be heard the other side of this ridge you have your ruler where you can surround her with nine hundred men and maybe get her away alliandre is still in that bloody town and surrounded by shaido gallenne bristled hand going to his sword hilt as though he might practice on arganda before moving on to masema were not killing anybody but shaido today perrin said firmly gallenne grunted but he did not try to argue he stank of discontent though protecting berelain would keep the winged guards out of the fighting off to the left a bluish flash appeared dimmed by the thick mist and the tightness in perrins shoulders loosened grady appeared in the fog peering about him his step picked up when he saw perrin but it was unsteady another man was with him leading a tall dark horse perrin smiled for the first time in a long while its good to see you tam he said good to see you too my lord tam althor was still a blocky man who looked ready to work from sunup to sundown without slacking but the hair on his head had gone completely gray since perrin had seen him last and he had a few more lines on his bluff face he took in arganda and gallenne with a steady gaze fancy armor did not impress him how are you holding up grady perrin asked im holding up my lord the weathered mans voice sounded bone weary shadowed by the fog as it was his face still looked older than tarns well as soon as youre done here join mishima i want somebody keeping an eye on him somebody who makes him too nervous to chink they can change what they agreed to he would have liked to tell grady to tie off this gateway it would make a short path to take faile back to the two rivers but if things went wrong today it would make a short path for the shaido too dont know as i could make a cat nervous right now my lord but ill do what i can frowning tarn watched grady vanish into the gray murk i could wish id had some other way to get here he said fellows like him visited the two rivers a while back one called himself mazrim taim a name wed all heard a false dragon only now he wears a black coat with fancy embroidery and calls himself the mhael they talked everywhere about teaching men to channel about this black tower he freighted the words with sourness the village councils tried to put a stop to it and the womens circles but they ended up taking above forty men and boys with them thank the light some listened to sense or i think theyd have had ten times that his gaze shifted to perrin taim said rand sent him he said rand is the dragon reborn there was a touch of questioning in that perhaps a hope for denial perhaps a demand to know why perrin had kept silent those hues whirled in perrins head but he batted them away and answered by not answering what was was nothing to be done about it now tam according to grady and neald the black tower did not just let men go once they signed on sadness entered tams scent though he let nothing show on his face he knew the fate of men who could channel grady and neald claimed the male half of the source was clean now but perrin could not see how that could be what was was you did the job you were given followed the road you had to follow and that was that there was no point complaining about blisters or rocks underfoot perrin went on this is bertain gallenne lord captain of the winged guards and gerard arganda first captain of the legion of the wall arganda shrugged uncomfortably that name carried political weight in ghealdan and apparently alliandre had not felt strong enough to announce that she was reconstituting the legion balwer had a nose for sniffing out secrets though this one made sure arganda would not go wild trying to reach his queen gallenne arganda this is tam althor hes my first captain you studied the map tam and my plan i studied them my lord tam said dryly of course he would have it looks a good plan to me as good as any till the arrows start flying arganda put a booted foot in his roans stirrup so long as hes your first captain my lord i have no objections he had offered plenty earlier neither he nor gallenne had been pleased that perrin was putting someone over them from up the slope came a blackwinged mockers shrill cry of alarm only one if it had been a real bird the call would have been repeated perrin scrambled up the slope as fast he could arganda and gallenne passed him on their mounts but they divided to ride to their men disappearing into the thick gray haze perrin continued to the top and beyond dannil was standing almost at the edge of the fog peering toward the shaido encampment he pointed but the reason for the alarm was obvious a large group of algaidsiswai was leaving the tents maybe four hundred or more the shaido sent out raiding parties frequently but this one was aimed straight at perrin they were just walking but it would not take them long to reach the ridge its time to let them see us dannil he said unpinning his cloak and draping it over a low bush he would come back for it later if he could it would only get in his way now dannil sketched a bow before hurrying back into the trees as aram appeared sword already in hand he smelled eager the cloak pin perrin put into his pocket carefully faile had given him that he did not want to lose it his fingers found the leather cord he had knotted for every day of her captivity pulling it out he let it fall to the ground without glancing at it this morning had seen the last knot tucking his thumbs behind the wide belt that supported his hammer and belt knife he strolled out of the fog aram advanced up on his toes already in one of those sword stances perrin just walked the morning sun indeed halfway to its noon peak was in his eyes he had considered taking the eastern ridge and putting masemas men here but it would have meant that much farther to reach the town gates a foolish reason yet those gates drew him as a lodestone drew iron filings he eased his heavy hammer in its loop on his belt eased his belt knife that had a blade as long as his hand the appearance of two men apparently walking idly toward them was enough to halt the shaido well perhaps not so idly considering arams sword they would have to be blind to miss the sun glinting off his long blade they must have been wondering whether they were watching madmen halfway down the slope he stopped relax he told aram youre going to tire yourself out that way the other man nodded without taking his eyes from the shaido and planted his feet firmly his scent was that of a hunter after dangerous quarry and determined to pull it down after a moment half a dozen of the shaido started toward them slowly they had not veiled likely they were hoping he and aram would not be frightened into running among the tents people were pointing at the two fools on the slope the sound of running boots and hooves and snorting horses made him look over his shoulder argandas ghealdanin appeared out of the fog first in their burnished breastplates and helmets riding behind a rippling red banner that bore the three sixpointed silver stars of ghealdan and then the winged guards in their red armor behind the golden hawk on a field of blue of mayene between them dannil began arraying the two rivers men in three ranks every man carried a pair of bristling quivers at his belt and also a bundle of shafts that he stuck point down into the slope before slicing the binding cords they wore their swords and shortswords but the halberds and other polearms had been left on the carts this morning one of them had brought along the red wolfhead banner but the staff was stuck aslant into the ground behind them no one could be spared to carry the thing dannil carried a bow too masema and his bodyguard of lancers took position on the winged guards right their poorly handled horses plunging and rearing their armor showed patches of speckled brown where rust had been scraped away instead of properly cleaned masema himself was out in front a sword at his hip but helmetless and without a breastplate no he did not lack courage he was glaring at the mayeners where perrin could just make out berelain in the middle of that forest of lances he could not get a clear view of her face but he imagined it was still frosty she had objected strenuously to her soldiers being held back from the fighting and he had needed to be very firm to make her see reason light the woman had half suggested she might lead them in a charge the wise ones and the two aes sedai filed down between the ghealdanin and the two rivers men accompanied by the maidens each of whom had long strips of red cloth tied around her upper arms and dangling to the wrist he could not pick out aviellin but by their number she must be among them newly healed or not black veils covered their faces except for their eyes yet he did not need to see their faces or catch their scents to know they were indignant the markings were necessary to avoid accidents but edarra had had to put her foot down to make them wear the things bracelets of gold and ivory rattled as edarra adjusted her dark shawl with smooth sundark cheeks that seemed darker because of her paleyellow hair she looked little older than perrin but her blue eyes held an unshakable calm he suspected she was far older than she appeared those eyes had seen a great deal i think it will begin soon perrin aybara she said perrin nodded the gates called to him the appearance of near enough two thousand lancers and two hundredodd bowmen was sufficient to make the shaido below raise their veils and spread out while more began rushing from the tents to join them in a thick lengthening line pointing fingers along that line pointing spears made him look back again tam was on the slope now and more two rivers men were pouring out of the fog with longbows in hand some tried to mingle with the men who had followed perrin to reunite with brothers sons nephews friends but tam chivvied them away trotting his black gelding up and down as he arranged them in three everexpanding ranks to either side of the horsemen perrin spotted hu barran and his equally lanky brother tad the stablemen from the winespring inn and squarefaced bar dowtry only a few years older than he himself was who was making a name for himself as a cabinetmaker and skinny thad torfinn who seldom left his farm except to come into emonds field oren dautry lean and tall stood between jon ayellin who was hulking and bald and kev barstere who finally had gotten out from under his mothers thumb if he was here there were marwins and aldais alseens and coles thanes and alcaars and crawes men from every family he knew men he did not recognize from down to deven ride or up to watch hill or taren ferry all grimfaced and burdened with pairs of bristling quivers and extra sheaves of arrows and among them stood others men with coppery skins men with transparent veils across the lower half of their faces fairskinned men who just did not have the look of the two rivers they carried shorter bows of courseit took a lifetime to learn the two rivers longbowbut every face he could make out looked as determined as any two rivers man what in the light were the outlanders doing here on and on the streams of running men continued until finally those three long lines held at least three thousand men maybe four tam walked his horse down the slope to perrin and sat studying the swelling shaido ranks below yet he seemed to hear perrins unspoken question i asked for volunteers from the two rivers men and picked the best bowshots but those you took in started coming forward in groups you gave them and their families homes and they said they were two rivers men too now some of those bows wont carry much more than two hundred paces but the men i chose hit what they aim at below the shaido began beating their spears rhythmically against their bullhide bucklers rattattattat rattattattat rattattattat the sound rose like thunder the flow of veiled shapes running out from the tents slowed to a trickle that dwindled further and then ceased all of the algaidsiswai had been drawn out it seemed that was the plan after all there must have been twenty thousand of them near enough all pounding their bucklers rattattattat rattattattat rattattattat after the aiel war i hoped never to hear that again tarn said loudly to be heard that noise could get on a mans nerves will you give the command lord perrin you do it perrin eased his hammer again his belt knife his eyes kept going from the shaido to the town gates and the dark mass of the fortress inside the town faile was in there soon now we will know edarra said about the tea she meant if they had not waited long enough they were all dead her voice was calm though aram shifted up on his toes again sword upright before him in both hands perrin could hear tarn calling as he rode along the lines of bowmen longbows nock shortbows hold till you re close longbows nock shortbows hold till youre close dont draw you fool you know better longbows below perhaps a quarter of the shaido turned and began trotting north paralleling the ridge still beating their bucklers another quarter began trotting south they intended to sweep around and catch the men on the slope from either side flanking tylee called it a ripple passed through those remaining as they began sticking their spears through the harness holding their bowcases hanging their bucklers on their belts unlimbering their bows very soon edarra murmured a fireball larger than a mans head arched out from the tents toward the ridge then another twice the size and more streams of them sailing high the first turned down and exploded with loud roars a hundred paces overhead in rapid succession the others began exploding harmlessly too but more followed spheres of flame speeding toward the ridge in a continuous flow forked silver lightning stabbed down from a cloudless sky and erupted with booming crashes of thunder and great showers of sparks without ever coming near the ground perhaps fifteen or twenty wise ones escaped the tea edarra said otherwise more would have joined in by now i can see only nine women channeling the rest must be among the tents she disliked the agreement he had with the seanchan almost as much as the aes sedai did yet her voice was calm in her book the shaido had violated jietoh to such a degree that it was questionable whether they could be called aiel any longer to her they were something that had to be cut out of the body of the aiel and their wise ones were the worst of the sickness for allowing it masuri drew her arm back but edarra laid a hand on her shoulder not yet masuri sokawa we will tell you when masuri nodded obediently though she smelled of impatience well i for one feel in danger annoura said firmly drawing her arm back edarra looked at her levelly after a moment the aes sedai lowered her arm her beaded braids clicked together as she twisted her head away from the wise ones stare her scent was of strong unease perhaps i can wait a little longer she muttered the fireballs hurtling across the sky continued to explode far above the lightning jabbed toward the ridge but the shaido below were not waiting with a shout the main mass began trotting quickly toward the ridge and singing at the tops of their lungs perrin doubted anyone else on the slope could make out more than a roar but his ears caught words faintly they were singing in parts wash the spears while the sun climbs high wash the spears while the sun falls low wash the spears who j ears to die wash the spears no one i know he shut the sound out ignoring it while his eyes drifted beyond the onrushing mass of veiled figures to the gates of maiden iron filings to a lodestone the shapes below seemed to have slowed half a step though he knew they had not everything seemed to slow down for him at times like this how long before they came in range they had covered little more than half the distance to the ridge longbows raise on my signal tarn shouted longbows raise on my signal perrin shook his head it was too soon thousands of bowstrings snapped behind him arrows arced over his head the sky seemed black with them seconds later another flight followed then a third fireballs burned swathes through them but it was still thousands of arrows that fell in a deadly hail onto the shaido of course he had forgotten to factor in the bowmens elevation that gave them a little more distance trust tarn to see it right away not every arrow struck a man of course many plunged into the ground perhaps half struck algaidsiswai piercing arms or legs striking bodies wounded shaido hardly slowed even when they had to struggle up from the ground they left hundreds lying still though and the second flight put down hundreds more as did the third with the fourth and fifth already on the way the shaido kept coming leaning forward as if trotting into a driving rain while their wise ones balls of fire and lightnings exploded far overhead they were no longer singing some raised their bows and shot an arrow grazed perrins left arm but the rest fell short not by far though another twenty paces and the sudden sharp sound of seanchan horns pulled his gaze north and south just in time to see the ground erupt in fountains of fire among the flanking parties spears of lightning stabbed into them the damane were being kept back in the trees for the time but they did deadly work again and again explosions of fire or lightning hurled men like twigs those algaidsiswai could have no idea where the attack was coming from they began to run toward the trees toward their killers some of the fireballs coming out of the camp began flying toward the forests where the damane were and lightnings jabbed toward the trees but with as little effect as they had against the ridge tylee claimed damane were used for all sorts of tasks but the truth was they were weapons of war and they and the suldam were very good at it now edarra said and fireballs began raining down on the shaido below the wise ones and aes sedai made throwing motions with both arms as fast as they could and every time a ball of flame seemed to rise from their fingertips many of those exploded too soon of course the shaido wise ones were working to defend their own but the algaidsiswai were much nearer to the ridge so they had less time to react fireballs burst among the shaido hurling men aside flinging severed arms and legs into the air silverblue lightning bolts forked down and most of those struck too the hair on perrins arms stirred the hair on his head tried to stand the air seemed to crackle with the lightnings discharges even as they flung death at the men below edarra and the others continued to parry the shaido wise ones attacks and all the while the two rivers men worked their bows as fast as they could a trained man could loose twelve shafts in a minute and the range was shorter now the shaido lacked no more than two hundred paces of reaching the bottom of the ridge their arrows still fell short of perrin but the two rivers arrows were striking home every time at this range each bowman was picking his own target of course so perrin saw algaidsiswai fall pierced by two three even four shafts flesh could only take so much the shaido began to fall back it was not a rout they did not flee many shot arrows back at the ridge despite no hope of making the range but they turned as if on a command and ran trying to outpace the two rivers shafts and the rain of fire and lightning that pursued them the flankers were falling back too as lancers appeared out of the trees forming ranks a thousand horses wide advancing slowly while fire and lightning harried the shaido by ranks tarn shouted advance three paces and loose advance at a walk arganda bellowed with me masema shouted perrin was supposed to make that slow advance with the others but he began to walk down the slope faster and faster the gates tugged at him his blood was becoming fire elyas claimed it was a natural feeling when you were in danger of your life but he could not see it he had almost drowned in the waterwood once and he had felt nothing like this thrill that was surging through him now someone behind shouted his name but he trotted on picking up speed freeing his hammer from its belt loop he drew his belt knife with his left hand aram was running beside him he realized but his own focus was on the gates on the shaido who still stood between him and faile fire lightning and arrows fell among them like hail and they were no longer turning to fire their own arrows though they often looked over their shoulders but many were supporting wounded men who dragged a leg or clutched a side with a two rivers shaft jutting from it and he was catching up abruptly half a dozen veiled men turned back gripping spears and started toward him and aram at the run not using their bows meant they had expended their arrows he had heard tales of champions of men who decided the future by single combat between two armies that would abide by the outcome the aiel had no such tales he did not slow down though his blood was fire he was fire a two rivers shaft took one shaido in the middle of his chest and even as he fell three more were feathered with at least a dozen arrows each but now he and aram were too close to the remaining two anyone but the very best bowshots would risk hitting him or aram if he fired aram flowed toward one of the shaido as if dancing his blade a bright blur but perrin had no time to watch anyone else fight if he had wanted to a veiled man who overtopped him by a head stabbed at him with a short spear held near its base blocking the spear with his belt knife perrin swung his hammer the shaido tried to stop it with his buckler but he altered the swing slightly and heard the bones in the mans forearm snap under ten pounds of steel swung by a blacksmiths arm he was inside the spear now and without slowing he slashed across the mans throat with his knife blood gouted and he was running again while the man was falling he had to reach faile fire in his blood fire in his heart fire in his head no one and nothing would keep him from faile chapter thirty outside the gates faile tried to estimate the time by the slant of light falling through the gaps in the ruined building overhead it seemed still short of noon all that had been cleared was a small space at the very top of the basement stairs any of them could have passed through it if they dared to try climbing the slanting pile of blackened rubble but that still looked as though it might fall in any moment the tangled heap still creaked alarmingly at times the only good thing was that it had not started raining on their heads how long that would last was a question she had been hearing thunder for some time quite a lot of it and slowly coming closer the booms were almost continuous a storm that fierce might be enough to make the building finish collapsing light she was thirsty rolan suddenly appeared in the opening and lay down on the stone landing he was not wearing the harness that held his bow case carefully he wriggled his way out onto the rubble the pile groaned softly under his weight kinhuin a greeneyed man a good hand or more shorter than he knelt to grip his ankles there were only three of the brotherless up there it seemed but that was three too many head and shoulders sticking over the edge of the rubble rolan lowered one arm there is no more time faile bashere take my hand maighdin first faile said thickly waving away the sunhaired womans weary protests light but her mouth was coated with grit and too dry to spit any of it out arrela and lacile next ill go last alliandre nodded approvingly but arrela and lacile tried to object too be quiet and do as i say she told them firmly thunder crashed and crashed the storm that produced that much thunder would bring a deluge not simple rainfall rolan laughed how could the man laugh at a time like this he only stopped when the charred timbers beneath him groaned again from his shaking you still wear white woman so be quiet and do as i say there was a touch of mocking in his tone at that but not when he added no one will be taken out before you that sounded like cast iron my lady alliandre said quietly hoarsely i believe he means it i will send the others out in the order you gave stop pouting and give me your hand rolan commanded she was not pouting the man could be as infuriatingly stubborn as her perrin only in perrin it was intriguing not really infuriating raising her right hand as high as it would go she let rolans hand envelope hers he lifted her easily till her face was just below his catch hold of my coat there was no hint of strain in his voice despite the awkward angle of his arm you will have to climb over me she swung her left hand up and caught a fistful of the rough wool holding on hard the pain in her shoulder told her it was bruised as badly as she feared when he released her other hand she gasped at the jolt of agony and quickly grabbed his coat with that one too grasping her waist in both hands he boosted her higher so she was lying on his broad back thunder boomed and boomed without ceasing the rain must start falling soon that would make getting the others out more difficult i like feeling your weight on me faile bashere but maybe you could climb a little faster so i can bring the others out he pinched her bottom and she laughed in spite of herself the man just would not stop trying the climb over him was slower than she could have hoped for she did not believe anything was broken in her shoulder but it hurt once she thought she kicked rolan in the head pinch her would he at last she was outside and past kinhuin on her feet under the sky once more her first sight of the building from outside made her swallow and then cough vigorously as bits of grit entered her throat the charred timbers were tilting to an alarming degree ready to crash into the basement the third brotherless jhoradin a blueeyed man with redgold hair and a face that fell not far short of prettiness was watching kinhuin and rolan but every so often he glanced at the building as if expecting to see it fall he was squat for an aiel not quite as tall as perrin but half again as wide there must have been at least a hundred of her people in the street staring at her anxiously some of their white robes stained with soot from their efforts at digging her out a hundred she could not find it in her heart to upbraid them however especially after aravine thrust a plump waterskin into her hands the first mouthful went to wash away grit and dust though she wanted desperately to swallow it anyway but after that she held up the skin and all but poured water down her throat her bruised shoulder protested she ignored it and drank and drank suddenly she became aware of lightning striking outside the town to the west and lowered the waterskin to stare close outside the town out of a cloudless sky and sometimes not striking many of those forked silvery bolts erupted with thunderous roars far above the ground balls of fire hurtled across the sky sometimes bursting in air with a boom like thunder someone was fighting a battle with the power but who could perrin have found enough aes sedai or ashaman to attack the camp but something was very odd she knew how many wise ones in the camp could channel and there did not seem to be enough lightning or fireballs perhaps it was not perrin after all there were factions among the wse ones not just between those supporting or opposing sevanna but between septs with old alliances or animosities maybe one of those factions was fighting another that seemed highly unlikely but less so than perrin finding enough aes sedai to attack and the wise ones not fighting back with everything they could muster when the lightnings started rolan said there was a battle aravine said when faile asked her thats all nobody wanted to go find out more until we knew you were safe faile ground her teeth in frustration even if she did not have to deal with rolan whatever was going on outside the walls might make escaping that much more difficult if only she knew what it was she might be able to see how to avoid it or use it no one is to go anywhere aravine it might be dangerous and they might inadvertently lead shaido back when they returned light what was going on maighdin staggered out past kinhuin rubbing her hip he pinched me her voice was thick but indignation came through faile felt a stab of not jealousy certainly not that the bloody man could pinch any woman he wanted to he was not perrin grimacing she handed the sunhaired woman the waterskin and maighdin washed out her mouth hurriedly before beginning to gulp thirstily she was not so sunhaired at the moment her curls all sweatmatted and as coated with dust as her sweaty face she was not even pretty at the moment arrela came out of the ruin rubbing her bottom and looking grim as death but she eagerly took the waterskin that aldin offered the tall young amadician a squareshouldered fellow who looked more a soldier than the bookkeeper he was gazed at her avidly as she drank arrela did not like men that way but aldin refused to accept that he could not convince her to marry him lacile appearedrubbing her bottomand jhoradin handed her another waterskin drawing a finger down her dirty cheek she smiled up at him before beginning to drink already preparing her way back into his blankets if rolan proved obstinate at least faile thought that was what she was doing at last alliandre stalked past kinhuin and if she was not rubbing herself her expression of frosty ire told the tale plainly enough kinhuin backed out of the opening and stood while rolan began working his way back across the dangerous pile of timbers my lady aravine called anxiously and faile turned to find the plumpfaced woman kneeling on the paving stones and lifting maighdins head onto her lap maighdins eyelids fluttered but never came more than half open her lips moved weakly but only mumbles emerged what happened faile said hurrying to kneel beside them i dont know my lady she was drinking as if she intended to empty the skin and suddenly she staggered the next i knew she just collapsed aravines hands fluttered like falling leaves she must be very tired faile said smoothing her maids hair and trying not to think of how they were to get the woman out of the camp if she could not walk it would be done if they had to carry her light she felt a touch wobbly herself she saved us aravine the amadician woman nodded gravely i will hide you somewhere safe until tonight faile bashere rolan said fastening the last buckles of his bow case harness his brown shoufa was already wrapped around his head then i will take you to the forest taking three short spears from jhoradin he thrust them up through the harness behind so the long spearpoints glinting in the sun stuck up above his head faile almost collapsed beside maighdin with relief there would be no need to conceal anything from perrin but she could not afford weakness not now our supplies she began and as if the sound of her voice were the last straw the building gave a squealing groan and fell in with a crash that drowned out the explosions for a moment i will see that you have what you need rolan told her raising the black veil across his face jhoradin handed him another spear and his buckler which he hung on his belt knife before seizing her right arm and drawing her to her feer we must move quickly i do not know who we are dancing the spears with but the meradin will dance today aldin will you carry maighdin was all she managed to get out before rolan strode away pulling her with him she looked over her shoulder to see aldin lifting a limp maighdin in his arms jhoradin had lacile by her arm as firmly as rolan had her the three brotherless were leading a parade of whitegarbed men and women and one boy theril wore a grim expression fumbling in her sleeve no easy matter with rolans big hand on her arm she closed her fingers around the ridged hilt of her dagger whatever was happening outside the walls she might have need of that blade before nightfall perrin ran along the winding street through the tents no one moved in his sight but through the roar of exploding fireballs and lightnings he could hear other sounds of battle steel clashing on steel men shouting as they killed or died men screaming blood ran down the left side of his face from a gash in his scalp and he could feel it oozing down his right side from where a spear had grazed him oozing down his left thigh from a spear that had bitten deeper not all of the blood on him was his own a face appeared at the opening to a low dark tent and drew back hurriedly a childs face and frightened not the first he had seen the shaido were being pressed so hard that a good many children had been left behind they would be a problem for later though over the tents he could see the gates little more than a hundred paces ahead beyond them lay the fortress and faile two veiled shaido darted out from beside a dirty brown walltent spears at the ready but not for him they were looking at something off to the left without slowing he ran into them both were larger than he but the force of his rush carried them all to the ground and he fell already fighting his hammer smashed into the bottom of one mans chin while he stabbed and stabbed at the other man blade biting deep the hammer rose and crushed the first mans face splashing blood rose and fell again while he stabbed the man with the ruined face twitched once as perrin rose the other lay staring at the sky a hint of motion at the corner of his left eye made him throw himself to the right a sword whisked through the air where his neck would have been arams sword the onetime tinker had taken wounds too blood coated half his face like a strange mask there were bloodwet rents in his redstriped coat and his eyes looked almost glazed like those of a corpse but he still seemed to be dancing with that blade in his hands his scent was the scent of death a death he sought have you gone mad perrin growled steel rang against steel as he blocked that sword away with the head of his hammer what are you doing he blocked another slice of the blade tried to grapple the other man and barely danced back in time to get away with only a gash across his ribs the prophet explained it to me aram sounded in a daze yet his sword moved with liquid ease blows barely diverted with hammer or belt knife as perrin backed away all he could do was hope he did not trip over a tent rope or come up against a tent your eyes youre really shadowspawn it was you who brought the trollocs to the two rivers he explained it all those eyes i should have known the first time i saw you you and elyas with those shadowspawn eyes i have to rescue the lady faile from you perrin gathered himself he could not keep moving ten pounds of steel as quickly as aram moved a sword that weighed a third of that somehow he had to get close get beyond that blade blurring with the speed of its motion he could not do so without getting cut and likely badly but if he waited much longer the man was going to kill him something caught his heel and he staggered backward nearly falling aram darted in sword chopping down suddenly he stiffened eyes going wide and the blade dropped from his hands he toppled forward to lie on his face two arrows jutting from his back thirty paces beyond him a pair of veiled shaido already had arrows nocked and drawn again perrin leaped sideways behind a green peaked tent rolling to his feet quickly at the corner of the tent an arrow poked through the canvas still quivering crouching he made his way past the green tent and then a faded blue one a low tent of dingy brown hammer in one hand knife in the other this was not the first time he had played this game today cautiously he peeked around the edge of the brown tent the two shaido were nowhere to be seen they might be stalking him in turn or off hunting someone else already the game had turned both ways before he could see aram lying where he had fallen a scrap of breeze ruffled the dark fletchings on the arrows sticking up from his back elyas had been right he should never have let aram pick up that sword he should have sent him away with the carts or made him go back to the tinkers so many things he should have done too late now the gates called to him he glanced over his shoulder so close now still crouching he began to run again along those twisting streets wary of those two shaido or any others that might be lurking the sounds of battle were ahead of him now coming from north and south but that did not mean there would be no stragglers rounding a corner only a few paces from the wideopen gates he found them filled with people most were garbed in dirty white robes but three were veiled algaidsiswai one of them a hulking fellow who would have dwarfed lamgwin that one had failes arm in his fist she looked as if she had been rolled in the dirt with a roar perrin rushed forward raising his hammer and the huge man flung faile back and ran toward him spear coming up as he plucked his buckler from his belt perrin faile screamed the big shaido seemed to hesitate for a heartbeat and perrin took advantage of it his hammer hit the side of the mans head so hard that his feet left the ground as he fell another was right behind him though spear ready to stab suddenly the man grunted surprise in the green eyes above his black veil and dropped to his knees peering over his shoulder at faile who stood close slowly he fell forward revealing a ridged steel hilt rising from his back perrin looked hastily for the third and found him also lying on his face with two wooden knife hilts sticking out of his back lacile was leaning against arrela weeping no doubt she had found actually killing someone not so easy as she had supposed alliandre was at the front of the crowd too and maighdin right behind her carried by a tall young man in white but perrin had eyes only for faile letting knife and hammer fall he stepped over the dead men and gathered her in his arms the smell of her filled his nose it filled his head she smelled strongly of charred wood of all things but he could still smell her ive dreamed of this moment so long he breathed i have too she said against his chest hugging him hard her scent was full of joy but she was trembling did they hurt you he asked gently no they no perrin they didnt hurt me there were other smells mixed in with her joy though laced through it inextricably the dull aching scent of sadness and the greasy aroma of guilt shame like thousands of hairfine needles pricking well the man was dead and a woman had the right to keep her secrets if she wanted all that matters is that youre alive and were together again he told her thats all that matters in the world all that matters she agreed hugging him even harder hard enough that she actually groaned with the effort but the next instant she had pushed back and was examining his wounds fingering open tears in his coat to look at them these dont look too bad she said briskly though all of those emotions still lay tangled in her joy she reached up to part his hair and tugged until he bent his head so she could examine the slash along his scalp youll need healing of course how many aes sedai did you bring how did you no thats of no matter right now there are enough of them to defeat the shaido and that is whats important this lot of shaido he said straightening to look down at her light dirt or no dirt she was so beautiful therell be another six or seven thousand spears here in he glanced at the sun it seemed it should be higher less than two hours maybe we need to finish up here and be moving before then if we can whats wrong with maighdin she was limp as a feather pillow against the young mans chest her eyelids were fluttering without opening fully she tired herself out saving our lives faile said abandoning his injuries and turning to the other people in white aravine all of you start gathering up gaishain not just those sworn to me everybody in white we leave no one we can reach behind perrin what direction is safest north he told her north is safe start them moving north faile went on gather carts wagons packhorses and load them with whatever you think well need hurry people started moving running no you stay here aldin maighdin still needs to be carried you stay too alliandre and arrela lacile needs a shoulder to cry on for a while perrin grinned put his wife down in the middle of a house engulfed in flames and she would calmly set about putting the fire out she would put it out too bending he cleaned his belt knife on the greeneyed mans coat before sheathing it his hammer needed a good wiping too he tried not to think about what he was smearing on the mans coat the fire was fading from his blood there was no thrill remaining only tiredness his wounds were beginning to throb will you send someone to he fortress to let ban and seonid know they can come out now he said as he slipped the hammers haft back through the loop on his belt faile stared at him in amazement theyre in the fortress how why alyse didnt tell you he had always been slow to anger until faile was taken now he felt fury bubbling up in him bubbles like whitehot iron she said she was taking you with her when she left but she promised to tell you to go to the fortress when you saw fog on the ridges and heard wolves howl by daylight id swear she said it straight out burn me you cant trust aes sedai an inch faile glanced toward the western ridge where the fog still clung thickly and grimaced not alyse perrin galina if that wasnt a lie too it has to be her and she has to be black ajah oh how i wish i knew her real name she moved her left arm and winced she had been hurt perrin found himself wanting to kill the big shaido all over again faile did not let her injury slow her though theril come out from there i see you peeking around the gate a skinny young man edged shyly around the corner of the gate my father told me to stay and keep an eye on you my lady he said in an accent so rough that perrin could barely understand thats as may be faile said firmly but you run to the fortress as fast as you can and tell whoever you find there that lord perrin says theyre to come run now the boy knuckled his forehead and ran in a quarter of an hour or so he reappeared still running followed by seonid and ban and all the others ban made a leg to faile and murmured smoothly how pleased he was to see her again before ordering the two rivers men to set up a guard ring around the gate bows at the ready and halberds stuck in the ground he used his normal voice for that he was another who was trying to acquire polish selande and failes other hangerson rushed around her all babbling with excitement and saying how worried they had been when she failed to appear after the wolves howled im going to masuri kirklin announced in tones that dared challenge he did not wait for one though simply drawing his sword and running off along the wall to the north tallanvor gave a cry when he saw maighdin being held by the tall young man and had to be convinced that she was only exhausted he still took her away from the fellow and held her against his own chest whispering to her where is chiad gaul demanded on learning that she had never been with them he lifted the veil across his face the maidens tricked me he said grimly but i will find her before them perrin caught his arm there are a lot of men out there wholl take you for a shaido i have to find her first perrin aybara there was something in the aiels voice something in his scent that perrin could only call heartache he understood the sorrow of thinking the woman you loved might be lost to you forever he let go of gauls sleeve and the man darted through the line of bowmen spear and buckler in hand ill go with him elyas grinned maybe i can keep him out of trouble drawing the long knife that had given him his name among the wolves long tooth he went running after the tall aielman if the two of them could not make their way safely out there then no one could if you are done jabbering perhaps you will stand still for healing seonid told perrin you look as if you need it furen and teryl were heeling her hands on their sword hilts and eyes trying to watch in every direction the ring of two rivers men were all very well their attitude seemed to say but seonids safety was their charge they looked like leopards heeling a house cat only she was no house cat see to faile first he said her arm is hurt faile was talking with alliandre both of them so angry they should have had tails to bristle no doubt angry over alyse or galina or whatever her name was i do not see her bleeding like a stuck pig seonid lifted her hands to cup his head and that too familiar chill hit him like suddenly being immersed in a winter pond on the brink of freezing he gasped and jerked arms flailing out of his control and when she released him his wounds were gone if not the blood smeared on his face and staining his coat and breeches he also felt he could eat a whole deer by himself what was that the diminutive green turned away from him toward faile did you mention galina casban i dont know her last name faile said a roundfaced aes sedai with a plump mouth and black hair and big eyes pretty in a way but an unpleasant woman do you know her i think she must be black ajah seonid stiffened hands knotting in her skirts that sounds like galina a red and decidedly unpleasant but why would you make such an accusation it is not a charge to bring against a sister lightly even against one as disagreeable as galina as faile explained beginning with the first meeting with galina perrins anger grew again the woman had blackmailed her threatened her lied to her then tried to murder her his fists clenched so tight that his arms shook ill break her neck when i get my hands on it he growled when she fell silent that is not your right seonid said sharply galina must be tried before three sisters sitting as a court and for this charge they must be sitters the entire hall of the tower might sit for it if she is found guilty she will be stilled and executed but justice in this lies with aes sedai if he said incredulously you heard what faile said can you have any doubt he must have looked threatening because furen and teryl glided in to flank seonid their hands resting lightly on sword hilts their eyes hard on his face shes right perrin faile said gently when jac coplin and len congar were accused of stealing a cow you knew they were thieves but you made master thane prove they had stolen it before you let the village council have them strapped its just as important with galina the village council wouldnt have strapped them without a trial whatever id said he muttered faile laughed she laughed light it was good to hear again oh all right galina belongs to the aes sedai but if they dont take care of her i will if i ever find her again i dont like people hurting you seonid sniffed at him her scent disapproving your arm is injured my lady see to arrela first please faile said the aes sedai rolled her eyes in exasperation and took failes head between her hands faile shivered and exhaled hardly more than a heavy sigh not a bad injury then and gone now in any case she txianked seonid while leading her to arrela suddenly perrin realized he could not hear the explosions any longer in fact he could not recall hearing one for some time that had to be good i need to find out whats happening ban you keep a close guard on faile faile protested his going alone and by the time he finally agreed to take ten of the two rivers men a rider in lacquered armor had appeared rounding the northern corner of the town wall three thin blue plumes marked her as tylee as she rode closer he realized she had a nude woman draped across her tall bay in front of the saddle a woman bound at ankles and knees wrists and elbows her long golden hair almost brushed the ground and there were jeweled necklaces and ropes of pearls caught in it a strand of large green stones and gold slid free and fell to the dirt as tylee reined in removing her peculiar helmet with gauntleted hands she rested it on the womans upturned bottom a remarkable weapon those bows of yours she drawled eyeing the two rivers men i wish we had the like kirklin told me where to find you my lord theyve begun surrendering masemas men held to the point of suicidemost of them are dead or dying i thinkand the damane turned that ridge into a deathtrap only a madman would walk into best of all the suldam have already fitted adam to over two hundred women that cold tea of yours was enough that most of them could not stand without help ill have to send for toraken to fly them all out seonid made a sound in her throat her face was smooth but her scent was daggersharp fury she stared at tylee as though trying to stare a hole through her tylee paid her no mind at all except to shake her head slightly after my people and i are gone perrin said his agreement was with her he did not want to risk testing it with anyone else what are our losses aside from masemas men light tylee replied between your archers and the damane they never really managed to close with us ive never seen a battle plan come off so smoothly if we have a hundred dead between us ill be surprised perrin winced he supposed those were light casualties under the circumstances but some would be two rivers men whether or not he knew them they were his responsibility do you know where masema is with whats left of his army hes no coward ill say that for him he and his two hundredwell about one hundred nowcut a path all the way through the shaido to the ridge perrin ground his teeth the man was back surrounded by his rabble it would be his word against masemas about why aram had tried to kill him and in any event it was unlikely the mans followers would surrender him for trial we need to start moving before the others get here if the shaido think rescue is at hand they might decide to forget they surrendered whos your prisoner sevanna faile said in a cold voice the smell of her hatred was nearly as strong as it had been while speaking of galina the goldenhaired woman twisted herself upward shaking hair out of her face and losing several more necklaces in the process her eyes glaring at faile were green fire above a strip of cloth that had been tied for a gag she stank of rage sevanna of the jumai shaido satisfaction was strong in tylees voice she told me so proudly shes no coward either met us wearing nothing but a silk robe and her jewels but she managed to spear two of my altarans before i took it away from her sevanna snarled through her gag and struggled as if to throw herself from the horse until tylee smacked her bottom anyway after that she contented herself with glaring at everyone in sight she was nicely rounded though he should not be noticing something like that with his wife there except that elyas said she would expect him to notice so he made himself study her openly i claim the contents of her tent faile announced shooting him a sharp look maybe he was not supposed to be that open she has a huge chest of jewels in there and i want them dont look at me like a looby perrin we have a hundred thousand people to feed clothe and help get back to their homes a hundred thousand at least i want to come with you my lady if youll have me the young fellow who had been holding maighdin piped up i wont be the only one if youll have us your lady wife i presume my lord tylee said eyeing faile she is faile allow me to present bannergeneral tylee khirgan in service to the empress of seanchan perhaps he was acquiring some of that polish himself bannergeneral my wife lady faile ni basheretaybara tylee bowed in her saddle faile made a small curtsy inclined her head slightly dirty face or no dirty face she was regal which made him think of the broken crown discussion of that little matter would have to come later no doubt it would be a prolonged discussion he thought he might not find it so hard to raise his voice the way she apparently wanted this time and this is alliandre maritha kigarin queen of ghealdan blessed of the light defender of garens wall and my liege woman ghealdan is under my protection fool thing to say but it had to be said our agreement doesnt speak to that my lord tylee said carefully i dont decide where the ever victorious army goes just so you know bannergeneral and tell those above you they cant have ghealdan alliandre smiled at him so widely so gratefully he almost wanted to laugh light faile was smiling too a proud smile he rubbed the side of his nose we really do need to begin moving before those other shaido arrive i dont want to find myself with them in front of me and all those prisoners behind me thinking about picking up a spear again tylee chuckled i have a little more experience with these people than you my lord once they surrender they wont fight again or try to escape for three days besides i have some of my altarans making bonfires out of their spears and bows just to make sure we have time to make our deployments my lord i hope i never have to face you in the field she said pulling the steelbacked gauntlet from her right hand i would be honored if youd call me tylee she bent over sevanna to offer her hand for a moment perrin could only stare it was a strange world he had gone to her thinking he was making a deal with the dark one and the light knew some of what the seanchan did was beyond repugnant but the woman was stalwart and true to her word im perrin tylee he said clasping her hand a very strange world stripping off her shift galina tossed it down atop the silk robe and bent to pick up the riding dress she had pulled from swifts saddlebags the thing had been sewn for a slightly larger woman but it would suffice until she could sell one of those firedrops stand as you are lina came theravas voice and suddenly galina could not have straightened if the forest around her had been on fire she could scream though be silent she choked as her throat swallowed the scream convulsively she could still weep silently and tears began to fall on the mulch of the forest floor a hand slapped her rudely somehow you have the rod therava said you would not be out here else give it to me lina there was no question even of resisting straightening galina dug the rod out of her saddlebags and handed it to the hawkeyed woman tears sliding down her cheeks stop sniveling lina and put on your necklace and collar i will have to punish you for taking them off galina flinched even theravas command could not shut off her tears and she knew she would be punished for that too golden necklace and collar came out of the saddlebags and went onto her she stood there wearing only her pale woolen stockings and soft laced white boots and the weight of the firedropstudded collar and belt seemed enough to bear her to the ground her eyes fastened themselves to the white rod in theravas hands your horse will do for a pack animal lina as for you you are forbidden to ride ever again there had to be some way to get that rod again there had to be therava turned the thing over and over in her hands taunting her stop playing with your pet therava what are we going to do belinde a slender wise one with hair bleached almost white by the sun strode up to glare at therava with pale blue eyes she was bony with a face well suited to glaring that was the first galina realized that therava was not alone several hundred men women and children stood among the trees behind them some of the men carrying women slung over their shoulders of all things she covered herself with her hands her face heating those long days of enforced nakedness had not inured her to being unclothed in front of men then she noticed another oddity only a handful were algaidsiswai with bow cases on their backs and quivers at their hips but every man and every woman except the wise ones among them was carrying at least one spear they had their faces veiled too with a scarf or just a scrap of cloth what could it mean we are returning to the threefold land therava said we will send runners to find every sept that can be found and tell them to abandon their wetlander gaishain abandon everything they must and make their way by stealth back to the threefold land we will rebuild our clan the shaido will rise from the disaster sevanna led us to that will take generations modarra protested slim and quite pretty but even taller than therava as tall as most aielmen she stood up to therava unflinchingly galina could not understand how she did that the woman made her flinch with a glance then we will take generations therava said firmly we will take whatever time is necessary and we will never leave the threefold land again her gaze shifted to galina who flinched you will never touch this again she said raising the rod briefly and you will never try to escape me again she has a strong back load her and let us be on our way they may try to pursue us burdened with waterskins and pots and kettles till she almost felt decently covered galina staggered through the forest at theravas heels she did not think of the rod or escape something had broken in her she was galina casban highest of the red ajah who sat on the supreme council of the black ajah and she was going to be theravas plaything for the rest of her life she was theravas little lina for the rest of her life she knew that to her bones tears rolled silently down her face chapter thirtyone the house on full moon street they must stay together elayne said firmly the two of you shouldnt be out by yourselves for that matter always three or four together anywhere in caemlyn thats the only way to be safe just two of the mirrored standlamps were lit six flames filling the sitting room with a dim light and the scent of liliesso much of the lamp oil had gone bad that it was always perfumed nowbut a crackling fire on the hearth was beginning to take away some of the early hours coolness there are times a woman wants a little privacy sumeko replied calmly as if yet another kinswoman had not just died from wanting privacy her voice was calm at least but plump hands smoothed her dark blue skirts if you wont put the fear of the light into them sumeko i will alise said her usually mild face stern she looked the elder of the two with touches of gray in her hair compared to the glossy black hair that fell below sumekos stout shoulders yet she was the younger by better than two hundred years alise had been intrepid when ebou dar fell and they were forced to flee the seanchan but her hands moved on her brown skirts too it was long past the bedtime that essandes niece melfane had decreed but tired as she was all the time once elayne woke she could never get back to sleep and warm goats milk did not help warm goats milk tasted worse than cool she was going to make rand bloody althor drink warm bloody goats milk till it came out of his ears right after she found out what had hurt him badly enough that she sensed a small jolt of pain while everything else in that small knot in the back of her head that was him remained as vague as a stone it had been all a stone again ever since so he was all right yet something had hurt him deeply for her to sense anything at all and why was he traveling so often one day he was far to the southeast the next to the northwest and even more distant the day after that somewhere else was he running from whoever had hurt him but she had her own worries at the moment unable to sleep and restless she had dressed herself in the first thing that came to hand a dark gray riding dress and gone for a walk to enjoy the stillness of the palace in the small hours of the morning when even the servants were abed and flickering standlamps were the only things that moved in the hallways aside from her her and her bodyguards but she was learning to ignore their presence she did enjoy the solitude until the two women encountered her and delivered the sad news that would have awaited sunrise otherwise she had brought them back to her smaller sitting room to discuss the matter behind a ward against listeners sumeko shifted her bulk in her armchair to glare at alise reanne let you press boundaries but as eldest i expect youre not eldest sumeko the smaller woman said coolly you have the authority here but by the rule the knitting circle consists of the thirteen eldest of us in ebou dar we arent in ebou dar any longer so there is no knitting circle sumekos round face grew hard as granite at least you admit i have the authority and i expect you to use it to prevent any more of us being murdered suggesting isnt enough sumeko no matter how strongly you say you suggest it isnt enough arguing will get us nowhere elayne said i know you re on edge i am too light three women murdered with the one power in the last ten days and very likely seven more before that were enough to put an anvil on edge but snapping at each other is the worst thing we can do sumeko you need to put your foot down i dont care how much anyone wants privacy no one can be by herself for a minute alise use your persuasion persuasion was not exactly the word alise did not persuade she simply expected people to do as she said and they nearly always did convince the others that sumeko is right between the two of you you have to the door opened to admit deni who closed it again behind her and bowed one hand on her sword hilt the other on her long cudgel the redlacquered breastplates and helmets trimmed in white had been delivered only yesterday and the stocky woman had been smiling ever since she donned hers but she looked solemn behind the facebars now pardon for interrupting my lady but theres an aes sedai here demanding to see you a red by her shawl i told her you were likely sleeping but she was ready to come in and wake you herself a red there were reports of reds in the city from time to time though not so often as oncemost aes sedai in the city went without their shawls concealing their ajahsyet what would a red want with her surely they all knew by now that she stood with egwene and against elaida unless someone was finally trying to bring her to book for the bargain with the sea folk tell her that im the door opened again bumping denis back pushing her out of the way the woman who entered vinewoven shawl draped along her arms so the long red fringe displayed itself to advantage was tall and slim and copperskinned she would have been pretty except that her mouth was compressed until her full lips seemed thin her riding dress was so dark it might have been black but the pale light of the standmirrors picked up hints of red and the divided skirts were slashed with brighter red duhara basaheen never made any secret of her ajah once sumeko and alise would have been on their feet and curtsying for an aes sedai in a flash but now they remained seated studying her deni normally placid in appearance at least scowled and fingered her cudgel i see the tales of you gathering wilders are true duhara said a great pity that the two of you get out i wish to speak with elayne privately if youre wise you will leave tonight heading in different directions and tell any others like you to do the same the white tower looks amiss on wilders gathering together when the tower looks on something amiss thrones have been known to tremble neither sumeko nor alise moved alise actually arched an eyebrow they can stay elayne said coldly with the power in her her emotions were not bouncing they were steady in an icy anger they are welcome here you on the other hand elaida tried to have me kidnapped duhara kidnapped you can leave a poor welcome elayne when i came to the palace as soon as i arrived and after a journey that would be as torturous to describe as it was to endure andor has always had good relations with the tower the tower intends to see they remain good are you sure you want these wilders to hear everything i have to say to you very well if you insist gliding to one of the carved sideboards she wrinkled her nose at the silver pitcher holding goats milk and poured herself a cup of dark wine before taking a chair across from elayne deni made a move as if to try dragging her out but elayne shook her head the domani sister ignored the kinswomen as if they had ceased to exist the woman who drugged you has been punished elayne she was flogged in front of her own shop with everyone in her village watching duhara sipped her wine waiting for elayne to respond she said nothing she knew very well that ronde macura had been flogged for failure rather than for feeding her that vile tea but saying so would make duhara wonder how she knew and that might lead to things that needed to remain hidden the silence stretched and finally the other woman went on you must know that the white tower wants very much for you to mount the lion throne to achieve that end elaida has sent me to be your advisor in spite of herself elayne laughed elaida had sent her an advisor it was ludicrous i have aes sedai to advise me when i need advice duhara you must know i oppose elaida i wouldnt accept a pair of stockings from that woman your socalled advisors are rebels child duhara said chidingly with a heavy dose of distaste on the word rebels she gestured with the silver winecup why do you think you have so many houses opposing you so many standing aside they surely know you dont really have the backing of the tower with me as your advisor that changes i might be able to put the crown on your head inside a week at most it should take no more than a month or two elayne met the other womans gaze with a level gaze of her own her hands wanted to make fists but she kept them still in her lap even were that so id refuse you i expect to hear any day that elaida has been deposed the white tower will be whole again and no one will be able to claim i lack its backing then duhara studied her wine for a moment her face a mask of aes sedai serenity it wont be entirely smooth going for you she said as if elayne had not spoken this is the part i thought you wouldnt want the wilders to hear and that guard does she think im going to attack you no matter once you have the crown firmly on your head you will have to appoint a regent because you must return to the tower then to complete your training and eventually be tested for the shawl you need have no fear of being birched as a runaway elaida accepts that siuan sanche ordered you to leave the tower your pretense of being aes sedai is another matter that you will pay for with tears sumeko and alise stirred and duhara took notice of them again ah you didnt know that elayne is really only one of the accepted elayne rose and stared down at duhara usually someone seated held the advantage over someone standing but she made her stare hard and her voice harder she wanted to slap the womans face i was raised aes sedai by egwene alvere on the day she herself was raised amyrlin i chose the green ajah and was admitted dont you ever say im not aes sedai duhara burn me if ill stand still for it duharas mouth pinched down till her lips seemed a gash think and you will see the reality of your situation she said finally think hard elayne a blind woman could see how much you need me and the white towers blessing we will talk again later have someone show me to my rooms i am more than ready for my bed youll have to find a room at an inn duhara every bed in the palace already has three or four people sleeping in it if dozens of beds had been free she would not have offered duhara one turning her back she walked to the fireplace and stood warming her hands the gilded pendulum clock on the scrollcarved marble mantel chimed three times perhaps as many hours remained till sunrise deni have someone escort duhara to the gates you wont fend me off so easily child no one fends off the white tower easily think and youll see im your only hope silk whisked against silk as she left the room and the door clicked shut behind her it seemed very possible duhara would cause trouble trying to make herself needed but one problem at a time did she put doubts in your minds elayne said turning from the fire none sumeko replied vandene and the other two accept you as aes sedai so you must be conviction was strong in her voice but then she had reason to want to believe if elayne were a liar her dreams of returning to the tower of joining the yellow ajah died but this duhara believes she was speaking the truth alise spread her hands im not saying i doubt you i dont but the woman believes elayne sighed the situation is complicated that was like saying water was moist i am aes sedai but duhara doesnt believe she cant because that would be admitting egwene alvere truly is the amyrlin seat and duhara wont do that until elaida has been brought down she hoped duhara would believe then accept at least the tower had to be made whole sumeko you will order the kinswomen to stay in groups always the stout woman muttered that she would unlike reanne sumeko had no flair for leadership or liking for it either a pity no older kinswoman had appeared to take the burden from her alise youll make sure they obey alises agreement was firm and quick she would have been the perfect candidate if the kin did not determine their rankings by age then weve done what we can its long past time you were in your beds long past time for you too alise said as she stood i could send for melfane no need to rob her of sleep too elayne said hastily and firmly melfane was short and stout a merry woman with a ready laugh and unlike her aunt in other ways as well merry or not the midwife was a tyrant who would not be pleased to learn that she was awake ill sleep when i can once they left she released saidar and took up a book from several on the second sideboard yet another history of andor but she could not concentrate bereft of the power she felt grumpy burn her she was so weary that her eyes felt grainy she knew that if she lay down though she would stare at the ceiling till the sun rose in any case she had stared at the page for only minutes when deni appeared again master norry is here my lady with that hark fellow said hed heard you were up and wondered if you could spare him a few minutes he had heard she was up if he was having her watched the import broke through her grumpiness hark he had not brought hark since that first visit ten days ago no eleven days now ebullience replaced peevishness telling deni to send them in she followed the woman as far as the anteroom where a patterned carpet covered most of the redandwhite floor tiles here too only a pair of standlamps were lit giving off a dim wavering light and a scent of roses master norry looked more than ever a whitecrested wading bird with his long spindly shanks and tufts of hair sticking up behind his ears but for once he almost seemed excited he was actually rubbing his hands together he was not carrying his leather folder tonight even in the dim light the ink stains on his crimson tabard showed one had turned the tuft of the white lions tail black he offered a stiff bow and the nondescript hark imitated him awkwardly then knuckled his forehead for good measure he was wearing a darker brown than he had previously but the same belt and buckle forgive the hour my lady norry began in that dry voice how did you know i was awake she demanded emotions bouncing again norry blinked startled by the question one of the cooks mentioned sending up warm goats milk for you when i went to get some for myself my lady i find warm goats milk very soothing when i cant sleep but she mentioned wine too so i assumed you had visitors and might still be awake elayne sniffed she still wanted to snap at someone keeping that out of her voice required an effort i suppose youve success to report master hark i followed him like you said my lady and hes been to the same house three nights counting this one its on full moon street in the new city it is only place he ever goes except taverns and common rooms he drinks some he does dices a lot too the man hesitated drywashing his hands nervously i can go now right my lady youll take off whatever it was you put on me according to the tax rolls norry said the house is owned by the lady shiaine avarhin my lady she seems to be the last of the house what else can you tell me about the place master hark who else lives there besides this lady shiaine hark rubbed his nose uneasily well i dont know as they lives there my lady but theres two aes sedai there tonight i saw one of them letting mellar out while the other was coming in and the one who was coming in said a pity there are only two of us falion the way lady shiaine works us only she said lady like she didnt mean it she did funny she was carrying a stray cat a thing scrawny as she was he bobbed a sudden nervous bow begging your pardon my lady didnt mean no offence speaking of an aes sedai that way but it took me a minute to realize she was aes sedai it did there was good light from the entry hall there was but she was so thin and plain with a wide nose that nobody would take her for aes sedai without some study elayne laid a hand on his arm excitement bubbled in her voice and she let it what were their accents their accents my lady well the one with the cat shes from right here in caemlyn id say the other well she didnt say above two sentences but id say she was kandori called the other marillin if that helps my lady laughing elayne capered a few steps she knew who had set mellar on her now and it was worse than she had feared marillin gemalphin and falion bhoda two black sisters who had fled the tower after doing murder that had been to facilitate theft but it was the murders that would see them stilled and beheaded it had been to find them and the others with them that she egwene and nynaeve had been sent out of the tower the black ajah had planted mellar next to her to spy most likely but still a chilling thought worse than she had feared and yet finding the two now was like completing the circle hark was staring at her with his mouth hanging open she realized master norry was studiously examining the lions stained tail she stopped dancing and folded her hands fool men where is mellar now in his rooms i believe norry said my lady youll take it off now hark said and i can go i did what you asked first you have to lead us to this house she said darting past him to the twinned doors then well talk putting her head out into the corridor she found deni and seven more guardswomen lined up on either side of the doors deni send someone to fetch the lady birgitte as fast as possible and someone else to wake the aes sedai and ask them to come too with their warders and prepared to take a ride then you go and wake however many guardswomen you think you need to arrest mellar you neednt be too gentle about it the charges are murder and being a darkfriend lock him in one of the basement storerooms with a strong guard the stocky woman smiled broadly and began giving orders as elayne went back inside hark was wringing his hands and shifting from one foot to the other anxiously my lady what do you mean well talk you promised to take this thing off me if i followed the man you did and i did so you have to keep your word i never said id remove the finder master hark i said youd be exiled to baerlon instead of hanging but wouldnt you rather remain in caemlyn the man widened his eyes trying to look sincere and failing he even smiled oh no my lady ive been dreaming about the fresh country air in baerlon i has ill wager theres never a worry about getting rotten meat in your stew there here you got to sniff careful before you eat anything im looking forward to it i am elayne put on the stern face her mother had always worn passing judgment youd be out of baerlon two minutes behind the guardsmen who escorted you there and then youd hang for breaking your exile much better for you to remain in caemlyn and take on a new line of work master norry could you use a man with harks talents i could my lady norry replied without even a pause for thought a satisfied smile touched his thin lips and elayne realized what she had done she had given him a tool to encroach on mistress harfors ground but there was no undoing it now the work wont be so remunerative as your former trade master hark but you wont hang for it not so what my lady hark said scratching his head it wont pay so well what do you say baerlon where youll surely cut a purse or bolt and hang for either one or caemlyn where youll have steady work and no fear of the hangman unless you take up cutting purses again hark swayed on his feet scrubbing the back of his hand across his mouth i needs a drink i does he muttered hoarsely very likely he believed the finder would allow her to know if he cut a purse if so she had no intention of disabusing him master norry scowled at the man but when he opened his mouth she said theres wine in the small sitting room let him have one cup then join me in the large sitting room the large sitting room was dark when she walked in but she channeled to light the mirrored standlamps against the darkpaneled walls and the kindling of the fires neatly laid on the facing hearths then she took a seat in one of the lowbacked chairs around the scrolledged table and released saidar again since her experiment at holding the power all day she had not held it longer than necessary her mood swung from joyful excitement to morose worry and back on the one hand she was done with having to put up with mellar and soon she would have her hands on two black sisters questioning them might lead to the rest or at least reveal their plans and if not this shiaine would have her own secrets anyone who was working two darkfriend sisters would have secrets worth knowing on the other hand what would duhara do to try forcing her acceptance as an advisor duhara would try to meddle somehow but she could not see how burn her she did not need any more difficulties between her and the throne with a little luck tonight would not only snare two black sisters it might uncover a third a murderer ten times over back and forth she went from falion and marillin to duhara even after master norry and hark joined her hark a silver cup in his hand tried to take a seat at the table but master norry tapped him on the shoulder and jerked his head toward a corner sullenly hark went where he was directed he must have begun drinking as soon as the cup was filled because he emptied it in one long pull then stood turning it over in his hands and staring at it suddenly he gave a start and directed an ingratiating grin at her whatever he saw on her face made him flinch scuttling to the long table against the wall he set the cup down with exaggerated care then scuttled back to his corner birgitte was the first to arrive the bond filled with weary discontent a ride she said and when elayne explained she began raising objections well some of it was objections the rest was just insults what harebrained crackpated scheme are you talking about birgitte vandene said as she entered the room she wore a riding dress that hung loose on her one of her sisters it would have fit her perfectly while adeleas was alive but the whitehaired woman had lost weight her jaem wiry and gnarled took one look at hark and placed himself where he could watch the man hark ventured a smile but it faded when jaems expression remained hard as iron the warders graying hair was thin but there was nothing soft about him she intends to try capturing two black sisters tonight birgitte replied shooting a hard look at elayne two black sisters sareitha exclaimed walking through the door she gathered her dark cloak around her as though the words had given a chill who her warder ned a tall broadshouldered young man with yellow hair eyed hark and touched his sword hilt he chose a spot where he could watch the man too hark shifted his feet he might have been thinking of trying to run falion bhoda and marillin gemalphin elayne said sareithas mouth hardened what about falion and marillin careane asked as she glided into the room her warders were disparate men a tall gangly tairen a bladeslender saldaean and a broadshouldered cairhienin they exchanged glances and tavan the cairhienin leaned against the wall watching hark while cieryl and venr stood in the doorway harks mouth took on a sickly twist there was nothing for it but to explain again from the beginning which elayne did with a rising impatience that had nothing to do with her shifting moods the longer this took the more chance that falion and marillin might be gone by the time she reached the house on full moon street she wanted them she intended to have them she should have made birgitte wait until everyone had gathered a good plan i think vandene said when she finished yes it will do nicely others were not so agreeable it isnt a plan its bloody madness birgitte said sharply arms folded beneath her bosom she scowled down at elayne the bond such a turmoil of emotions that elayne could barely make them out the four of you enter the house alone alone that isnt a plan its flaming insanity warders are supposed to guard their aes sedais backs let us come with you the other warders put in emphatic agreements but at least she was not trying to stop the whole thing any more there are four of us elayne told her we can watch our own backs and sisters do not ask their warders to face other sisters birgittes face darkened if i need you ill shout so loud youd be able to hear me if you were back here in the palace the warders remain outside she added when birgitte opened her mouth the bond filled with frustration but birgittes jaw snapped shut perhaps this man can be trusted sareitha said glancing at hark with no trust at all but even if he heard correctly nothing says there are still only two sisters in the house or any if they have gone theres no danger but if others have joined them we might as well put our necks in a noose and spring the trap ourselves careane folded her sturdy arms and nodded the danger is too great you yourself told us that when they fled the tower they stole a number of terangreal some very dangerous indeed ive never been called a coward but i dont fancy trying to sneak up on someone who might have a rod that can make balefire he could hardly have misheard something as simple as there are only two of us elayne replied firmly and they spoke as if they didnt expect any others burn her considering her standing with respect to them they should have been jumping to obey rather than arguing in any case this isnt a discussion a pity both objected if only one had it could have been a clue unless they both were black ajah a bonefreezing thought that yet her plan took the possibility into account falion and marillin wont know we are coming until its too late if theyre gone well arrest this shiaine but we are going it was a larger party than elayne had expected that rode out of the queens stableyard behind her and hark birgitte had insisted on bringing fifty guardswomen though all they would be doing was missing sleep a column of twos in redlacquered helmets and breastplates black in the night that snaked along the palace behind the aes sedai and warders reaching the front of the palace they skirted the edge of the queens plaza the great oval crowded now with rude shelters that housed sleeping guardsmen and nobles armsmen men were billeted everywhere room could be found but there were insufficient basements and attics and spare rooms near enough the palace and the parks where circles of kinswomen would take the men to the places where they were needed the fighting they did was afoot on the walls so their horses were all picketed in nearby parks and in the larger palace gardens a few sentries shifted as they passed heads swiveling to follow but with her hood up all they could be sure of was that a large contingent of guardswomen were escorting a party through the night the sky to the east was still dark but it must be less than two hours till first light the light send dawn would see falion and marillin in custody and one more at least one more winding streets led over and around the hills past narrow tilecovered towers that would glitter with a hundred colors when the sun rose and glittered faintly in the clouddappled moonlight past silent shops and lightless inns simple stone houses with slate roofs and small palaces that might have fit in tar valon the ring of horseshoes on the paving stones and the faint creak of saddle leather sounded loud in the silence except for an occasional dog that slunk away into the deeper shadows of alleys nothing else moved the streets were dangerous at this hour but no footpad would be mad enough to come in sight of so large a party half an hour after leaving the royal palace elayne rode fireheart through the mondel gate a wide twentyfoothigh arch in the inner citys tall white wall once there would have been guardsmen on duty there to keep the peace but the queens guards were spread too thin now for that almost as soon as they were into the new city hark turned east into a warren of streets that meandered in every direction through the citys hills he rode awkwardly on a bay mare that had been found for him cutpurses seldom spent time in the saddle some of the streets were quite narrow here and it was in one of those that he finally drew rein surrounded by stone houses of two or three or even four stories birgitte raised a hand to halt the column the sudden silence seemed deafening its just around that corner there it is my lady the other side of the street hark said in a near whisper but if we go riding out there they might hear us or see us pardon my lady but if these aes sedai are what you says they are i dont want them seeing me he scrambled down from his saddle clumsily and looked up her wringing his hands his moonshadowed face anxious dismounting elayne led fireheart to the corner and peeked around the corner of a narrow threestory house the houses along the other street stood dark except for one four substantial stories of stone with the closed gate of a stableyard beside it not an ornate building but large enough for a wealthy merchant or banker bankers and merchants were unlikely to be awake at this hour however there hark whispered hoarsely pointing he stood far back so he had to learn forward to point he really did fear being seen the one with the light on the second floor it is best to find out if anyone else is awake in there vandene said peering past elayne jaem dont go inside the house elayne expected the lean old warder to sneak across the street but he just strolled out holding his cloak close around him against the early morning chill even the dangerous grace of a warder appeared to have deserted him vandene seemed to sense her surprise skulking draws the eye and creates suspicion she said jaem is just a man walking and if its early to be out in the streets he isnt sneaking so anyone who sees him will think of some mundane reason for him to be out reaching the stableyard gate jaem pulled it open and walked through as if he had a perfect right long minutes passed before he came back out shutting the gate carefully behind him and strolled back along the street he rounded the corner and the leopardlike grace reappeared in his step all the windows are dark except that one he told vandene quietly the kitchen door is unlatched so is the back door that lets onto an alley trusting for darkfriends or else dangerous enough they dont worry about burglars theres a big fellow sleeping in the barn up in the loft big enough to scare any burglar but hes so drunk he didnt wake while i was tying him up vandene raised a questioning eyebrow i thought id better be safe drunks sometimes wake when you least expect you wouldnt want him seeing you go in and start making noise she nodded approval its time to get ready elayne said moving back from the corner and handing her reins to birgitte she tried to embrace the source it was like trying to catch smoke with her fingers frustration and anger welled up all the things you needed to suppress if you were to channel she tried again and failed again falion and marillin were going to get away to come this close they had to be in that lighted room she knew it and they were going to escape sadness replaced anger and suddenly saidar flowed into her she barely stifled a sigh of relief ill meld the flows sareitha vandene you meld for careane i dont understand why we have to link the tairen brown muttered but she put herself on the edge of embracing the power with two of them and four of us we outnumber them but linked its two and two a clue perhaps she wished it to be three and three two strong enough to overwhelm them even if theyre holding the power sareitha elayne reached through her as if she were an angreal and the glow of saidar surrounded the other woman as the link was completed in truth it surrounded both of them but she could only see the part around sareithauntil she wove spirit around her then the glow vanished she placed the same weave on herself and prepared four shields and several other weaves all inverted she felt almost giddy with excitement but she did not intend to be caught by surprise frustration still pulsed along the bond but for the rest birgitte felt like a drawn arrow elayne touched her arm we will be all right birgitte snorted and flung her thick braid back over her shoulder keep an eye on master hark birgitte it would be a shame if he had to be hanged because he was tempted to run hark squeaked she exchanged glances with vandene who said we might as well be about it the four of them walked up full moon street slowly as if out for a stroll and slipped into the shadowshrouded stableyard elayne opened the kitchen door slowly but the hinges were welloiled emitting not a squeak the brickwalled kitchen was lit only by a tiny fire in the wide stone fireplace where a kettle hung steaming yet that was enough for them to cross the floor without bumping into the table or chairs someone sighed and she pressed a warning finger to her lips vandene frowned at careane who looked embarrassed and spread her hands a short hall led to stairs at the front of the house gathering her skirts elayne started up silent on slippered feet she was careful to keep sareitha where she could see her vandene was doing the same with careane they could do nothing with the power but that hardly meant they could do nothing on the second flight of stairs she began hearing the murmur of voices light spilled from an open door dont care what you think a woman said in that room you leave the thinking to me and do as youre told elayne moved to the door it was a sitting room with gilded standlamps and rich carpets on the floor and a tall fireplace of blue marble but she had eyes only for the three women in it only one a sharpfaced woman was seated that must be shiaine the other two stood with their backs to the door heads bowed like penitents the sharpfaced womans eyes widened when she saw her in the doorway but elayne gave her no time to open her mouth the two black sisters cried out in alarm as shields went onto them and flows of air bound their arms to their sides tightened their skirts around their legs more flows of air fastened shiaine to her gilded armchair elayne drew sareitha into the room with her and moved to where she could see all of their faces sareitha tried to step back she might only have been trying to give her the place of prominence but elayne caught her sleeve again keeping her in view too vandene and careane joined them marillins narrow face held aes sedai calm but falion snarled silently what is the meaning of this shiaine demanded i recognize you youre elayne trakand the daughterheir but that gives you no right to invade my home and assault me falion bhoda elayne said calmly marillin gemalphin shiaine avarhin i arrest you as darkfriends well her voice was calm inside she wanted to skip with glee and birgitte thought this would be dangerous that is ridiculous shiaine said in icy tones i walk in the light not if you walk with these two elayne told her to my certain knowledge theyve proven themselves black ajah in tar valon tear and tanchico you dont hear them denying it do you thats because they know i suddenly sparks danced all over her from head to toe she twitched helplessly muscles spasming saidar slipping from her grasp she could see vandene and careane and sareitha jerking as sparks flickered across them as well only a moment it lasted but when the sparks vanished elayne felt as if she had been fed through a mangle she had to hold on to sareitha to stay on her feet and sareitha clung to her as hard vandene and careane were supporting one another swaying each with her chin on the others shoulder falion and marillin wore startled expressions but the light of the power enveloped them in heartbeats elayne felt the shield fasten on to her saw them settle on the other three there was no need for binding any of them would have fallen over without support she would have shouted if she could have if she thought that birgitte and the others could do more than die four women elayne recognized entered the room asne zeramene and temaile kinderode chesmal emry and eldrith jhondar four black sisters she could have wept sareitha groaned softly why did you wait so long asne demanded of falion and marillin the saldaeans dark tilted eyes were angry i used this so they wouldnt feel us embrace saidar but why did you just stand there she waved a small bent black rod perhaps an inch in diameter that had a strangely dull look the thing seemed to fascinate her a gift from moghedien a weapon from the age of legends i can kill a man at a hundred paces with this or just stun him if i want to put him to the question i can kill a man if i can see him chesmal said scornfully tall and handsome she was the image of icy arrogance asne sniffed but my target could be surrounded by a hundred sisters and not one would know what killed him i suppose it has its uses chesmal admitted in grudging tones why did you just stand there they had us shielded falion said bitterly eldriths breath caught and she put a plump hand to a round cheek thats impossible unless her dark eyes sharpened theyve discovered a way to hide the glow to hide their weaves now that would be most useful you have my thanks for your timely rescue shiaine said rising but do you have a reason for coming here tonight did moridin send you asne channeled a flow of air that struck shiaines cheek with a loud crack staggering her keep a civil tongue in your mouth and perhaps well let you leave with us or we can leave you behind dead shiaines cheek was reddened but her hands remained at her sides her face was expressionless elaynes the only one we need temaile said she was pretty in a foxfaced way almost a fragile child in appearance despite her ageless face but her blue eyes held an unhealthy light she touched her lips with the tip of her tongue id enjoy playing with the others but theyd be a burden we dont need if youre going to kill them marillin said as though discussing the price of bread spare careane she is one of us a gift from adeleas vandene murmured and careanes eyes went very wide her mouth opened but no sound came out the two women sagged and fell to the carpet vandene began trying to push herself up but careane lay staring at the ceiling the hilt of vandenes belt knife protruding from beneath her breastbone the glow surrounded chesmal and she touched vandene with a complex weave of fire earth and water the whitehaired woman collapsed as if her bones had melted the same weave touched sareitha and she pulled elayne down atop her as she fell sareithas eyes were already glazing their warders will be coming now chesmal said a little more killing to do run birgitte elayne thought wishing the bond could carry words run chapter thirtytwo to keep the bargain birgitte was leaning against the stone wall of the threestory house thinking sadly of gaidal when the bundle of emotions and physical sensations in the back of her head her awareness of elayne suddenly spasmed that was the only word for it whatever it was lasted just a moment but afterward the bond was full of limpness elayne was conscious but unsteady she was unafraid however still birgitte threw back her cloak and moved to the corner to peer up full moon street elayne could be too brave for her own good the hardest thing about being elaynes warder was keeping her from endangering herself beyond need nobody was indestructible but the bloody woman thought she bloody well was her sigil should have been an iron lion rather than a golden lily that light shone in the window spilling a pale pool into the narrow street and there was not a sound except for a cat yowling somewhere in the night sareitha feels muzzy ned yarman muttered beside her the tall young warders boyish face was a grim shadowed mask inside the hood of his cloak she feels weak birgitte became aware of the other warders crowding her close stonefaced and hardeyed that was clear enough even by moonlight something had happened to all of the aes sedai it seemed but what the lady elayne said shed shout if she needed us she told them as much to reassure herself as anything else even if both careane and sareitha were darkfriends they would have been helpless to do anything linked and apparently whatever had happened had happened to them as well burn her she should have insisted that she and the other warders go along careane wont be pleased if we interfere needlessly venr kosaan said quietly blade slim and dark with touches of white in his tightly curled black hair and short beard he appeared completely at ease i say we wait she feels confident whatevers going on more so that she did going in cieryl arjuna added earning him a sharp glance from venr still short of his middle years cieryl seemed all bones though his shoulders were wide birgitte nodded elayne was confident too but then elayne would feel selfassured walking an unraveling rope stretched over a pit full of sharp stakes a dog began barking in the distance and the yowling cat went silent but other dogs answered the first in a spreading ripple that faded away as suddenly as it had begun they waited with birgitte fretting in silence suddenly venr growled an oath and shed his cloak the next instant his blade was in his hand and he was running up the street followed by cieryl and tavan cloaks billowing behind their blades bared too before they had gone two steps jaem gave a wild cry unsheathing his sword he threw his cloak down and raced after the other three at a speed that belied his age bellowing with rage ned ran too the steel in his fist glittering in the moonlight fury stabbed through the bond like the battle fury that took some men and sadness too but still no fear birgitte heard the soft rasp of swords being unsheathed behind her and spun cloak flaring put those up theyre no use here i know what the warders running in means as well as you my lady yurith said in courtly accents obeying smoothly and with clear reluctance lean and as tall as most men the saldaean denied being nobly born but whenever the conversation came around to what she had done before swearing the oath as a hunter for the horn she always gave one of her rare smiles and changed the subject she was skilled with that sword however if the aes sedai are dying elayne is alive birgitte cut in alive and in trouble shes our concern now but well need a lot more swords to rescue her and more than swords somebody collar that man two guardswomen seized harks coat before he could slip away into the darkness apparently he had no wish to stay near where aes sedai had died neither did she gather the the extra horses and follow me she said swinging into arrows saddle and ride like fire she suited her words digging her heels into the rangy gray geldings flanks without waiting it was a wild gallop through dark twisting streets where people were just beginning to appear she reined arrow around the few carts and wagons out this early but men and women had to leap from her path often shaking fists and shouting curses she only urged the gelding for more speed her cloak flapping behind before she reached the mondel gate elayne was moving she had been uncertain at first but there could be no mistaking it now elayne was moving northeast at about walking speed the bond said she was too wobbly to walk far maybe to walk at all but a wagon would make the same pace the sky was turning gray how long before she could gather what was needed in the inner city the street spiraled inward rising past towers glittering in a hundred colors toward the golden domes and pale spires of the royal palace atop the highest of caemlyns hills as she galloped around the rim of the queens plaza soldiers stared at her they were being fed from black kettles atop pushbarrows cooks ladling some sort of brown stew onto tin plates and every man she could see wore his breastplate and had his helmet hanging from his sword hilt good every moment saved was a moment toward saving elayne two lines of guardswomen were practicing the sword in the queens stableyard when she galloped in but the lath blades stopped rattling when she flung herself out of the saddle let arrows reins drop and ran toward the colonnade hadora run tell the windfinders to meet me in the map room right away she shouted without slowing all of them sanetre you do the same for captain guybon and have another horse saddled for me arrow was played out for today she was past the columns by that time but she did not look back to see whether they were obeying they would be she raced through tapestryhung hallways and up sweeping marble stairs got lost and shouted curses as she retraced her steps at a run liveried serving men and women gaped as they dodged out of her way at last she reached the lioncarved doors of the map room where she paused only long enough to cell the two burly guardsmen on duty to admit the windfinders as soon as they appeared then went in guybon was alteady there in his burnished breastplate with the three golden knots on his shoulder and dyelin delicately holding her blue silk skirts up as she moved the pair of them frowning at the huge mosaic map where well over a dozen red discs marked the citys northern wall never before had there been so many assaults at once not even ten but birgitte spared the discs barely a glance guybon i need every horse and halberd you can muster she said unpinning her cloak and tossing it down on her long writing table the crossbowmen and archers will have to handle anything that crops up by themselves for a few hours elaynes been captured by darkfriend aes sedai and theyre trying to carry her out of the city some of the clerks and messengers began murmuring but mistress anford silenced them with a sharp order to see to their work birgitte eyed the colorful map in the floor measuring distances elayne seemed to be moving toward the sunrise gate and the road to the river erinin but even if they used one of the smaller gates they had gone too far to be aiming at anything but the eastern wall theyll probably have her through the gates by the time were ready to move were going to travel to just this side of the ridge east of the city and take what was going to happen out of the streets away from peoples homes it would be better out in the open in any case in that tangle of streets with horsemen and halberdmen jammed together there would be too many people to get in the way too much chance of accidents guybon nodded already issuing terse orders that brownclad clerks copied down hastily lor him to sign and pass to young messengers in redandwhite who went running as soon as the paper was in hand the boys faces were frightened birgitte had no time for her own fear elayne felt none and she was a prisoner sadness yes but no fear we certainly need to rescue elayne dyelin said calmly but shell hardly thank you if you give arymilla caemlyn by doing it not counting the men in the towers and holding the gates almost half the trained soldiers and armsmen in the city are on the northern wall if you strip away the rest one more attack will gain a stretch of the wall crossbows and bows alone wont stop them once they have that arymillas forces will pour into the city enough to overwhelm what you propose to leave you will have neatly reversed our positions and worsened yours arymilla will have caemlyn and elayne will be outside without enough armsmen to get back in unless these darkfriends have somehow smuggled an army inside caemlyn a few hundred men will do as well as thousands birgitte scowled at her she had never been able to like dyelin she did not know why exactly but dyelin had just made her bristle at first sight she was fairly certain the other woman felt the same about her she could never say up without dyelin saying down you care about putting elayne on the throne dyelin i care about keeping her alive to mount that throne or not so long as shes alive i owe her my life and i wont let hers trickle away in darkfriend hands dyelin sniffed and went back to studying the red discs as if she could see the soldiers fighting her frown deepening the lines at the corners of her eyes birgitte clasped her hands behind her back and forced herself to stand still she wanted to pace with impatience elayne was still trundling toward the sunrise gate theres something you need to know guybon well be facing at least two aes sedai likely more and they may have a weapon a terangreal that makes balefire have you ever heard of that never it sounds dangerous though oh it is dangerous enough that its prohibited for aes sedai in the war of the shadow even darkfriends stopped using it she barked a bitter laugh all she knew of balefire now was what elayne had told her it had come from her in the first place yet that only made matters worse would all of her memories go she did not think she had lost any recently but how would she know if she had she could remember bits of the founding of the white tower pieces of what she and gaidal had done to help it be founded but nothing before that all of her earlier memories were yesterdays smoke well at least well have aes sedai of our own guybon said signing another order theyre all dead except for elayne she told him flatly there was no way to gild that dyelin gasped her face growing pale one of the clerks clasped her hands to her mouth and another knocked over his ink jar the ink fanned across the tabletop in a black stream and began dripping onto the floor rather than reprimanding the man mistress anford steadied herself with a hand on another clerks writing table i hope to make up for that birgitte went on but i cant promise anything except that were going to lose men today maybe a lot of men guybon straightened his expression was thoughtful his hazel eyes steady that will make for an interesting day he said finally but well get the daughterheir back whatever the cost a solid man charlz guybon and brave he had demonstrated that often enough on the walls too good looking for her taste of course birgitte realized she had begun pacing back and forth across the mosaic and stopped she knew nothing of being a general whatever elayne thought but she knew that showing nerves could infect others with them elayne was alive that was all that was important alive and moving farther away by the minute the lefthand door opened and one of the burly guardsmen announced that julanya fote and keraille surtovni had returned guybon hesitated looking to her but when she said nothing he told the man to admit them they were very different women in appearance at least though each carried a wooden walking staff julanya was plump and pretty with touches of white in her dark hair while keraille was short and slim with tilted green eyes and fiery red curls birgitte wondered whether those were their real names these kinswomen changed names as easily as other women changed stockings they wore plain woolens suitable for country peddlers which each had been in the past and each was a keen observer skilled at taking care of herself they could talk their way out of most situations but their simple belt knives were not the only blades they carried and they could surprise a strong man with what they could do with those walking staffs both offered curtsies julanyas skirts and cloak were damp and splashed with mud around the hem ellorien luan and abelle began breaking camp early this morning my lady she said i only stayed long enough to make sure of their directionnorthbefore coming to report the same is true with aemlyn arathelle and pelivar my lady keraille added theyre coming for caemlyn birgitte did not need to examine the large map spread out on the table with its markers depending on how muddy the roads were how much rain they had to contend with they could reach the city by that afternoon youve done well both of you go find yourselves hot baths do you think theyve had a change of heart she asked dyelin once the two women had left no the woman replied without hesitation then sighed and shook her head i fear the most likely thing is that ellorien has convinced the others to support her for the lion throne they may be thinking to defeat arymilla and take over the siege they have half again her numbers and double ours she let that hang there was no need to say the rest even using kinswomen to shift men they would be hard pressed to hold the wall against that many first we get elayne back then we can worry about that lot birgitte said where were those bloody windfinders no sooner did she have the thought than they were padding into the room behind chanelle a riotous rainbow of silks except for renaile last in line in her linens yet a red blouse green trousers and a deep yellow sash made her bright enough though even rainyn a roundcheeked young woman with just half a dozen golden medallions dangling onto her cheek made renailes honor chain look bare renailes face wore an expression of stoic endurance i do not appreciate being threatened chanelle said angrily sniffing the golden scent box on its golden chain around her neck her dark cheeks were flushed that guardswoman said if we did not run she would kick never mind what she said exactly it was a threat and i will not be elayne has been captured by darkfriend aes sedai birgitte cut in i need you to make a gateway for the men who are going to rescue her a murmur rose among the other windfinders chanelle gestured sharply but only renaile fell silent the others just lowered their voices to whispers to her obvious displeasure by the medallions crowding their honor chains several of them matched chanelles rank why did you summon all of us for one gateway she demanded i keep the bargain you can see i brought everyone as you ordered but why do you need more than one because youre all going to form a circle and make a gateway big enough to take thousands of men and horses that was one reason chanelle stiffened and she was not alone kurin her face like a black stone practically quivered with outrage and rysael normally a very dignified woman did quiver senine with her weathered face and old marks indicating she once had worn more than six earrings and fatter ones fingered the jeweled dagger thrust behind her green sash soldiers chanelle said indignantly that is forbidden our bargain says we will take no part in your war zaida din parede black wing commanded it so and now that she is mistress of the ships that command carries even greater weight use the kinswomen use the aes sedai birgitte stepped close to the dark woman looking her straight in the eyes the kin were useless for this none of them had ever used the power as a weapon they might not even know how the other aes sedai are dead she said softly someone behind her moaned one of the clerks what is your bargain worth if elayne is lost arymilla certainly wont honor it keeping her voice steady saying that took effort it wanted to shake with anger shake with fear she needed these women but she could not let them know why or elayne would be lost what will zaida say if you ruin her bargain with elayne chanelles tattooed hand halflifted the piercework scent box to her nose again then let it fall among her many jeweled necklaces from what birgitte knew of zaida din parede she would be more than displeased with anyone who wrecked that bargain and it was beyond doubtful that chanelle wished to face the womans anger yet she only looked pensive very well she said after a moment for transport only though it is agreed she kissed the fingertips of her right hand prepared to seal the bargain you only need do what you want birgitte said turning away guybon its time they must have her to the gate by now guybon buckled on his sword took up his helmet and steelbacked gauntlets and followed her and dyelin out of the map room trailed by the windfinders with chanelle loudly insisting that they would provide a gateway only birgitte whispered instructions to guybon before leaving him striding toward the front of the palace while she hurried to the queens stableyard where she found a hammernosed dun gelding wearing her saddle and waiting the reins held by a young groom with her hair in a braid not much different from her own she also found all hundred and twentyone guardswomen armored and mounted climbing into the duns saddle she motioned them to follow her the sun was a golden ball clear of the horizon in a sky with only a few high white clouds at least they would not have rain to contend with too even a wagon might have been able to slip away in some of the heavy rainstorms caemlyn had seen lately a thick snake of men ten and twelve abreast spanned the queens plaza now stretching out of sight in both directions horsemen in helmets and breastplates alternating with men in every sort of helmet imaginable carrying shouldered halberds most wearing mail shirts or jerkins sewn with steel discs and only rarely a breastplate each group large or small headed by the banner of its house or the banner of a mercenary company the sellswords would have too many watchers to try slacking off today minus the crossbowmen and archers there would be close on twelve thousand men in that column two thirds of them mounted how many would be dead before noon she pushed that thought out of her mind she needed every one of them to convince the sea folk any man who died today could die as easily on the wall tomorrow every man of them had come to caemlyn prepared to die for elayne at the head of the column were better than a thousand guardsmen helmets and breastplates gleaming in the sun steeltipped lances slanted precisely the first of them waiting behind the banner of andor the rearing white lion on a field of scarlet and elaynes banner the golden lily on blue at the edge of one of caemlyns many parks it had been a park anyway but oaks hundreds of years old had been cut down and hauled away along with all the other trees and the flowering bushes their roots dug out to clear a smooth space a hundred paces wide the graveled paths and grassy ground had long since been trampled to mud by hooves and boots three other parks around the palace had received the same treatment to make places for weaving gateways guybon and dyelin were already there along with all the lords and ladies who had answered elaynes call from young perival mantear to brannin marfan and his wife all mounted perival wore helmet and breastplate like every other male present brannins were plain and dull and slightly dented where the armorers hammer had failed its task tools of his trade as surely as the plainhiked sword scabbarded at his side perivals were as gilded as conails and branlets worked with the silver anvil of mantear where theirs were lacquered with northans black eagles and gilyards red leopards pretty armor for being seen in birgitte hoped the women had sense enough to keep those boys out of any fighting looking at some of those womens faces grim and determined she hoped they had sense enough to stay clear themselves at least none was wearing a sword the simple truth was a woman had to be more skilled than a man to face him with a sword stronger arms made too much difference otherwise much better to use a bow the windfinders were grimacing as they shifted their bare feet uneasily on ground still muddy from yesterdays downpour wet they were more than accustomed to but not mud this man will not tell me where the gateway is to reach chanelle said furiously pointing to guybon as birgitte dismounted i want to be done so i can wash my feet my lady a womans voice called from back down the street my lady birgitte reene harfor came running up the line of guardsmen her red skirts held high exposing her stockinged legs to the knee birgitte did not think she had ever seen the woman so much as trot mistress harfor was one of those women who always did everything perfectly every time they met she made birgitte conscious of every last mistake she herself had ever made two men in redandwhite livery were running behind her carrying a litter between them when they came closer birgitte saw that it held a lanky helmetless guardsman with an arrow piercing his right arm and another jutting from his right thigh blood trickled down both shafts so he left a thin trail of drops on the paving stones he insisted on being brought to you or captain guybon immediately my lady mistress harfor said breathlessly fanning herself with one hand the young guardsman struggled to sit up until birgitte pressed him back down three or four companies of mercenaries are attacking the far madding gate my lady he said pain wracking his face and tinging his voice from inside the city i mean they placed archers to shoot anyone who tried to wave the signal flags for help but i managed to get away and my horse lasted just long enough birgitte growled an oath cordwyn gomaisen and bakuvun would be among them she was ready to wager she should have pressed elayne to put them out of the city as soon as they made their demands she did not realize she had spoken aloud until the wounded guardsman spoke up no my lady leastwise not bakuvun him and a dozen or so of his men dropped by to toss uh to pass the time and the lieutenant figures theyre the only reason weve managed to hold on if they are still holding they were using battering rams on the tower doors when i looked back but theres more my lady theres men massing in low caemlyn outside the gates ten thousand maybe twice that hard to tell the way those streets twist birgitte winced ten thousand men would be enough to carry an assault from the outside whether or not the mercenaries were held off unless she sent everything and she could not what in the light was she to do burn her she could plan a raid to rescue someone from a fortress or scout in country held by the enemy with confidence that she knew what she was doing but this was a battle with the fate of caemlyn and maybe the throne in the balance still she had it to do mistress harfor take this man back to the palace and see his wounds tended please there was no point in asking the windfinders for healing they had already made it clear that was taking part in the war in their view dyelin leave me all of the horse and a thousand halberdmen you take the rest and all of the crossbowmen and archers available and every man you can scrape together who can hold a sword if the gate is still holding when the kinswomen get you there make sure it continues to hold if its fallen take it back and hold that bloody wall till i can get there very well dyelin said as if those were the easiest orders in the world to carry out conail catalyn branlet perival you come with me your foot will fight better with you there conail looked disappointed no doubt seeing himself riding in a gallant charge but he gathered his reins and whispered something that made the two younger boys chuckle so will my horse fight better catalyn protested i want to help rescue elayne you came to help her secure the throne dyelin said sharply and youll go where youre needed to see to that or you and i will have another talk later whatever that meant catalyns plump face reddened but she sullenly followed dyelin and the others when they rode away guybon looked at birgitte yet he said nothing though likely he was wondering why she was not sending more he would not challenge her publicly the problem was she did not know how many black sisters would be with elayne she needed every windhnder needed them to believe they were all necessary had there been time she would have stripped the sentries from the outer towers stripped even the gates make the gateway she told chanelle to just this side of the ridge east of the city right on top of the erinin road and facing away from the city the windfinders gathered in a circle doing whatever they had to do to link and taking their bloody time about it suddenly the vertical silverblue slash of a gateway appeared widening into an opening five paces tall and covering the whole width of the cleared ground that showed a wide road of hardpacked clay climbing the gentle slope of the tenspan high ridge on its way to the river erinin arymilla had camps beyond that ridge given the news they might be emptywith luck they were but she could not concern herself with them now in any event forward and deploy as ordered guybon shouted and spurred his tall bay through followed by the gathered nobles and the guardsmen ten abreast the guardsmen began curling off to the left and out of sight while the nobles took a position a little up the ridge some began peering toward the city through looking glasses guybon dismounted and ran crouching to peer over the crest through his birgitte could almost feel the impatience of the guardswomen waiting behind her you did not need a gateway this large chanelle said frowning at the column of horsemen flowing into the gateway why come with me birgitte said taking the windfinder by her arm i want to show you something pulling the dun along by his reins she began drawing the woman toward the gateway you can come back once youve seen it if she knew the least thing about chanelle she was the one guiding the circle for the rest she was counting on human nature she did not look back yet she nearly sighed with relief when she heard the other windfinders murmuring among themselves behind her following whatever guybon had seen it was good news because he straightened up before running back down to his horse arymilla must have stripped her camps to the bone make it twenty thousand at the far madding gate then if not more the light send it was holding the light send everywhere was holding but elayne first first and above all else when she reached guybon who was back on his bay the guardswomen arrayed themselves in three lines behind caseille off to one side the whole hundredpace width of the gateway was filled with men and horses now trotting as they hurried left and right to join the others already forming in three ranks that grew to either side of the road good there would be no easy way for the windfinders to duck back through for a little while a wagon with an arched canvas cover and a fourhorse team surrounded by a small mounted party was halted in the road just beyond the last buildings of low caemlyn perhaps a mile distant beyond it people bustled in the open brick markets that lined the road going about their lives as best they could but they might as well not have existed elayne was in that wagon birgitte raised her hand without taking her eyes from the vehicle and guybon put his brassmounted looking glass in her palm wagon and riders leaped closer when she raised the tube to her eye what did you want me to see chanelle demanded in a moment birgitte replied there were four men three of them mounted but more important were the seven women on horseback it was a good looking glass but not good enough for her to make out an ageless face at that distance still she had to assume all seven were aes sedai eight against seven might have seemed almost even odds but not when the eight were linked not if she could make the eight take part what were the darkfriends thinking seeing thousands of soldiers and armsmen appear from behind what would seem to them a heat haze hanging in the air she lowered the glass noblemen were beginning to ride down as their armsmen came out and went to join the lines however surprised the darkfriends were they did not dither long lightning began flashing down out of a clear sky silverblue bolts that struck the ground with thunderous crashes and threw men and horses like splashed mud horses reared and plunged and screamed but men fought to control their mounts to hold their places no one ran the booming thunder that accompanied those blasts struck birgitte like blows staggering her she could feel her hair stirring trying to rise out of her braid the air smelled sharp it seemed to tingle again lightning lashed the ranks in low caemlyn people were running most were running away but some fools actually ran to where they could have a better view the ends of narrow streets opening onto the countryside began filling with spectators if were going to face that we might as well be moving and make it harder for them guybon said gathering his reins with your permission my lady well lose fewer if youre moving birgitte agreed and he spurred down the ridge caseille halted her horse in front of birgitte and saluted an arm across her chest her narrow face was grim behind the facebars of her lacquered helmet permission for the bodyguard to join the line my lady you could hear the capital they were not just any bodyguard they were the daughterheirs bodyguard and would be the queens bodyguard granted birgitte said if anyone had a right these women did the arafellin whirled her horse and galloped down the slope followed by the rest of the bodyguard to take their place in those lightningtorn ranks a company of mercenaries perhaps two hundred men in blackpainted helmets and breastplates riding behind a red banner bearing a running black wolf halted when they saw what they were riding into but men behind the banners of half a dozen houses pushed past them and they had no choice but to go on more noblemen rode down to lead their men brannin and kelwin laerid and barel others none hesitated once he saw his own banner appear sergase was not the only woman to move her horse a few paces as if she too meant to join with her armsmen when her banner came out of the gateway at a walk guybon shouted to be heard over the explosions all along the line other voices echoed him advance wheeling his bay he rode slowly toward the darkfriend aes sedai while lightning boomed and crashed and men and horses flew in fountains of earth what did you want me to see chanelle demanded again i want to be away from this place small danger of that for the moment men were still coming out of the gateway galloping or running to catch up fireballs fell among the ranks too now adding their own eruptions of dirt arms legs a horses head spun lazily into the air this birgitte said gesturing to the scene in front of them guybon had begun to trot pulling the others with him the three ranks holding steady in their advance others coming as hard as they could to join them abruptly a legthick bar of what appear to be liquid white fire shot out from one of the women beside the wagon it quite literally carved a gap fifteen paces wide in the lines for a heartbeat shimmering flecks floated in the air the shapes of men and horses struck and then were consumed the bar suddenly jerked up into the air higher and higher then winked out leaving dim purple lines across birgittes vision balefire burning men out of the pattern so that they were dead before it struck them she swung the looking glass up to her eye long enough to spot the woman holding a slim black rod that appeared to be perhaps a pace long guybon began to charge it was too soon but his only hope was to close while he still had men alive his only hope but one over the thunderous explosions of fireballs and lightning rose a ragged cry of elayne and andor ragged but fullthroated the banners were all streaming a brave sight if you could ignore how many were falling a horse and rider struck squarely by a fireball simply disintegrated men and horses all around them going down as well some managed to rise again a riderless horse stood on three legs tried to run and fell over thrashing this chanelle said incredulously i have no desire to watch men die another bar of balefire sliced a breach of nearly twenty paces in the charging ranks before knifing down into the ground cutting a trench halfway back to the wagon before it vanished there were a good many dead though not so many as it seemed there should be birgitte had seen the same in battles during the trolloc wars where the power had been used for every man who lay still two or three were staggering to their feet or trying to stem a flow of blood for every horse stifflegged in death two more stood on wobbly legs the hail of fire and lightning continued unabated then stop it birgitte said if they kill all the soldiers or just enough to make the rest break then elayne is lost not forever burn her she would track her for the rest of her life to see her free but the light only knew what they might do to her in that time zaidas bargain is lost you will have lost it the morning was not warm yet sweat beaded on chanelles forehead fireballs and lightning erupted among the riders following guybon the woman holding the rod raised her arm again even without using the looking glass birgitte was sure it was pointed straight at guybon he had to see it but he never swerved a hair suddenly another bolt of lightning slashed down and struck the woman holding the rod she flew in one direction her mount in another one of the wagon team sagged to the ground while the others danced and reared they would have run except for their dead tracemate the other horses around the wagon were rearing and plunging too the rain of fire and lightning ceased as the aes sedai fought to control their horses to maintain their saddles rather than trying to calm his team the man on the drivers seat leaped down and drew his sword as he began to run toward the charging horsemen the onlookers in low caemlyn were running again too this time away take the others alive birgitte snapped she did not much care whether they livedthey would die soon enough for being darkfriends and murderersbut elayne was in that bloody wagon chanelle nodded stiffly and around the wagon riders began toppling from their fractious mounts to lie struggling on the ground as if bound hand and foot which they were of course the running man fell on his face and lay writhing i shielded the women too chanelle said even holding the power they would have been no match for a circle of eight guybon raised his hand slowing the charge to a walk it was remarkable how short a time it all had taken he was less than halfway to the wagon men mounted and afoot were still pouring out of the gateway swinging into the duns saddle birgitte galloped toward elayne bloody woman she thought the bond had never once carried any hint of fear chapter thirtythree nine out of ten the darkfriends had taken no chances with elayne aside from shielding her temaile had taken seemingly malicious pleasure in tying her in a tight knot with her head between her knees her muscles already ached from the cramped position the gag a dirty piece of rag with a vile oily taste tied so tightly that it dug into the corners of her mouth had been meant to keep her from shouting for help at the gates not that she would have all that would have done was sentence the men guarding the gates to death she could feel the six black sisters holding saidar until they were through the gate but the blindfold had been an unnecessary touch she thought they wanted to add to her sense of helplessness yet she refused to feel helpless after all she was perfectly safe until her babies were born and so were her babies min had said so she knew she was in a wagon or cart by the sound of harness and the feel of rough boards beneath her they had not bothered to pad the floorboards with a blanket a wagon she thought there seemed to be more than one horse pulling it the wagon box smelled of old hay so strongly that she wanted to sneeze her situation seemed hopeless but birgitte would not fail her she felt birgitte leap from somewhere miles behind her to perhaps a mile ahead and she wanted to laugh the bond said birgitte was aimed at her target and birgitte silverbow never missed when the channeling started on both sides of the wagon the desire to laugh faded determination held rocksteady in the bond but there was something else as well now a strong distaste and a rising not anger but close men would be dying out there instead of laughing elayne wanted to weep for them they deserved someone to weep for them and they were dying for her as vandene and sareitha had died sadness for them welled up in her again no guilt though only by letting falion and marillin walk free could they have been spared and neither would have countenanced that there had been no way to anticipate the arrival of the others or that strange weapon asne had a thunderous crash came close at hand and her conveyance was jolted so violently that she bounced on the floorboards her knees and shins were going to be bruised from that she sneezed in the dust that had risen with her sneezed again she could feel individual hairs lifting where they were not held down by the gag and blindfold the air smelled peculiar a lightning strike it appeared she hoped birgitte had managed to involve the windfinders unlikely as that seemed the time would come when the kin would have to use the power as a weaponno one could stand aside from tarmon gaidonbut let them preserve their innocence a little longer moments later the shield on her vanished unable to see she could not channel to any real purpose but she could sense weaves near her some of spirit some of air without seeing the weaves she was unable to know what they were yet she could make a reasonable guess her captors were themselves captives now shielded and bound and all she could do was wait impatiently birgitte was coming closer rapidly yet now she felt anxious to have that bloody web of ropes off her the wagon box creaked as someone heaved herself in birgitte the bond carried a flash of joy in moments the ropes fell away from her and birgittes hands went to the knot of the gag moving a little stiffly elayne untied the blindfold herself light she was going to ache like fury until she could ask for healing that reminded her that she would have to ask the windfinders and the sadness rose all over again for vandene and sareitha once she could spit out the gag she wanted to ask for water to wash away the oily taste but instead she said what kept you her laughter at the other womans sudden consternation was cut short by another sneeze lets get out of here birgitte the kin windfinders birgitte answered holding open the canvas flap at the back of the wagon chanelle decided shed rather not report losing her bargain to zaida elayne sniffed in disdain a mistake sneezing repeatedly she climbed down from the wagon as quickly as she could manage her legs were as stiff as her arms burn her but she wanted a hot bath and a hairbrush birgittes whitecollared red coat looked somewhat rumpled but elayne suspected she made her warder appear fresh from the dressing room when her feet hit the ground mounted guardsmen in a thick ring around the wagon raised a loud cheer shaking their lances in the air guardswomen whooped too apparently almost every last one of them two of the men bore andors white lion and her golden lily that brought a smile the queens guards were sworn to defend andor the queen and the daughterheir yet the decision to carry her personal banner had to have been charlz guybons sitting a tall bay with his helmet resting on the saddlebow he bowed to her a broad smile on his lips the man was a pleasure to look at perhaps he would do for a third warder beyond the guards rose house banners and banners of mercenary companies banner after banner light how many men had birgitte brought that could be answered later though first elayne wanted to see her prisoners asne lay spreadeagled on the road her empty eyes staring at the sky the shield on her was unneeded the others lay as still bound with flows of air that held their arms to their sides and snugged their divided skirts against their legs a much more comfortable position than she had been in most seemed remarkably composed considering their situation though temaile scowled at her and falion appeared about to sick up shiaines mudsmeared face would have done credit to any aes sedai the three men bound with air were anything but composed they writhed and struggled glaring at the riders surrounding them as if they wanted nothing more than to attack them all that was enough to identify them as asnes warders though not necessarily as darkfriends whether they were or not they would still have to be imprisoned to protect others from the deathrage that asnes death had filled them with they would do anything to kill whomever they held responsible how did they find us chesmal demanded if she had not been lying in the road with a dirty face no one would have thought her a prisoner my warder elayne said smiling at birgitte one of them a woman warder chesmal said disdainfully marillin shook in her bonds with silent laughter for a moment id heard that she said when the shaking ceased but it seemed too incredible to be true you heard this and you never mentioned it temaile said twisting around to transfer her scowl to marillin you great fool you forget yourself marillin said sharply and the next instant they were arguing about whether temaile should defer to her in truth temaile shouldelayne could sense their relative strengthsyet it hardly seemed a topic they would argue over now somebody gag these women elayne ordered caseille dismounted handing her reins to another guardswoman and strode over to begin cutting a strip from temailes skirts with her dagger load them into the wagon and cut away that dead horse i want to get back inside the walls before arymillas people beyond the ridge feel tempted the last thing she needed now was a pitched battle whatever the outcome arymilla could afford to lose more men than she where are the windfinders birgitte still on the ridge i think they believe they can deny taking part if they dont get too near the carnage but you dont have to worry about being attacked here the camps beyond the ridge are empty caseille hoisted temaile over her shoulder and staggered over to heave her into the wagon like a sack of grain guardswomen were picking up the other women too they wisely left the struggling warders to the guardsmen it required two to handle each of them a pair of tall guardsmen were unfastening the dead horses harness all i saw were camp followers grooms and the like charlz put in i think all of her camps may be empty birgitte went on she sent heavy assaults against the northern wall this morning to draw as many of our men as possible and she has twenty thousand or more in low caemlyn below the far madding gate some of the mercenaries changed colors and are attacking it from inside but i sent dyelin with everything i could spare as soon as youre safe inside the walls ill take the rest to help her to add to the good news luan and the rest of that lot are riding north they could be here this afternoon elaynes breath caught luan and the rest would have be dealt with when they appeared but the other news do you remember what mistress harfor reported birgitte arymilla and the others all intend to be with the first party to ride into caemlyn they must be outside the far madding gate too how many men do you have here whats the butchers bill guybon birgitte asked eyeing elayne warily the bond carried wariness too great wariness i dont have a full tally yet my lady some of the bodies charlz grimaced id say as many as five or six hundred dead though perhaps a few more twice as many wounded one way and another as nasty a few minutes as ive ever seen call it ten thousand elayne birgitte said thick braid swaying as she shook her head she tucked her thumbs behind her belt and determination filled the bond arymilla has to have at least twice that at the far madding gate maybe three times if shes really stripped her camps if youre thinking what i think youre thinking i told dyelin to retake the gate if it had fallen but its more likely shes fighting arymilla inside the city if by some miracle the gate is holding youre talking better than two to one odds against us if theyre through the gate elayne said stubbornly its unlikely they closed it behind them well take them in the rear it was not all stubbornness not entirely she had not trained with weapons but she had received all of the other lessons gawyn had gotten from gareth bryne a queen had to understand the battle plans her generals gave her rather than simply accept them blindly if the gate is holding well have them trapped between us and the wall numbers wont count so much in low caemlyn arymilla wont be able to line up any more men across a street than we can we are going to do it birgitte now somebody find me a horse for a moment she thought the other woman was going to refuse which ratcheted up her stubbornness but birgitte exhaled heavily tzigan catch up that tall gray mare for lady elayne it seemed that everyone around them except the darkfriends sighed they must have thought they were going to see a display of elayne trakands fabled temper knowing that almost sparked one burn her bouncing moods stepping closer birgitte lowered her voice but youll ride surrounded by your bodyguard this isnt some fool story with a queen carrying her banner into battle to lead her troops i know one of your ancestors did that but youre not her and you dont have a broken army to rally why that was exactly my plan elayne said sweetly how ever did you guess birgitte snorted with laughter and muttered bloody woman not quite softly enough to escape detection affection flowed in the bond though it was not so simple of course men had to be told off to help the wounded some could walk but many could not too many had tourniquets around the bloody stump of an arm or a leg charlz and the nobles gathered around elayne and birgitte to hear the plan of attack which was simple of necessity but then chanelle refused to change the gateway until elayne agreed that this time they need provide transport only and sealed the agreement with them both kissing their fingertips and pressing them to the others lips only then did the gateway dwindle to a vertical silvery slash and widen again into a hundredpacewide view of caemlyn from the south there were no people in the brick markets lining the wide road that ran north from the gateway to the far madding gate but a great mass of men mounted and aroot crowded the road out of bowshot from the walls the first of them was only a few hundred paces from the gateway it appeared that they spilled into the side streets too the mounted men were to the front with a thicket of banners but cavalry or infantry they were all looking toward the gates of caemlyn itself the closed gates elayne could have shouted for joy she rode through first but birgitte was taking no chances her bodyguard gathered around her herding her off to one side birgitte was right by her side but somehow they did not seem to be herding her fortunately no one tried to object to her pushing the gray forward until only a single line of guardswomen was between her and the road that line might as well have been a stone wall the gray was indeed tall however so she could see without standing in the stirrups she should have lengthened those they were just a little short for her that made this chesmals horse since she was the only one who came close to her own height a horse could not be tainted by its riderjust because chesmal was black ajah did not make the horse evilbut she felt uncomfortable on the animal for more than short stirrups the gray would be sold the gray and all the other horses the darkfriends had been riding and the money distributed to the poor cavalry and foot came out of the gateway behind charlz enough to fill it from side to side followed by the white lion and the golden lily he started up the road at a trot with five hundred guardsmen spread out to cover the width of the road other parties of similar size split off and vanished into the streets of low caemlyn when the last men exited the gateway it dwindled and vanished now there was no quick escape if anything went wrong now they had to win or arymilla would as good as have the throne whether or not she had caemlyn we need mat cauthons bloody luck today birgitte muttered you said something like that before elayne said what do you mean birgitte gave her a peculiar look the bond carried amusement have you ever seen him dicing i hardly spend much time in places where theres dicing birgitte lets just say hes luckier than any other man ive ever met shaking her head elayne put mat cauthon out of her mind charlzs men were shutting off her view as they rode forward not charging yet trying to make no more noise than absolutely necessary with a little luck her men would have arymillas surrounded before they knew what was happening and then they would hit arymilla from every side mat was the luckiest man birgitte had ever met in that case he must be very lucky indeed suddenly charlzs guardsmen were moving faster their steeltipped lances swinging down someone must have looked back shouts rose cries of alarm and one thunderous shout she heard repeated from many directions elayne and andor there were other cries as well the moons and the fox the triple keys and the hammer and the black banner others for lesser houses but from her side came only the one repeated again and again elayne and andor suddenly she was shaking half laughing half weeping the light send she was not consigning those men to their deaths for nothing the cries faded largely replaced by the clash of steel on steel by shouts and screams as men killed or died abruptly she realized the gates were swinging out and she could not see kicking her feet free of the stirrups she clambered up to stand on the highcantled saddle the gray shifted nervously unaccustomed to being a stepstool but not enough to disturb her balance birgitte muttered a particularly pungent oath but the next moment she was standing on her saddle too hundreds of crossbowmen and archers were pouring out of the far madding gate but were they her men or the renegade mercenaries for answer archers began firing at arymilias massed cavalry as fast as they could nock and draw the first crossbows went up and loosed a volley immediately those men began working their cranks to rewind their crossbows but others rushed past them to loose a second flight of bolts that cut down men and horses like scythes reaping barley more archers spilled out of the gate firing as fast as they could a third rank of crossbowmen ran forward to fire a fourth a fifth and then men wielding halberds were pushing past the crossbowmen still running out of the gate a halberd was a fearsome weapon combining spearpoint and axe blade with a hook for pulling men out of the saddle horsemen with no room to charge their lances their swords outreached by the halberds long haft began falling men in red coats and burnished breastplates were galloping out of the gate now guardsmen swinging to left and right to find another way to get at arymillas ranks the flow of them went on and on unceasing how in the light could dyelin have so many of the guards unless burn the woman she must have scooped up the halftrained men well halftrained or not they would be anointed in blood today suddenly three figures in gilded helmets and breastplates rode through the gates swords in hand two of them were very small the shouts that rose when they appeared were thin with distance but still audible over the din of battle the black eagles and the anvil and the red leopards two mounted women appeared in the gate struggling until the taller managed to pull the others horse back out of sight blood and bloody ashes elayne snapped conails old enough i suppose but branlet and perival are boys somebody should have kept them out of that dyelin held them back long enough birgitte said calmly the bond carried bonedeep calm longer than i thought she could hold conail and she did manage to keep catalyn out of it anyway the boys have a few hundred men between them and the forefront and i dont see anyone trying to make room for them to squeeze forward it was true the three were waving their swords impotently at least fifty paces from where men were dying but then fifty paces was a short range for bow or crossbow men began appearing on the rooftops first dozens then hundreds archers and crossbowmen climbing over the roof peaks working their way across the slates like spiders until they could shoot down into the packed mass below one slipped and fell his body lying atop the men in the street and jerking as it was stabbed repeatedly another suddenly reared up a shaft sticking out of his side and toppled from his perch he also lay atop the men in the street twitching as he was stabbed again and again theyre jammed together too tightly birgitte said excitedly they cant raise a bow much less draw one ill wager the dead dont even have room to fall down it wont be long now but the slaughter continued for a good halfhour before the first shouts of quarter rose men began hanging their helmets on sword hilts and raising them overhead risking death in the hope of life footmen stripped off helmets and held their hands up empty horsemen flung down lances helmets swords and raised their hands it spread like a fever the cry bellowing from thousands of throats quarter elayne sat down on her saddle properly it was done now to learn how well it had been done the fighting did not stop immediately of course some tried to fight on but they fought alone and died or were pulled down by men around them who were no longer ready to die at last however even the most diehard began shedding weapons and armor and if not every voice cried for quarter the roar was still thunderous weaponless men shorn of helmets and breastplates and any other armor they might have worn began staggering through the line of guardsmen hands above their heads halberdmen herded them like sheep they had something of the stunned look of sheep in a slaughter yard the same thing must have been being repeated on dozens of low caemlyns narrow streets and at the gates because the only shouts she heard were for quarter and those were beginning to dwindle as men realized it was being granted the sun lacked no more than an hour of its noonday peak by the time the nobles were all separated out the lesser were escorted inside the city where they would be held for ransom to be paid once the throne was secure the first of the greater nobles to be brought to her escorted by charlz and a dozen guardsmen were arymilla naean and elenia charlz had a bloody gash down his left sleeve and a dent in his shining breastplate that must have been made by a hammer blow but his features were composed behind the facebars of his helmet she heaved a huge sigh of relief to see the three women among the dead or among the captives the others would be found she had decapitated her opposition at least until luan and the others arrived the guardswomen in front of her at last moved aside so she could confront her prisoners the three were garbed as if they had intended to attend arymillas coronation that very day her red silk dress was sewn with seed pearls on the bosom and embroidered with rearing white lions marching up the sleeves swaying in her saddle she had the same stunned look in her brown eyes that her soldiers had naean slim and straightbacked in blue with the silver triple keys of arawn climbing her sleeves and silver scrollwork across her bosom her gleaming black hair caught in a silver net set with sapphires seemed subdued rather than numb she even managed a sneer though it was weak honeyhaired elenia in green elaborately embroidered with gold shared her glares between arymilla and elayne the bond carried equal measures of triumph and disgust birgittes dislike of these women was as personal as elaynes own you will be my guests in the palace for the time being elayne told them i hope your coffers are deep your ransoms will pay for this war youve caused that was malicious of her but she felt spiteful all of a sudden their coffers were not deep at all they had borrowed far more than they could repay in order to hire mercenaries and bribe mercenaries they faced ruin without any ransom with they faced devastation you cannot believe it ends this way arymilla said hoarsely she sounded as if she were trying to convince herself jarid is still in the field with a considerable force jarid and others tell her elenia jarid will try to preserve what he can of sarand from this disaster youve forced us into elenia snarled they began shouting at one another but elayne ignored them she wondered how they would enjoy sharing a bed with naean next to appear under escort was lir baryn and moments later karind anshar as slender as a blade and as strong lir wore a thoughtful expression rather than defiant or sullen his green coat embroidered with the silver winged hammer of house baryn on the high collar bore the marks of the breastplate he was no longer wearing and his dark hair was matted with sweat more glistened on his face he had not gotten so sweaty watching other men fight karind was garbed as grandly as the other women in shimmering blue silk heavy with silver braid and pearls in her graystreaked hair her square face looked resigned especially after elayne told them about their ransoms neither had borrowed as heavily as the other three so far as she knew but that ransom would still cut deep then two guardsmen appeared with a woman a little older than elayne in simple blue a woman she thought she recognized a single enameled brooch a red star and silver sword on glittering black appeared to be her only jewelry but why was sylvase caeren being brought to her a pretty woman with alert blue eyes that held steady on elaynes face she was lord nasins heir not the high seat of caeren caeren stands for trakand sylvase said shockingly as soon as she reined in the bond echoed elaynes startlement arymilla gaped at sylvase as if she were mad my grandfather suffered a seizure arymilla the young woman said calmly and my cousins fell over themselves affirming me as high seat i will publish it elayne if you wish that might be best elayne said slowly publication would make her support irrevocable this would not be the first time a house had switched sides even without the death of a high seat but best to be certain trakand welcomes caeren warmly sylvase best not to be too distant either she knew little of sylvase caeren sylvase nodded accepting so she had at least a degree of intelligence she knew she would not be fully trusted until she demonstrated her loyalty by sending out the proclamations of support if you trust me a little may i have custody of arymilla naean and elenia in the royal palace of course or wherever you choose to house me i believe my new secretary master lounalt may be able to convince them to throw their support to you for some reason naean gave a loud cry and would have fallen from her saddle if a guardsman had not grabbed her arm to support her arymilla and elenia both appeared ready to sick up i think not elayne said no proposed conversation with a secretary produced those reactions it seemed sylvase had a hard core to her naean and elenia have published their support of arymilla theyll hardly destroy themselves by recanting that truly would destroy them smaller houses sworn to them would begin falling away until their own house dwindled in importance they themselves might not survive as high seats much beyond announcing that they now stood for trakand and as for arymilla elayne would not allow arymilla to change her tune she would refuse the womans support if it were offered something grim entered sylvases gaze as she glanced at the three women they might with the proper persuasion oh yes a very hard core but as you wish elayne be very careful of them though treachery is in their blood and bones baryn stands for trakand lir announced suddenly i too will publish it elayne anshar stands for trakand karind said in firm tones i will send the proclamations out today traitors arymilla cried ill see you dead for this she fumbled at her belt where a daggers scabbard hung jeweled and empty as if she intended to see to the matter herself elenia began to laugh but she did not sound amused it sounded almost like weeping elayne drew a deep breath now she had nine of the ten houses needed she was under no illusions whatever sylvases reasons lir and karind were trying to salvage what they could by cutting themselves loose from a lost cause and hitching themselves to one that suddenly appeared to be rising they would expect her to give them preferment for standing for her before she had the throne while forgetting that they had ever supported arymilla she would do neither but neither could she reject them out of hand trakand welcomes baryn never warmly though never that trakand welcomes anshar captain guybon get the prisoners into the city as soon as you can armsmen for caeren baryn and anshar will be restored their weapons and armor once the proclamations have been sent out but they can have their banners back now he saluted her and wheeled his bay already shouting orders as she heeled the gray toward dyelin who was riding out of a side street followed by catalyn and the three young fools in their gilded armor sylvase lir and karind fell in behind her and birgitte she felt no disquiet having them at her back not with a hundred guardswomen at theirs they would be watched very closely until those proclamations were sent including sylvase elaynes mind was already casting itself ahead youre awfully quiet birgitte said softly youve just won a great victory and in a few hours she replied ill learn whether i have to win another chapter thirtyfour a cup of kaf furyk karede pressed his gauntleted fist to his heart returning the sentrys salute and ignored the fact that the man spat as he rode past he hoped the eighty men and twentyone ogier behind him ignored it too they had better if they knew what was good for them he was here for information and a killing would make getting it more difficult since his manservant ajimbura had planted his knife in a standardbearers heart over a perceived insult to his master in truth a real insult but ajimbura should have held his temper the way he himself hadsince then he had taken to leaving the wiry little hilltribesman in the forest with the suldam and damam and some of the guards to watch over the packhorses when he entered a camp he had come a long way from ebou dar chasing the wind almost four weeks of haring after rumors until the news brought him here to this camp in east central altara the neat rows of pale tents and horselines stood in a forest clearing large enough for raken to land but there was no sign of raken or fliers no ground company with its wagons and rakengrooms but then he had not seen a raken in the skies for some time now supposedly almost all had been sent west why he did not know and did not care the high lady was his goal and his entire world a tall thin message pole cast its long shadow in the early morning sun though so there must be raken somewhere about he thought the camp might contain a thousand men not counting farriers and cooks and the like interestingly every last soldier he could see wore familiar armor from home rather than those solid breastplates and barred helmets practice was to pad out most forces with men from this side of the ocean it was interesting that they were all armored too a rare commander kept his soldiers in armor unless he expected action soon from the rumors he had picked up that might be the case here three flagstaffs marked the command tent a tall walled affair of pale canvas with air vents along the peak that doubled as smoke holes no smoke issued from them now for the morning was only a little cool though the sun hung not far above the horizon on one flagstaff the bluebordered imperial banner hung in limp folds hiding the spreadwinged golden hawk clutching lightning in its talons some commanders hung it from a horizontal staff so it was always visible in full but he thought that ostentatious the other two banners on shorter flanking staffs would be of the regiments these men belonged to karede dismounted in front of that tent and removed his helmet captain musenge emulated him revealing a grim expression on his weathered face the other men climbed down too to rest their horses and stood by their animals the ogier gardeners leaned on their longhafted blacktasseled axes everyone knew they would not be staying long keep the men out of trouble he told musenge if that means accepting insults so be it thered be fewer insults if we killed a few of them musenge muttered he had been in the deathwatch guards even longer than karede though his hair was unbroken black and he would suffer insults to the empress might she live forever as gladly as insults to the guards hartha scratched one of his long gray mustaches with a finger the size of a fat sausage the first gardener commander of all the ogier in the high lady tuons bodyguard was almost as tall as a man in the saddle and wide with it his redandgreen lacquered armor contained enough steel to make armor for three or four humans his face was as dour as musenges yet his booming voice was calm ogier were always calm except in battle then they were as cold as deep winter in jeranem after we rescue the high lady we can kill as many of them as need killing musenge recalled to his duty musenge flushed for having allowed himself to stray after he agreed karede had schooled himself too hard over the years had been schooled too hard by his trainers to sigh but had he been other than a deathwatch guard he might have done so now not because musenge wanted to kill someone and almost anyone would do rather it was because the insults he had walked away from these past weeks chafed him as much as they did musenge and hartha but the guards did whatever was necessary to carry out their assignments and if that meant walking away from men who spat on the ground at the sight of armor in red and the dark green most called black or dared to murmur about lowered eyes in his hearing then walk away he must finding and rescuing the high lady tuon was all that mattered everything else was dross beside that helmet under his arm he ducked into the tent to find what must have been most of the camps officers gathered around a large map spread out on a folding camp table half wore segmented breastplates lacquered in horizontal red and blue stripes the other half red and yellow they straightened and stared when he walked in men from khoweal or dalenshar with skin blacker than charcoal honeybrown men from nkon fairhaired men from mechoacan paleeyed men from alqam men from every part of the empire their stares held not the wariness often tinged with admiration that he had always been used to but very nearly challenges it seemed everyone believed the filthy tale of guards involvement with a girl pretending to be the high lady tuon and extorting gold and jewels from merchants likely they believed that other whispered tale about the girl not merely vile but horrific no that the high lady was in danger of her life from the ever victorious army itself went beyond horrific that was a world gone mad furyk karede he said coolly his hand wanted to go to his sword hilt only discipline kept it at his side discipline and duty he had accepted sword thrusts for duty he could accept insults for it i wish to speak to the commander of this camp for a long moment the silence stretched everybody out a tall lean man barked at last in the sharp accents of dalenshar the others saluted gathered their helmets from another table and filed out not one offered karede a salute his right hand twitched once feeling a phantom hilt against his palm and was still gamel loune the lean man introduced himself missing the top of his right ear he had a slash of solid white there through his tight black curls and flecks of white elsewhere what do you want there was the barest touch of wariness in that a hard man and selfcontrolled he would have had to be to earn the three red plumes decorating the helmet atop his swordrack weak men without mastery of themselves did not rise to bannergeneral karede suspected the only reason loune was willing to talk to him was that his own helmet bore three black plumes not to interfere in your command loune had cause to fear that ranks in the deathwatch guard stood half a step higher than those outside he could have coopted the mans command had he needed to though he would have been required to explain his reasons later they would have had to be good reasons for him to avoid losing his head i understand there have been difficulties in this part of altara recently i want to know what i am riding into loune grunted difficulties thats one word for it a stocky man in a plain brown coat a narrow beard dangling from the point of his chin entered the tent carrying a heavily carved wooden tray with a silver pitcher and two sturdy white cups the sort that would not break easily while being carried about in wagons the scent of freshly brewed kaf began to suffuse the air your kaf bannergeneral setting the tray on the edge of table holding the map he carefully filled one cup with the black liquid while watching karede from the corner of his eye somewhere in his middle years he wore a pair of long knives at his belt and his hands had a knifemans calluses karede sensed close kin to ajimbura in spirit but not blood those dark brown eyes never came from the kaensada hills i waited till the others left since theres hardly enough for you any more dont know when im going to get more i dont will you take kaf karede lounes reluctance was obvious but he could hardly fail to offer for an insult that large karede would have been forced to kill him or so the man would think with pleasure karede replied placing his helmet alongside the tray he doffed his steelbacked gauntlets and laid them beside it the serving man filled the second cup then started toward a corner of the tent but loune said that will be all for now mantual the stocky man hesitated eyeing karede before making a bow to loune touching eyes and lips with his fingertips and departing mantual is overprotective of me loune explained clearly he did not want to explain but he did want to avoid what might be taken for open insult odd fellow attached himself to me years ago in pujili wormed his way into becoming my manservant i think hed stay if i stopped paying him yes very close kin to ajimbura for a time they simply sipped kaf balancing the cups on fingertips and enjoying the pungent bitterness it seemed to be a pure ijaz mountains brew and if so very expensive karedes own supply of black beans most definitely not ijaz mountains had run out a week ago and he had been surprised at how much he missed having kaf he never used to mind going without anything at need the first cups done loune refilled them you were going to tell me about the difficulties karede prompted now that conversation would not be impolite he always tried to be polite even with men he was going to kill and rudeness here would dam up the mans tongue loune set his cup down and leaned his fists on the table frowning at the map small red wedges supporting tiny paper banners were scattered across it marking seanchan forces on the move and red stars indicating forces holding in place little black discs marking engagements peppered the map but strangely no white discs to indicate the enemy none over the last week loune said there have been four sizeable engagements and upwards of sixty ambushes skirmishes and raids many quite large all spread out across three hundred miles that encompassed almost the entire map his voice was stiff plainly given a choice he would have told karede nothing that halfstep gave him none however there must be six or eight different armies involved on the other side the night after the first large engagement saw nine major raids each forty to fifty miles from the site of the battle not small armies either at least not taken altogether but we cant find them and nobody has any eyeless idea where they came from whoever they are they have damane those aes sedai with them and maybe those cursed ashaman men have been torn apart by explosions our damane say werent caused by the power karede sipped his kaf the man was not thinking if the enemy had aes sedai and ashaman they could use the thing called traveling to move as far as they wished in a step but if they could do that why had they not used it to step all the way to safety with their prize perhaps not all aes sedai and ashaman could travel yet that begged another question why had they not sent those who could maybe the only aes sedai were the damane stolen from the tarasin palace reportedly none of them had had any idea how to travel that made sense what do the prisoners say about who sent them lounes laugh was bitter before you can have eyeless prisoners you need an eyeless victory what weve had are a string of eyeless defeats picking up his cup he took a sip his voice loosened as if he had forgotten the colors of karedes armor he was just a soldier talking his trade now gurat thought he had some of them two days ago he lost four banners of horse and five of foot almost to the last man not all dead but most of the wounded are the next thing to it pincushioned with crossbow bolts mostly taraboners and amadicians but that isnt supposed to matter is it had to be twenty thousand or more crossbowmen to put out that volume thirty thousand maybe and yet they manage to hide from the moratraken i know weve killed somethe reports claim it at leastbut they dont even leave their dead behind some fools have begun whispering that were fighting spirits fools he might consider them but the fingers of his left hand hooked in a sign to ward off evil ill tell you one thing i know karede their commanders are very good very very good every man to face them has been fought off his feet outmaneuvered and outfought completely karede nodded thoughtfully he had speculated that the white tower must have tasked one of its best to kidnap the high lady tuon but he had not been thinking along the lines of what people this side of the ocean called the great captains perhaps thom merrilins real name was agelmar jagad or gareth bryne he looked forward to meeting the man not least to ask him how he had known she would be coming to ebou dar he might hide suroths involvement but then again he might not on the heights todays ally could be tomorrows sacrifice except for the gardeners the deathwatch guards were da covale to the empress herself might she live forever yet they lived on the heights there must be some plan for finding them and pinning them are you in charge of it no praise be to the light loune said fervently he took a long drink as though wishing it were brandy general chisen is bringing his entire army back through the malvide narrows apparently the tarasin palace decided this was important enough to risk thrusts out of murandy or andor though from what ive heard neither one is capable of striking at anyone at the moment i just have to wait here until chisen arrives well see a different result then i think more than half chisens men will be veterans from home abruptly loune seemed to recall who he was talking to his face turned to dark wood a hard mask it did not matter karede was convinced this was the work of merrilin or whatever his name was and he knew why the man was doing what he was doing under different circumstances he would have told loune his reasoning but the high lady would not be safe until she was back in the tarasin palace among those who knew her face if the man failed to believe him on the key point that she was the high lady he would have increased her danger for nothing i thank you for the kaf he said setting the cup down and taking up his helmet and gauntlets the light see you safe loune we will meet in seandar someday the light see you safe karede loune said after a moment plainly surprised by the polite farewell we will meet in seandar someday the man had shared kaf and karede had no quarrel with him why should he be surprised karede did not speak to musenge until they had ridden out of the camp the ogier gardeners striding along just ahead of the human guards hartha was walking on karedes other side his long axe propped on his shoulder his head nearly level with theirs we head northeast he said for the malvide narrows if he remembered the maps correctly and he seldom forgot any map he had more than glimpsed they could reach it in four days the light shine on us that we arrive before the high lady if they did not the pursuit would continue all the way to tar valon if necessary the thought of turning back without the high lady never occurred to him if he had to bring her out of tar valon he would chapter thirtyfive the importance of dyelin they wanted safe conduct elayne said incredulously to enter caemlyn lightning flashed outside the windows and thunder boomed outside a deluge fell on caemlyn a hammering downpour the sun must have been well above the horizon but the standlamps were lit against twilight darkness the slender young man standing in front of her lowbacked chair colored with embarrassment yet he continued to look her in the eye he was little more than a boy really his smooth cheeks likely shaved as much for torm as because he needed a razor very often very properly hanselle renshar arathelles grandson wore neither sword nor armor but the marks or breastplate straps remained on his green coat imprinted by long wear a large damp spot on his left shoulder showed where his cloak had leaked through odd the things you noticed at times like this i was instructed to ask for it my lady he said his voice steady dyelin arms folded beneath her breasts grunted sourly she was not far from scowling mistress harfor resplendent as always in her crimson tabard with the white lion spotless on her formidable bosom sniffed audibly hanselle colored again they were in elaynes smaller sitting room where a small fire on the marble hearth took away most of the mornings chill and lamp oil scented the air with roses she wished birgitte was there from the mild irritation flowing through the bond she was dealing with reports her annoyance was not great enough for it to be anything more urgent the arrival of luan and the others below the city two days ago with their sixty thousand armsmen had occasioned more than a little excitement and impromptu celebrations in the streets by the citizens once it became clear they were not going to occupy the camps abandoned when jarid sarand left taking with him men from houses that now sided with elayne though they could not know it yet the light only knew what trouble that bloody man was going to cause but hanselles message put a new complexion on the huge encampment just a mile south of low caemlyn if arathelle luan and the others knew about the city being supplied from tear and illian through gateways and surely everyone in andor knew by this time perhaps they had decided a siege would accomplish nothing safe conduct was a matter of battle lines perhaps they intended to call for caemlyns surrender to avoid a grand assault the proclamations of support carried by kinswomen rather than riders had been posted from aringill to the mining villages in the mountains of mist or soon would be but even with sumeko and other kinswomen wearing themselves out in healing the armsmen of caeren anshar and baryn who had not been carried off by jarid did not bring her numbers anywhere near sixty thousand small bands of armsmen were beginning to flow into the city as word spread that it was safe to approach caemlyn but not enough yet it might be a week or more before sizeable parties appeared those had been staying clear of the city for fear of arymillas army the outcome of a massive assault was not a foregone conclusionmen atop a wall had considerable advantage over those trying to scale itbut it would be a near run thing at best and no hope for more help soon dyelin had paid another visit to danine candraed in the west but the woman still dithered elayne had nine houses where she needed ten everything hung in the balance and danine could not bloody decide whether or not to stand for trakand why do they wish to speak with me she managed to keep birgittes irritation from tinging her voice birgittes and her own hanselle reddened yet again he seemed to do that easily burn her they truly had sent a boy i was not informed my lady i was simply told to ask for safe conduct he hesitated they will not enter caemlyn without it my lady rising she went to her writing desk removed a smooth sheet of good white paper from the rosewood paperbox and dipped a pen in the silvermounted crystal ink jar precise letters flowed onto the page without her usual flourishes she was short and to the point lord luan norwelyn lady arathelle renshar lord pelivar coelan lady aemlyn carand lady ellorien traemane and lord abelle pendar may feel safe in entering caemlyn and be assured that they and their retinues may depart the city at any time they wish i will receive them informally this afternoon in the grand hall as befits their stations we must speak of the borderlanders elayne trakand daughterheir of andor high seat of house trakand she tried to maintain calm but the steel nib dug into the paper with the last letters safe conduct she channeled a sealing candle alight and her hand trembled as she dribbled golden yellow wax onto the page they implied she would try to hold them by force no more than implied they as good as said it she pressed her seal a blossoming lily into the wax as if trying to drive it through the tabletop here she said handing the sheet to the young man her voice was ice and she made no effort to warm it if this fails to make them feel safe perhaps they might try wrapping themselves in swaddling thunder boomed for punctuation he colored once more this time plainly in anger but wisely confined himself to offering thanks as he folded the page he was carefully tucking it inside his coat when mistress harfor showed him out she would escort him to his horse personally a messenger from nobles as powerful as luan and the others had to be given a certain level of honor suddenly elaynes anger turned to sadness she could not have said what she was sad over her moods often seemed to change without cause perhaps for all those who had died and all those who would are you certain you dont want to be queen dyelin luan and that lot would stand for you in a heartbeat and if i stand for you those whove stood for me will stand with me burn me danine would probably stand for you dyelin took a chair spreading her blue skirts carefully before answering im absolutely certain running my own house is work enough for me without adding all of andor to it besides i disapprove of the throne changing houses without good causethe lack of a daughterheir or worse one whos a fool or incompetent cruel or greedy youre none of those things continuity provides stability and stability brings prosperity she nodded she liked that turn of phrase mind had you died before returning to caemlyn and making your claim i would have entered my own but the simple truth is youll make a better ruler than i would better for andor in part thats because of your connection to the dragon reborn dyelins raised eyebrow invited elayne to expound on that connectionbut in large part she went on when elayne said nothing its you yourself i watched you grow up and by the time you were fifteen i knew youd be a good queen perhaps as good as andor has ever had elaynes face grew hot and tears welled in her eyes burn her bouncing moods only she knew she could not blame her pregnancy this time praise from dyelin was like praise from her mother never grudging but never given unless she felt it was deserved her morning was busy and she had only caemlyn and the palace to deal with rather than all of andor mistress harfor reported that the spies in the palace who could be confirmed as reporting to arymilla or her allies had grown very quiet and still like mice that feared a cat might be watching at least its safe to dismiss them now my lady reene said in tones of great satisfaction she disliked having spies in the royal palace as much as elayne did perhaps more daughterheir or queen might live in the palace but in the first maids eyes it belonged to her all of them spies for others had been left in place so that no one would suspect that reene knew keep them all on and continue to watch them elayne told her theyre the most likely to take coin from someone else and we know who they are a spy who was known could be kept from learning anything they should not and you could make sure they learned exactly what you wanted them to that went for the ajah eyesandears mistress harfor had uncovered too the ajahs had no right to spy on her and if she occasionally spoonfed them false information it would be their own fault if they acted on it she could not do that too often or they would realize she had uncovered their spies but she could at need as you say my lady the world has changed hasnt it im afraid it has mistress harfor the round woman nodded sadly but she quickly returned to business one of the windows in the grand hall has developed a leak my lady id have seen to anything minor without bothering you but this is a crack in the glass which means calling in the list of problems that needed elaynes approval and papers that needed her signature went on master norry reported on wagonloads of grain and beans and trade goods in that dusty voice of his and announced with some surprise that the number of arsons had not decreased seventeen buildings had burned in the night he had been sure the capture of arymilla would see an end to that and he was rueful over being wrong he brought death warrants in the names of rhys abalaman and aldred gomaisen for her to sign and seal mercenaries who turned their colors could expect no more unless their new masters prevailed evard cordwyn had died at the gate or he would have gone to the gallows too hafeen bakuvun had sent a petition asking a reward for his actions at the far madding gate yet that was easy enough to reject the presence of the domani mercenary and his men might well have been the difference in the gate holding until dyelin arrived but they had been earning their pay no more the prisoners are still being closemouthed i fear norry said sliding the refused petition back into his leather folder he seemed to feel that if he did that quickly enough it was the same as never having removed it the darkfriend aes sedai i mean my lady and the other two very closemouthed except for um invective mellar is the worst with that shouting about what he intends to do to the women who arrested him deni had taken her instuctions literally the guardswomen had pummeled mellar severely leaving him a mass of bruises from head to foot but the aes sedai can be quite um vituperative as well i fear it may be necessary to put them to the question if we hope to learn anything useful dont call them aes sedai she snapped hearing aes sedai linked with darkfriend made her stomach writhe those women have given up any right to be called aes sedai she had taken their great serpent rings herself and had them melted down that was egwenes prerogative not hers and she might well be reprimanded for it but she could not restrain herself ask the lady sylvase for the use of her secretary she had no questioners among her people and accorddng to aviendha an unskilled questioner was likely to kill the one being put unsuccessfully to the question when was her sister going to be allowed to visit light she missed aviendha i suspect hes no such thing lightning lit up the windows of the sitting room the glassed casements rattling with the boom of its thunder norry pressed his fingertips together holding the folder against his inkstained tabard with the heels of his hands and frowning gravely few people keep a private questioner my lady it suggests um a dark side but then as i understand matters her grandfather chased away every man who showed interest in her until men stopped showing interest and she has been virtually a prisoner since reaching her majority that would tend to give anyone a dark view of the world she may not um be as trustworthy as you could wish my lady do you think you can bribe some of her servants to be my eyesandears how easy it was to ask that spies had become a part of her life as much as masons or glaziers that should be possible my lady i will know for certain in a day or two once he would have been horrified by the very idea of having anything to do with spying all things changed eventually it seemed his hands shifted on the folder almost but not quite opening it i fear the sewers in the southern part of the new city need attention urgently elayne sighed not everything changed burn her once she did have all of andor she suspected she would seldom have an hour to herself what didluan and the others want not long after midmorning melfane dawlish appeared and had essande and neris strip elayne to the skin so she could be weighed in a huge woodenarmed balance scale the midwife had brought along a daily ritual the brass pan was padded with a blanket thank the light the stout little woman listened to her heart though a hollow wooden tube pressed to her chest and back thumbed back her eyelids to examine her eyes and smelled her breath she had elayne make water then held the glass jar up to the light of a standlamp to study it she smelled that too and even dipped a finger in and licked it it was another daily ritual elayne averted her eyes pulling her flowerembroidered silk robe tight around her but she still shuddered this time melfane noticed i can tell some sickness from changes in the taste my lady anywaytheres worse things my boy jaem the one who carried the scale for me his first paid job of work was mucking out in a stable he claimed everything he ate tasted like her round belly shook with laughter well you can imagine my lady elayne could and was glad she was not prone to nausea she shuddered again anyway essande seemed quite composed hands folded at her waist and watching her niece with approval but neris looked about to sick up pity he cant learn my craft but no one would buy herbs from a man or have a man midwife melfane laughed uproariously at that ridiculous notion wants to be apprenticed to an armorer of all things old for it but there it is now you be sure to read to your babe she was more than doubtful of elaynes claim that she would have a boy and a girl she would not accept it until she could hear their heartbeats and that would be some few weeks yet and have musicians play for her shell learn the sound of your voice learn to like reading and music too it helps in other ways besides makes the child brighter you say that every time mistress dawlish elayne said peevishly i can remember you know and i am doing it melfane laughed again a twinkle in her dark eyes she accepted elaynes bouncing moods the way she accepted rain and lightning youd be surprised how many dont believe a babe in the womb can hear but i can see the difference in those who get read to and those who dont do you mind if i have a few words with my aunt before i go my lady i brought her a pie and an ointment for her joints essandes face reddened well now that her lie was exposed she would accept healing or elayne would know the reason why at the end of the midday meal elayne brought up the intentions of luan and the others with birgitte it was a wonderful meal and she ate ravenously melfane had lambasted the cooks and every other woman in earshot for the bland diet they had been reeding her today there were small pond trout grilled to perfection cabbage rolls stuffed with ctumbly white ewes milk cheese broad beans with pinenuts and a tangy apple tart another reason it was marvelous was that nothing had the faintest hint of spoiling to drink there was good black tea with mint that made her tense for a moment until she realized it really was mint the only thing melfane had forbidden was wine however well watered birgitte had even given up drinking herself though it seemed impossible it could have any effect through the bond elayne refrained from pointing that out birgitte had been drinking too much to dull the pain of losing her gaidal elayne understood even if she did not approve she could not imagine what she would do if rand died i dont know birgitte said after wolfing down the last of her tart my best guess is theyve come to ask you to help them move against the borderlanders the one bloody thing thats sure is that they didnt bloody come to throw their support to you thats my best guess too elayne picked up crumbs of cheese with a damp fingertip and popped them into her mouth she could have eaten as much again as had been on her plate but melfane had announced her strict intention to limit her weight gain just enough and not too much perhaps a cow being fattened for market felt like this unless theyre going to demand i surrender caemlyn theres always that birgitte said sounding almost cheerful the bond said she was anything but we still have watchers in the towers though and julanya and keraille have gotten work as laundresses in their camp so well know if they begin to move against the city before the first man sets out elayne wished she did not sigh so often burn her she had arymilla naean and elenia under guard and definitely not enjoying sharing a bedshe knew the thought should not give her pleasure but it didand she had gained three more allies if not necessarily the most solid at least they were tied to her inextricably now she should have been feeling triumphant that afternoon essande and sephanie dressed her in dark green slashed with emerald on the skirts and embroidered with silver across the bosom down the sleeves and around the hem for jewelry she wore her great serpent ring and a large silver pin enameled blue except for the shape of trakands keystone the pin made her morose inside the house it was said that trakand was the keystone that held andor together she had not done a very good job of it so far she and birgitte took turns reading aloud to her babes from histories of course if melfane was right she did not want to direct them to frivolous tales dry stuff it was a plump man in red and white played the flute while a lean woman in livery played the twelvestring bittern producing lively joyous tunes at least when crashes of thunder did not drown them out bards did not grow on trees and birgitte had been uncertain about allowing anyone from outside the palace near elayne but mistress harfor had found a number of accomplished musicians who had leapt at the chance to put on livery their pay was considerably better in the palace than in a common room and their clothing was provided with it elayne thought of trying to hire a gleeman but that made her think of thom was he dry was he even alive all she could do was pray the light send it so please mistress harfor came to announce the arrival of luan arathelle and the others and elayne donned the coronet of the daughterheir a simple gold band that held a single golden rose surrounded by thorns above her brows caseille along with eight guardswomen fell in behind her birgitte and essande as they left her apartments boots thudding loudly on the floor tiles in step nine guardswomen had been among the dead when she was rescued from the darkfriends and that seemed to have bonded the others together even more tightly they got lost twice finding their way to the grand hall but no one so much as murmured what were shifting corridors when you had faced powerwrought fire and lightning the great arched doors of the grand hall carved with tall lions on both sides stood open and caseille took the guardswomen to stand in front of them while she birgitte and essande went in the tall windows in the walls were dark with rain except when lightning flashed but the mirrored standlamps against the walls and around the white columns that marched in rows along the sides of the chamber were all lit a loud steady plunkplunkplunk echoed in the vast space drops falling into a prosaic wooden bucket standing beneath one of the colored windows set in the ceiling twenty paces overhead where one of the rearing white lions had beads of water glistening along a crack near scenes of battle and the faces of andors earliest queens as always in this hall elayne felt those women judging her as she crossed the redandwhite floor tiles they had built andor with the sharpness of their minds and the blood of their sons and husbands beginning with a single city and molding a strong nation out of the rubble of artur hawkwings empire they had a right to judge any woman who sat on the lion throne she suspected their visages had been placed there so every queen would feel her actions judged by history the throne itself sat atop a white marble dais at the far end of the chamber carved and gilded and sized for a woman yet massive on its lionpawed legs the white lion formed from moonstones set in a field of glittering rubies on its tall back would stand above the head of the tallest woman who sat on that throne dyelin was already standing at the foot of the daiss steps watching sylvase converse with conail and catalyn while branlet and perival listened closely perival raked his fingers through his hair and nodded did dyelin have questions about sylvase too lir and karind stood apart from the rest and apart from each other as well neither even glanced at the other having been allies against elayne they would not want her to think they were allied still essande went to join the serving men and women in the liveries of the eight other houses gathered around a table that held tall silver pitchers of wine and tea that was what informal meant in this context each of them would bring a single servant in attendance for a formal meeting elayne would have provided all of the servants and the grand hall would have been crowded with every noble in caemlyn every noble from the encampment below caemlyn ellorien may well be provocative elayne dyelin said for about the fifth time since hearing of the safe conduct request her face was cool and calm yet she must have been feeling her nerves her hands smoothed unnecessarily at her goldembroidered skirts i wont let her provoke me elayne replied neither will anyone else i mean you conail and you lir conail in goldworked blue colored as quickly as hanselle had he had gotten into a fight with a mercenary he thought had spoken disparagingly of elayne and almost killed the man it was well for him the other man had begun drawing his sword first even mercenaries deserved justice and andor was not tear where nobles could kill commoners with impunity well before rand changed so many of their laws burn him why is he leaping about so i stood for you elayne and that means i always stand up for you lir said smoothly he looked every inch the selfconfident courtier in silverembroidered green silk with house baryns silver winged hammer on the collar yet he was too smooth by half lir was but ill hold my temper whatever ellorien says the bond surged with fleeting contempt trying to demonstrate how loyal he was to elayne lir had fought with mercenaries three times in two days the man had to have been searching for fights to manage that if she tries to goad us why should we bite our tongues catalyn demanded her red dress embroidered with broad bands of gold at the hem and on the sleeves did not suit her coloring especially when her plump cheeks were crimson with anger her chin was raised perhaps she wore that large enameled pin bearing haevins blue bear where she did so she would be forced to keep her chin high and look down her nose at everyone ive never allowed anyone to poke at me and walk away unscathed an ox responds to the goad and does as the oxherd wants dyelin said drily the same way you will be doing what ellorien wants if you respond to her goads the crimson remained in catalyns cheeks no doubt from embarrassment now reene harfor appeared in the doorway my ladies she said loudly her voice echoing in the nearly empty chamber my lords this was informality when two sides met and there was no knowing how far apart they were mistress harfor announced the newly arrived lords and ladies in strict order of precedence though among the houses gathered here there was not a great deal between them luan norwelyn hardfaced and more grayhaired than when elayne last saw him his blue coat undecorated except for norwelyns silver salmon on the high collar arathelle renshar her face creased and her brown hair thick with gray in a red riding dress ornately worked with gold and a large rubystudded pin that displayed the three golden hounds pelivar coelan tall and lean his dark hair receding till he almost looked as if he had shaved the front of his head like a cairhienin in silverembroidered blue with twinned red roses worked on his collar the roses of coelan aemlyn carand plump in gray silk with the three golden arrows climbing her sleeves and so thick on her bosom she looked like a bristling quiver ellorien traemane not so plump as elayne recalled but still pretty in greenslashed blue embroidered with goldenantlered white stags the white stag of traemane on the sleeves abelle pendar his angular face stern beneath gray hair in dark gray with the three golden stars on his collar they walked up the grand hall together trailed by their servants but not grouped as announced ellorien and abelle walked with luan pelivar and aemlyn with arathelle two paces between the groups so they asked for safe conduct as one yet they were not one that made a demand for surrender a little less likely even open enemies could act in concert at times divided skirts and snug breeches glistened damply the finest cloak could not protect a person completely in a downpour like this they would not be in their best tempers be welcome she told them as their servants peeled away to join the others will you take wine or tea the wine is hot and spiced this seems a wintery day for spring luan opened his mouth but ellorien spoke first at least youre not sitting on the throne her face might have been carved from marble and her voice was that hard and cold i half expected you to be thunder rolled overhead luan looked pained arathelle rolled her eyes as if she were hearing something she had heard all too often before lir stirred but elayne fixed him with a steady look and he gave a small apologetic bow i have no right to sit on the throne ellorien she replied calmly light please let her mood hold steady now yet there was an unintended touch of bite in that perhaps she was not so calm as she wished to be ellorien sneered if youre waiting for danine to make your ten youll have a long wait danine spent the last succession visiting her manors she never declared for anyone elayne smiled but it was difficult a succession was when one house succeeded another on the throne i will have tea ellorien blinked but it sparked the others to announce what they would take only elayne birgitte branlet and perival took tea everyone sniffed at their cups whether silver cups of wine or porcelain teacups before taking a sip elayne felt no insult food and wine could be fine in the kitchens and tainted by the time it reached the table there was never any telling where or when spoilage would strike the tea had a faint tang of ginger but not enough to overwhelm the taste of good tremalking black i see youve gathered most of your support among the children and arymillas leavings ellorien said catalyn turned as red as her dress and branlet straightened angrily until perival put a hand on his arm and shook his head a levelheaded boy perival and bright beyond his years lir managed to restrain himself this time but conail started to say something sharp before elaynes firm look snapped his teeth shut karind merely returned elloriens spiteful stare stolidly karind was not very intelligent but little ruffled her you must have had a reason for asking this meeting elayne said if it was merely to offer insults she let that trail off she had her own reasons for wanting this meeting if they had asked for her to come to them she would have without asking for safe conduct feeling a pulse of anger through the bond she took a firm rein on hers birgitte wore a scowl directed ac ellorien like a dagger if they began feeding one anothers temper that did not bear thinking about not here not now ellorien opened her mouth again and this time luan cut her off weve come to ask for a truce elayne a flash of lightning lit the northern windows and those in the ceiling but the interval to thunder said it had been some distance off a truce are we at war luan has someone declared for the throne that i havent heard of six sets of eyes swung to dyelin who grunted fools i told you and told you and you wouldnt believe me perhaps youll believe this when sylvase karind and lir sent their proclamations of support i sent my own taravin stands for trakand and the whole of andor will know it soon enough ellorien colored angrily and managed to make even that seem cold aemlyn took a long drink looking thoughtful arathelle allowed a touch of disappointment to touch her face before it returned to a mask nearly as hard as elloriens be that as it may luan said we still want if not a truce then a temporary agreement he drank a small swallow from his winecup and shook his head sadly even gathering everything we can well have a difficult time defeating the borderlanders but if we fail to act together theyll carve up andor once they decide to move frankly im surprised theyve remained in one place this long their men ought to be well rested by now even after a thousandleague march lightning lit the southern windows brightly and thunder crashed so loudly it seemed the glass panes should shiver close that one i expected them to be into murandy by now myself elayne said but i believe their reason for sitting in one place is a fear of sparking a war if they come too near caemlyn they seem to be trying to find a way to murandy using country roads you know what condition those are in this time of year they want no war with us when i gave them permission to cross andor they told me they were looking for the dragon reborn ellorien spluttered and chips of ice should have come from her mouth when you what you prate of how you have no right to sit on the throneyetand then you arrogate to yourself the right of of an aes sedai ellorien elayne held up her right hand so they could not miss the golden great serpent encircling the third finger her own voice was frosty despite all she could do i did not speak as daughterheir or even high seat of house trakand i spoke as elayne aes sedai of the green ajah had i not they would have come anyway they were very short of food and fodder had i tried to stop them had anyone tried to stop them there would have been war they are determined to find the dragon reborn it would have been a war andor had faint chance of winning you speak of acting together luan gather all of andors strength and we could nearly match their numbers but two in three of ours would be men who can handle a halberd or spear but spend most of their days behind a plow every man of theirs is a longserving armsman who would not be surprised to face trollocs any day of his life instead of a war that would soak andor in blood and cripple her for a generation we have the borderlanders crossing our nation peacefully i have them watched they pay for the food and fodder they need and pay well another time with other listeners she would have laughed over that andoran farmers would try to pry high prices out of the dark one the worst theyve done is flog a few horsethieves and if they should have been handed over to a magistrate i cant fault the borderlanders for it now tell me ellorien what would you have done differently and how ellorien blinked icily sullen then sniffed dismissively and sipped at her wine and what do you plan for this black tower abelle asked quietly i suspect you have a plan for them too did he suspect her other reason for letting the borderlanders cross andor let him so long as he did not give it voice so long as he kept silent her motives seemed purely for andors good that was hypocritical no bones about it but realistic as well she had spoken truthfully concerning her other reasons but that one spoken aloud could cost her she still needed one more house and it looked as if candraed had to be it but danine would never move if she thought elayne was trying to force her into it nothing she told him i send guardsmen periodically to ride around the black tower grounds and remind them they are in andor and subject to andors laws but aside from that i can do no more than i could if the white tower were somehow transported to caemlyn for a long moment they stared at her all six of them unblinking pendar stands for trakand abelle said suddenly and right atop him luan said norwelyn stands for trakand lightning flashed overhead brightening the colored windows in the ceiling elayne kept herself from swaying with an effort birgittes face was smooth but the bond carried amazement it was done she had eleven and the throne was hers the more who stand for her the better for andor dyelin sounded a touch dazed herself stand with me for trakand there was another pause longer full of exchanged glances but then one by one arathelle pelivar and aemlyn announced that their houses stood for trakand doing so for dyelin though elayne would have to remember that perhaps she could win their loyalty in time but for the present they supported her for dyelins sake she has the throne ellorien said as cold as ever the rest is fluff and feathers elayne tried to make her voice warm will you dine with us this evening ellorien at least remain until the rain abates i have my own cooks ellorien replied turning away toward the doors her serving woman came running to take her cup and return it to the table as soon as the rain stops i will be leaving for sheldyn ive been away too long tarmon gaidon is coming soon ellorien elayne said you wont be able to remain on your estates then ellorien paused looking over her shoulder when tarmon gaidon comes traemane rides for the last battle and we ride behind the lion of andor thunder boomed as she strode out of the grand hall with her serving woman at her heels will you all join me in my apartments elayne asked the others behind the lion of andor but not a word about behind elayne trakand nearly half her support was suspect one way or another jarid sarand was still on the loose with a not inconsiderable force and she would have trouble from ellorien eventually it was never this way in stories in stories everything was always wrapped up neatly by the end real life was much messier still she had the throne at last there was still the coronation but that was a formality now as she led the procession from the grand hall chatting with luan and pelivar thunder rolled overhead like martial drums beating the march for tarmon gaidon how long before andors banners had to march to the last battle chapter thirtysix under an oak the sun stood well above the mountains as karede rode through the trees toward the socalled malvide narrows perhaps two leagues ahead the fivemilewide gap in the mountains carried the road from ebou dar to lugard a mile south of him well short of the narrows though he would find the camp ajimbura had located for him ajimbura had not been fool enough to try entering the camp so karede still did not know whether he was riding into a deathtrap for nothing no not for nothing for the high lady tuon any deathwatch guard was ready to die for her their honor was duty and duty often meant death the sky held only billowing white clouds with no threat of rain he had always hoped to die in sunlight he had brought just a small party ajimbura on his whitefooted chestnut to show the way of course the wiry little man had cut off his whitestreaked red braid a measure of his great devotion the hill tribes took those braids as trophies from those they killed in their endless feuds and to be without one was to be disgraced in the eyes of all the tribes and families a selfproclaimed coward that devotion was to karede rather than the high lady or the crystal throne but karedes own devotion was such that it came to the same thing two of the guards rode at karedes back their redandgreen armor buffed till it shone like his own hartha and a pair of gardeners strode along with their longhafted axes on their shoulders easily keeping pace with the horses their armor glistened as well melitene the high ladys dersuldam her long graying hair tied with a bright red ribbon today was on a highstepping gray the silvery length of an adam connecting her left wrist to mylens neck there had been little that could be done to make those two appear more impressive but the adam and melitenes blue dress the red panels on skirts and bosom holding silver forked lightning bolts should draw the eye taken altogether no one should notice ajimbura at all the rest were back with musenge in case it truly was a deathtrap he had considered using another damane than mylen the tiny woman with the face he could never put an age to almost bounced in her saddle with eagerness to lay eyes on the high lady again she was not properly composed still she could do nothing without melitene and she was useless as a weapon a fact that had made her hang her head when he pointed it out to the dersuldam she had needed consoling her suldam petting her and telling her what beautiful sky lights she made how wonderful her healing was even thinking about that made karede shudder taken in the abstract it might seem a wonderful thing wounds undone in moments but he thought he would need to be near death before he would let anyone touch him with the power and yet if it could have saved his wife kalia no the weapons had been left with musenge if there was a battle today it would be of a different sort the first birdcall he heard seemed no different from others he had heard that morning but it was repeated ahead and then again just one call each time he spotted a man up in a tall oak with a crossbow thar tracked him as he rode seeing him was not easy his breastplate and openfaced helmet were painted a dull green that faded into the trees foliage a length of red cloth tied around his left arm helped though if he really wanted to hide he should have removed that karede motioned to ajimbura and the wiry little man grinned at him a wizened blueeyed rat before allowing his chestnut to fall back behind the guards his long knife was under his coat today he should pass for a servant soon enough karede was riding into the camp itself it had no tents or shelters of any kind but there were long horselines laid out in orderly fashion and many more men in green breastplates heads turned to watch his party pass but tew men were on their feet and fewer held a crossbow a fair number of them were asleep on their blankets doubtless tired from all the hard riding they had been doing by night so the birdcall had told them he was not enough to present a danger they had the look of welltrained soldiers but he had expected as much what he had not expected was how few they were oh the trees might be hiding some but surely the camp held no more than seven or eight thousand men far too few to have carried out the campaign loune had described he felt a sudden tightness in his chest where were the rest the high lady might be with one of the other bands he hoped ajimbura was taking note of the numbers before he had gone far a short man mounted on a tall dun met him and reined in where he had to stop or ride the man down the front half of his head was shaved and appeared to be powdered of all things he was no popinjay though his dark coat might be silk yet he wore the same dull green breastplate as the common soldiers his eyes were hard and expressionless as he scanned melitene and mylen the ogier his face did not change as his gaze returned to karede lord mat described that armor to us he said in accents even quicker and more clipped than those of the altarans to what do we owe the honor of a visit from the deathwatch guard lord mat who under the light was lord mat furyk karede karede said i wish to speak with man who calls himself thorn merrilin talmanes delovinde the man said finding manners you want to talk to thomt well i see no harm in it i will take you to him karede heeled aldazar after delovinde the man had made no mention of the obvious that he and the others could not be allowed to leave and carry word of this armys location he had some manners at least they would not be allowed to leave unless karedes mad plan worked musenge gave him only one chance in ten of success one in five of living personally he himself believed the odds longer but he had to make the attempt and merrilins presence argued in favor of the high ladys presence delovinde dismounted at an oddly domestic scene among the trees people on camp stools or blankets around a small fire beneath a spreading oak where a kettle was heating karede stepped down from his saddle motioning the guards and ajimbura to dismount as well melitene and mylen remained on their mounts for the advantage of height of all people mistress anan who had once owned the inn where he stayed in ebou dar was sitting on one of the threelegged stools reading a book she no longer wore one of those revealing dresses he had enjoyed looking at but her closefitting necklace still dangled that small jeweled knife onto her impressive bosom she closed her book and gave him a small nod as if he had returned to the wandering woman after an absence of a few hours her hazel eyes were quite composed perhaps the plot was even more intricate than the seeker mor had thought a tall lean whitehaired man with mustaches nearly as long as harthas was sitting crosslegged on a striped blanket across a stones board from a slender woman with her hair in many beaded braids he quirked an eyebrow at karede shook his head and returned to perusing the crosshatched board she glared pure hatred at karede and those behind him a gnarled old fellow with long white hair was lying on another blanket with a remarkably ugly young boy playing some game or other on a piece of red cloth spiderwebbed with black lines they sat up the boy studying the ogier with interest the man with one hand hovering as if to reach for a knife beneath his coat a dangerous man and wary perhaps he was merrilin two men and two women sitting together on camp stools had been conversing when karede rode up but as he was stepping down a sternfaced woman stood and fixed her blue eyes on his in very nearly a challenge she wore a sword on a wide leather strap slanting across her chest the way some sailors did her hair was closecropped rather than cut in the style of the low blood her fingernails were short and none were lacquered but he was certain she was egeanin tamarath a heavyset man with hair as short as hers and one of those odd illianer beards stood beside her one hand on the hilt of a shortsword staring at karede as if he intended to second her challenge a pretty woman with dark waistlong hair and the same rosebud mouth as the taraboner stood and for a moment it seemed she might kneel or prostrate herself but then she straightened and looked him right in the eyes the last man a lean fellow in a peculiar red cap who looked carved from dark wood gave a loud laugh and flung his arms around her the grinning stare he gave karede could only be called triumphant thom delovinde said this is furyk karede he wants to talk with a man who calls himself thorn merrilin with me the lean whitehaired man said rising awkwardly his right leg appeared slightly stiff an old battle injury perhaps but i dont call myself thorn merrilin its my name though im surprised you know it what do you want of me karede removed his helmet but before he could open his mouth a pretty woman with large brown eyes rushed up pursued by two others all three had those aes sedai faces one minute looking twenty the next twice that the third somewhere in the middle it was very disconcerting thats sheraine the pretty woman cried staring at mylen release her you do no understand joline one of the women with her said angrily thinlipped with a narrow nose she looked as if she could chew rocks she do no be sheraine any longer she would have betrayed us given a chance teslyn is right joline the third woman said handsome rather than pretty she had long black hair that fell in waves to her waist she would have betrayed us i dont believe it edesina joline snapped you will free her immediately she told melitene or ill suddenly she gasped i did tell you teslyn said bitterly a young man in a widebrimmed black hat galloped up on a dark bluntnosed chestnut with a deep chest and flung himself out of the saddle whats bloody going on here he demanded striding up to the fire karede ignored him the high lady tuon had ridden up with the young man on a blackandwhite horse with markings like none he had ever seen selucia was at her side on a dun her head wrapped in a scarlet scarf but he had eyes only for the high lady short black hair covered her head but he could never mistake that face she spared him only one expressionless glance before returning to a study of the young man karede wondered whether she recognized him probably not it had been a long time since he had served in her bodyguard he did not look over his shoulder but he knew that the reins of ajimburas chestnut were now held by one of the guards apparently unarmed and his distinctive braid gone he should have no problem leaving the camp the sentries would never see the little man ajimbura was a good runner as well as stealthy soon musenge would know that the high lady was indeed here she has us shielded mat joline said and the young man snatched off his hat and strode to melitenes horse as if he intended to seize the bridle he was longlimbed though he could not be called tall and he wore a black silk scarf tied around his neck and dangling onto his chest that made him the one everyone had called tylins toy as if being the queens plaything were the most important feature of him likely it was playthings seldom had another side to them strange but he hardly seemed handsome enough for that he did look fit though release the shield he told her as if he expected obedience karedes eyebrows rose this was the plaything melitene and mylen gasped almost as one and the young man barked a laugh you see it doesnt work on me now you bloody well release the shields or ill bloody well haul you out of the saddle and paddle your bottoms melitenes face darkened few people dared speak so to a dersuldatn release the shields melitene karede said the marath damane was on the point of embracing saidar she said instead of obeying theres no telling what she might have release the shields he said firmly and release the power the young man gave a satisfied nod then suddenly spun pointing a finger at the three aes sedai now dont you bloody well start shes let go of the power you do it too go ahead again he nodded for all the world as if he was sure they had obeyed from the way melitene was staring at him perhaps he was maybe he was an ashaman perhaps ashaman could detect a damanes channeling somehow that hardly seemed likely but it was all karede could think of yet that hardly squared with how tylin reportedly had treated the young man one of these days mat cauthon joline said acidly someone will teach you to show proper respect to aes sedai and i hope i am there to see it the high lady and selucia laughed uproariously it was good to see she had managed to keep her spirits up in captivity doubtless her maids companionship had helped but it was time to get on too time to take his mad gamble general merrilin karede said you fought a short but remarkable campaign and achieved miracles at keeping your forces undetected but your luck is about to run out general chisen deduced your real purpose he has turned his army around and is marching for the malvide narrows as fast as he can he will be here in two days i have ten thousand men not far from here enough to pin you until he arrives but the high lady tuon would be in danger and i want to avoid that let me leave with her and i will allow you and your men to depart unhindered you can be well the other side of the mountains into the molvaine gap before chisen arrives and into murandy before he can catch you the only other choice is annihilation chisen has enough men to wipe you out it wont be a battle a hundred thousand men against eight thousand will be a slaughter they heard him out every face as blank as if they were stunned they schooled themselves well or perhaps they were stunned at merrilins plan apparently unraveling at the last instant merrilin stroked one of his white mustaches with a long finger he seemed to hiding a smile i fear you have mistaken me bannergeneral karede for the space of a sentence his voice became extremely resonant i am a gleeman a position higher than courtbard to be sure but no general the man you want is lord matrim cauthon he made a small bow toward the young man who was settling his flattopped hat back on his head karede frowned tylins toy was the general were they playing a game with him you have about a hundred men deathwatch guards and maybe twenty gardeners cauthon said calmly from what i hear that could make an even fight against five times their number for most soldiers but the band arent most soldiers and i have a sight more than six hundred as for chisen if thats the fellow who pulled back through the narrows even if he has figured out what i was up to he couldnt get back in less than five days my scouts last reports had him pushing southwest along the ebou dar road as fast he could march the real question is this though can you get tuon to the tarasin palace safely karede felt as if hartha had kicked him in the belly and not only because the man had used the high ladys name so casually you mean to let me take her away he said incredulously if she trusts you if you can get her to the palace safely shes in danger till she reaches that in case you dont know it your whole bloody ever victorious flaming army is ready to slit her throat or bash in her head with a rock i know karede said more calmly than he felt why would this man just release the high lady after the white tower had gone to all the trouble of kidnapping her why after fighting that short bloody campaign we will die to the man if that is what is needed to see safe it will be best if we set out immediately before the man changed his mind before karede woke from this feverdream it surely seemed a feverdream not so fast cauthon turned toward the high lady tuon do you trust this man to see you safe to the palace in ebou dar karede stifled an impulse to wince general and lord the man might be but he had no right to use the high ladys name so i trust the deathwatch guards with my life the high ladyreplied calmly and him more than any other she favored karede with a smile even as a child smiles from her had been rare do you by any chance still have my doll bannergeneral karede he bowed to her formally the manner of her speaking told him she was still under the veil forgiveness high lady i lost everything in the great fire of sohima that means you kept it for ten years you have my commiseration on the loss of your wife and of your son though he died bravely and well few men will enter a burning building once he saved five people before he was overcome karedes throat tightened she had followed news of him all he could do was bow again more deeply enough of that cauthon muttered youre going to knock your head on the ground if you keep that up as soon as she and selucia can get their things together you take them out of here and ride hard talmanes roust the band it isnt that i dont trust you karede but i think ill sleep easier beyond the narrows matrim cauthon is my husband the high lady said in a loud clear voice everyone froze where they stood matrim cauthon is my husband karede felt as if hartha had kicked him again no not hartha aldazar what madness was this cauthon looked like a man watching an arrow fly toward his face knowing he had no chance to dodge bloody matrim cauthon is my husband that is the wording you used is it not this had to be a feverdream it took a minute before mat could speak burn him it seemed to take a bloody hour before he could move when he could he snatched off his hat strode to tuon and seized the razors bridle she looked down at him cool as any queen on a bloody throne all those battles with the flaming dice rattling away in his head all those skirmishes and raids and they had to stop when she said a few words well at least this time he knew what had happened that was bloody fateful for mat bloody cauthon why i mean i knew you were going to sooner or later but why now i like you maybe more than like you and i enjoy kissing you he thought karede grunted but you havent behaved like a woman in love youre ice half the time and spend most of the rest digging under my skin love tuon sounded surprised perhaps we will come to love one another matrim but i have always known i would marry to serve the empire what do you mean you knew that i was going to speak the words call me mat only his mother had ever called him matrim when he was in trouble and his sisters when they were carrying tales to get him in trouble your name is matrim what did you mean he sighed the woman never wanted much just her own way like just about every other woman he had ever known i went through a terangreal to somewhere else another world maybe the people there arent really peoplethey look like snakesbut theyll answer three questions for you and their answers are always true one of mine was that id marry the daughter of the nine moons but you havent answered my question why now a faint smile on her lips tuon leaned down from her saddle and rapped him hard on the top of his head with her knuckles your superstitions are bad enough matrim but i wont tolerate lies an amusing lie true but still a lie its the lights own truth he protested clapping his hat on maybe it would give him some protection you could learn for yourself if you could make yourself talk to an aes sedai they could tell you about the aelfinn and the eelfinn it could be the truth edesina piped up as if she were being helpful the aelfinn can be reached through a terangreal in the stone of tear so i understand and supposedly they give true answers mat glared at her a fat lot of help she was with her so i understands and supposedlies tuon continued to stare at him as if edesina had not opened her mouth i answered your question tuon so you answer mine you know that damane can tell fortunes she gave him a stern look likely expecting him to call it superstition but he nodded curtly some aes sedai could foretell the future why not a damane i asked lidya to tell mine just before i landed at ebou dar this is what she said beware the fox that makes the ravens fly for he will marry you and carry you away beware the man who remembers hawkwings face for he will marry you and set you free beware the man of the red hand for him you will marry and none other it was your ring that caught my eye first he thumbed the long ring unconsciously and she smiled a small smile but a smile a fox apparently startling two ravens into flight and nine crescent moons suggestive wouldnt you say and just now you fulfilled the second part so i knew for certain it was you selucia made a sound in her throat and tuon waggled fingers at her the bosomy little woman subsided adjusting her head scarf but the look she shot at mat should have been accompanied by a dagger in her hand he laughed mirthlessly blood and bloody ashes the ring was a carvers trypiece bought only because it stuck on his finger he would give up those memories of hawkwings face along with every other old memory if it would get the bloody snakes out of his head and yet those things had gained him a wife the band of the red hand would never have existed without those old memories of battles seems to me being taveren works on me as much as it does on anybody else for a moment he thought she was going to rap him again he gave her his best smile one more kiss before you leave im not in the mood at the moment she said coolly that hanging magistrate was back all prisoners to be condemned immediately perhaps later you could return to ebou dar with me you have an honored place in the empire now he did not hesitate before shaking his head there was no honored place waiting for leilwin or domon no place at all for the aes sedai or the band the next time i see seanchan i expect it will be on the field somewhere tuon burn him it would be his life seemed to run that way no matter what he did youre not my enemy but your empire is nor are you my enemy husband she said coolly but i live to serve the empire well i suppose youd better get your things he trailed off at the sound of a cantering horse approaching vanin reined in a rangy gray beside tuon eyed karede and the other deathwatch guards then spat through a gap in his teeth and leaned on the high pommel of his saddle theres ten thousand or so soldiers at a little town about five miles west of here the fat man told mat only one man seanchan near as i could learn rest are altarans taraboners amadicians all mounted thing is theyre asking after fellows wearing armor like that he nodded toward karede and rumor says the one of them that kills a girl that sounds a lot like the high lady gets himself a hundred thousand crowns gold their mouths are dripping for it i can slip past them karede said his bluff face looked fatherly his voice sounded like a drawn sword and if you cant mat asked quietly it cant be chance theyre this close theyve caught some sniff of you one more smell might be all it takes to kill tuon karedes face darkened do you intend to go back on your word a drawn blade that might be used soon worse tuon was watching looking at mat like that hanging magistrate in truth burn him if she died something would shrivel up inside him and the only way to stop it to be sure it was stopped was to do what he hated worse than work once he had thought that fighting battles much as he hated it was still better than work near enough nine hundred dead in the space of a few days had changed his mind no he said she goes with you but you leave me a dozen of your deathwatch guards and some of the gardeners if im going to take these people off your back i need them to think im you tuon abandoned most of the clothing matrim had bought for her since she would need to travel light the little cluster of red silk rosebuds he had given her she tucked away in her saddlebags folded in a linen cloth as carefully as if were blown glass she had no farewells to make except for mistress ananshe really would miss their discussionsso she and selucia were ready to ride quickly mylen smiled so broadly at the sight of her that she had to pat the little damane it seemed that word of what had happened had spread because as they rode through the camp with the deathwatch guards men of the band stood and bowed to her it was very like reviewing regiments in seandar what do you make of him she asked karede once they were away from the soldiers and beginning to canter there was no need to say which he she meant it is not my place to make judgments high lady he said gravely his head swivelled keeping watch on the surrounding trees i serve the empire and the empress may she live forever as do we all bannergeneral but i ask your judgment a good general high lady he replied without hesitation brave but not overly brave he wont get himself killed just to show how brave he is i think and he is adaptable a man of many layers and if you will forgive me high lady a man in love with you i saw how he looked at you in love with her perhaps she thought she might be able to come to love him her mother had loved her father it was said and a man of many layers matrim cauthon made an onion look like an apple she rubbed a hand over her head she still was not accustomed to the feel of hair on her head i will need a razor first thing it may be best to wait until ebou dar high lady no she said gently if i die i will die as who i am i have removed the veil as you say highness smiling he saluted gauntleted fist striking over his heart hard enough that steel clanged on steel if we die we will die as who we are chapter thirtyseven prince of the ravens leaning on the tall pommel of his saddle ashandarei slanted across pips neck mat frowned at the sky the sun was well past its noon height if vanin and those deathwatch guards did not return soon he might find himself fighting a battle with the sun in the crossbowmens eyes or worse in twilight worst of all dark clouds loomed over the mountains to the east the gusting wind was out of the north no help there rain would put the weasel in the henyard bowstrings fared poorly in rain well any rain was a few hours off with luck but he had never noticed his luck saving him from getting soaked in a downpour he had not dared wait until tomorrow those fellows hunting tuon might have gotten another whiff of karedes men and then he would have had to try attacking them or laying an ambush and carry it out before they could catch karede better to have them come to him at a place of his choosing finding the proper spot had not been difficult between master roidelles collection of maps on the one hand and vanin and the other scouts on the other aludra was fussing over one of her tall metalbound lofting tubes beaded braids hiding her face as she examined something at the broad wooden base he wished she had been willing to remain with the pack animals like thorn and mistress anan even noal had been willing to stay if only to help juilin and amathera make sure olver did not run off to watch the battle the boy was dead eager which could soon lead to plain dead matters had been bad enough when only harnan and the other three had been corrupting olver but now he had half the men teaching him how to use a sword or dagger or fight with his hands and feet and apparently filling his head with tales of heroes from the way he had been behaving begging to go on raids with mat and the like aludra was near as bad anybody could have used one of those strikers to light the fuse once she had loaded that tube but she insisted on doing it herself she was a fierce woman aludra was and none too pleased at finding herself on the same side as seanchan however temporary the arrangement was it seemed wrong to her that they would see some of her handiwork without being on the receiving end leilwin and domon sat their horses nearby keeping an eye on her as much to make sure she did nothing foolish as to protect her mat hoped leilwin did nothing foolish herself since there was apparently only one seanchan with the people they would fight today she had decided it was all right to be there and the way she glared at musenge and the other deathwatch guards it seemed she might think she had something to prove to them the three aes sedai standing together with their reins in hand cast dark looks at the seanchan too as did blaeric and fen who caressed their sword hilts perhaps unconsciously joline and her two warders had been the only ones aghast at sheraines willing departure with tuonwhat an aes sedai felt on any subject was usually how her warders felt on it toobut the memory of being leashed had to be too fresh for edesina or teslyn to feel comfortable around seanchan soldiers bethamin and seta stood very meekly hands folded at their waists a little apart from the sisters bethamins lightcolored bay nudged her shoulder with his nose and the tall dark woman half reached up to stroke the animal before snatching her hand back down and resuming her humble pose they still would take no part joline and edesina had made that plain yet it seemed they wanted the two women under their eyes to make sure of it the seanchan women plainly were looking at anything but the seanchan soldiers for that matter bethamin seta and leilwin might as well not have existed for all of musenge and that lot burn him there were so many tensions in the air he could almost feel that hanging rope around his neck again pips stamped a hoof impatient at standing in one place so long and mat patted his neck then scratched the scar forming on his own jaw tuons ointments had stung as badly as she had said they would but they worked his new collection of scars did itch yet though tuon his wife he was married he had known it was coming had known for a long time but just the same married he should have felt different somehow but he still felt like himself he intended to keep it that way burn him if he did not if tuon expected mat cauthon to settle down to give up gambling or some such she had another think coming he supposed he would have to give over chasing after women much less catching them but he would still enjoy dancing with them and looking at them just not when he was with her burn him if he knew when that would be he was not about to go anywhere she had the upper hand her and her talk of cupbearers and running grooms and marrying to serve the empire how was marrying him supposed to serve the flaming empire musenge left the other ten men and five ogier in redandblack armor and trotted his black gelding up to mat the horse had good lines built for speed and endurance both as far as mat could tell without a thorough examination musenge looked built for endurance a stocky stolid man his face worn but hard his eyes like polished stones forgiveness highness he drawled banging a gauntleted fist against his breastplate but shouldnt the men be back to work he slurred his words worse than selucia almost to unintelligibility their rest break has stretched a long time i doubt they can complete the wall before the traitor arrives as it is mat had wondered how long it would take him to mention that he had expected it earlier openfaced helmets off but breastplates strapped on the crossbowmen were sitting on the ground behind a long curving wall perhaps a third of a circle made of earth thrown up out of the fourfoot deep trench fronting it with a thicket of sharpened stakes driven into the ground in front of that and extending a little beyond the ends of the trench they had finished that in short order infantry needed to be as handy with shovel mattock and axe as they were with weapons even cavalry did but making horsemen believe was harder footmen knew it was better to have something between you and the enemy if you could the tools lay scattered along the trench now some of the men were dicing others just taking their ease even napping soldiers slept any chance they got a few were reading books of all things reading mandevwin moved among them fingering his eyepatch and now and then bending to say a few words to a bannerman the only lancer present standing beside his horse every line of him saying he had nothing to do with the crossbowmen held no lance but rather a long bannerstaff cased for half its length in leather it was perfect terrain for what mat had in mind near two miles of grassy meadow dotted with wildflowers and a few low bushes stretched from the wall to the tall trees at the western end to the north was a blackwater swamp full of oaks and odd whiteflowering trees that seemed half thick roots with a lake clinging to its western edge and forest below the lake a small river flowed south out of the swamp half a mile behind mat before curving away to the west on his left a small river but wide enough and deep enough that horses would have to swim it the far bank lay beyond bowshot there was only one way for any attacker to get at the wall come straight for it when they arrive i dont want them stopping to count how many men in red and black are here he replied musenge winced slightly for some reason i want them to see an unfinished wall and tools thrown down because we learned they were close the promise of a hundred thousand crowns gold has to have their blood up but i want them too excited to think straight theyll see us vulnerable our defenses incomplete and with any luck theyll rush in straight away theyll figure close to half of them will die when we loose but that will just raise the chances for one of the others to get that gold theyll only expect us to manage one volley he slapped his hands together and pips shifted then the trap closes still highness i wish we had more of your crossbowmen ive heard you may have as many as thirty thousand musenge had heard him tell tuon he would fight the seanchan too the man was probing for information i have fewer than i did mat said with a grimace his victories had hardly been bloodless only remarkably close to it near four hundred crossbowmen lay in altaran graves and close to five hundred of the cavalry a small enough butchers bill considering yet he liked it best when the butcher presented no bill but what i have is enough for the day as you say highness musenges voice was so neutral he could have been commenting on the price of beans strange he did not look like a diffident man i have always been ready to die for her there was no need for him to say which her he meant i guess i am too musenge light he thought he meant that yes he did mean it did that mean he was in love better to live for her though wouldnt you say should you not be donning your armor highness i dont intend getting close enough to the fighting to need armor a general who draws his sword has put aside his baton and become a common soldier he was only quoting comadrin againhe seemed to do that a lot when discussing soldiering but then the man had known just about everything there was to know about the craftjust quoting yet it appeared to impress the weathered man who saluted him again and asked bloody permission before riding back to his men mat was tempted to ask what that highness foolishness was about likely it was just some seanchan way of calling him a lord but he had not heard anything like it in ebou dar and he had been surrounded by seanchan there five figures appeared out of the forest at the foot of the meadow and he did not need a looking glass to know them the two ogier in armor striped bright red and black would have told him even if vanins bulk had not the mounted men were at a flat gallop yet the ogier kept pace long arms swinging axes swinging like a sawmills driveshaft slingmen get ready mat shouted everybody else go pick up a shovel the appearance had to be just right as most of the crossbowmen scattered to pick up tools and make a show of working on the trench and wall fifty others strapped on their helmets and lined up in front of aludra tall men they still carried the shortswords they called catgutters but instead of crossbows they were armed with fourfoot long slingstaffs he would have liked more than fifty but aludra only had so much of her powders each man wore a cloth belt sewn with pockets slung across his breastplate and each pocket held a stubby leather cylinder larger than a mans fist with a short length of dark fuse sticking out of the end aludra had not come up with a fancy name for them yet she would though she was one for fancy names dragons and dragons eggs one by one the men held up long pieces of slowmatch for her to light with a striker she did it quickly using each striker until the long wooden stick had burned down nearly to her fingertips but she never winced just dropped the thing and lit another while telling the slingmen to be faster she was getting low on strikers light but she was tight with the things she had five more boxes that mat knew of as each man turned away from her he put the smoking slowmatch between his teeth and secured one of the cylinders to his slingstaff as he walked to the wall there were wide intervals between slingmen they had to cover the whole length of the wall time to get your people in place musenge mat said loudly the deathwatch guards formed a single line abreast with the gardeners on the end anybody who took one glance through a looking glass would know what they were light all they needed was to see ogier in armor and the sun glinting off all that red and black and if they stopped to think how few of the guards there were they would still see they had mat outnumbered and there would be only one way to find out whether tuon was with him vanin galloped behind the wall flung himself out of the saddle and immediately began walking his lathered dun to cool the animal down as soon as he passed the wrall crossbowmen began dropping the tools and running to put on helmets and pick up crossbows those had been laid so that the men formed three spaced ranks with gaps where the slingmen stood it no longer mattered if anyone was watching from the forest what they saw would seem natural mat trotted pips to vanin and dismounted the two human deathwatch guards and the two ogier went to join the others the horses nostrils flared with their heavy breathing but the ogier were panting no harder one was hartha a stoneeyed fellow who apparently ranked very close to musenge vanin scowled at the men who had not gotten down to walk their horses a horsethief he might be reformed or not but he disliked mistreating horseflesh they went up like one of her nightflowers when they glimpsed us he said nodding toward aludra we made sure they got a good look at that fancy armor then hightailed it as soon as they started getting mounted theyre coming hard behind us harder than they should he spat on the ground i didnt get a good look at their animals but i doubt theyre all good for that run somell founder before they get here the more the better mat said the fewer who make it the better in my book all he needed was to give tuon a day or two head start on them and if that came from their ruining horses if they rode out of the trees and decided he had too many men to take on he would take that over a battle any day after todays sixmile gallop they would need to rest their horses a few days before they were fit to travel any distance at all vanin directed that scowl at him others might go around calling him my lord and highness but not chel vanin mat laughed and clapped him on the shoulder before swinging back into pips saddle it was good there was someone who did not think he was a fool noble or at least did not care whether or not he was he rode to join the aes sedai who were mounted now blaeric and fen the one on a bay gelding the other on a black gave him stares almost as dark as those they had directed at musenge they still suspected he had something to do with what had happened to joline he thought of telling fen that his stub of a topknot looked ridiculous fen shifted in his saddle and stroked his sword hilt then again maybe not what i told you joline was telling bethamin and seta shaking an admonitory finger her dark bay gelding looked a warhorse but was not the animal had a good turn of speed yet its temperament was mild as milkwater if you even think about embracing saidar youll regret it teslyn grunted sourly she patted her whitefaced chestnut mare a much more feisty creature than jolines mount and spoke to the air she does train wilders and expects them to behave once out of her sight or perhaps she does think the tower will accept overage novices spots of color appeared in jolines cheeks but she straightened in her saddle without saying anything as usual when those two got into a conflict edesina concentrated on something else in this case brushing imaginary dust from her divided skirts enough tension to choke on suddenly riders poured out of the trees at the far end of the meadow in a torrent that swelled into a spreading lake of steeltipped lances as they drew rein no doubt in surprise at what lay before them h seemed that not as many horses had foundered as mat had hoped for pulling the looking glass from its scabbard tied to his saddles pommel he raised it to his eye the taraboners were easy to pick out with mail veils hiding their faces to the eyes but the others wore every sort of helmet rounded or conical with facebars and without he even saw a few ridged tairen helmets though that did not mean there were tairens among them most men used whatever armor they could find dont think he thought the woman is here that hundred thousand gold crowns is waiting dont bloody a shrill seanchan bugle sounded thin with the distance and the horsemen began advancing at a walk already spreading out to extend beyond the walls edges uncase the banner macoll mat ordered so these flaming sons of goats thought they were coming to murder tuon did they this time well let them know whos killing them mandevwin you have the command mandevwin turned his bay to face front stand ready he shouted and underofficers and bannermen echoed the cry macoll pulled the leather case off carefully fastening it to his saddle and the banner streamed on the wind a redfringed white square with a large open red hand in the center and beneath it embroidered in red the words dovieandi se tovya sagain its time to toss the dice mat thought translating and so it was he saw musenge eyeing it he seemed very calm for a man with ten thousand lances coming toward him are you ready aludra mat called of course i am ready she replied i only wish i had my dragons musenge shifted his attention to her burn her she needed to watch her tongue mat wanted those dragons to be a shock when the seanchan first faced them perhaps twelve hundred paces from the wall the ranks of lancers began to trot and at six hundred they began to gallop but not as hard as they might have those horses were tired after a long run already they lumbered none of the lances had come down yet they would not until the last hundred paces some of those carried streamers that floated behind them in the air a large knot of red here a clump of green or blue there they might have been house colors or perhaps they marked mercenary companies all those hooves made a noise like distant thunder rolling aludra mat shouted without looking back a hollow thump and an acrid sulphur smell announced the lofting tube sending its nightflower aloft and a loud pop the blooming of a ball of red streaks overhead some of the galloping horsemen pointed to it as if in amazement none looked behind them to see talmanes leading the three banners of horse out of the forest below the lake their lances had been left with the pack animals but every man would have his horsebow out spreading out in a single line they began following the galloping riders increasing speed as they came their horses had been ridden far last night but not pressed too hard and they had been rested all morning the distance between the two groups of riders began to narrow front rank mandevwin shouted when the horsemen were four hundred paces away loose above a thousand bolts flashed out dark streaks in the air immediately the front rank bent to fasten their cranks to their crossbows and the second rank raised their weapons second rank mandevwin shouted loose another thousand quarrels streaked for the oncoming horsemen at that range they could not punch through a breastplate despite heads designed to do just that but men with shattered legs toppled from their saddles and men with ruined arms reined in frantically to try stemming the flow of blood and the horses ah light the poor horses horses fell by the hundreds some kicking and screaming struggling to stand others not moving at all many of them tripping more animals catapulted riders tumbled across the meadow grass until they were trampled by the riders behind third rank loose mandevwin shouted and as soon as those bolts were away the front rank straightened front rank mandevwin called loose and another thousand bolts added to the carnage second rank loose it was not so onesided as an ambush of course some of the galloping horsemen had flung down their lances and uncased their horsebows arrows began to fall among the crossbowmen shooting accurately from a galloping horse was no easy task and the range was too far at the start for the arrows to kill but more than one man struggled to work his crossbow with a shaft jutting from an arm the wall protected their legs yet too far to kill unless your targets luck had run out mat saw a man fall with an arrow in his eye another with a shaft taken in the throat there were other gaps in the ranks as well men shuffled forward quickly to fill them you could join in any time joline he said third rank loose the aes sedai shook her head irritably i must be in danger i dont feel in danger yet teslyn nodded she was watching the charge as if it were a parade and a not very interesting one at that if you would allow seta and me bethamin began but joline looked over her shoulder coldly and the seanchan woman subsided and dropped her eyes to her hands on the reins seta smiled nervously but it slid off her face under jolines stare front rank loose mat rolled his eyes to the heavens and muttered a prayer that was half curse the bloody women did not feel in danger he felt as though his bloody head was on the chopping block second rank loose talmanes had come in range now and announced himself with a volley from four thousand bows at three hundred paces that cleared saddles closing the distance they fired again again the enemy ranks seemed to ripple with the shock some men whirled about and charged at talmanes line with lances coming down others began returning his hail of arrows with their own most continued on though form square mandevwin shouted a heartbeat before mat could he hoped the man had not left it too bloody late the band was welltrained though the men on the flanks fell back at the run as calmly as if arrows were not pelting them clanging off breastplates and helmets and sometimes not men fell the three ranks never lost cohesion though as they bent into a hollow box with mat at its center musenge and the other human deathwatch guards had their swords out and the ogier were hefting their long axes slingmen mandevwin shouted loose at will front rank west loose slingmen along the western rank shifted their slingstaffs so they could touch the fuses coming from the stubby cylinders to the slowmatches held in their teeth and as the volley lanced out from the crossbows whipped cheir slings back and then forward the dark cylinders flew more than a hundred paces to land among the onrushing horsemen the slingmen were already fitting more of the cylinders to their slings before the first fell aludra had marked each fuse with pieces of thread to indicate different burning times and each cylinder erupted with a roar in a burst of flame some on the ground some as high as a mounted mans head the explosion was not the real weapon though a man struck in the face was suddenly headless he stayed upright in the saddle for three strides before toppling no aludra had wrapped a layer of hard pebbles around the powder inside each cylinder and those pierced flesh deeply when they hit shrieking horses fell to thrash on the ground riders fell to lie still an arrow tugged at mats left sleeve another pierced his right sleeve only the fletchings keeping it from going through cleanly and a third ripped open the right shoulder of his coat he put a finger behind the scarf around his neck and tugged the bloody thing felt awfully tight of a sudden maybe he should consider wearing armor at times like this the enemy flanks were beginning to curl in now preparing to envelop the crossbowmen behind the wall talmanes men still peppered their rear with arrows but several hundred men had been forced to drop their bows to defend themselves with swords and it was unlikely that all of the horses with empty saddles out there had belonged to taraboners or amadicians he had left a gap in the center of his line a path for anyone who decided to flee yet no one was taking the offering they could smell that hundred thousand crowns gold i think joline said slowly yes i feel in danger now teslyn simply drew back her hand and threw a sphere of fire larger than a horses head the explosion hurled dirt and pieces of men and horses into the air it was about bloody time facing in three directions the aes sedai began hurling fireballs as fast as they could swing their arms but the devastation they wrought did nothing to slow the attack those men should have been able to see there was no woman matching tuons description inside the square by this time but their blood was no doubt on fire the scent of riches in their nostrils a man could live the rest of his life like a noble with a hundred thousand crowns gold the square was encircled and they fought to close on it fought and died as volleys from the crossbows lashed them and slingmen killed them another wall began to rise made of dead and dying men and horses a wall that some tried to ride over and joined in the attempt more scrambled down from their saddles and tried to clamber over crossbow bolts hurled them back this close bolts penetrated breastplates like hot knives going into butter on they came and died the silence seemed to come suddenly not quite silence the air was full of the sound of panting men who had been working those cranks as fast as they could and there was moaning from the wounded a horse was still shrieking somewhere but mat could see no one on his feet between the wall of dead and talmanes no one in the saddle except men in green helmets and breastplates men who had lowered their bows and swords the aes sedai folded their hands on the high pommels of their saddles they were breathing hard too it is done mat came talmanes shout those who are not dead are dying not one of the fools tried to escape mat shook his head he had expected them to be halfmad with the lust for gold they had been completely mad with it it would be necessary to haul away dead men and horses for mat and the others to get out and talmanes set men to work fastening ropes to horses to drag them aside no one wanted to climb over that no one but the ogier i want to see if i can find the traitor hartha said and he and the other six gardeners shouldered their axes and walked over the mound of bodies as if it were dirt well at least we settled this joline said patting her face with a laceedged handkerchief sweat dotted her forehead you owe a debt mat aes sedai do not become involved in private wars as a rule i shall have to think on how you can pay it mat had a pretty good idea what she would come up with she was mad herself if she thought he would agree crossbows settled this marathdamane musenge said his helmet breastplate and coat were orf his left shirtsleeve ripped away so one of the other guards could wrap a bandage around where an arrow had gone through the sleeve had come away very neatly as if the stitching had been weak he had a raven tattooed on his shoulder crossbows and men with heart you never had more than this did you highness that was not a question this and whatever losses you suffered i told you mat said i had enough he was not going to reveal anything more to the man than he could not avoid but musenge nodded as if he had confirmed everything by the time an opening could be cleared so that mat and the others could ride through hartha and the gardeners had returned i found the traitor hartha said holding up a severed head by its hair musenges eyebrows climbed at the sight of that dark hooknosed face she will be very interested to see this he said softly softly as the sound of sword being drawn is soft we must carry it to her you know him mat asked we know him highness musenges face suddenly seeming carved from stone said he would say no more on the subject look would you stop calling me that my name is mat after today id say you have a right to use it mat surprised himself by sticking out his hand that stone mask crumpled in astonishment i could not do that highness he said in scandalized tones when she married you you became prince of the ravens to speak your name would lower my eyes forever mat took off his hat and scrubbed fingers through his hair he had told everyone who would listen that he did not like nobles did not want to be one and he had meant it he still meant it and now he bloody was one he did the only thing he could he laughed until his sides ached chapter thirtyeight remember the old saying the redwalled room its ceiling painted fancifully with birds and fish cavorting among clouds and waves bustled with brownclad clerks scurrying along the aisles between the long tables that covered the floor none seemed to be trying to listenmost seemed stunned with causebut suroth disliked their presence they had to overhear some of what was being said and it was potentially dire news galgan had insisted though they needed to work to keep their minds off the disastrous news from home and they were all trusted men and women he insisted at least the whitehaired old man was not dressed as a soldier this morning his voluminous blue trousers and short highcollared red coat with rows of gold buttons embossed with his sigil were the height of seandar fashion which meant the height of fashion for the empire when he wore armor or even just his red uniform he sometimes looked at her as if she were a soldier under his command well once elbar brought word that tuon was dead she could have galgan killed his cheeks were smeared with ashes as were hers the ship semirhage had promised had brought word of the empresss death and the empire was racked by rebellion in every quarter there was no empress no daughter of the nine moons to commoners the world trembled on the brink of destruction to some of the blood too with galgan and a few more dead there would be none to object to suroth sabelle meldarath proclaiming herself empress she tried not to think of the new name she would take thinking on a new name beforehand was bad luck a frown creasing his face galgan looked down at the map spread out before them and placed a redlacquered fingernail atop mountains on the southern coast of arad doman suroth did not know what the mountains were called the map showed all of arad doman and held three markers one red wedge and two white circles spaced out in a long line north to south has turan gotten an accurate count of how many men came out of these mountains to join ituralde when he crossed into arad doman yamada efraim yamada wore the ashes too since he was of the blood if only the low blood his hair cut in the bowlandtail rather than a narrow crest across an otherwise shaved scalp only the commoners around the table whatever their rank were without graying and tall in a blueandgold breastplate with broad shoulders and lean hips yamada still held some of the beauty of his youth he reports at least one hundred thousand captaingeneral perhaps half again that and how many came out after turan crossed the border possibly two hundred thousand captaingeneral galgan sighed and straightened so turan has one army ahead of him and another behind very likely the whole of arad domans strength and between them he is outnumbered the fool stating the blindingly obvious turan should have stripped tarabon of every sword and lance suroth snapped if he survives this debacle i will have his head galgan quirked a white eyebrow at her i hardly think tarabon is loyal enough to support that just yet he said drily besides he has damane and raken they should offset his lesser numbers speaking of damane and raken ive signed the orders raising tylee khirgan to lieutenantgeneral and the low blood since youve dithered over it and orders to return most of those raken to amadicia and altara chisen still hasnt found whoever created that little mess in the north and i dont like the notion that whoever it was is lying in wait to spring out as soon as chisen returns to the molvaine gap suroth hissed gripping her pleated blue skirts in her fists before she could stop her hands she would not let the man make her show emotion you overstep yourself galgan she said coldly i command the forerunners for the time being i command the return you will sign no orders without my approval you commanded the forerunners who have been subsumed into the return he replied calmly and suroth tasted bitterness the news from the empire had emboldened him with the empress dead galgan intended to make himself the first emperor in nine hundred years it seemed he would have to die by tonight as for you commanding the return he cut off at the sound of heavy boots from the corridor suddenly deathwatch guards filled the doorway armored and hands on their sword hilts hard eyes stared out of their redandgreen helmets to survey the room only when they were satisfied did they step aside to reveal that the corridor was filled with deathwatch guards human and ogier suroth barely noticed them she had eyes only for the small dark woman in pleated blue with a shaven head and ashes on her cheeks the news was all over the city she could not have reached the palace without hearing of her mothers death her familys deaths but her face was a stern mask suroths knees hit the floor automatically around her the blood knelt the commoners prostrated themselves the lights blessings for your safe return highness she said in chorus with the rest of the blood so elbar had failed no matter tuon would not take a new name or become empress until the mourning was finished she could still die clearing the way for a new empress show them what captain musenge brought me bannergeneral karede tuon said a tall man with three dark plumes on his helmet bent to carefully empty a large lump from a canvas bag onto the green floor tiles the gagging smell of decay began to permeate the room dropping the bag he strode across the floor to stand beside suroth it took her a moment to recognize elbars hooknosed face in that rotting mass but as soon as she did she fell forward prostrating herself kissing the floor tiles not in desperation though she could recover from this unless they had put elbar to the question my eyes are lowered highness that one of mine has offended you so deeply that you took his head offended me tuon seemed to be weighing the words it might be said he offended me he tried to kill me gasps filled the room and before suroth could more than open her mouth the deathwatch guard bannergeneral planted a boot on her bottom seized her crest in his fist and hauled her upper body clear of the floor she did not struggle that would only have added to the indignity my eyes are deeply lowered that one of mine should be a traitor highness she said hoarsely she wished she could have spoken naturally but the cursed man had her back arched till it was a wonder she could speak at all had i even suspected i would have had him put to the question myself but if he tried to implicate me highness he lied to protect his true master i have some thoughts on that which i would share with you in private if i may be allowed with a little luck she could lay this to galgan his usurpation of her authority would help tuon looked over suroths head she met galgans eyes and abaldars and yamadas and those of everyone of the blood but not suroths it is well known that zaired elbar was suroths man completely he did nothing that she did not order therefore suroth sabelle meldarath is no more this dacovale will serve the deathwatch guard as they wish until her hair has grown enough for her to be decent when she is sent to the block for sale suroth never thought of the knife she had intended to use to open her veins a knife beyond reach in her apartments she could not think at all she started screaming a wordless howl before they even began cutting her clothing off the andoran sun was warm after tar valon pevara removed her cloak and began tying it behind her saddle as the gateway winked shut hiding the view of the ogier grove in tar valon none of them had wanted anyone to see them leaving they would return to the grove for the same reason unless matters went very badly in which case they might never return she had thought this task must be carried out by someone who combined the highest diplomatic skills with the courage of a lion well she was no coward at least she could say that much of herself where did you learn the weave for bonding a warder javindhra asked abruptly stowing her own cloak in similar fashion you should recall that i once suggested red sisters would be well served by having warders pevara snugged her red riding gloves showing no concern for the question she had expected it before this why would you be surprised i know the weave in truth she had needed to ask yukiri and had been hard pressed to dissemble her reason for asking she doubted that yukiri was suspicious though a red bonding a warder was as likely as a woman flying except of course that that was why she had come to andor why they had all come javindhra was there only at tsutamas command given when pevara and tarna could not come up with enough names to suit the highest the angular sitter did not bother to hide her displeasure over that not from pevara although she had buried it deeply around tsutama tarna was there of course palehaired and icy cold her keepers stole left behind but her divided gray skirts embroidered in red to the knee for elaidas keeper to have a warder would be difficult though the men were to be housed in the city away from the tower yet it had all been her idea in the first place and she was if not eager then determined to take part in this first experiment besides the need for numbers was paramount because they had found only three other sisters willing to entertain the idea the primary task of the red for so long finding men who could channel and bringing them to the tower to be gentled tended to sour women on all men so the clues had been few and far between jezrail was a squarefaced tairen who kept a painted miniature of the boy she had almost married instead of coming to the tower his grandchildren would be grandparents now but she still spoke of him fondly desala a beautiful cairhienin with large dark eyes and an unfortunate temper when given the chance would dance any number of men to exhaustion in a night and melare plump and witty with a love of conversation sent money to andor to pay for her grandnephews education as she had for her nephews and nieces weary of searching out such tiny clues weary of probing delicately to learn whether they meant what they might pevara had convinced tsutama that six would be enough to begin too a larger party might cause some unfortunate reaction after all the whole red ajah appearing at this socalled black tower or even half might well make the men think themselves under attack there was no telling how sane they all still were that was one thing they had agreed on behind tsutamas back they would bond no men who showed any signs of madness that was if they were allowed to bond any ajah eyesandears in caemlyn had sent copious reports on the black tower and some had even found employment inside it so they had no difficulty locating the wellworn dirt track that led down from the city to a grandiose doublearched black gate near fifty feet tall and ten spans wide topped by crenelations over a downpointing central spike of stone and flanked by a pair of thick crenelated black towers that stood at least fifteen spans high there were no actual gates to close up the opening and the black stone wall that stretched out of sight east and west marked at intervals by the foundations of bastions and towers was nowhere higher than four or five paces that she could see weeds grew along the uneven top and grasses ruffled by the breeze those unfinished walls looking as if they might never be finished made the gate seem ludicrous the three men who stepped out into the opening were not at all ludicrous however they wore long black coats and swords at their hips one a lean young fellow with curled mustaches had a silver pin in the shape of a sword on his high collar one of the dedicated pevara resisted the instinct to think of him as equivalent to an accepted and the other two as novices novices and accepted were kept safe and guided until they knew enough of the power to become aes sedai by all reports soldiers and dedicated were considered ready for battle almost as soon as they learned to channel and they were forced from the first day pressed to seize as much of saidin as they could made to use it almost continually men died from that and they called it training losses as if they could hide death behind bland words the thought of losing novices or accepted in that fashion curdled pevaras stomach but it seemed that the men took it in stride a fine morning to you aes sedai the dedicated said with a small bow as they reined in before him a very small bow never taking his eyes from them his accents were those of murandy now what would six sisters be wanting here at the black tower this fine morning to see the mhael pevara replied managing to avoid choking on the word it meant leader in the old tongue but the implication of taking that alone as a title gave the word much stronger meaning as if he led everyone and everything ah to see the mhael is it and of what ajahs should i say the red pevara replied and watched him blink very satisfying but not very helpful the red he said flatly he had not remained startled very long well then enkazin alseen you keep watch while i see what the mhael has to say to this he turned his back and the vertical silvery slash of a gateway appeared in front of him widening into an opening no larger than a door was that as large as he could make there had been some discussion about whether to bond men who were as strong as possible or those who were weak the weak might be more easily controlled while the strong mightwould definitelybe more useful they had reached no consensus each sister would have to decide for herself he darted through the gateway and closed it before she had a chance to see more than a white stone platform with steps leading up one side and a squaredoff black stone that might have been one of the building blocks for the wall polished till it shone in the sun sitting atop it the two who remained stayed in the middle of the double arch as if to bar the sisters from riding in one was a saldaean a skinny broadnosed man just short of his middle years who had something of the look of a clerk about him a bit of a stoop as from hunching for long hours over a writing table the other a boy little more than a child who raked dark hair out of his eyes with his fingers though the breeze quickly put it back again neither seemed the slightest uneasy over confronting six sisters alone if they were alone were there others in those towers pevara refrained from glancing at the tower tops you there boy desala said in a voice like chimes chimes tinged with anger the surest way to set off her temper was to harm a child you should be at home with your mother studying your letters what are you doing here the boy flushed bright red and raked hair from his face again samls all right aes sedai the saldaean said patting the boys shoulder hes a quick learner and you dont need to show him anything twice before he knows it the boy stood up very straight pride on his face and tucked his thumbs behind his sword belt a sword at his age true a nobles son would have been learning the sword for several years at saml alseens age but he would not be allowed to wear the thing about pevara tarna said coolly no children i knew they had children here but no children light melare breathed her white mare sensed her agitation and tossed her head certainly no children that would be an abomination jezrail said no children pevara agreed quickly i think we should wait to say more until we see master the mhael javindhra sniffed no children what aes sedai enkazin asked frowning no children what he said again when no one answered he no longer appeared so much like a clerk the stoop remained but something in his tilted eyes suddenly seemed dangerous was he holding the male half of the power the possibility sent a chill down pevaras spine but she resisted the desire to embrace saidar some men who could channel seemed able to sense when a woman was holding the power enkazin looked like he might be hasty now they waited in silence except for the occasional stamp of a hoof pevara schooling herself to patience javindhra grumbling under her breath pevara could not make out the words but she knew grumbling when she heard it tama and jezrail took books from their saddlebags and read good let these ashaman see that they were unconcerned only not even the boy seemed impressed he and the saldaean just stood there in the middle of the gate watching hardly blinking after perhaps half an hour a larger gateway opened and the murandian strode through the mhael will be receiving you at the palace aes sedai go on through he jerked his head toward the opening you will show us the way pevara said dismounting the gateway was larger but she would have had to crouch to ride through therell be someone the other side to guide you he barked a laugh the mhael doesnt associate with the likes of me pevara filed that away to chew over later as soon as the last of them was through near the white stone platform with its mirrorbright black stone the gateway winked shut but they were not alone four men and two women in rough woolens took the reins of their horses and a dark heavyset man with both the silver sword and a sinuous redandgold figure a dragon on his tall black collar gave them a minimal bow follow me he said curtly in a tairen accent his eyes were like augers the palace the murandian had spoken of was just that two stories of white marble topped with pointed domes and spires in the style of saldaea separated from a large space of bare hardpacked ground by the white platform it was not large among palaces but most nobles lived in buildings far smaller and less grand broad stone stairs rose to a wide landing in front of tall twinned doors each bore a gauntleted fist gripping three lightning bolts carved large and gilded those doors swung open before the tairen reached them but there were no servants in evidence the man must have channeled pevara felt that chill again javindhra muttered under her breath with a sound of prayer this time the palace might have belonged to any noble with a taste for tapestries showing battles and redandblack floor tiles except that there were no servants in evidence he had servants though unfortunately no red ajah eyesandears among them but did he expect them to remain out of sight when not needed or had he ordered them from the halls perhaps to avoid having anyone see six aes sedai arrive that line of reasoning ran toward thoughts she would rather not consider she had acknowledged the dangers before leaving the white tower there was no point dwelling on them the chamber the tairen led them to was a throne room where a ring of spiralcut black columns supported what must have been the palaces largest dome its interior layered with gilt and half filled with gilded lamps hanging on gilded chains tall mirrored standlamps stood along the curved walls too perhaps a hundred men in black coats were standing to either side of the room every man she could see wore the sword and the dragon men with hard faces leering faces cruel faces their eyes focused on her and the other sisters the tairen did not announce them but rather simply joined the mass of ashaman and left them to make their own way across the room the floor tiles were red and black here too taim must particularly like those colors the man himself was lounging on what could only be called a throne a massive chair as heavily carved and gilded as any throne she had seen atop a white marble dais pevara focused on him and not only to avoid feeling all those eyes of men who could channel following her mazrim taim drew the eye he was tall with a strongly hooked nose and an air of physical strength about him an air of darkness too he sat there with his ankles crossed and one arm hanging over the heavy arm of the throne yet he seemed ready to explode into violence interestingly though his black coat was embroidered with blueandgold dragons that twined around the sleeves from elbows to cuffs he did not wear the collar pins six sisters of the red ajah he said when they stopped short of the dais his eyes she had only thought the tairens eyes were augers plainly you didnt come to try gentling us all chuckles rippled around the room why did you come asking to speak to me i am pevara tazanovni sitter for the red she said this is javindhra doraille also a red sitter the others are tarna feir desala nevanche i didnt ask your names taim cut in coldly i asked why you came here this was not going well she managed not to take a deep breath but she wanted to outwardly she was cool and calm inside she wondered whether she would end the day forcibly bonded or dead we want to discuss bonding ashaman as warders after all youve bonded fiftyone sisters against their will as well to let him know they were aware of that from the start we do not propose bonding any man against his will however a tall goldenhaired man standing near the dais sneered at her why should we allow aes sedai to take any m something unseen struck the side of his head so hard that his feet left the floor tiles before he fell in a heap eyes closed and blood trickling from his nostrils a lean man with receding graystreaked hair and a forked beard bent to touch a finger to the fallen mans head hes alive he said as he straightened but his skulls cracked and his jaws broken he might have been talking about the weather none of the men made any move to offer healing not one i have some small skill in healing melare said gathering her skirts and already moving toward the fallen man enough for this i think with your permission taim shook his head you do not have my permission if mishraile survives till nightfall hell be healed perhaps the pain will teach him to guard his tongue you say you want to bond warders reds that last word carried a great deal of contempt which pevara chose to ignore tarnas eyes could have turned the sun to an icicle though pevara laid a cautionary hand on the other womans arm as she spoke reds have experience with men who can channel mutters rose among the watching ashaman angry mutters she ignored that too we are not afraid of them custom can be as hard to change as law harder at times but it has been decided to change ours henceforth red sisters may bond warders but only men who can channel each sister may bond as many as she feels comfortable with given the green for example i think that is unlikely to be more than three or four very well pevara blinked in spite of herself very well she must have misunderstood him he could not have been convinced so easily taims eyes seemed to bore into her head he spread his hands and it was a mocking gesture what would you have me say fair is fair equal shares accept very well and ask who will let you bond them besides you must remember the old saying let the lord of chaos rule the chamber erupted with mens laughter pevara had never heard any saying like that the laughter made the hair on the back of her neck try to

they shave the sides and back of the head leaving what appears to be a bowl of hair with a wide tail at the back allowed to grow longer often to the shoulder for men or to the waist for women those of the highest level of the high blood are called high lady or high lord and lacquer the first two fingernails on each hand those of the next level of the high blood are called simply lord or lady and lacquer only the nails of the forefingers those of the low blood also are called simply lady or lord but those of the higher rank lacquer the nails of the last two fingers on each hand while those on the lowest level lacquer only the nails of the little fingers the empress and immediate members of the imperial family shave their heads entirely and lacquer all of their fingernails one can be raised

also known as heartstone currency after many centuries of trade the standard terms for coins are the same in every land crowns the largest coin in size marks and pennies crowns and marks can be minted of gold or silver while pennies can be silver or copper the last often called simply a copper in different lands however these coins are of different sizes and weights even in one nation coins of different sizes and weights have been minted by different rulers because of trade the coins of many nations can be found almost anywhere and for that reason bankers moneylenders and merchants all use scales to determine the value of any given coin even large numbers of coins are weighed the heaviest coins come from andor and tar valon and in those two places the relative values are copper pennies silver penny silver pennies silver mark silver marks silver crown silver crowns gold mark gold marks gold crown by contrast in altara where the larger coins contain less gold or silver the relative values are copper pennies silver penny silver pennies silver mark silver marks silver crown silver crowns gold mark gold marks gold crown the only paper currency is lettersofrights which are issued by bankers guaranteeing to present a certain amount of gold or silver when the letterofrights is presented because of the long distances between cities the length of time needed to travel from one to another and the difficulties of transactions at long distance a letterofrights may be accepted at full value in a city near to the bank which issued it but it may be accepted only at a lower value in a city farther away generally someone intending to be traveling for a long time will carry one or more lettersofrights to exchange for coin when needed lettersorrights are usually accepted only by

its own customs and taboos the latter of which often make no sense to anyone outside that tribe most of the tribesmen avoid the more civilized residents of seanchan kin the even during the trolloc wars more than two thousand years ago circa ab the white tower continued to maintain its standards putting out women who failed to measure up one group of these women fearing to return home in the midst of the wars fled to barashta near the presentday site of ebou dar as far from the fighting as was possible to go at that time calling themselves the kin and kinswomen they kept in hiding and offered a safe haven for others who had been put out in time their approaches to women told to leave the tower led to contacts with runaways and while the exact reasons may never be known the kin began to accept runaways as well they made great efforts to keep these girls from learning anything about the kin until they were sure that aes sedai would not swoop down and retake them after all everyone knew that runaways were always caught sooner or later and the kin knew that unless they held themselves secret they themselves would be punished severely unknown to the kin aes sedai in the tower were aware of their existence almost from the very first but prosecution of the wars left no time for dealing with them by the end of the wars the tower realized that it might not be in their best interests to snuff out the kin prior to that time a majority of runaways actually had managed to escape whatever the towers propaganda but once the kin began helping them the tower knew exactly where any runaway was heading and they began retaking nine out often since kinswomen moved in and out of barashta and later ebou dar in an effort to hide their existence and their numbers never staying anywhere more than ten years lest someone notice that they did not age at a normal speed the tower believed they were few and they certainly were keeping themselves low in order to use the kin as a trap for runaways the tower decided to leave them alone unlike any other similar group in history and to keep the very existence of the kin a secret known only to full aes sedai the kin do not have laws but rather rules called the rule based in large part on the rules for novices and accepted in the white tower and in part on the necessity of maintaining secrecy as might be expected given the origins of the kin all of their members maintain their rules very firmly recent open contacts between aes sedai and kinswomen while known only to a handful of sisters have produced a number of shocks including the facts that there are twice as many kinswomen as aes sedai and that some have lived more than a hundred years longer than any aes sedai since before the trolloc wars the effect of these revelations both on aes sedai and on kinswomen is as yet a matter for speculation see also knitting circle the knitting circle the the leaders of the kin since no member of the kin has ever known how aes sedai arrange their own hierarchyknowledge passed on only when an accepted has passed her test for the shawlthey put no store in strength in the power but give great weight to age with the older woman always standing above the younger the knitting circle a title chosen like the kin because it is innocuous thus consists of the thirteen oldest kinswomen resident in ebou dar with the oldest given the title of eldest by the rules all will have to step down when it is time for them to move on but so long as they are resident in ebou dar they have supreme authority over the kin to a degree that any amyrlin seat would envy since the kin have left ebou dar the knitting circle does not technically exist see also kin the lancecaptain in most lands noblewomen do not personally lead their armsmen into battle under normal circumstances instead they hire a professional soldier almost always a commoner who is responsible both for training and leading their armsmen depending on the

they are true legion of the dragon the a large military formation all infantry giving allegiance to the dragon reborn trained by davram bashere along lines worked out by himself and mat cauthon lines which depart sharply from the usual employment of foot while many men simply walk in to volunteer large numbers of the legion are scooped up by recruiting parties from the black tower who first gather all of the men in an area who are willing to follow the dragon reborn and only after taking them through gateways near caemlyn winnow out those who can be taught to channel the remainder by far the greater number are sent to basheres training camps legion of the wall formerly an elite military formation of ghealdan which provided not only a core to any army that was raised from the ghealdanin nobiltys armsmen but also provided a bodyguard for the ruler of ghealdan and policed jehannah the capital in place of a city watch after they were slaughtered and the survivors dispersed by the followers of the prophet masema the nobles of the crown high council decided that without the legion their own power and their influence over any ruler was increased so they managed to stop the legion

knowledge of artur hawkwings attempted invasion despite the accounts of eyewitnesses from the sea folk the little information that has leaked out reveals that the sharans are ruled by a single absolute monarch a shboan if a woman and a shbotay if a man that monarch rules for exactly seven years then dies the rule then passes to the mate of that ruler who rules for seven years and then dies this pattern has repeated itself since the time of the breaking of the world the sharans believe that the deaths are the will of the pattern there are channelers in shara known as the ayyad who are tattooed on their faces at birth the women of the ayyad enforce the ayyad laws stringently a sexual relationship between ayyad and nonayyad is punishable by death for the nonayyad and the ayyad is also executed if force on his or her part can be proven if a child is born of the union it is left exposed to the elements and dies male ayyad are used as breeding stock only they are not educated in any fashion not even how to read or write and when they reach their twentyfirst year or begin to channel whichever comes first they are killed and the body cremated supposedly the ayyad channel the
