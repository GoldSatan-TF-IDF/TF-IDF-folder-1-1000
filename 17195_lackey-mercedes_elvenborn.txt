elvenborn book three of the halfblood chronicles andre norton and mercedes lackey tor fantasy atom doherty associates book new york prologue vkel lyon lord kyndreth stood up and loomed over the council table and the councilors seated there most of his fellow elvenlords would not meet his eyes those that did so shared a congratulatory glance with him the council chamber was not a comfortable place today and he had ensuredwith a few orders to the slaves who had prepared it that it would remain so cold dim the cushions on the seats pounded flat and even the refreshments were illservedat a uniform temperature that could only be described as tepid all to keep everyone here wishing he was elsewhere and less than pleased with the onenot lord kyndrethwho was nominally in charge lord kyndreths star was in the ascendant once again and this time he would see to it that it did not fall a second time how is it he asked to empty air that a rebellious pack of children and former slaves have managed to hold off our allegedly welltrained wellled and wellsupplied armies and have done so for long enough that people are beginning to call thistemper tantrumthe young lords rebellion lord kyndreth ventured vkel anster lord rechan scrambling mightily for the upper hand he hadif he had only known itjust lost this is exactly as you say no more than a temper tantrum inconsequential no more than a handful of estates have been lost our supplies continue to move without more than the occasional ambush there is no more than a trickle of slaves escaping and our lives continue as they always have in balance the threat a trickle here a loss there the complete inability of our socalled invincible army to bring our own offspring to heel and you say its inconsequential lord kyndreth roared and had the satisfaction of seeing his chief opponent wince by the ancestors you fool cant you see that a socalled trickle is all that is needed to bleed us to death kyndreth saw with some satisfaction a subtle and unspoken shifting among the other council members and watched as power came over to his side and what may i ask do you propose to do if these socalled errant children of ours decide to ally with the elvenbane and her wizards and dragons there it was out in the open the thing that no one had dared to say and he watched as a chill passed over all the rest of them yes even lord rechan they wouldnt someone whispered dont ever believe that one of kyndreths supporters said sharply he took note of the speaker and reminded himself to single that one out for some special favor why shouldnt they becausebecausebecause theyre elvenlords the first lord spluttered looking so horrified by the very notion that one would think hed been accused of fathering halfblooded children himself and when whatever magic theyve discovered ceases to prevent our magic from reaching and punishing them lord kyndreth asked what then do you think do you really think that they will hesitate for one moment before going over to the halfblood side silence now kyndreth said into that silence changing his voice from challenging to calm i have some suggestions the first of which is one i think none of you will anticipate i suggest that we continue to allow our loyal offspring to continue their lives as usual i do not propose interfering with their pleasures in fact if anything i suggest a slightly looser leash for now and you may well be asking yourself why wellyes replied lord rechan looking gratifyingly puzzled if as you say the inroads are slowly bleeding us to death firstly we dont want the brats to know its bleeding us to death and rest assured they must have ears and eyes among us and its probably some of our apparentlyloyal children secondly we want to remind our apparentlyloyal children just how pleasant life is when ones sire is pleased with one he smiled slightly it is easier to catch a fly with a sweetmeat than with vinegar and meanwhile his eyes narrowed i will be ahunting for a better commander and to his immense satisfaction there was not one single objection vkel aelmarkin erlord tornal smiled down at the slave who rested her paletressed head on his knee she was his current personal favorite a delicate young human female nestled trustingly against his leg her thin fineboned face and porcelain complexion pleased him with their flawless symmetry and perfection she returned his smile shyly yet with a touch of the coquette her round blue eyes reflecting her callow unsophisticated nature no rebellious thoughts dwelling in that narrow skullin fact he would be surprised if she managed to conjure up more than one or two thoughts of any kind in an average day her pedigree was immaculate out of a long line of carefully chosen slaves famed for their beauty and delicacy to be nothing more complicated than any other ornamental object he sighed with contentment and smoothed the pale gold silken hair away from her brow with a gentle caress she was exquisite lovely eager to please pliant graceful innocent and incredibly easy to manipulate exactly the sort of slave that gave him the most pleasure he carefully cultivated that innocence and none of his other slaves would dare his wrath by spoiling that naivete no tales of floggings or more extreme punishments no haremstories of his other favorites and what had become of themnothing to hint that he had aspects she had never experienced so far as she was concerned he was the gentle loving everkind master that she believed him to be he turned his attention back to his most important guest there you see he said gesturing expansively to the hall before them and its raucous occupants did i not promise you would be far more amused here than in dancing attendance on all the dull hopeful maidens at your fathers fete elvenlord aelmarkin did not possess enough magic to create a fanciful illusion in his great hall so the luxurious surroundings here were all quite real guests at his entertainments would always find themselves in the same opulent room that they had graced at the last entertainment rather than a new and exotic setting vastly different from their last he made up for the lack of novel surroundings by the lavishness of his entertaining which had begun to earn him something of a reputation take this room for example fortunately it had been beautifully constructed in the first place and he had only needed to embellish it when it came into his possession the north and south walls were mostly of glassnorthwards lay a natural lake artfully landscaped and southwards were the pleasuregardens the east and west walls paneled in wood bleached to silver held silverrimmed doors that led to the rest of the manor the ceiling with its bleachedwood beams from which hung great silver fantasies of lights crystals tiny glass sculptures and silver filigree also boasted vast transparent skylights just now the reflection of the myriad lights made it impossible to see anything of the outside world but later when the lights were dimmed the stars would shine impassively down on the celebrants the black carpet of the floor was kind to the bare feet of the slaves but aelmarkin had selected black carpeting largely because it was easy to clean after one of his entertainments and was far more forgiving a surface for a drunken reveler to fall on than marble or wood the east and west walls were hung with silver draperies and the silver diningcouches were upholstered in black to match the carpet between each couch and the next stood an enormous silver censer from which came sensuous and intoxicating incensesmokes silver tables stood before each couch and the guests provided the only touch of color in the room the couches themselves each held two occupants an invited guest and a companion of his or her choosingeither a fellow guest or one of aelmarkins haremslaves dressed in silver gossamer and matching silver collar picturesque wineslaves dressed in abbreviated silver tunics stood at each couch with their silver pitchers and more slaves dressed in silver tunics and gossamer skirts or trews served the guests with plates of dainties enough wine had been drank by this time that the guests were starting to raise their voices in lessthandelicate jests and lose what few inhibitions they had when they arrived here vsher tennith erlord kalumel raised one long silver eyebrow sardonically as he surveyed the occupants of the dining couches before and below him i must admit he drawled that seeing varcaleme making a fool of himself is far more entertaining than fending off wouldbe brides and their anxious fathers aelmarkin laughed and continued to caress the platinum tresses of his slave chosen out of all the possible candidates presented to him because she most resembled a delicate elven maiden he dressed her like an elven girl too in flowing gowns of delicate pastel silks with huge butterfly sleeves and long embroidered trains ordering her attendants to weave strings of pearls in her silverblond hairand to arrange her hair so that it covered the round tips of her ears so long as one didnt look too deeply into her eyes the illusion was complete and he could use his magic to change her blue eyes to elvengreen if he chose her name had been kindre until he ordered it changed to the elven synterrathe the aforementioned varcaleme was chasing one of the winegirls around his couch the flowerwreath she had bound around his brows had slipped sideways and was obscuring one eye and the fact that he had drunk most of the wine in her nowempty flask was not aiding his ability to catch her she had cast one look at her master when she began eluding those clutching hands to see if he objected to her evasions he had nodded slightly and she needed no further encouragement to keep dodging his advances varcalemes couchcompanion one of his personal concubines a tall darkhaired wench gowned in brilliant emerald that matched the beryl of her controlling collar seemed relieved that she no longer had to entertain him and was nibbling on spiced fruit wearing a bored but wary expression now the rest of the guests had taken an interest in the proceedings calling out encouragement to varcaleme or the slave taking bets on whether or not he would catch her as she dodged his outstretched hands and outpaced his stumbling feet most of aelmarkins guests were male with a scant pair of elven ladies one of the ladies clad in pearly silks that revealed scarcely less than the slaves costumes had brought her own couchcompanion a musclebound human gladiator the other elven lady swathed from nape to ankle in skintight black satin had come with another of the elvenlordswho was not her affianced of the remaining twenty guests half had brought their own concubines and half had made a selection from the slaves offered to them by aelmarkin all of the elvenlords present with the exception of aelmarkin and the lady who had brought her own male concubine were the sons of ruling elvenlordsbut had not joined the young lords rebellion most of them saw themselves as losing far more than they would gain by rebelling and the rest were cynically hoping for the rebellion to eliminate their fathers for them aelmarkin and vdann triana lord falcionwho despite being female was lord of the falcion holdings in her own right and thus it recently had been ruled was entitled to the title of lord rather than lady or erlordwere the only elvenlords in the room with their own estates and property aelmarkin however was hardly a great lordhis property was a fraction of the size of any of those with real power most of his wealth came from the sale of the exquisitely bred and trained concubines who were literally worth their weight in gems that gave him a certain status but no real power as for triana her standing had plummeted after her involvement in the debacle of the second wizard war and she was no longer a desirable ally to anyone on the great council she generally kept to herself on her own estate he suspected that she was biding her time waiting to see which way the wind blew in the young lords uprising before she tried to worm her way back into the good graces of the powerful as a party guest however she was still of value an acid wit and a reputation for depravity gave her all the fascination of a captivating serpent and people enjoyed seeing what she would say or do next any time aelmarkin invited her to one of his entertainments he knew he would have full participation and her own parties continued to be extremely popular among the younger sons those who did not possess great power and those who did not have a council seat aelmarkin was by no means as certain as the great lords that triana would remain out of power for the foreseeable future she was clever resourceful and learned from her mistakes the wizard wars and the rebellion were changing everything it was always possible that triana would prove to be a potent ally at some point it was even possible that she would somehow claw her way to power entirely on her own the extent of her boldness was demonstrated in her dress tonight gowned in transparent silks like a concubine she knew very well that however tempting she might be there was no one here with sufficient power to dare touch her without her consentand so she taunted them with her very appearance besides she had no scruples to speak of he liked that in a womanprovided he didnt have to marry her have you heard anything more from the council about your petition triana called to him from across the room with a half smile her gladiator offered her a choice tidbit with a servile gesture she allowed him to feed it to her nibbling at it with white sharp teeth he was new to aelmarkin but that was hardly surprising triana went through male slaves at an astonishing rate he concealed a wince triana had a vested interest in the outcome of that petition and it was one quite opposite to his she would bring up the subject hed cherished the notion when hed scheduled this entertainment that it might be a victory celebration since it wasnt he had hoped no one would bring up the subject they denied it he said trying to sound as if he didnt care about the outcome even though his defeat ate at him triana made a little pout of sympathy and tennith turned his head to gaze at aelmarkin with astonishment no really i should have thought that your cousin had proved himself mentally unbalanced a hundred times over by now about half of the guests looked puzzled they didnt know who aelmarkins cousin was and he really didnt wish to enlighten them really chimed in another sending away a server with a flick of an impatient hand your cousin is quite a piece of work aelmarkin playing soldier with human slaves as if he was still an infant playing with toys its ridiculous if he was going to have an obsession it at least ought to be a dignified obsession oh i dont know purred triana running her finger along the arm of her gladiator some of us like to play with soldiers the slave blushed from the top of his head to well past his waist on what grounds did they deny you tennith asked and aelmarkin wondered if he detected a certain malicious enjoyment in tenniths tone tennith might not be a lord in his own right but he outranked aelmarkin and he wasnt above flaunting that fact and embarrassing aelmarkin at the same time but tennith would find out for himself what the council had said if he simply bothered to ask his father aelmarkins best protection lay in pretending the decision meant very little to him they did a very tiresome thing they had the production records from the estate for the last fifty years brought out and nothing there shows that cousin kyrtian is neglecting his estate or his duties they decided that he isnt unbalanced merely eccentric and that eccentricity is hardly grounds for taking his inheritance and giving it to the next male heir next male heir triana asked significantly with a little frown isnt his mother still alive wouldnt she be the appropriate heir even if he was disinherited on the grounds of insanity that was trianas interest anything that barred another female from inheriting could eventually be used against her his mother is not my sister aelmarkin replied shes not the next heir of blooddescent as you so clearly were for clan falcion if kyrtian were removed the estate would come to me naturally and legally shes probably the one running things then tennith pointed out if she doesnt want to be sent back to live in her fathers household she has to make it look as if your cousin is competent that may be but ive no hope of proving it aelmarkin growled wishing that lady lydiell had resembled the child at his feet rather than the clever creature she was he recalled his intended pose and forced a laugh well i suppose the council had to rule the way that they did lord jaspireth told me rather tartly that if fitness to hold title and property was to be judged on the basis of unusual hobbies half the council would lose their seats half tennith laughed more like threequarters looked at in that light its obvious you are a victim of necessity aelmarkin signaled to his wench to refill his goblet and sipped at the vintage with deliberation much as i would like to see the lands of my clan administered properly i suspect they will come to me in time anyway kyrtian shows no sign of marrying which in itself ought to prove his unfitness and its entirely possible hell manage to break his neck or do something equally foolish to himself as he careens around the countryside break his neck queried the second lady looking puzzled as did her escort im afraid im rather lost aelmarkin i dont know anything about your cousin who is he is he doing something dangerous that triggered laughter among some of the others who were more familiar with aelmarkins cousin than she was triana took pity on herprobably because the ladys escort was neither clever nor outstandingly handsomeand explained weve been discussing kyrtian vdyll lord prastaran triana said giving aelmarkins cousin his full name and title surely youve heard something about him the lady shook her head not really she confessed then realized that triana was patronizing her and put on a cool air as she tried to save the situation but i dont pay much attention to the provincials aelmarkin snorted hes certainly provincial ill grant you that lady brynnire he never leaves the estate unless he absolutely has to he could get a seat on the great council if he only worked at it but he wont even try instead he spends all of his time collecting books and studyingof all the nonsensical subjectsmilitary tactics military tactics triana erupted in peals of laughter oh aelmarkin even if he is serious and not seriously unbalanced just who does he think hes going to use military tactics on everyone knows the humans and the halfbloods dont have real armies they dont fight proper battles and as for the young lords she stopped because it was entirely possible that this was a touchy subject for some of aelmarkins other guests but tennith whose father was highly placed in the great council and thus was the highestranked elvenlord present finished her sentence for her the young lords are a disorganized pack of rabble he said loftily once a solution is found that negates their ability to nullify magic theyll dissolve and come crawling back to their fathers begging forgiveness in the meantime it is impossible to use tactics against someone who doesnt know what the word means oh that isnt the best of it gloated lord pratherin he not only studies this nonsense he practices it personally i think hes never gotten over playing in the nursery with toy soldiers he just does it now on a grander scale when brynnire still looked confused he leaned over the couch in her direction and explained he makes up two opposing armies out of slaves my dear and personally leads one army into battle against the other if you can believe it not to settle a grievance or for any other reasonable purpose not even for the entertainment of watching them slaughter each other no he does this just to see how strategies work out with living subjects as the others chortled howled or simply looked smug according to their natures lady brynnire looked startled then shocked then amused aelmarkin if i didnt know you id be tempted to think you were making this up sadly my dear i am not aelmarkin replied and looked to tennith who nodded in confirmation really brynnire giggled a little nervously well eccentric is not what i would call him he takes after his father dear lady said tennith smoothly which might be said to demonstrate that sadly madness is inherited in his family surely you recall that poor demented fellow who vanished several years ago out hunting some obscure relics of evelon yes brynnire replied brightening ancestors you dont mean to tell me that was kyrtians father the same aelmarkin told her with a heavy sigh a sad case indeed and it should have been obvious to the great council from that fiasco that the estate should not have been put in the hands of his son i should say not lady brynnire nodded her head after exchanging a look with her escort at least i would not have nor anyone else with any sense aelmarkin thought it more than time to change the subject and signaled for the dancers the musicians who had been playing soothing quiet background music until this moment abruptly changed mood and tempo startling the guests with a thunder of percussion the lights dimmed and a mist arose from the censers a scented cool mist that relaxed and yet stimulated the senses even as it obscured the couches and their occupants only the space in the middle of the couches remained clear lit from some invisible source the dancers ran in from all directions dressed in the merest scraps of animalhide paint beads and feathers and meant to represent wild humans not that any of aelmarkins guests had ever seen wild humansnor had aelmarkin himself for that matterbut that would hardly matter most entertainments featured dancers mimicking the graceful and ethereal dances of their masters or dancers changed to resemble animated flowers birds or flames aelmarkin wanted to startle his guests with something different the dance began with astonishing leaps as the performers hurled themselves across the floor with total abandon their unbound hair streaming out behind them then as drums pounded the females hurled themselves at the males who caught them in various positions whirled them around and flung them on to the next partner there was frank and unflinching eroticism in their choreography even aelmarkin who had seen them practicing felt his pulse quicken at their raw sensuality ancestors tennith muttered under his breath his eyes wide what is this an ancient fertility rite so im told aelmarkin said casually i thought it might be interesting to watch tennith didnt reply his eyes were glued to the dancers half combat and half matingfrenzy it was sometimes difficult to tell if the dancers intended to couple or kill each other and the performance built to a pulsepounding crescendo that ended in a tangle of bodies suggestive of both by aelmarkins orders the lights dimmed gradually as the dance ended leaving the room bathed only in star and moonlight as he had hoped the performance had achieved the arousing effect he had intended his guests had turned their attentions to their couchcompanions and as the dancers and servants slipped away aelmarkin turned his attention to the censers increasing the mist rising from them the slaves already knew to dust more of the intoxicating drugs over the coals therein magic did not come easily to him and he had to close his eyes in concentration even to perform so minor a conjuration as he opened his eyes he realized that he and his little slave were no longer alone a slim form sat on the end of his couch well triana he said blandly concealing his surprise whatever brings you to my side forgive me if i doubt that you have erotic intentions she made a pouting motion with her lips aelmarkin i do believe you havent a romantic particle in you neither do you he countered so i just wondered what it would be worth to you to see your cousin unseated she said casually casting her eyes down and tracing a little path on the fabric of the couch with her finger i suppose that would depend on the circumstances he replied just as casually it would do me no good at all if for instance his estates were ruined in the process why do you ask no real reason just that women often have sources of information that are closed to the men she gave him an arch smile but he refused to rise to the bait the last thing he wanted was to give triana something she could use to manipulate him just as men have sources that are closed to women he countered with an arch smile of his own especially someone like me do recall what my stockintrade is my dear concubines dont speak to ladies she smiled with malicious delight if i hadnt made a vow never to marry i swear i would propose to you on the spot aelmarkin you and i are two of a kind you and i would kill one another before a year was out he replied and touched his finger to the bottom of her chin drawing her to him for a brief dangerous kiss now youve left that handsome stud all alone better get back to him before he pines away or falls asleep she rose with a sinuous grace worthy of any of his dancers ill tell you what ill lay a bet with you i bet that i can find something to discredit him before you do and the stakes he asked her smile was so sweetly poisonous that it took his breath away something we both swore never to do if you lose you train a male slave for me and if i lose i train a female for you but you cant limit me as to means is it a wager the idea of owning a slave trained by triana made his head swim and his breath come short now here were stakes worthy of the play done he said immediately she laughed and glided away into the mist he felt a tentative touch on his wrist and belatedly returned his attention to his current favorite he looked down at her and saw by the furtive color in her cheek her moist lips and her shining eyes that the danceand the sighs and vague shapes moving in the mist around themhad produced the effect he had anticipated on her as well lord the slave breathed looking up at him coyly from beneath her long fluttering lashes do you wish myfurther service this evening though untouched she was by no means unaware of the duties of a concubine and it was clear from the moist eagerness in her eyes that she was ready to fulfill those duties he closed his eyes for a moment savoring what he was about to do he had ways of controlling the slaves he trained that went beyond far beyond the slavecollar and magic coercion he had subtle tortures that were far more sophisticated than anything tennith dreamed of i dont believe so he said just as casually as if he were rejecting a notquiteripe fruit then he looked down at her and frowned my dear childis something troubling you you seem to be a littlepuffy tonight or perhaps you have just gained a little weight perhaps you should return to your quarters the girl put her hand to her mouth stifling a sob her eyes brightened further with tears quickly as a fluttering bird she fled into the mist he chuckled to himself he had carefully manipulated her mind for weeks now and this carefully chosen moment was the beginning of a delightful interlude he had made a point of praising her slender figure of leaving no doubt that he treasured her slimness doubting her own mirror certain that she had lost her real beauty and desperate to gain his regard she would begin starving herself from this moment at first he would taunt her by references to plump arms and chubby cheeks by inquiries if she thought she ought to change her diet once she truly began to starve herself he would switch to the next phase she would begin refusing food he of course would urge all manner of dainties on her which she would eat unwillingly only to purge herself of them at the earliest opportunity his lips curved in a slight smile watching her torture herself all the while certain that he was still as gentle and considerate as ever would be highly amusing eventually she would probably die of course but not before he gained a great deal of pleasure from watching her ridiculous sufferings if he was feeling generous he might even save her wiping out her memories of everything up to this moment so that he could sell her to someone else in any case there would be weeks possibly months of pleasure ahead and further pleasure between the two of them he and triana would almost certainly find a way to bring his cousin kyrtian down he laughed softly how his fortune had suddenly turned this might well turn out to be the victory celebration he had hoped for his appetite suddenly aroused he reached for the nearest winewench to satisfy his needs of the moment poor kyrtian he had no notion even that he had an enemy much less how formidable that enemy was one did not normally see an elvenlord smudged with dirt twigscratched and rather the worse for several hours of tramping through untamed forest i wonder how much scandal i would cause if even one of the great lords saw me in this state kyrtian mused as he held aside an errant limb of a bush taking care that it did not rattle and making certain the human behind him had a firm grip on it before he released it it was impossible to see the mans expression behind his helm but the fellow sketched a respectful salute with his free hand ah well knowing my reputation they would probably not be at all surprised kyrtian vdyll lord prastaran led his skirmishing band of lightly armed humans in person very few elvenlords would ever have put themselves in that inferior and vulnerable a position especially now with humans halfblooded wizards and younger elvenlords all in revolt against the great lords the mere notion of leading a group alone without the presence of a fully collarcontrolled and loyaltyspelled bodyguard was something that would never occur to most of them kyrtian cared nothing for their opinions since little secret was made of the fact that they cared nothing for his his reputation was as eccentric as his hobby and that was the way he preferred things his grandfather had eschewed politics when the great lords disdained his advice by now staying out of politics was something of a family tradition and kyrtian was quite prepared to continue that tradition at this moment as always when on maneuvers all of his attention was focused on his battlestrategies and his surroundings to the exclusion of everything else his initial battleplan was so vague that at this point he was rather recklessly making decisions moment by moment he suspected that his opponent was counting on that assuming that kyrtians wellknown caution would also make him inflexible it was a reasonable assumption kyrtian just hoped that he could prove that it was an incorrect one that was the point of this exercise after all this was the first time he had ever met an opponent in anything other than a set battle where was the right balance of caution and initiative nothing in all of his books and studies had dealt with that magic formula sweat trickled down the back of his neck but a headband under his helm kept it from dripping into his eyes he felt a brief flash of superiority as he climbed the steep and rockstrewn slope before him with no sense of strain not even an increase in his breathing how many of the pampered great lords would be able to do as much certainly he was sweating but he wasnt in the least tired and if at last he managed to bring his skirmishers to a fight he would be as ready for action as any of them senses alert for the least sign of warning he picked his way one careful step at a time through the sparse underbrush of the forest his men spread out in his wake carefully following his example his sword was out and ready in his left hand that would give him a little advantage against an opponent should one suddenly appear before him but not much the enemy fighters lurking somewhere ahead knew him and some had fought handtohand against him before the enemyall that he knew for certain was that they were here in his patch of pristine oldgrowth forest and that their numbers were equal to his the most logical place to find them the weathered remains of an ancient fortification had been empty he assumed now that they probably planned to set up an ambush for his skirmishers somewhere they knew he was coming and he doubted that they intended to make a pitched battle of it in their place he wouldnt his advantage was that he knew these woods as well as his opponents did he should since everything for leagues around here belonged to him he had made a mental tally of all the obvious places for an ambush and he hoped he could approach such places from unexpected angles and with luck catch the foemen by surprise an ambushed ambushhardly sporting i suppose he smiled knowing the expression was hidden by his helm well first he would have to pull this off then he would worry about whether it was sportingassuming hed won the encounter of course after all it is the victor who writes the histories and he is the one who gets to determine what is fair after the fact a movement to one side caught his eye only one of his men trying to shoo away an irritating fly with a minimum of obvious movement they knew better than to slap at insects lest the sound betray them to the enemy and he felt sorry for his human fightingmen for all that he sweated as heavily as any one of them insects seldom plagued elves perhaps because elves not native to this world did not smell right to the pesky bugs kyrtian froze and raised his hand to signal to his men to do likewise as he thought he caught a murmur of voices up ahead holding his breath he closed his eyes and concentrated on listening perhapsperhaps he opened his eyes again and considered their present location frowning as he did so he and his fighters were approaching a ridge overlooking one of the lesserused pathways through the forest the ridge was an obvious lo cation for an ambush placement on the part of his foes if they assumed he and his men would take that path below it would be very difficult for his party to creep up upon the enemy unseen if that was where they were he raised his right hand above his head to describe three circles with his index finger the fighter immediately behind him made the same motion and in due time a slightly built lithe young fellow by the peculiar human name of horen gosak moved cautiously and noiselessly into place beside kyrtian they locked eyes kyrtians green ones meeting the humans brown kyrtian nodded towards the ridge in the direction of the voices and made the hand signal for ambush horen nodded and leaving his sword and swordbelt behind in kyrtians keeping lest they catch in the brush dropped to his hands and knees to snake his way up towards the ridge moving so low to the ground that he looked like a crawling lizard it was always a wonder to kyrtian how young horen managed to disappear into landscape that was so barren of obvious cover sometimes he wondered if the ability was some unique application of the socalled human magics that was entirely possible and would have caused far more scandal among the great lords than kyrtians little eccentricity of leading his fighters in person although it was the law that all human slaves be fitted with collars that inhibited their own peculiar magic no slave on the prastaran estates had ever worn anything but a decorative collar since the elvenlords came to this world and no slave on the prastaran estates had ever been a slave in anything but name humans make very poor slaves grandfather tried to tell his arrogant compatriots that and they wouldnt listen and now theyre paying the price for ignoring such sage advice the first lord prastaran had retired to the estate hed been allotted proceeding there to put his own theories to work in regard to the aboriginal inhabitants of the place before he drowned in a flash floodwhile nearly twenty of his devoted slaves also drowned in frantic attempts to save himhe had formed the loose confederation of primitives that had been living on the property into a thriving and prosperous community that not only accepted him as their overlord but were absolutely devoted to his welfare kyrtians father had inherited that community and had cherished and fostered it recognizing it for the valuable resource that it was now it was kyrtians to guide and guard for in guarding the humans under his protection he was all too aware that he was guarding his own prosperity his wandering thoughts were abruptly recalled by horens return as the young man wriggled into cover beside him with the aid of twigs pebbles and a few handsignals horen swiftly laid out the disposition of the enemy forces ahead kyrtian studied the arrangement for several moments grinding his teeth a little in frustration as usual the enemy commander showed brilliant skill it was an appallingly superior disposition obviously one couldnt approach them from the front or the rear so what did that leave him we could retreat but that would leave them in possession of the woods and they would win this without a fight that was unacceptable is there enough room on the top of this ridge to flank them he didnt want to divide his force if he could help it and hed have to if he wanted to use a classic pincer maneuver that wouldnt be a good idea anyway one that the ground didnt encourage hed have to send his men to fight against both ends of the enemy ambushline in a way that would only allow one or two fighters to close in at a time that would put them at an immediate disadvantage finally kyrtian decided on something truly unorthodox waiting until the enemy commander was frustrated enough to come looking for him short exploration by horen produced the place where any opposing force was most likely to descend from the ridge after careful deliberation he set up an ambush of his own of course the weakness of this plan was that the opposition might not decide to come down on this side of the ridge that would leave him in his turn waiting to spring an empty trap still the occasional murmur of voices through the hush of the forest told him that his opponents were getting tired of waiting probably they had been in place ever since his own force had entered the woods horen went out again to spy so that kyrtians troops would at least know if the foe moved off in some other direction kyrtian settled into his own position and held off boredom by making an informal birdcount based on the calls he heard time crawled past but his patience was finally rewarded horen slithered back to take up his weapons kyrtian pumped his fist in the air once and heard a faint rustle of leaves as his men caught the signal relaying it down the line and readying themselves for action he had chosen his own place perfectly another faint rustle of leaves and the occasional snapping of a twig warned that the enemy was on the move and shortly after the men appeared filing cautiously down the slope below them flitting from bits of cover to their next position kyrtian waited until he was certain that all of the enemy skirmishers were immediately below their own position his nerves so taut that his skin tingled muscles were afire his pulse pounding in his temples and his ears wait for it if he sprang the ambush too soon his own men would be surrounded he didnt know exactly how many men the enemy had so he couldnt count heads wait for it he didnt dare permit his force to be outflanked now his throat cracked with a yell as he broke out of cover and charged his men streaming down the slope behind him the startled skirmishers whirled to face them kyrtian skidded to a halt on the slope as he nearly ran into a fighter who was considerably taller than he in that moment as was always true for him once the fighting started everything narrowed to this single opponent their swords clashed together his opponent countered with a clever parry that sent him leaping away lest the fighter try to grapple with him next the man tried to circle him but that was the last thing that kyrtian was going to allowat the moment he had the slight advantage of being uphill and that was the only advantage he really had over this bulkier opponent kyrtian retreated as fast as the other advanced nothing was going to force him to turn if he could help it somewhere in the back of his mind he was dimly aware of shouts the clashing of metal and all the din of battle but he was too seasoned to ever be distracted from his own line of combat giving up on the ploy of forcing kyrtian off higher ground the fellow swung low hard and wide scything at kyrtians legs kyrtian used the opportunity to slash at the mans swordhand as he himself skipped backwards he really hadnt expected the luck of a full strike but his opponent had evidently anticipated a blow to the head rather than the hand the fighter ducked to one side and didnt get his hilt up in time to deflect kyrtians blow the blade passed through the others wrist leaving behind a glowing line the fighter cursed transferring the sword to his left hand tucking the disabled hand into his belt at the small of his back as per the rules of combat if he hadnt hed get a warning after the battle was overand the second time he refused to accept a blow the marked area or limb would truly go completely numb and useless until kyrtian removed the magic that rendered it so he was by no means as good a fighter with his weak hand as kyrtian was a clumsy attempt at an overhand blow left his armpit unprotected and the elvenlord executed a fatal thrust the blade vanished up to the hilt with no resistance and the man jerked in reaction to the allover tingle that the deathwound gave him as the sign that he was dead now the fighter glowed the color of new leaves all over with a goodnatured curse he saluted kyrtian sheathed his blade and removed his helm joining five of his fellow dead men on the sidelines all of them were glowing the same yellowgreen which meant they were all out of the enemy forces kyrtian made the mistake of allowing himself a brief pause to gloat without looking behind him a moment after that a sudden electric jolt told kyrtian that he had been taken from behind ruefully looking down at himself he saw that he too was glowing galkasht he cursed in the old tongue and heard sargeant gels familiar laugh in answer he sheathed his own sword in disgust pulled off his helm and went to join the other dead gel did not get a chance to enjoy his victory for long horen rose out of a bush behind him and caught him across the neck as he turned gel swore even more colorfully than kyrtian had while his own men jeered and catcalled from the sidelines who is it has never been hit from behind called one in feigned innocence you owe me beer for the next moon sargeant one of the others heartlessly reminded him and you owe horen three nightwatches dont remind me the human pulled off his helm and threw it to the ground glaring at thembut they knew they were safe the dead could say anything they liked as long as the battle was on that was another one of the rules meant to be sure that no one turned mockcombat into a real fight temper temper scolded a third as horen vanished to seek a new opponent a true warrior never fights with anger im not fighting gel pointed out sourly his jaw clenched tight gel picked up his helm after another scorching glare and stamped his way down the hill to the sidelines kyrtian hid his own grin and gave gel a commiserating slap on the shoulder too bad old man he said with what he hoped was a good counterfeit of sympathy thats combatluck for you thats carelessness you mean gel growled as he ruffled his sweaty grizzled brown hair to dry it dont coddle me kyrtian i got you when you stopped to gloat then i was served the same dish whats more you ambushed me when i lost patience youre going to win this one i underestimated you since at this point those who glowed yellowgreen outnumbered those who glowed redorange by three to one that was fairly obvious so kyrtian held his tongue and tried assume a modest expression i think we can count this experiment a success he said instead i wasnt sure wed be able to make the transition from arenafighting and setbattles but its obvious this mode is going to work id keep it at the skirmishlevel for a while gel cautioned i intend to kyrtian assured him as more of the dead on the sidelines cheered the surviving fighters on or showered them with abuse at least until everyones gotten a fair amount of practice at this i dont want people stumbling around breaking ankles in rabbitholes or running into an alicorn and getting skewered were out here to fight not get hurt he loosened his throatguard and yanked it off gel barked a laugh at that and kyrtian had to grin thats as true as it sounds absurd gel chuckled and its true youd have less luck getting people to volunteer to fight for us if too many of the boys started coming back with broken bones or worse he stuck his thumb in his swordbelt and watched the fighters with pardonable pride ill tell you what thoughid pit these lads against any of the professional fighters ive seen when it comes to combat rather than gladiatorial games theyd win thats rather the point though i hope it doesnt come to that therell be far less blood shed if they go up against conscripts kyrtian watched as the last of his men surrounded the last of gels and demanded their surrender the elvenlords can compel men to fight but they cant compel them to fight well speaking of volunteersthe fieldfolk are going to need another holiday before too long wed better think about organizing a melee then gel sighed he hated setting up melees as they were a great deal of work and as in real battles most of the people who took part in them had no idea how to actually fight a good percentage got muddled and did the opposite of what theyd been ordered and when they got muddled they generally confused those who were trying to obey the orders correctly still everyone on the estate enjoyed the mockwars and were happy to volunteer for them there was great excitement in battle when there was no chance of dying and little chance of getting hurt a warday meant a general holiday with feasting and music and dancing for those who were killed before they were completely exhausted not that anyone got killed deliberately just so he could go dancing since those who were too exhausted to dance were pampered and treated like heroes regardless of which side won ever since the first time that kyrtian and his righthand man had expanded their wargames to include the general population of the estate the exercise had proven so popular that humans and elves alike had come to expect and anticipate a warday every two or three moons or so kyrtian just couldnt bring himself to disappoint themand the one time hed tried to hold a feast without a war there had been such protest that hed never dared do it again i dont suppose it could be a woodsbattle could it he asked wistfully oroh what about a siege with the manor as the target no better yet the dowagerhouse no ones used it in decades and its been years since it was cleaned and aired out itll give your ladymother an excuse to get it set to rights in case we need it for something ancestors know what but we might gel mulled that over as his men declined to surrender electing to fight to the last one standing that could be doneif you could manage mockarrows and mockstones perhaps mockboilingoil kyrtian stared at him aghast at the picture that conjured up ancestors youre certainly bloodyminded if you want a siege you might as well do it right gel argued that means that the besiegers will use bows and the besieged will pelt them with whatever they can from the walls now can you produce the proper material or cant you i probably can kyrtian admitted but you do realize what this will mean dont you huge casualties early on which means the battle wont run long which means well get to the feasting sooner gel grinned which means less work for me and more for your obliging ladymother in arranging the entertainment and probably a population increase in nine months unless i make sure to dose every particle of food on the estate against conceptions kyrtian sighed which means more work for me both in concocting the new magicweapons and in seeing to it that we dont get that flood of new births you know what happens when the women get to be in on the combat why it is that mockfighting gets them so stimulated he shook his head sometimes i think that you humans are so different from us that ill never understand you still a siege would be fun gel said persuasively as his men dropped one by one beneath the swords of kyrtians fighters weve never done a siege before with live fighters things that work on the sandtable with models dont always work with living people the temptation was too great to resist all right he decided start planning and working toward it ill research the magic needed if it doesnt look as if we can pull it off in a months time well have the usual fieldmelee instead done gel crowed and slapped him on the shoulder just as the last of his men fell at that point kyrtians remaining fighters rushed up cheering and there was no point in trying to talk until the victory celebration was over as was usual the two groups of combatants trudged out of the forest together as a single fraternal mass with no sense of marching order the forest could well have been devoid of life at this point birds and beasts were probably frightened into immobility by the laughter and talking at any rate kyrtian couldnt spot so much as a rabbit or a sparrow as they followed the faint track of an old road beneath the trees the sun was just setting and a thick golden light poured through the branches gilding the edges of the leaves and touching the clouds tired but cheerful friends and comrades traded congratulations boasts and outright lies as kyrtian and gel brought up the rear kyrtian never permitted anyone to carry his armor for him like his men he bore his own equipment at least as far as their transportation there were wagons and a carriage waiting just outside the woods to carry them all back to the manor since it would have taken them hours to return on foot kyrtian was very glad to be able to toss his helm to his driver and allow his bodyservant to take the heavy armor off before he climbed into the cushioned comfort of the carriage as a token of his privileged rank gel shared both the attentions of the servant and the carriage the men helped each other and made do with the cushioning effect of a thick layer of hay in their wagons ah the benefits of rank gel sighed as he sat back in the carriage opposite kyrtian kyrtian grinned as soon as gel got himself seated the driver turned the horses and sent the carriage on its way while the wagons were still being loaded with men and armor ancestors kyrtian exclaimed as the servant handed him a flask of cool sweet water ive been looking forward to this all afternoon he took a long draught timing his drink with the jolting of the carriage so he didnt break his teeth on the neck of the flask before handing it to gel youd think wed get tired of this nonsense gel responded leaning back into the soft dark brown velvet cushions after hed corked the flask and handed it back to young lynder kyrtians bodyservant your dear mother keeps saying were too old to play at being soldiers and sometimes i wonder if shes right at least about me every time we come back from one of these games i ask myself if it isnt time to stop you only think that as long as it takes for you to get your wind back the young elvenlord grinned at his companions and lynder chuckled and mother has a different set of priorities from you and me what do you expect her to say shes not just a female shes a lady and if she had her way wed all be drifting around the estate in clouds of tranquil music perfume and refinement if it were up to her youd be cultivating roses and id be cultivating illusions and courting some fragile little lily of a maiden he accepted the flask back and took another drink not that you need to apologize for having a knack with rosesbut i dont think youd want to spend your life among the flowers gel rolled his eyes gods forbid he exclaimed id die of boredom in half a day roses are all right for a hobby but not as a lifes work id prefer tending roses to being forced to spend my time cultivating a highborn maiden kyrtian laughed the sound interrupted oddly by the jouncing of the carriage at least you dont have to make conversation with a flower even if you do have to be careful of the thorns its easier to avoid thorns than try to keep a strange woman from seeing things she shouldnt he tried to keep his tone light but his laughter sounded a bit strained in his own ears the subject of wives and heirs had been much on his mothers mind and tongue lately hardly a day passed without her alluding to it at least once it was a subject he was not easy with he enjoyed his life the way it was and had no real wish to bring a stranger into his home ancestors id have to set up an entirely separate part of the estate to keep her properly secluded and that would be as much of a bore as courting her would be i swear if it werent forbidden id wed a stouthearted human wench from right here gel made a sour face at the least wed need the dowagerhouse set to rights just to confine the girl in and somehow keep her mewed up there indefinitely if tenebrinth selazian and pelenal had daughtersthings would be a great deal easier on all of us youd think one of your clients would have the good sense to take care of that little problem for us kyrtian replied with complete seriousness i wish they had nothing would have pleased me better to take one of them into my family line theyre all fine gentlemen as it iswell someday soon i suppose ill have to please mother and go looking amongst someone elses underlings for a wife eventually ill find a maiden whos of sufficiently low rank to be too overawed to notice my eccentricities shell have to overlook more than that gel warned him or youll have her running back to her papa with stories of how you cant keep your slaves properly under your thumb kyrtian felt compelled to give his mothers counters to those arguments which were the same that he himself had raised elven maidens in most households are kept closeconfined mother says and a maiden of low rank should be dazzled by her new surroundings and too much in awe of mother ever to question things we think that as long as her servants obeyed her shed never know we do things differently here he compressed his brows in a little frown id have to make sure that she was never allowed to abuse them though and that could take some management gel looked dubious but only said if youd just leave the wifehunting up to your mother you can be sure she wont choose someone well have to worry about she has entry to all the bowers and if she cant find someone sympathetic to our ways she can at least find someone who is too timid to speak up about anything too stupid to care or has been too closely sheltered to know what is and is not usual i suppose thats the only real solution kyrtian sighed and winced at the thought of a mouse a dolt or a frail flower as a wife what a disgusting situation he thought frowning and im going to have to do something about it fairly soon mother isn t going to allow me to put it off much longer gel snorted at his rueful expression as a particularly hard bounce sent them all in the air for a brief moment dont mope he replied sternly then added with a crude chuckle at least you arent going to be saddled with a wife who has the hips of a cow the manners of a pig and the face of a horse you elves are never less than handsome so you wont have to wish for a bag to put over her head when you do your duty to present the estate with an heir kyrtian flushed feeling the tips of his ears burn gel had been his teacher companion and friend for as long as he could remember but the human could be amazingly coarse sometimes how on earth could he explain that what made him dread matrimony was the fear that hed find himself bound for centuries to a dull insipid idiot how could he possibly get up enough interest in a maiden like that to do his duty by the estate and the clan gel would only laugh and tell him that it wasnt what was between a girls ears that mattered if i could find someone like mother he thought wistfully id wed her no matter what her rank was did father ever really know how lucky he was to find a maiden with wit courage sense and intelligence what are rank and magic worth compared with qualities like that well have to tell milady about the new scheme for a siege gel said cheerfully interrupting his thoughts shell probably want to have a hand in it herself this timeand i think you ought to give her a bit of a command maybe then shell stop teasing us about our pastime you know you could be right kyrtian braced himself as the carriage hit a series of ruts that threatened to bounce them all against the ceiling rattling his very teeth this was the worst part of the road in a moment everything would suddenly smooth out as they reached the paved section maybe if she gets a taste of this shell realize just how challenging it is my only other choice would be to tell her the truththat it isn t a game that gel and i are training the humans to defend the estate ifor whencombat comes here i dont want to do that i dont know that danger is coming i just feel it in my bones their estate was relatively isolated and he and his mother certainly were not in the first social circles but still first had come the elvenbane that weird wizardgirl who had by all repute singlehandedly engineered an uprising of totally unsuspected halfbloods not that he expected any trouble from the halfbloodshis people were perfectly free to join the wizards any time they wanted to and none of them did still to have a dreaded legend come to life and take down the most powerful elvenlord on the council and do it with the aid of lord dyrans own son who she somehow subvertedwell it had all of the elvenlords looking for more halfbloodsindisguise in their midst and when the great lords were looking for one thing they might find something else they didnt care for then had come a second rebellion this time of the elven lords own disregarded second and third offspring the spares which apparently involved a new sort of magic that disrupted even the most powerful elven magic that war was not going well for the great lords it wasnt so much that theyd lost a great deal of territory for the relatively small number of young lords who had revolted had only taken a few estates the problem was that theyd taken and held them and continued to hold and although kyrtian didnt know this for certain he suspected they were making themselves felt they were a thorn not in the side but in the foot and one which was felt with every step the great lords took that made them edgy always a dangerous thing kyrtian didnt like the idea of having an edgy inquisitive great lord nosing around anywhere near his estate or his people and if anything happened because there was an inquisitive great lord sniffing aroundwell he wanted to be ready for it maybe shell want to take up the sword for herself gel suggested with a sly twinkle you know shed be good at it i think if she ever got a feel for righting shed be as addicted to it as we are oh theres a thought kyrtian laughed wickedly i could make her my secondincommand then what would you do go on my knees and submit gel admitted and bow to the inevitable ive seen her move and ive seen her at the hunt shes got better reactions than you do ancestors put a bow in her hands and ill surrender on the spot rather than face her the carriage jolted one last time as the wheels bounced up onto the pavement then kyrtian and gel settled back with identical sighs of relief as rough ride gave way to smooth rolling that was as comfortable as sailing on a smooth lake i trust youve taken care of things for the men as usual kyrtian asked lynder the young human had only been kyrtians bodyservant for two months but hed been meticulously trained by kyrtians previous man and the elvenlord was confident he could handle his new responsibilities as invisibly as his predecessor the man looked a little anxious the bathhouse is cleared and ready dinners been held theres to be music and lateleave for the other servants to join the entertainment he hesitated and glanced pleadingly at gel clearly wondering if hed missed something exactly right lynder kyrtian said soothingly to take the look of anxiety out of his eyes lynder had probably missed one or two details but the other servants would see to it that everything went smoothly anyway after years of these mockbattles everyone knew what was expected afterwards the houseand fieldservants were expected to reschedule their own baths so that the returning fighters could have the place to themselves dinner had been held back so that it would reach the tables hot and fresh as they came out of the bathhouseand it wouldnt be the usual bread and stew but something a little fancier roast meat or chicken usually a choice of sidedishes and something in the way of a sweet there would be a little extra beernot enough to cause problems but a glass or two more than usual for everyone some of the household musicians would come down after dinner and there would be some lively music and dancing and if beds had two occupants or none in them tonight instead of one no one would be taken to task tomorrow would be a quarterholiday work and drill to start a bit later in the morning than usual so that the men could sleep in a bit all in all the men would feel themselves well rewarded for their hard work today and we need to begin planning the next holiday by tomorrow at the latest kyrtian reminded himself he didnt like to make the intervals between holidays too long he didnt want the houseand fieldservants to start feeling aggrieved at the special treatment the fighters received the carriage slowed and came to a stop in the dusty gold light that was swiftly fading a servant in emeraldgreen tunic and trews opened the door and kyrtian got out followed by gel and lynder round bluewhite lights hanging in clusters of four from bronze posts already blazed on either side of the white stone staircase that led to the front portals of the manor more greenliveried servants took possession of the armor and arms as kyrtian looked about gel saluted and stalked off towards the barracks in that tireless ageless stride that kyrtian could never imitate with the final rays of the setting sun illuminating him like some godtouched hero of human history kyrtian ran up the alabaster steps of the manor with lynder close behind deep shadows now giving way to blue dusk at the top of the stairs double doors of cast bronze would have swung open at the merest touch of his magic but he ignored them entirely intending to take the inconspicuous doorkeepers entry at the side the greenclad doorkeeper had expected just that and was holding open the smaller portal for him bowing slightly as he passed through beker kyrtian greeted him is your wife better the humans long face brightened at the question oh much better lord kyrtian we cannot thank you enough youll thank me by not letting things get to such a pass before you say something kyrtian replied with just enough of a stern tone to his voice that the doorkeeper would know he was serious dont keep going back to the pothecary when the simple cure doesnt work go to lord selazian thats why i keep him as a retainer beker make the lazy lout work for his living yes lord kyrtian the doorkeeper whispered bowing further i will my lord carry on beker kyrtian replied and moved on leaving the doorkeeper to shut things up behind him lynder remind lord tenebrinth to have a talk with the apothecary will you kyrtian said in a quiet aside as they strode down the middle of the entrance hall a thick palegrey carpet beneath their feet muffled all sound of footfalls and although the alabaster ceiling and greyveined marble walls were not imposing kyrtian thought they had a great deal of dignity about them i cant have my people getting sick and relying on thatthat herbshaman for everything i wouldnt have had him at all if you humans hadnt insisted on him lord kyrtianit is frightening for some of us to ask a lord for anything much less ask him to treat us for our ailments lynder replied with hesitation you forget sometimes that although many of us have been born and raised in your service many more come from outside the boundary of your estate and things are very different in the greater world well thats why i want you to remind lord tenebrinth to talk to the apothecary i suspect the man might be encouraging those fears and if thats true i want it stopped kyrtian frowned ancestors the last thing we need is to get a plague started because a man who thinks rattling bones and brewing teas can cure everything wont give up trying till his patients are dead with your permission lord kyrtian ill ask sergeant gel to have a word with him first kyrtian saw out of the corner of his eye that lynder was smiling a little the sergeant can be very persuasive kyrtian nodded as they turned down a side corridor to the familyquarters i trust your judgment lynder but do feel free to bring tenebrinth in on it he is my seneschal after all lynder moved ahead to smoothly open a door on the righthand side of the corridor before kyrtian could touch it himself yes lord kyrtian he replied and as kyrtian stepped through the door into his private quarters he was engulfed by servants in other households they would have been called slaves and it was true that kyrtian was their titular ownerbut if any one of them wanted to leave he would have only to petition the elvenlord and permission would be instantly granted somehow some way kyrtian would find a way to smuggle the human out to the territories held by the wizards or the free humans not that anyone would ever ask for that permissionthe world open to free humans was hostile and uncomfortable and entirely too dangerous to be much of a temptation as had been the case with kyrtians father and grandfather kyrtian and his mother were respected admired even beloved not only by the humans of the estate but by the few elven retainers who called them their liegelords there were three who were of the most importance the aforementioned tenebrinth whose position as seneschal predated kyrtians birth selazian the physician who had been studying the diseases of humans as well as elves for literally centuriesand lord pelenal kyrt ians agent who handled all the affairs of the estate that needed to be conducted outside the walls of the estate kyrtian and his mother were as dependent on pelenals good will as he was on theirs but he had never given them even a moment of unease pelenal bought new slaves negotiated contracts and haggled to get the best prices for the foodstuffs produced by this most fertile of estates pelenal was one of those most despised of creatures an elvenlord with so little magic he might just as well have had none at all despite the fact that there could not possibly have been a better agent in all of the estates pelenal would never have attained that position of power in the service of anyone other than kyrtians family he knew that saw elves with more magic than he groveling for crumbs at the tables of greater elvenlords and demonstrated his gratitude in the most tangible of terms on a regular basis that was just as well because where real power the political power of the council of the great lords was concerned kyrtian had none his only power was economic and that was in no small part due to pelenals clever management still that power could be formidable as servants swarmed over him stripping him to the skin as they propelled him towards the bathing room he allowed himself the luxury of feeling just a little smug political power came and wenteven magic power could fade with time or be lost to further generationsbut economic power was a much more dependable if underrated force his grandfather had understood that even if his father hadntbut his father had the services of tenebrinth to ensure that the estates prosperity continued pelenal had simply built on that foundation the bathingroom of greenveined marble with shining silver fixtures featured a sunken tub longer than kyrtian was tall and deep enough for him to sink in up to his chin just now it was so full of steam it was difficult to see across it kyrtian stepped into the tub carefully when father vanished things could have been very bad if mother hadnt had the good sense to ask tenebrinth if he knew someone he could trust to become our outside agent kyrtian eased himself down into the hot juniperscented water of his bath thinking as he did so that his mother was almost as remarkable in her way as his grandfather had been the more he learned about running this estate the more amazing it was to him that nothing had gone wrong thanks to tenebrinth and pelenal who studied the demands of the other estates and the resources of their own with the fierce dedication of a warrior for his craft kyrtians estate was so prosperous that even his worst enemies would never dream of forcing a confrontation with him he closed his eyes and fragrant steam rose up and filled the room further with scented fog no one lord would ever dare challenge me he thought contentedly and probably not two or three together not that they re likely to since i dont meddle in politics but they still wouldnt dare not when these lands feed and clothe a third of them not when the fruits of our labors are served up on their tables when our wines are the choicest our silks the fairest granted an elvenlord with powerful magic could transform water and ashes into the finest wine and choicest mealsbut it was still water and ashes and wouldnt nourish any better it took a great deal of magic to create such illusions magic which could be put to better use illusory gold had no commercial worthbut the gold in kyrtians treasury was real enough no no one is ever going to try any political games with us he told himself as the heat of the bath warmed and soothed all of his tired strained muscles they wouldnt dare pelenal wouldn t sell to them and then where would they be half the stuff that goes to feed their slaves comes from here most of them dont bother growing grain anymore or raising sheep for wool and flax for linen as often as he asked tenebrinth if there was anything the seneschal wanted as a reward for all his good service tenebrinth had never asked for anything but the most trivial of favors lord tenebrinth often seemed to kyrtian the most contented of beings he had a wife who adored him and the freedom to manage the estate as he saw fit tenebrinths chief pleasure outside of his family came from trying out little theo ries of management over the decades he had weeded out all the ones that didnt work at all or didnt work well and now he was in the process of finetuning and balancing everything the one thing that tenebrinth would have wanted that kyrtian couldnt give him was a child and if i could i would i think we pay for our long lives in our lack of children it was sad really for if there was ever an elven lady born to be a mother it was tenebrinths wife lady seryana and of course it would be so much easier on all of us if they just had a daughter it wouldnt have mattered how young the girl was kyrtian would be more than willing to wait for her to grow up after all he had all the time in the world before him elves did age and die eventually but eventually was several centuries away maybe what he ought to do would be to investigate those rumors that some elvenlords had discovered ways to enhance their fertility with magic if that were true and he could find a way to purchase the services of such a magician that would solve everyones problem wouldnt it it was an easy solution on the surface but like deep water such a solution could cover more than was immediately apparent the favor might cost more than im willing to give what if the mage wanted slaves how could i send off any of my people into real slavery what if he wanted some of my fighters what if he wanted gel even if that difficulty never came up there was the imaginary girl to consider she might not like me she might like me but not enough she might fall in love with someone elseeven pelenal he winced away from the idea of forcing a maiden to wed because shed been betrothed to him in her cradle how could any good come out of such a bad bargain gel is right i should leave it up to mother he decided with a slight sinking of his heart and a contradictory feeling of relief ill tell her so at dinner that should make her so happy shell let us besiege her very bower if we want as lynder replenished the goblet of cool water at kyrtians right hand the young lord soaked until the aches in his tired sore muscles eased hed have remained in the bath until he was in danger of falling asleep if not for two factors his stomach complained that it hadnt gotten anything but water for some time and he knew his mother was waiting for him to have dinner with her and out of politeness would not touch a morsel until he appeared servants sent off for a platter of fingerfoods would have taken care of the hunger but he was not going to be rude to his mother it isn t wise to be rude to ones mother she knows everything about your childhood that is potentially embarrassing reluctantly he stepped up out of the water dripping onto the marble floor and waved off another attentive servant taking the soft snowy towel the lad held out to him wrapping the towel around himself he returned to his bedroom to find clothing laid out over a stand and waiting for him to don this clothing had been selected by lynder to complement whatever his mother was wearing for dinner it was a small gesture but one that his mother appreciated and it only cost a little extra attention on the part of the servants such attention was no burden to them for she was as beloved to her staff as she was to her son to his relief the waiting clothing was casual a comfortable tunic and trews of heavy amber silk with a simple geometric design in bronze beadwork trimming the collar and belt that meant his mother was in a casual mood in fact with any luck she had arranged to dine on the balcony outside the lesser diningroom where they could watch their human dependents dancing and listen to their music he knew because she had told him that other elvenlords generally chose to dine amid selfcreated fantastic settings built of illusion a simpler version of the illusions hed seen at the few elven gatherings and fetes he had attended he had never been able to fathom why they would wish to do such a thing how boring must it be surrounded by something so utterly controlled in which one knew to the moment exactly what would happen he preferred real weather real sunsets and the spontaneity of live performers but then hed never cared much for even the most elaborate of illusions far preferring the beauties of the real world to gossamer fantasies even his suite held a but single illusion to bring the outdoors that he loved inside regardless of weather or season he had created an ethereal forest glade and waterfall illuminated in a perpetual twilight in the corner of his sitting room this illusion opened his suite and made the room seem to extend far beyond the actual walls he could easily have had a real waterfall put in but that would have made the sitting room rather more humid than he liked the three rooms of his suitesitting room study and bedroomwere otherwise all as they had been built grey carpet white walls and ceiling simple unornamented furnishings with frames of pale birchwood and fat cushions in greyblue greygreen and slategrey sourceless gentle light bathed the rooms but could be extinguished with a single commandmagic yes but hardly illusion he donned the soft comfortable silk garments slipped on a pair of buttery leather indoor boots and belted the tunic with a matching sash after a quick glance at himself in a mirror to ensure that he had not forgotten anything he set out for the diningchambers leaving the servants to clean up behind him the same sourceless light as brightened his rooms illuminated the hallways whose only ornaments were small tables placed at intervals against the wall he noted with approval that now that it was summer someone had replaced the statues that had stood on each table with arrangements of flowers which gently scented the air without being cloying so much better than all the incense and heavy perfumes hed encountered in the few other manors hed occasionally visited his mother made life here into an art form something that appeared effortless and was anything but it required a small army of their faithful servants working in careful harmony to achieve the simple effects that others created with illusions as he approached the dining chambers the light subtly changed growing warmer in tone and the flower arrangements here were no longer made up of blooms of white and pale pastels but of richer colors this was clearly the work of his mothers hand and mind the impression now created was that of cheer and welcome and he noted proudly that once again it was accomplished without the use of a single illusion lynder waited patiently outside the door of the lesser diningchamber confirming kyrtians guess that he and his mother would be dining without the company of any of the other elves of the estate lynder opened the bronzeedged door for him and he passed through with a nod of thanks subdued lighting and an empty table greeted him and the open casement door to the balcony beyond beckoned him onward out on the alabaster balcony a pair of bronze lamps gave just enough light to be useful without being obtrusive a servant with a cart laden with covered dishes waited beside a small table flanked by two chairs his mother rose from the furthest of these as he stepped onto the balcony and held out her hand to him with a welcoming smile vdyll lydiell lady prastaran was not the most beautiful of elven women her green eyes were a touch too shrewd her cheekbones too sharply defined her mouth at once too generous and too sardonic her winglike eyebrows too inclined to arc upwards in wry amusement her figure was too slight to be called generous and too muscular to be called delicate in fact she was a notable dancer and athlete and she was too tall for the current fashion with fully as much height as her son tonight her moonpale hair was caught at the back of her head in a single practical knot only relieved by three strands of bronze moonstone and amber beads threaded onto slender locks of hair behind her left ear her clothing was virtually identical to her sons except that she wore a divided skirt instead of trews she followed no fashions and set none she was a law unto herself and as such fit the prastaran estate and clan perfectly kyrtian took her hand dropped a filial kiss on it and assisted her back into her seat before taking his own he sniffed appreciatively at the savory scents arising from the first dish as the servant uncovered a thick soup and offered it for their approval lydiell took the ladle herself and measured out two porcelain bowls full ive already quizzed lynder so i know that you beat gel she said with amusement and i also know that he managed to kill you in the process of beating him a rather dubious victory dont you think i suppose it would depend on whether you were the captain who was killed or the general who sent him kyrtian pointed out my imaginary superior would have no reason to be unhappy about the outcome of our battle lydiell made a little grimace of distaste your notsoimaginary relations would either be very grieved or very pleased if your demise had been genuine she countered your obnoxious cousin aelmarkin in particular kyrtian knew what was coming and this time decided to preempt the little speech about his duty to the legacy left to him by his father my obnoxious cousin in particular is going to be very wnhappy as soon as you finish the project id like you to undertake ladymother he interrupted tapping her hand playfully with his index finger i want you to go hunt me out a couple of suitable females so i can make a selection for a bride id likely only bungle the job you however will manage it brilliantly lydiell stared at him with her mouth slightly open her eyes wide and her eyebrows arched as high as they would go are you serious she demanded are you really ready to wed she didnt say at last but she didnt have to he shrugged as ready as i am ever likely to be and with all the unrest about it would probably be better to get it over with before it becomes impossible for you to travel around to find me someone lydiells expression assumed a faint cast of guilt i swore to your father i would never pressure you into marrying someone for whom you had no affection she began and and you arent going to now he replied firmly ive just gotten over the expectation that the perfect woman will somehow drop out of the sky on gossamer wings emerge nixielike from the river or materialize spiritwise out of the forest and make me fall into passionate love with her a girl who wont become a risk for us is far more important and youre the best judge of that so far as my own needs are concerned someone i can tolerate over breakfast will do nicely if we have some things in common so that we dont baffle or bore each other better still he put his hand over his mothers as it rested on the table and he felt it tremble to my mind it is far more important that she feel love and affection for you my lady if you found a wife whom you loved but who didnt care for me i could always retire to the dowagerhouse she began bravely but he shook his head i know grandmother loved the dowagerhouse and retired there because she found too many memories in these halls but that wont be the case for you i couldnt care for anyone who drove you out of your own home so i rely on you to find me someone sensible i will be happy with safety sense and intelligence in that order now he continued seeing the light in her eyes and deciding to take advantage of the situation gel and i want to stage another holidaybattle and we thought wed have a siege of the dowagerhouse instead of the usual woodsbattle or fieldmelee do you think we could arrange that as surely as if he had the human magic for reading thoughts he knew she was engrossed in running over the various matrimonial possibilities in her mind and that the moment he had said gels name she dismissed the rest of the sentence as irrelevant to the allimportant task of matchmaking oh certainly she said absently allowing the servant to take away her soup and serve her a portion of baked eel a dish she normally never touched she ate it too taking dainty but rapid bites all of her thoughts occupied with more important things than food he grinned to himself and devoured his own portion without further comment congratulating himself on his clever maneu ver hed gotten her approval of the siegewhich she would belatedly remember some time late tonight as she went over the dinner conversation in her mind by that time it would be too late to retract the approval and it hadnt cost him anything other than something hed already made up his mind to do satisfaction gave him a hearty appetite and he enjoyed every bite of his dinner down below the balcony the lawn stretched out in a plush velvety slope for some distance before it flattened out and became the village green shared by all of the human servants who had earned cottages in the manorvillage surrounded by lanterns suspended from stands plunged into the turf it was brilliantly and festively illuminated the green served as fairgrounds dancefloor and feasttable in fine weather and it served the latter two purposes tonight the warriors victorious and defeated both celebrated at long wooden tables that had been carried out from their barracks other servants and fieldworkers their dinners long over slowly came by groups of two and three to join the fun festive torches burned brightly at either end of each table and a little band of musicians had set up at the far end and played raucous dancingtunes that were unlike anything ever heard at an elven celebration kyrtian rather liked human music himself and he knew his mother was amused by itbut to compare human to elven music would be like comparing a noisy forest stream to an illuminated watersculpture they were both made of moving water but with that all resemblance ended gel and a dozen others had already finished their dinner and found themselves partners and were dancing with great enthusiasm and abandon if not skill from the rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes of the girls none of the partners were inclined to complain if their toes got trodden on occasionally kyrtian finished his meal in silence and settled back in his chair with a glass of wine watching the swirl and chaos of the everincreasing crowd of dancers about your obnoxious cousin lydiell murmured unexpectedly startling him what about him kyrtian replied glancing at her he doesnt want to visit again does he i thought wed managed to cure him of that after the last time lydiell winced it almost cured me of wanting to stay here she said shuddering if id had to sit through one more evening of youjroning in that flat voice youd have made erotic poetry unbearably dull with that voice kyrtian grinned i thought the monotone went with the subject matter you can thank gel for that by the way i had no idea he knew so much about the tactical importance of camp supply and sanitation by the time he was done filling my head with the information i could have written a monograph on the subject remind me to have him served a nice dish of live scorpions she said with a touch of exasperation he might have taken care to recall that i was going to have to endure that evening too but to go back to the subjectno your cousin aelmarkin has no intention of visiting evidently however he does want to make up for trying to disinherit you oh really kyrtian felt his eyebrows rising in an imitation of his mothers most sardonic expression how fraternal of him what exactly does he want lydiells face gave no hint of her feelings he wants you to visit hes invited you to aa gathering of sorts lord marthien and lord wyvarna are settling their dispute at his estate kyrtian was unpleasantly surprised two great lords are settling a feud and aelmarkin wants me there whatever for lydiell shook her head i dont know she replied sounding honestly perplexed perhaps he has decided he should change his behavior in the hope youll forget his petition or forgive it at least kyrtian made a sour face perhaps he just wants to show the great lords that im as crazed as my father after all i have the same obsession with the past that father did hes probably hoping ill start droning about evelon history or asking if any of them have ancient books in their libraries that i could have copied darthenian wasnt crazed lydiell said softly and neither are you it isnt madness to be concerned about the pastits madness to try and pretend it never happened look at the situ ation the great lords have createdat war with their own sons if they had remembered the past and the feuds that sent us fleeing evelon in the first place they might have avoided this tragedy i sometimes wonder if it isnt a little mad to pursue the past so relentlessly kyrtian replied his mood suddenly shadowed why else would father have disappeared lydiells cheeks flushed delicately with anger but she did not give rein to it why else she asked and answered the question herself forcefully a combination of dedication and bad luckor perhaps the acquisition of a ruthless enemy i dont know what darthenian was hunting when he vanished my love for he kept it a secret even from me but i do know that it was important and potentially very powerful that made the secret a dangerous one and that was why he kept it from me it is possible that he met with an accident it is also possible that someone besides me took him seriouslyand wished to learn what he knew or prevent him from discovering anything that might have given him an edge in the endless jostling for power are you suggesting that he wasmurdered kyrtian asked slowly it was something that had never occurred to him lydiell sighed i dont know it is possiblebut i cannot even guess at how likely it is i have never seen or heard anything to allow me to dismiss the idea or that confirmed it her expression was haunted by that very uncertainty nevertheless let others remember him as an unstable dabbler for delving into the oldest of our recordsi know better and so should you kyrtian immediately felt ashamed and bent his head in mute apology and i should not allow the views of vkel aelmarkin erlord tornal to shade my opinion of even so trivial a question as wine selection much less anything important he frowned ive half a mind to turn his invitation down its come too quickly on the councils decision and aelmarkin is nothing if not persistent he surely has something planned as an attempt to embarrass me but lydiell shook her head that you mustnt do he has more political power than you and he could make things diffi cult if you offend him do you really want to waste your time countering his petty nastiness with the council when you could avoid having to do so by attending his gathering kyrtian sighed knowing with resignation that he was going to have to go and play the fool to keep aelmarkin happy not really when is this farce scheduled in three days lydiell told him and patted his hand comfortingly cheer up she offered its only for an afternoon how hard can it be to maintain your composure for an afternoon how hard can it be to maintain my composure for an afternoon kyrtian asked himself savagely as he glared down at the sands of the arena to avoid meeting any more contemptuous or amused glances harder than getting the better of gel in a swordbout thats how from the moment hed stepped out of the portal into aelmarkins manor hed realized two things the first lydiell had been absolutely right if he hadnt shown his faceand his sanityat this function aelmarkin would have been able to say whatever he liked and be believed the second it was going to stress his patience and his acting ability to the limit to put up with the attitude of every other guest that aelmarkin had invited he had never felt so utterly outofplace in his life why he had more in common with the humans of his estate than he did these strange creatures of his own race a great many of them were approximately his agemuch younger than aelmarkinthe idle offspring of great lords who didnt care to attend this particular challengefight themselves but wanted to send representatives of course this meant that he was surrounded by those with little to do except chatter about others of their set current fads useless pastimes and new fashions the people of their social set were people he didnt know anything about and the pursuits they found so importantwell he couldnt imagine why anyone would waste time on such things but in their eyes he was clearly impossibly backward outofstep and provincial none of them knew anything about any of the subjects he cared about which made him sound both a bore and a boor and after hed shown a flicker of startlement at statements he considered outrageous they probably put him down as callow and a prig well by their standards i am a prig i dont consider an afternoon spent in having my jaded appetites aroused by poor human girls who only exist to serve as my concubines to be particularly amusing after the first hour they snubbed him openly and with unveiled contempt this strangely enough made him very uncomfortable he hadnt expected them to make him feel that way he could try to tell himself that these people didnt matter that all he had to do was remain polite and comport himself like a gentleman and nothing they reported back to their fathers would do any harmbut that didnt make the sneers and the sniggering any easier to bear he didnt like them but they were many and he was one it was all too easy to feel the hurt of the scorned outsider he truly hadnt anticipated that sort of reaction from himself and he wished there was a way he could gracefully extricate himself and go home as he stared fixedly down at the woodenwalled arena below him he heard whispers behind him and snickering and felt the back of his neck grow hot he was just glad that gel was here with him in the role of bodyguard somehow it was easier to stay composed with gels stonefaced example to copy im on their choice of ground the best i can hope to do is get out of this without making any major blunders mother couldn t possibly have known how slippery this situation could become he was acutely aware that they had far more experience than he at the maneuvering of intrigue and politics he felt horribly young shallow and naive these people had drunk machination with their first milk and he had no idea how to deal with situations they wouldnt even hesitate over kyrtian had taken a seat in the first row to avoid meeting their eyes any longer but they continued to speak to each other in voices pitched for him to overhear taunting him to respond who exactly is this fellow asked an arrogant young male a little to kyrtians left my cousin kyrtian aelmarkin said lightly son of the late lord darthenian my uncle lord darthenian someone murmured behind him that name sounds familiar dont i know it from some old story or other try coupling the name with daft drawled another sounding so smug that it was all kyrtian could do to keep from standing up and going for the fellows throat daft darthenian pothunter excavator of things better left buried and pursuer of useless old manuscripts missing in pursuit of same and presumed dead oh decades ago now ferahine theres nothing wrong with having a hobby replied aelmarkin in a tone so tolerant that kyrtian clenched his hands on the armrests of his chair to keep himself in his seat isnt insectcollecting as silly ive seen you send slaves out bobbing about in fields and forests with a net and a bottleand all those boxes of dead beetles are just as useless as unreadable manuscripts point taken still hobbies are all very well aelmarkin said the drawler but no gentleman and no sane fellow goes off himself to dig up nasty old discards in parts unknown now does he i certainly dont go rambling through briars with nets and bottles thats what slaves are for and he went out alone too why that was simply insane if you ask me kyrtian gritted his teeth he knew he was meant to overhear all of this he knew they were trying to provoke him and they were only saying in his hearing what they told each otherand what their elders said if he just kept his temper he would learn a great deal if they thought he was too dull to understandor too cowardly to respondwhat possible harm could it do still it was the hardest thing he had ever done to sit there and let strangers abuse the memory of his own father without challenging them alone exclaimed the first speaker why didnt he take slaves if he wouldnt send them to do his hunting for him aelmarkin admit it he must have been deranged there was an audible rustle of fabric marking aelmarkins careless shrug he was always secretive about these hunts of his and never more so than on the last one he was hunting the site of the great gate that brought us from evelon and the things that were discarded as useless because they no longer functioned after passing the gate why i havent a notion yes well its obvious he was an obsessive at the very least said the drawler dismissively and judging from the disaster of a conversation i had with kyrtian yonder obsession runs in the family blood all the poor fool can talk about is military matters history tactics battles no one cares about a sneer crept into the drawl as if anyone would ever give the likes of him command over so much as a squad of latrinediggers by now kyrtians neck burned his cheeks were nearly the same temperature and his jaw and shoulders ached with the strain of tightlyclenched muscles he gladly would have given half his possessions for the opportunity to come at any of those foppish fools in barehanded combat and thats just what they expect from you he reminded himself trying mentally to throw a little cold water on his overheated temper they think you re an atavistic barbarian and they may very well be waiting for you to stand up and attack them physically they would have the right to challenge you or bring you up in front of the great council and that beyond a shadow of a doubt was what aelmarkin wanted him to do for such an attack would prove to everyones satisfaction that he kyrtian was just as mad as aelmarkin claimed in his petition an elvenlord and a gentleman did not settle differences handtohand an elvenlord and a gentleman issued a proper challenge and settled it as this feud was being settled i have to keep my mouth closed and my eyes open and find out just how these things work he told himself vehemently so that if i get a chance i can arrange for these fools to eat their words without salt beside him gel stood at wary attention as impassive as any statue and as invisible to these fools as any other bodyguard gel had heard every word toobut you would never know it by looking at him copy gel he told himself stay quiet if not calm wait and watch he knew only that these feuds were settled in trialbycombat using slaves as proxies if his fighters were bettertrained than these then it might be worth dealing with these dolts in a way they ii understand abruptly conversation behind him ceased as some signal he didnt recognize warned the idlers that the combat was about to begin abruptly caught up in spite of himself kyrtian leaned forward with the rest as the light in the arena brightened and the lights above their seats dimmed two bronze doors one at each end of the arena and decorated with hammered images of armored fighters opened onto the sands of the arena two lines of heavilyequipped fighters paced through them moving ponderously into the light there were fourteen of these humans in all seven to each side one set was armored in pale green with a winged serpent badge in brilliant blue on their breastplates and shields the other in emerald green with the badge of a rearing alicorn in white the armor was impressive the men inside it were less so kyrtian studied each of the fighters minutely weighing and measuring their general strength noting the kinds of weapons each man carried he assumed that gel was doing the same ancestors came another whisper from behind what can be so fascinating about a handful of fighters is he so provincial that hes never seen gladiators before kyrtians neck burned again for a moment but he calmed himself quickly with something before him to study and analyze he finally managed to think of his own situation in terms of tactics rather than emotions most of them are taking me for a provincial boor but those are the ones who are ignoring me the comments might be coming from those who are suspicious of methinking that the provincial fool might just be a pose they would be trying to prod me into either doing something typical of a foolsuch as lose my temper and insult them backor to do or say something that will give them more information about what im really here for if i do neither ill confuse them further its even possible that aelmarkin is behind the prodding the possible number of plots and counterplots going on behind his back made him feel dizzy and these strangers seemed even more alien to him how did they do it how could anyone live like that spending most of every day in guarding against treachery and the rest in planning treachery it would drive him mad in no time he could not imagine how they coped with the constant paranoia perhaps that is why they spend so much time in debauching themselves only by immersing themselves in pleasure can they relax for a few moments if that was sohe felt suddenly sorry for them but not too sorry the best weapon he had to use against them was the uncertainty he represented the very fact that he was unknown no matter what aelmarkin had told them they probably wouldnt really believe it until they had proved for themselves what he was they would tend to judge him against the standard of their own behavior what would one of them do in a situation similar to his play the fool try and find an ally probably look for an ally or a protector hopefully by doing neither he had confused them further he wished he could talk openly to gel of all the times he needed advice then again gel might not have any better notion of how to handle these effete creatures than he did well others have mistaken my caution for a lack of imagination in the pastso perhaps that is what is going on now i can only hope so it will make them underestimate me further all he really knew was how such situations would have been handled in the far past as recounted in the history books he spent so much time perusing in the days of long ago there had been less time and leisure for long plots and political machination the elvenlords of old had dealt with problems with their own kind in ways that human barbarians would find perfectly familiar if one of the first lords chose to deal with the insults instead of tamely accepting them he would have called his enemy out for a duelbymagic that makes a satisfying fantasy these days as wellproviding you picture yourself as the winner rather than the loser in law that was still an option but it was one that very few ever took anymore more than ninetynine times out of a hundred insults were answered and arguments settled by proxy in the arena at the hands of human gladiators like the ones below hardly fair since clearly someone whose means were limited couldnt afford to keep and train as many fighters as someone of greater rank and power but someone of greater rank and power would also be much stronger in magic than a lesser lordso it wouldnt make a great deal of difference to the outcome whether it was settled by combat or magic duel its even possible for someone with weak magic to become wealthy enough to afford firstquality fighters or to gain an ally with access to such fighters but nothing increases the power of the magic that someone is born with i suppose combatbyproxy is marginally more fair than combatbymagic it wouldnt be quite as viscerally satisfying though i wonder how id fare if i decided to challenge one of the charmers behind me to a magic duel have any of them even bothered to practice and train their power there was no way of judging how strong they were by the way they were acting and he really didnt know how strong his magic was in comparison with theirs going into such a challenge blind would be the stupidest thing he could do he didnt use magic except when there was no way to accomplish something without it he really didnt have much use for illusions so hed never really practiced them but there was no reason why even an illusion couldnt be used as a weapon other elvenlords seemed to waste a great deal of power on outward appearancesfor instance as aelmarkin had turning his manor into an impossible confection that hardly resembled a dwelling at all but was that the waste that it seemed to be is it a kind of bluffor even a way of demonstrating power without the risk entailed by combat for a moment he felt a flicker of concern that he hadnt done likewise should he have created an opulent illusory costume like theirs what would these people think if they saw his unadorned home did they think him weak and of little account because he didnt create and maintain fantastic illusions it doesn t matter he told himself quickly no one ever comes to visit who needs to be impressed and im not the only one here wearing ordinary clothing he reminded himself that his status and that of his family remained securebecause they produced what others needed and they had no power that anyone else coveted it was a reassuring thought and one that calmed his newborn concerns he wanted to look harmless and inconsequential hed nearly forgotten that he wanted people like these friends of aelmarkin to underestimate him and his family he gave himself a mental shake these people were contaminating himhe hadnt been among them for even half a day and already he was thinking about challenges and status worrying because they thought he was a provincial insular bumpkin so what if they did that was what kept him and his safe let them jockey with each other he reminded himself let them ignore us as long as they consider us politically insignificant but too useful to disturb we ii remain secure and safe unless of course the family holdings looked so prosperous that they became a choice plum ripe for picking certainly aelmarkin thought so was it possible that some other more dangerous opponent would come to share that belief perhapsperhaps he ought to consult with lydiell when he returned home maybe it was time to create a few carefullycrafted bluffs lydiell was clever surely she would be able to concoct an excuse for kyrtian to demonstrate his powers in such a way that would make it appear that kyrtian had incredible ability or at least that he had enough magical power to make challenging him more costly than the prize was worth something to make it appear that it isn t worth upsetting the way things are now thats what we need something to show that there is nothing to be gained and a great deal to be lost in a direct confrontation it might be all to his advantage that most conflicts were settled in the arena he knew for certain that in strength and agility his own worst fighters were the equal of even the best of the fighters down there on the sandand were superior to most of the men waiting to fight if it came to a challengematch like this one kyrtian was confident that his side would not lose that realization made him relax a little really he was worrying for no reason as long as issues were settled by human gladiators like those below him he had nothing to fear in fact the more he studied those fighters the more confident of that fact he became it was odd those gladiators all seemed a good bit younger than he would have expected this was an important match or so he had been led to believe so why werent the two antagonists fielding their older more experienced gladiators what is it that gel says experience and duplicity will overcome youth and energy every time he had managed to lose track of what the gossips behind him were chattering about while he mulled over his own situation and studied the combatants when he turned a fraction of his attention back to them he discovered they were placing bets on the outcome not only of the whole combat but on the fortunes of individual fighters mildly intrigued he eavesdropped without shame you must know something if youre betting that high the drawler said suspiciously dont take the bet galiath hes too confident i think he bribed the trainers to tell him something nonsense he doesnt know anythinghes just bluffing and ive wanted a chance to get that horse for ages replied a new voice one that kyrtian thought was slurred just a little with drink ill take that bet your racehorse against my redhaired concubine and two jeweled armlets that the one with the two swords draws first blood before hes marked it took a moment for the sense of what they were saying to sink in and when it did he felt a little sick the idea of equating the value of a human with that of a horseno as less than that of the horse it hit him with the force of a blow to the stomach just how foreign their way of thinking was to his hed known it intellectually of course but this was the first concrete example hed witnessed up until now aelmarkins slaves hadnt behaved any differently than his own servants at their most discreet i truly am the alien here if they knew how we treat our humans they wouldn t hesitate for a moment to bring us all down he would be considered a traitor to his race and worse than the wizards and the wild humans he had to remember to keep his guard up the two feuding parties finally arrived with great fanfare at exactly the same moment with each of the elvenlords came an entourage of glittering fancifullycostumed hangerson there were box seats at either end of the arena directly above the two doors that had disgorged the combatants those boxes were now occupied by the newlyarrived lords and their entourages kyrtian found that he could not for the life of him remember their names and housesnot that it really mattered to him he would if he was introduced later congratulate the winner and be properly sympathetic to the loser it wasnt likely though that aelmarkin would make such an introduction unless he thought he had a way of making kyrtian lose face how they took their seats and in what order was clearly as choreographed as an elaborate ritual neither of the lords wished to be seated first and there was much arranging of the chairs and jockeying of seating before the two great lords sat at precisely the same moment they glared at each other across the span of the arena before turning away with studied indifference to speak with a companion now aelmarkin as host stood up kyrtian caught the movement out of the corner of his eye and turned j ust enough so that he could watch his cousin without being obvious about it most noble lords aelmarkin said his smooth and impersonal words carrying effortlessly above the whispers of those seated all around him you have determined to settle your differences in trialbycombat and have accepted my offer to host this venture are you still of the same mind to accept the outcome of this combat as the settling of your feud he of the azure serpent replied with a gruff aye while he of the white alicorn simply nodded very well aelmarkin said calmly let the record show that both agree to be bound by the outcome here below us let all who ye assembled here so bear witness we so bear witness came a chorus of voices some indifferent sxjme full of tense excitement a hush came over them all whispers and movement stopped so profound was the silence that the slightest rustle of fabric came as a shock as if this had been a signal the fighters below tensed aelmarkin surveyed the two opposed lines of fighters for a moment an odd smile on his lips very well he said at last into the stillness begin kyrtians full attention immediately turned to the arena the two lines of fighters leapt at each other hurling themselves across the sand to meet in a clangor of metal and harsh male shouts the noise echoed inside the arena making kyrtian wince involuntarily added to the noise of fighting was the clamor of shouts and cheers behind him and to either side of him as the onlookers cheered the combatants on kyrtian was still trying to figure out how aelmarkin intended to score this combat when the swordsman nearest him managed to beat down his opponents guard and laid open the others swordarm from shoulder to wrist with a single blow the rnan screamed and dropped to his knees a torrent of shockingly scarlet blood pouring from the wound into the sand as his blade fell from his slack fingers for one moment kyrtian was startled by how realistic the wound wasthen he realized that it wasnt realistic it was real he felt as if someone had rammed him in the midsection and knocked all the breath out of him he started to shake as a wave of sick horror twisted his throat and stomach its realits real theyre trying to really kill each other they re dying and all so a couple of idiots can settle an argument senselessuselessinsane then strangely it all dissolved under a flood of blinding rage he lost caution lost focus lost everything except the will to make it all stop he rose abruptly to his feet no he shouted spreading his arms wide his voice somehow carrying above the noise of combat his powers leaping to answer his will poured out an angry and violent burst of magic tore out of him it flung the combatants to their own sides of the arena and dropped every man in the arena to his kneesexcept the injured one who was frantically trying to close his gaping wound with his good hand the sudden silence heavy with anger seemed louder than his shout for a moment no one movedno one seemed able to believe what he had done then in an instant both of the great lords turned to stare at him with an anger as overwhelming as his kyrtian felt the weight of that anger all of it directed solely at him and came to his senses with a start this might have been a tactical error the lord of the white alicorn was the first to rise from his seat there was lightning in his gaze and thunder in his voice as he addressed not kyrtian but his cousin aelmarkin the elvenlord said enunciating each syllable with care i trust you did not anticipate this aelmarkin also rose and his voice fairly dripped apology and concern good my lord i assure you i had no idea that my cousin would indulge in such bizarre behavior i do apologize i would never have invited him if kyrtian who had been staring down at the wounded fighter now being aided by one of his companions felt fury overcome his good sense again he swung around to face his cousin twisting his lips into a snarl a red haze settling across his vision bizarre behavior bizarre i call it sanitystopping utterly senseless and wanton waste what waste shouted the other feuding lord furiously the ice in his voice freezing kyrtians words in his throat waste what do you know of waste you impudent puppy you provincial idiot who let you in among civilized beings i i apologize again my lords aelmarkin protested waving his hands about frantically please take your seats and the combat can resume resume resume at that kyrtians rage sprang to full and insensate life again and grew until it was beyond anything he had ever felt before he went cold then hot then cold again and a strange haze came over his vision havent you heard a word ive said this idiocy will not resume not while im standing here that can be remedied muttered someone as gel finally put a calming hand on kyrtians arm kyrtian had the sense not to throw it off but he was quite ready at that moment to snatch up a sword himself and take them all on singlehanded dont back down gel muttered but get hold of yourself think fastif you cant salvage this situation were going to have three feuds on our hands two with them and one with aelmarkin aelmarkin was so angry he could scarcely think when hed invited that fool kyrtian here hed hoped the puppy would make some sort of blunder that would prove he was as foolish as aelmarkin claimed well hed blundered all rightbut hed managed to do it in such a way that now aelmarkin was potentially in as much trouble as he was how had he managed to stop the combat where did he get all that magic power to the desert with that how am i going to save myself this was nothing short of a disaster the amount of status he stood to lose over this debacle was incalculable this might even cost him his council seat please my lords he said entreatingly to his two furious guests my young cousin has never seen one of these exhibitions before and exhibitions aelmarkin blinked at the tone of kyrtians voicea moment ago it had nearly cracked with strain and kyrtian was clearly a short step from losing control entirely suddenly nowthe anger was still there but it was controlled anger and overlaid with calculated scorn worthy of an experienced councilor he turned to see that kyrtians face was now a carefully haughty mask could kyrtian actually salvage this situation exhibitions kyrtian repeated is that what you call these senseless slaughters his lip curled in what was unmistakably a sneer i suppose if your idea of sport is to take tame pets and line them up for targets then you could call something like this an exhibition but i certainly wouldnt dignify this idiocy with such a term aelmarkin saw with hope that the two feuding lords had forgotten all about him kyrtians declaration and attitude had caused them to focus all of their insulted rage on him i suppose its too much to expect you to answer that statement of utter nonsense with anything like a challenge asked lord marthien his voice dripping with sarcasm yes it is kyrtian replied answering sarcasm with arrogance because your fighters are no match for mine you would lose before the combat began that is why i say this is senseless the least of my fighters has four years of combat experiencethe best of yours cant possibly have more than one no less than one since i doubt your men ever survive even that long that arrogance took them rather aback lord wyvarna glanced at aelmarkin as if asking for confirmation of the astonishing statement aelmarkin made a slight shrug and are we supposed to accept this bluff at face value impudent puppy lord wyvarna demanded to their astonishment kyrtian laughed albeit mirthlessly you would be wise to since it is hardly a bluff he replied consider what you already know about me and myhobby consider that i have very little to do except train and drill my fighters in every possible style and manner of combat and that i do not and never have sold any of them for any price consider that i have been doing this every day for the past ten years at least personally overseeing the training and practice in every aspect meanwhile what have you been doing entrusting the training and practice of your gladiators to others quite without supervision and slaughtering the best of your men in useless exhibitions and what stake do those you entrust with this training have in your success or failure what personal incentive have they to make certain that nothing is left to chance and how many of your gladiators die or are crippled in training for that matter what incentive do your gladiators have to succeed the best and cleverest of them are surely contriving to get themselves mildly crippled in the first week of your socalled training it would seem to me that the very smartest ones the ones who would make the very best fighters would see to it that they were always crippled in training in order to avoid being slaughtered in one of your socalled exhibitions kyrtian cleverly left the questions hanging in the air and now aelmarkin saw a certain wariness creep over the expressions of the two feuding lords and i suppose you have a better idea boomed a new voice both aelmarkin and kyrtian turned to face the new speaker who stood up from among his sons entourage aelmarkin was startled he hadnt realized that lord lyon had come with his son gildor damn has he been there all along or did he just arrive for the combat did i somehow insult him by not noticing him can anything else go wrong here today aelmarkins thoughts scurried after one another like frantic slaves trying to clean up a terrible spill vkel lyon lord kyndrethlord lyon of the great house of kyndrethstood wrapped in a scarlet cloak embroidered with leaping stags his arms crossed over his chest aelmarkin shivered the man was one of the most powerful lords of the great council a vote from lord lyon was worth three from anyone with a lesser council seat the number of allies he hadthe number of people he could make or break with a single word aelmarkin held his breath all his own prayers might be answered in the next few moments if kyrtian insulted lord lyon badly enoughif he convinced lord lyon that he was as insane and unstable as aelmarkin had been claiming elvenborn then before this day was over aelmarkjn might be organizing his slaves for the move to his new properties kyrtian looked at lord lyon a veritable icon of power as if he were no more important than any of the lesser sons and hangerson yes he said simply i have and im quite prepared to demonstrate it here and now in front of you all thats vkel lyon lord kyndreth gel hissed in kyrtians ear kyrtian made the fingersign for i understand but did not look away from the tall powerfullybuilt noble who had addressed him that was one name he definitely recognized and the halfformed plan he had thrown together in an instant of panicridden thinking took on a new importance and urgency if he could persuade lord lyon to use his methods not only in training but in challengematches how many thousands of lives would be spared for if lord lyon decreed it all training and matches would be performed kyrtians way so he turned his halfformed plan into a bluff in fact he continued as calmly as if he spoke the truth i came here hoping to stop this nonsense for all time with such a demonstration really lord lyon looked amused which boded well for kyrtian and how is that i take it you intend a live demonstration and not some illusory shadow show pit one fighter of your choosing against my bodyguard kyrtian said boldly they will use my methods of fighting they will fight to a deathwound but neither will be harmed by the experience you can use the best of your menthe one you would least care to losewithout any fear that harm will come to him and you will be without his services indeed lord lyon looked from one side of the arena to the other wyvarna marthienif i proposed using my bodyguard in this combat would you accept the results of such a duel instead of using your gladiators as settling your dispute the lord of the white alicorn looked sullen the lord of the blue serpent responded first how would we decide which fighter represented which of us draw lots lyon said carelessly i know my man takes secondplace to very few and i hardly think lord kyrtians man is less expert he turned back to kyrtian i agree in principle that this is a waste of fightingstrength the training is expensive and its all gone to waste when a fighter is killedor runs off to join those damned renegade wizards before the current unpleasantness there were no wizards to run off to of course and there was no need to field battletroops but our present situation does call for some changes in our own customs in fact some of the members of the council have even asked openly if it might be wise to outlaw challenges altogether to save the waste of trained fighters he smiled thinly some have even suggested that if challengers are unwilling or unable to conduct duelsbymagic that they should take sword in hand themselves to settle their quarrels astonished mutters and a few gasps followed that announcement and lords wyvarna and marthien looked openly dismayed lord lyon looked down his long aristocratic nose at kyrtian with a hint of sardonic interest kyrtian raised his chin and reminded himself that his lineage was as long and proud as that of the house of kyndrefh how much better then if you can have your challenges without the loss of a single fighting man or spillage of a single drop of blood he demanded maybe your gladiators will stop running off if they know they arent going to be killed in a senseless grudgematch and i know i need not point out to a lord of your experience and wisdom that such training will make better fieldforces than anything our foes can create think of the kind of fighters you will field when you can breed the best to the best then give them real combat experience where they can learn from their mistakes bloodless matches wheres the sport in that someone behind kyrtian muttered kyrtian ignored the commentand ignored the fact that the spectators were leaving one by one grumbling he had lord lyons attention and he was not going to give it up i am well aware that many consider my interest in the past to be eccentric he continued but because of that interest i have learned at least one of the secrets lost when we passed the gate from evelon i know how the ancestors conducted their duelsofhonor and their training sessionshow they taught and practiced combat without pulling blows without using blunted weapons yet without spilling blood didnt it ever occur to you that they must have had some way to learn swordwork themselves without risking hurt after all unlike us here he looked down his nose at the young lords around him with a bland expression they engaged in swordduels themselves and not by proxy their method is what i use to train my own fighters furthermore i give every ablebodied human on my properties a basic training in fightingskills against the day that they may need to defend the manor until my real fighters can come to their rescue he did not say what foe he trained his humans to fighthe figured that lord lyon would assume that he meant the army of the wizards or of the wild humans not an army commanded by his fellows not a flicker of mistrust appeared on lord lyons face only a growing interestand if anyone here had been thinking about the idea of taking his holdings by force that last statement would give them a reason to think better of the plan if all this is true lord lyon turned to a silent blackclad flamehaired human who stayed at his side like his shadow kaethget down to the arena and get some armor and weapons i want to see how this works the human saluted and left lord lyons side jumping down into the arena and walking past the gladiators as casually as if they were statues kyrtian caught gels eye and nodded gel followed him i believe that you will find this well worth your time lord lyon kyrtian said evenly then turned to the feuding parties my lords will you make your choice of combatant there was more grumbling but finally it was settled that lord marthien would be represented by gel and wyvarna by lord lyons man kaeth since it was obvious that there was no longer going to be the bloody spectacle that everyone had planned on no one really wanted to remain any longer and both lords lost most of their entourages leaving only their human bodyguards and one or two other slaves in attendance as for aelmarkins guests they had all departed as well probably returning to the great hall and the food and drink and other pleasures they had abandoned to watch the combat that left only aelmarkin lord lyon and a young erlord who was probably his son a couple of young lords who looked to be friends of his son and kyrtian those who remained seated themselves and waited with varying degrees of impatience for something to happen gel was no stranger to getting into armor quickly and neither apparently was lord lyons redhaired bodyguard both appeared at the same door of the arena a remarkably short time later gel must have told kaeth not to bother about weapons for neither man carried any kaeth looked up at his master who nodded to lord wyvarna kaeth immediately picked up one of the discarded shields stacked at the side of the arena bearing the azure serpent and gel took one of the discarded white alicorn shields weve agreed to longsword and shield master gel called up in a servile voice that kyrtian hardly recognized he suppressed a nervous chuckle and nodded then kyrtian fixed his gaze on a point on the sand at gels feet and concentrated drawing motes of power out of himself and spinning them into the fabric of a pair of his very special blades hed conjured up longswords so many times that it was hardly any effort at all to spin out a mere pair of them the air above the sand misted briefly then shimmered and a pair of fine blades condensed out of the mist as kyrtian felt a slight inward drain of power he looked up to see that aelmarkin was watching closely with a look of intense concentration on his face i wonder if he can follow what im doing has he the talent to read all the special modifications ive made gel gestured to the identical swords and let kaeth pick first the bodyguard picked up the nearest and gave it an experimental swing then rapped his shield with it the shield gave off a perfectly normal metallic clang and kaeth nodded with satisfaction feels like a regulation longsword lord lyon he called up into the viewing stands squinting against the light maybe a bit better balanced than most these blades will act in all respect like a normal battle weapon kyrtian assured the few who were left in the stands but concentrating on lord lyon with a single exception that is they will not cause any physical damage gel please offer your opponent a target gel held out his swordarm with a grin knowing that kyrtian would eliminate the shock of being struck for this part of the demonstration kaeth if you would swing at gel please and cut off his arm lord lyons slave did not hesitate he took a full overhand swing at the arm gel extended for him as lord lyon leaned forward a little with interest the blade passed through gels arm leaving a glowing line and making about half his body glow wounds cause a slight shock to the wounded man to tell him that he has been wounded and the blade leaves a mark that he and any referees can see kyrtian explained there is no other effect on the fighter so struck but for the purposes of scoring there is full attention paid to the realities of battle the longer gel stands there the more of him will glow representing how close he is to death by bloodloss from such a massive wound if he had only gotten a slight wound there would only have been a mark and a shock eventually according to the rules we follow he will glow all over and be forced to retire and if the wound was immediately mortal hed glow all over as well lord lyon supplied yes and he would get a larger quite unmistakable shock kyrtian replied he permitted himself a smile we allow for the heat of combat causing people to forget themselves and the shocks they receive will get their attention he negated the glow with a moments thought and gel shifted his feet in the sand lord lyon nodded thoughtfully and even wyvarna and marthien looked more interested than they had been im sure there are more details that i will want to ask you about later lord lyon said after a moment of silence but meanwhile lets settle this quarrel and have our practical demonstration shall we at this point kyrtian caught a decidedly unfriendly expression on aelmarkins face it was there for only a moment but it reminded him that his cousin was the host of this combat and that kyrtian had done him a fair amount of damage but maybe there was a way to begin repairing that damage or at least doing something to make up for it never make an enemy that you dont have to he reminded himself and never give an enemy you already have another excuse to act against you cousin he said gesturing to the arena as host yours should be the honor aelmarkin looked briefly startled then suspicious but stood up he bowed to the two for whom this entire combat had been arranged lord marthien lord wyvarna will your feud be settled by the outcome of this challenge aye came the replygrudgingly but without much hesitation be it witnessed aelmarkin intoned we so witness came the chorus of kyrtian lord lyon lyons son and a pair of hangerson thinner than before but enough to satisfy custom very well aelmarkin continued as gel and kaeth eyed each other and settled into nearly identical stances begin aelmarkin seated himself and crossed his arms over his chest kyrtian leaned forward to watch what he suspected would be a very fine show there was no rush to combat and clash of weapons this time not with two such seasoned fighters they circled each other warily taking careful measure of each other making tiny feints and gauging the speed of response gel and kaeth were a good match for one another and although aelmarkin leaned back in his seat and looked dreadfully bored lord lyon and the two feuding elvenlords were quickly on the edge of their chairs recognizing the level of skill each man represented kyrtian felt a thrill of pride as he watched gels catlike powerful moves it was obvious that kaeth was an extremely welltrained and probably very expensive slave and regarded gel as his equal in ability when the first exchange came it was sudden kaeth thought he detected a weakness and drove in making gels shield and blade ring with a flurry of blows gel countered successfully and when kaeth sprang back both of them had tiny glowing marks kaeth along the back of his swordhand and gel across his forehead well used to the rules of the game gel did something that surprised kaeth he sprinted backwards out of reach for a moment just long enough to pull a scarf from around his neck and whip it around his forehead kyrtian risked a glance at lord lyon and saw him frown suddenly in puzzlement then just as quickly nod and smile slightly good he understands that if gel hadn t done that the glow would drop over his eye obscuring his vision as blood would without a scarf to stop it hes beginning to understand how complex the rulesmagic is kyrtian abandoned himself to watching the fight able to enjoy it as a demonstration of grace and expertise he noticed that kaeth was grinning just as gel was evidently kaeth seldom found himself with an opponent of comparable ability and without needing to worry about crippling injuries or death had given himself over to the exhilaration and visceral pleasure of such a duel with each exchange of blows one or both of the combatants came away marked but only superficiallyand by the time theyd acquired half a dozen cuts each lord marthien and lord wyvarna were on their feet cheering their representatives on with as much vigor as they would have used if their contest had gone as planned kyrtians own heart was pounding at this point and his fists clenched with excitement it was a terrific combat and he honestly wasnt certain who he wished to see win it kyrtian noticed a pattern in kaeths shieldwork a weakness a tendency to push an oncoming blow to the outside rather than hold up under it that spared the shock to the shieldarm yes but it left him open for a sliding parry under the shield or a feint and a drive straight to the chest if he saw it certainly gel did gel made a little dance to the side another blow towards the shieldbut it wasnt a blow it was a feint and he followed it with a lunge straight for kaeths unguarded throat but kaeth was ready for him the pattern had been a ruse a lure to see if gel would take it he dodged aside moving just enough so that gels blade slid over his shoulder without harming him and slashed up in a vicious gutthrust gel stiffened and burst into glowing light obedient to the rules and his own sense of high drama he toppled over and dropped to the ground dead lord lyon rose to his feet applauding enthusiastically as kaeth saluted him then saluted lord wyvarna who was also on his feet and cheering so for that matter was kyrtian and oddly enough lord marthien by the blood of our ancestors lyon i havent seen a better fight in decades lord marthien shouted as kyrtian banished the weapons and kaeth offered his now free hand to gel to help him up its worth losing the challenge to have seen it he turned his attention briefly to the arena and waved graciously at gel well fought boy i couldnt have had a better champion he gathered up the remains of his entourage and in amazingly good humor led them out kaeth and gel left the arena in a similar state of accord and lord wyvarna made his way to the area of seating where lord lyon still stood clearly in a high flood of euphoria after a moment of hesitation kyrtian followed to join them when he reached them he found them involved in a rehash of the combat but lord lyon broke off when he noticed kyrtians approach well you impudent young puppy you were right and i was wrong wyvarna exclaimed laughing he showed kyrtian a friendly face for the first time since hed entered the arena ancestors that old fool marthien was right for the first time in his lifeeven if id been the one who lost id have thought it was worth it to have seen a fight like that he shook his head and now that he was closer kyrtian realized that wyvarna was much older than he had thought it was often difficult to tell the age of an elvenlord but a hint of lines at the corners of his eyes and a certain sharpening of the tips of his ears indicated that he was older than lord lyon if lord marthien was just as old then ive gotten myself two very wellentrenched allies maybe not as powerful as lord lyon but certainly respected by the council this is coming out better than i dared hope and i think it was just as well that it never came to a challenge with young kyrtian here hmm lord lyon asked slyly given how well his bodyguard foughtwhat must his trained fighters be like kyrtians respect for lord lyon rose a notch hes reminding wyvarna that this could have been very expensiveand hes making sure that wyvarna will spread the word so although i might be considered a dolt im a dolt no one will want to challenge lord wyvarna gave an exaggerated shudder and laughed again damn me if you arent right about that his men would have cut mine to pieces without even breathing hard he clapped kyrtian on the back hard trying to make him stagger kyrtian who had been expecting something of the sort braced himself and stood firm smiling it was a pleasure to show you the secret i discovered my lords he replied blandly of all the things i dislike the most waste is highest on the list and there is no reason other than losses in a real battle to have to replace a gladiator or a fightingslave before his time humans are hardly difficult to breed but it takes time and resources to train them resources that could more sensibly be put to other uses besides if we keep killing the strongest and cleverest of our breedingslaves what do you think well end up with these techniques are quite easy to learn and even easier to apply if you can set a collarspell you can create these training conditions wyvarna gave a half smile and glanced over at lord lyon then i expect well be getting a mandate from the council about using them shortly eh lyon i believe that you can count on that wyvarna lord lyon replied just as blandly as kyrtian wyvarna coughed and then shrugged well times change and the ones who wont change with them are fools he said to no one in particular ill be off marthien will be sending his conciliationparty and i should be there to receive them properly or therell be another feud on my hands with that lord wyvarna turned and led his own entourage out of the arena leaving kyrtian standing beside lord lyon well either you are the cleverest young lordling i have ever seen or the luckiest lyon observed softly i wouldnt have given you any odds of getting out of that situation intact the luckiest my lord kyrtian replied quicklyhoping that he sounded modest i fear that although i had come to this event intending to demonstrate my discovery i made a profound mistake in permitting my feelings to get the better of me initially i am i fear a very provincial fellow and this was the first combattrial i have ever attended and if i offended you with my untutored manner i do apologize for i had no intention of offending anyone and once again he turned to his cousin aelmarkins expression was so bland it could not have been anything other than a mask he was probably still infuriated cousin i must ask your forgiveness for using your premises as the intended venue for my display butwell not to put too fine a point upon it this is the only combatchallenge i have ever been invited to so opportunities have not exactly been thick upon the ground he had no real hope that this would pacify aelmarkin but at least it would make it look as if hed tried i wouldnt worry about it if i were you aelmarkin lord kyndreth told the stonefaced elvenlord with a raised eyebrow i can promise you this little demonstration is only going to reflect to your glory if you like i can even spread it about that you colluded with young kyrtian here to what end my lord aelmarkin asked dryly ah well to a most proper end you are aware of the dreadful wastage of fighters weve had in this campaign against the socalled young lords and i assume given the age and rank of your two main guests you were aware that i would appear at this combat of course you are aware of my keen interest in new methods of training our fightingslaves faster lord kyndreth smiled the smile reminded kyrtian of a large cat with its prey beneath its paw so you decided to help your cousin and yourself at the same time by giving him a venue to demonstrate the fruits of his hobby for me hmm aelmarkins expression remained as bland as cream but he bowed as you say my lord and i am deeply grateful to you no more than i am to you this was clearly a dismissal and aelmarkin took it as such i must return to my guests my lord if i may excuse myself aelmarkin bowed lord kyndreth waved him off and aelmarkin departed the line of his backbone suggested further trouble to kyrtian but that was for the future there was a larger and more dangerous predator in front of him still aelmarkin was a jackal at best lord kyndreth was a lion in truth and not just in name thank you again my lord kyrtian said meaning it hmph lord lyon eyed him as if suspecting further cleverness well i shall be wanting to come visit you within the next few days i want to discuss your training methodsand other things i am at your service lord lyon kyrtian replied stunned i will send a portaltoken to the council hall in your name before he could think of anything else to say the old lord had sketched a brief salute and turned away leading what was left of his entourage off through the exit every trace of the bloody conflict that had preceded gels fight had been cleared away from the preparation room by the time that he and the other lords bodyguard retired to it even the armor was gone all that remained was the presence of the liveried gladiators themselves divided into two tight groups with a careful space between them divested of arms and armor to gels eyes they looked absurdly young barely out of boyhood the two sets of gladiators hovered at a respectful distance from gel and lord kyndreths man as they took over the preparation room for themselves gel suppressed a smile of amusement there was more than a touch of heroworship in those young faces he and his opponent had not only saved these children from injury and death they had probably put on the most skillful combat the callow lads had ever seen he was just glad that he was going to be able to return to his own estate and get away from all those admiring eyes as gel followed kaeth jareds example and divested himself of armor clothing and walked naked into the whitetiled watercascade cubicle as if he belonged there he was thoroughly conscious of gratitude for being able to clean up after their strenuous bout with all of the youngsters still watching awefilled eyes glued to him gel was more than a little uncomfortable as he plunged under the warm cascade of water and let it soothe muscles that had been asked to work without a proper warmup he wondered why the other fighters didnt say anything to himor at least to kaeth jared they might not know him but surely they knew kaeth at least by sight well theyve got tongues he told himself as he ducked his head under the steaming water and let it pour down his neck and back if they dont want to use them thats not my problem kaeth jared must have been more used to this odd semifrightened treatment from his fellow humans as he acted on the surface as if the other fighters simply werent there on the surface anyway to gels experienced eyes he moved as if he noted and analyzed every move any of them made however inconsequential that spelled assassin as well as bodyguard to gel which actually made a great deal of sense considering lord kyndreths prominence and the uncertain times there was no telling if the young lords or his own peers might decide to revert to the ancient ways of dealing with an obstacle in the form of another elvenlord who better to guard against assassins than another assassin still it aroused his suspicions in all his lifetime gel had encountered no more than four assassins and he himself was one of them and i wonder if kaeth jared has made the same conclusions about me that i have about him the first had been his own teacher the third had been his teachers teachera succession of trained men to guard the estates lord just in case the fourth had been on the auction block and that particular set of skills hadnt been mentioned in the auction catalog although it momentarily tempted himto have someone else he could trust with his lords safetyhe had said nothing to the seneschal who had been looking for a few choice youngsters to introduce to the freedom of the estate it was a bad idea like his own teacher he would train his own successor there was no telling where that man had been or why he was on the block for a moment gel recalled his teacher with great fondnesshakkon shor had not been gels father but he might just as well have been hed helped raise gel from the moment that gel showed the sort of athletic potential that made him the skilled fighter he was today hakkon hadnt had sons only daughtersnot that one of them wouldnt have served perfectly well as kyrtians bodyguard but none of them took after hakkon in point of fact they were sweetnatured and absolutely oblivious to half of what went on around them now tirith shor whod been hakkons father felt that was just as well but gel knew it had been a great disappointment to the old man that his son wouldnt be the one to stand at the next lords side kaeth jared was an unlikely sort for an assassin if you only saw him clothed tall and slim pale with hair of a dark auburn and long clever hands he didnt look particularly strong if you saw him nude howeveror in combatyou realized that he was a great deal stronger and more agile than he seemed there wasnt an ounce of superfluous flesh on him anywhere and the muscles he had were wire and whipcord tough and powerful gel wondered if the others had noticed kaeth jareds unusual alertness and caution and decided that they probably hadnt they were just ordinary fighters and wouldnt be trained or practiced in such careful observation and deduction they were probably just impressed by the bout that he and gel had completedand perhaps a little stunned at its bloodless outcome part of their awe might very well have been due to the lack of scars on kaeths body and his own in the old methods of training at some point when two fighters met they would covertly read true expertise in martial arts not by the number of wounds collected over the years but by the absence of scarring an unmarked body in their world meant either that ones lord valued one so highly that he granted the use of magic in healing or that a fighters reflexes were so swift and movement so agile that no opponent ever got a chance to land a blow neither he nor kaeth were marred by more than a few trivial lines long healed as gel emerged from the cascade of water and shook his head like a dog he caught kaeth watching out of the corner of his eye kaeth knew hed been caught and unexpectedly grinned you gave me the best bout ive had in a long time friend he said pitching his voice just loud enough to be heard over the sound of the watercascade im impressed so am i gel admitted freely as the circle of silent gladiators strained their ears to hear every syllable either of them spoke and i dont mind saying that if youd had the benefit of lord kyrtians system to train under youd be so much better than me that it wouldnt have been a contest i wouldnt know about that kaeth replied quickly enough to salve gels bruised ego but if im any judge of lord kyndreth hell be using this system of yours before the month is out and if he does every other lord will do the same or be thought hopelessly provincial and outofstep with enough approval behind him he might well mandate this system through the council the encircling men let out a suppressed sigh so that was what they had been waiting to hear and perhaps kaeth had known that gel sympathized such news would be like a reprieve from a deathsentence like by the stars it is a reprieve from a deathsentence i wonder how many of their comrades were killed in training and how many more killed in feudcombat or their masters entertainments now the only thing they ii have to fear is being drafted into the old lords army and sent up against the rebels or the wizards i dare say youre right gel agreed waving his hand in front of the cascade to stop it then reaching for a towel from the rack behind him at that point a servant appeared to summon the gladiators to their respective lords for the return to their home estates and with palpable disappointment the two groups of men filed out of the preparation room kaeth waved his own hand at the cascade beneath which hed been standing and the sound of rushing water was replaced by silence he seized a towel and dried himself then wrapped it around his waist as gel already had and exchanged a wry smile with his companion alone at last he said gel chuckled warily for an assassin this man had a remarkable sense of humor and no reticence about showing it i would hardly have thought my conversation was that entrancing surely hes here by accident assassins are normally sent against key humans in an elvenlords entourage and there was no way of knowing who would be playing bodyguard to kyrtian was there its better than theirs kaeth jerked his head in the direction of the exit door those poor blockheads dont have much to talk about except fighting food and sex if theyd gotten up the courage to speak to us youd have found that out gel raised an eyebrow well theyre young he pointed out as he followed kaeth carefully into the main room and under the old system not likely to get older kaeth retorted getting his clothing off the shoulderhigh shelf beside him and laying it out on a polished wooden bench how olds your oldest fighter gel considered his reply carefully before answering using the opportunity to lay out his own gear as a chance to stall a little if you count retired fighters who could still pick up a weapon in defense of the estatethe oldest just turned seventyeight kaeth was actually taken aback and let out a low whistle as he reached for his trews i dont know that ive ever seen a human that old much less a fighter you mean your lord actually puts his old men out to pasture instead of putting them down great ancestors man how many of these retired fighters have you got im not sure gel replied his suspicions aroused hes asking too many questions hes a trained assassin know he is what if hes targeting kyrtian it was possiblelord kyndreth could be a patron and ally of the obnoxious aelmarkin it might be that he would wait just long enough to learn kyrtians trainingtechnique then eliminate aelmarkins inconvenient cousin in fact he might have been brought to get rid of kyrtian right here and now which was why kyrtian got the invitation in the first place maybe thats why lord kyndreth wants to come to our estate now to get the secret then get rid of kyrtian where there aren t any witnessesand maybe get rid of the lady at the same time by now gel had gotten his second wind and such alarming thoughts only increased his energy and kaeth all unsuspecting had actually turned his back to him if there was ever a time when a trained assassin would be vulnerable this was it gel didnt even pause for a breath he acted he had been bent over tying his boots now without warning he turned his pose into a charge staying crouched over and rushing kaeth shouldering him into the wall facefirst he heard kaeth grunt as he hit the wall but before he could secure the assassin kaeth writhed loose a trifle his reactions were as swift as a serpents and he managed to get himself turned around but not before gel grabbed a wrist in either hand and smashed them into the wall then got his knee up to reinforce his hold now gel had kaeth pinned against the wall with both wrists imprisoned over his head and gels knee in his gut his legs are still free if he can kick my leg out from under me flushed but impassive he stared into gels greyviolet eyes for a long moment as gel waited for him to speak or act his wrists under gels hands showed no sign of tension nor was there any indication that he intended resistance or struggle but that could be a ruse to get me to drop my guard i suppose its too much to ask what prompted thisah rather unexpected action of yours he finally asked mildly a bit out of breath but completely polite in spite of the situation gel glared at him but he didnt drop his eyes i suppose youre going to deny youre an assassin he replied flatly ah the expressionless eyes now reflected understanding and the mouth relaxed a trifle in a faint smile wow i understand you think lord kyndreth has targeted me at youor perhaps your master be at ease friend lord kyrtian is in no danger that i know of other than from his own conniving cousin and youre in no danger at all least of all from me it felt honest gel wanted to believe him but you dont deny youre an assassin gels instincts warred with his intellect his instincts and his senses swore that kaeth was telling the truthhis more cynical mind warned him that this was just a trick still he was very tempted to release the fellow this just didnt seem like a lie hardly since you seem to have caught me as one kaeth replied with a surprising amount of humor although my own lord isnt nearly as observant as you since he is totally unaware of my training i went to him bought at auction after the unlamented death of my old lord still once an assassin as they say the cloak never drops from your shouldersso ill qualify it by admitting for lyon lord kyndreth im an active agent but an inactive assassin nor am i ever likely to let him know of my more esoteric abilities huh slowly carefully gel rocked his weight back onto his own feet and released kaeths wrists just as slowly kaeth dropped his hands from the wall and rubbed then flexed his wrists testing them and just how did you become an inactive assassin look for yourself kaeth reached up and pulled the neck of his tunic open then tilted his chin up so that gel could see his slavecollar clearly it wasnt the seal of lyon lord kyndreth there but that of the deceasedand as kaeth had said unlamentedlord dyran things were beginning to add up the noble lord dyran who trained all manner of slaves in skills best left unexamined and whose estate was broken up and divided among his relatives with what was left going to auction and that was where i saw another assassin that seal couldnt possibly be counterfeited either the fact that he was still wearing dyrans collar meant that hed been claimed after dyrans deathotherwise the new master would insist on having the old collar removed and his own put on gel backed up giving him a little more space interesting my beloved former master kaeth said with a touch of ironic inflection on the word beloved that did not escape gels notice was not the sort of elvenlord to forget the traditions of his ancestors including assassination gel replied evenly kaeth nodded with a dignity that impressed gel in spite of himself even so i was trained from childhood having shown unusual ability for getting into and out of supposedly guarded spaces and places without being caught whether or not you choose to believe me i will say that my training was never employed against elvenlords not that dyran would have hesitated if hed thought he could get away with it gel interjected again kaeth nodded this time with a shrug be that as it may my usual tasks were to act as his intelligence agent which is how i was employed at the time of his demise and not knowing any better that is how my talents were advertised when the estate was broken up and the slaves went to auction as an agent and bodyguard kaeth turned his palms up and shrugged his shoulders again and you of course were under no compulsion to enlighten the auctioneers gel felt a reluctant smile creeping over his lips if this story was true kaeth was a very clever fellow indeed hardly likely he d tell them when it was a lot more likely that the other elvenlords would order him destroyed rather than take the chance of one of their number getting his hands on a trained assassin i dont suppose it ever occurred to you to bolt of course it did kaeth replied and sat down on the bench indicating to gel that he should do the same oh dont worry about anyone overhearing us if there had been anyone listening or watching theyd have been in here the moment you went for my throat i cost kyndreth a very pretty penny and hed take it personally if someone deprived him of my services and this could be a setup but its getting rather too unlikely and complicatedno i think ill go with my instincts and take him at his word naturally it occurred to me to flee to the wizards and the wild humans he repeated butwell learned a few things about these collars that i wasnt supposed to only dyran could compel me magically and once he was dead no other elvenlord can harm me through this collar unless he is dyrans equal or better in power that was a reason to run but dyran was as clever a bastard as his reputation claimedi can still be traced and pursued through the collar and any attempt to take it off will deprive me of my head that was dyrans little failsafe in case anyone ever decided to subvert me gel winced that took powerful magic and it took a particularly cruel mind to think of it so on the whole it seemed better for everyone that i turn myself in as one of dyrans slaves and go up for auction with the rest kaeth concluded with a lazy smile after all i still had the option to bolt if my new master proved unbearable and id be able to plan my escape so that id have a decent chance to get so far away before they discovered i was missing that it wouldnt be worth pursuit at the time of dyrans death i was in a position where that wasnt a possibility what if kyndreth ever finds out from another of dyrans slaves gel began but kaeth interrupted him with a gentle shake of his head its not likely since everyone who ever knew what i was trained for is deadmostly at dyrans hands i might add for just a moment there was a shade of bitterness in his voice but he quickly covered it and of all the old lords frankly kyndreth is the least likely to use an assassin hes powerful enough to do his own dirty work and ruthless enough to enjoy doing so no im out of the business unless for some reason it becomes necessary to reenter it long enough to protect myself on the whole im rather enjoying myself kyndreth treats expensive property well and my duties are light compared to those i had under dyran gel didnt miss the veiled threat in those words but he shrugged them off i dont give a flying damn what you do with your skills as long as youre not targeting kyrtian he couldnt help it a note of fierce protectiveness crept into his voice kaeth blinked slowly and looked deeply and penetratingly into gels eyes for a moment interesting he murmured id heard rumors about lord kyrtians people then he shook his head as if it was no consequence i overhear a great deal as all bodyguards do and kyndreth has the usual failing of our masters that he forgets how much his slaves see and hear i hope you will believe me when i tell you that kyndreths plans are such and so complex that it is unlikely he could ever fit a trained assassin into them with any degree of confidence maybe against the old lords and the lords that havent re volted gel objected but what about the young lords who are still in revolt a bare possibility if they actually developed a leader with enough charisma to make them all work together kaeth admitted but its more likely that cattle will fly before that happens and besides even if he did sons arent so thick on the ground that the victims relatives would be very happy that the errant lad had been eliminated rather than returned to the parental fold he smiled but this time there was no humor in it after all a youngster who has had all thoughts of rebellion neatly wiped from his mind can still function to sire the next generation even if the rest of the time all he does is sit in a corner and drool that shocked gel hed heard rumors that some of the old lords had the ability to tamper with another elvenlords mind and memory but this was the first time anyone had said anything that confirmed what he had privately thought was a rather wild tale he did his best to seem as nonchalant about it as kaeth was however putting it that wayi suppose youre right kyndreth would get no joy from the surviving relatives if he wiped out an heir no matter how they felt about that heir when he was alive he shook his head and allowed his disgust and bafflement to show damn but this is as twisted as ball of snakes how do you make it all out early training mostly now kaeth actually relaxed and for the first time gel saw him drop all of his defensive mannerisms he knew that he was meant to see thatand he instinctively knew that kaeth now trusted him as far as he had ever trusted anyone but himself politics among the elvenlordsits considered a high art sometimes i think its a pity that no one will ever know how accomplished an artist i am but myself gel had to chuckle at that and kaeth smileda real unmasked smilein answer well im a plain man and i tell you now that id rather map battlefield strategy than political strategy any day its cleaner the regret in that voice was so deep that gel could have drowned in it for a moment they both fell silent then kaeth coughed wellbefore lord kyndreth wonders what is taking me so long and summons mewhat can you tell me about this training method of lord kyrtians gel studied his expression and came to an interesting conclusion he approves granted if his master asks what we were talking about this will give him something to feed to him but he also approves of this and wants to know for himself fascinating i wouldn t have thought that an assassin would be interested in preserving lives hes doing something with his magic thats initially complicated to set up but doesnt take a great deal of power gel admitted thats what hes told me anyway not being a lord i dont know the mechanics of it he brooded a moment thinking back to the first time that kyndreth set the spells there are two different pieces of magic involved one to create a weapon that looks and feels real but has no more substance than an illusion and the other that he sets on the fighter that works with the weapon and reacts to what the weapon does senses it you mean kaeth asked his eyes intent i guess thats close as close as anything a human can understand gel licked his lips anyway that second spell is what makes the glow and the shock when youre hit the first time he did it it took him most of the day he says it gets easier as you get used to it and according to him its almost as simple to work the spells on a lot of people as it is to cast them for onehe said something once about giving the magic extra energy and it copies itself for as long as you feed it he laughed with embarrassment that probably sounds stupid but thats the best i can tell you no no it makes sense kaeth told him ive heard them talking about that when they want to create a lot of something like trees or flowersdoing the first one then setting it to copy itself thats how they can tell the difference between the illusion that a really powerful lord creates and one created by an underling you never see a powerful lord making copies in his illusions every tree every flower is different whatever thats the best description i can tell you he pondered a moment then decided to give kaeth some informa tion that should he feed it back to lord kyndreth would be a protection for kyrtian rather than a danger kyrtian has as many regular fighters as any other great lord but i have to tell you all we do is practiceeither in daily drill using his method or in actual battlesimulations thats the regular fighters once a fighter is over forty he goes on lightduty he has some other job but keeps in practicearchery practice mostly though some of them keep their sword and spear work right up to their old standards which means you dont just have gladiators you have an army trained to fight together kaeth pulled on his lower lip and you have a backup corps of those older men interesting only a fool would challenge your lord that was said as a statement not a question good let kyndreth chew on that exactly gel nodded thats because lord kyrtian likes to see how battlestrategy really works rather than just reading about it we work out new combat simulations fairly often because unless someone steps into a hole and breaks a leg or something equally stupid we come out of combat with the same number of fighters we went into it with its a damned good system kaeth agreed finally so good it makes me wonder what the advantage is to lord kyrtian trained fighters could revolt if they put their minds to it gel laughed easily well for one thing there arent any real weapons around where we can get hold of them theyre all locked up in the armory under kyrtians seal so he doesnt have to worry about a slaverevolt kaeths face cleared and he nodded and of course knowing you arent going to get injured or killed makes the men willing to practice he wouldnt have the expense of buying or raising replacements either kaeth sighed in open admiration brilliant strategy especially for someone with no political allies after today no one will dare challenge him to a feud his position is secure against all normal avenues of challenge i would never have thought it given his reputation not exactly bad strategy to make the others underrate him until he was ready was it gel said slyly and kaeth actually laughed gel had the impression now that despite his sinister training kaeth jared was a pretty decent sort and that surprised him more than a little hed always considered assassins to be to be scum actually i suspect most of them are this one thoughwell hes got my respect his thoughts were interrupted by a discreet cough from the door where a pair of young lads in aelmarkins livery stood uneasily your lords the nearest said a tremor in his voice our lords require us kaeth supplied with a nod suddenly the mask dropped over his face and he was all cool surface again remote and unreadable of course immediately gel stood only a fraction behind kaeth who turned and offered his hand it was a pleasure in every sense kaeth said the warmth of his tone belying his lack of expression i would like to meet you again under similar circumstances gel clasped the offered hand solemnly i hope that we can he replied as warmly and i look forward to it and with that they parted as gel followed his guide he wondered what kaeths emotions were he didnt think he was mistaken something had resonated between them maybe not friendship at least not yet he decided as he saw kyrtian waiting up ahead with a sense of relief that the ordeal was finally over but definitely admiration and neither of us wants to ever have to kill the other that has to count for something kyrtian passed through the portal which on aelmarkins side was a great gilded basrelief gate wide and tall enough for a cargowagon to pass through and on the manor side was an ornatelycarved wooden door with a high lintel featuring the family crest he had been in a profoundly thoughtful state of mind from the moment that he had parted with lord kyndreth and gel didnt interrupt his musings by trying to talk to him then again it was entirely likely that gel was too tired to talk which didnt hurt kyrtians feelings in the least longstanding family tradition of caution situated the portal inside a small chamber with walls of stone and a locked door of firetoughened bronze as insurance against an enemy using it to penetrate the heart of the manor invited guests were met here by an escort and let out and the chamber itself would hold no more than ten at the most the key to unlock the door was the presence of a family member or someone else like gel to whom the lock had been sensitized of course it was possible to overpower the escort and open the chamber door that way but the door was guarded every moment of every day and at least one guard would be able to raise an alarm there would be no invasions of the estate through this portalor so it was hoped after all of his studies in military tactics kyrtian was only too aware that a clever commander could think of ways to get past their precautions his only comfort was that most of the elvenlords were not very clever commanders kyrtian parted with gel just outside the portal chamber as the guards tried to pretend they werent eavesdropping well were in for it now he said in mingled pride and chagrin i think this is the highestranked member of the great council to come here since grandfathers day and were going to have to make certain everyone is totally prepared and understands what they need to do the sooner we start preparing the staff and servants for lord kyndreths visit the sooner we can get it over with and then everything can go back to normal and the longer we delay the more we risk an insult dont worry im on it the sergeant said with a wave you go break the news to the lady gel made for the trainingquarters at a trot and kyrtian reflected that the sergeant was probably already five steps ahead of him in planning things and one thing was absolutely cer tain the visit could not take place until every servant on the estate was so wellrehearsed in the appropriate conduct of a slave that nothing would force him to depart from it not insult not punishment and certainly not carelessness those servants closest to kyrtian and his mother would have to be the best actors of the lot which meant that certain of the younger and less experienced houseservants such as lynder would be replaced for the duration with others who had been promoted to other positions or had even retired kyrtian would certainly be doing without most of his personal servants who would be attending lord kyndreth but that was a small price to pay for keeping up the deception that this was a normal elven household all that would be in the hands of gel lady lydiell and lord tenebrinth the seneschal and the sooner he let the last two know what was about to descend on them the better gel was right lord kyndreths visit could not be postponed for long without offending him he paused for a moment to locate both his mother and the seneschal this was no time to waste precious moments hunting for them by ordinary means the merest whisper of magic told him that as was often the case at this time of day tenebrinth was with his mother in the latters office probably going over the household and estate accounts making plans for the next couple of months or dealing with issues of the servants that could not possibly have been better for kyrtians purposes by catching them together kyrtian would only have to go over the prospective visit and the reasons for it once lydiells office was literally at the center of the manor overlooking everything the manor boasted five towers one at each corner and one at the center with the centermost being a good two stories taller than the othersa full twelve stories tall the towers gave the manor a look of delicacy and attenuation that kyrtian found both attractive and amusingly deceptive for the building itself had been constructed to survive a long siege and had been built to withstand siege weapons that for the most part no longer existed lydiells office was a glasswalled room at the very tip of the centermost tower a place that would in war time be occupied by at least four lookouts even in the worst weather it was a snug and welcoming place as the tower was one of the few places in the manor that depended on magic for more than lighting and a decorative illusion or two magic and not mechanical contrivances heated and cooled the tower and protected it from the worst weather magic also ensured the safety of any occupants of the transparent tube he entered at the bottom of the tower powering the little platform under his feet that slowly rose through the tower to the top no human could use this contrivance by himself not even if that human was blessed with the humans own form of magic in this way when she worked lydiell could be assured that no one could interrupt her without having to go first to one of elven blood there were drawbacks to being as approachable as the lords of this manor had always been the shortlived humans tended to come to them with any problem that had them stymied for more than a few moments assuming that long experience granted unfathomable wisdom if it did that there wouldn t be a young lords war now the old lords would have known better than to let them get as far as they did and there wouldnt have been a second wizard war either the intervening floors of the tower were for the most part unfurnished although this was the oldest section of the manor and everything else had been constructed around it the round rooms were too small to use for anything but offices and only lydiell and tenebrinth had need of an office so kyrtian passed room after round empty alabasterwalled room with nothing more to entertain him than brief glimpses of the outside through the weaponslits that served in place of windows even the look of alabaster was deceptive the tower was built of something far stronger though too much magic went into the construction of the material for anyone to use it these days this tower was an artifact of the first fifty years after the elves crossed out of evelon when no one knew if this world would prove to be as dangerous as the one they had left a time when the elvenborn existed as closely crowded together as any of the primitive humans in their huts and waited for something infinitely more dangerous to descend without warning than a mob of weak shortlived humans tenebrinths office just below lydiells was empty and untenanted as kyrtian had anticipated that office and lydiells were nearly double the size of the rooms below them the walls swelled out here giving the tower the look of a deep plate or shallow bowl balanced on a candlestick and covered with a round pointed silver dish cover that was the overhanging and projectileproof roof the windows in tenebrinths office were only half the size of the ones in lydiells but were glazed with the same impervious substance used instead of ordinary glass in every opening of this tower light that came through this substance lost some of its color and strength making it appear as if the office lay underwater now kyrtian heard voices and as he rose through the ceiling of tenebrinths office into that of lady lydiell lord tenebrinth himself got up from his chair to greet him lady lydiell remained seated but welcomed her son with a smile and an extended hand tenebrinth was a little older than kyrtians father would have been had he still been alive having apprenticed in the position of seneschal under kyrtians grandfather he had served in his official capacity for as long as kyrtian had known him and as one of kyrtians tutors as well as with all elvenlords above a certain age but below the point of being considered ancient it was impossible to tell exactly how old he was tall thinner and less muscular than lady lydiell with a long jaw and nose and prominent cheekbones hair confined with a silver clasp at the nape of his neck he looked exactly like what he was a studious creature serious and careful in thought and speech a true scholar and thinker who preferred to joust with his mind and not his body well i see you survived your encounter with the young tygers the seneschal said genially permit me to congratulate you kyrtian stepped out of the tube kissed the back of his mothers hand and took the chair that the seneschal offered him believe me it felt like being in a tygerpit he replied with feeling i cant imagine how anyone enjoys these socalled social occasions they arent all as bad as combat challenges seem to be lady lydiell said with a touch of sympathy and a shrug some of the fetes can be positively pleasant especially the fetes for unwed daughters the presence of women seems to make the young tygers sheath their claws and hide their teeth at least long enough to look civilized while in the company of the ladies kyrtian had debated whether or not to tell his mother everything and decided now that on the whole she was better off not knowing about how he had interrupted the challengecombat since only good had come out of his nearblunder in the end well i know you dont care who won the disputebut gel and i managed to pull off a little triumph that i think you two will approve of tenebrinth blinked and his mother raised an eyebrow oh she said now what have you two gotten into well theres good news and theres inconvenient news he replied the inconvenient news is that lyon lord kyndreth wants to visit for long enough to learn my training and combat methods the good news is that the reason he does is that we persuaded the two feuding lords to have their differences settled in a combat my way between gel and lord lyons man lyon was impressed and not only wants to know how the spells are set but said in the presence of the other lords that he intends to make this the way in which fighters are trained and disputes settled from now on after seeing bloodless combat he says that he agrees with me the old ways are too wasteful to continue with every word lydiell and tenebrinth grew more and more astonished eyes widening and mouths dropping slightly open it was tenebrinth who could not restrain himself as kyrtian leaned back in his chair a satisfied smile on his face by the ancestors boy that isnt good news its wonderful news do you realize what this means to the humans out there tenebrinth waved his arm at the world outside the windows wellmostly lady lydiell interjected gently there are going to be those of our race whose thirst for blood and cruelty will not be satisfied with bloodless combat and who will continue to waste the lives of gladiators not even lyon could get a law through the council forbidding them to kill their own slaves that strikes at the heart and soul of what nearly every elvenlord sees as his basic rights over creatures he considers to be no better than beasts and property at kyrtians nod of agreement she smiled nonetheless tenebrinth is right most of the elvenlords will be only too pleased with the notion that they can settle differences through bloodless combat its a great drain breeding and buying expensive fighting stock the further expense of training gladiators and keeping them in training is bad enough its worse to have their expensive property massacred during training and nearly as bad when the massacre happens in settling a petty argument leaving them to train gladiators all over again if they wish to maintain their position and status tenebrinth nodded thats been a complaint of the lesser lords against the greater for the past two generationsvery few have the resources to toss away slaves without considering the expense lord lyon will gain a great deal of support among the lesser lords for this if he makes it policyand almost as importantly he wont aggravate the greater he stands to win all around lydiell patted her sons hand im so pleased that i wont even ask what trouble you tumbled into in order to achieve this remarkable goal mother kyrtian objected hoping he didnt sound guilty but the price of this is that we are to expect lord kyndreth some time in the immediate future the seneschal interjected did you actually set a date for the visit no date has been set and i told him that i would send him a portalkey when i had things ready for him i tried to give the impression that as we were a small household reclusive and unused to visitors we needed time to prepare for the visit of so prominent a guest he was satisfied with that so far as i could tell and i have no intention of letting him set foot here until everyone is prepared that wont be until you two and gel have gotten the servants and fieldhands ready to hold up the illusion that this is an ordinary estate kyrtian assured him he didnt seem all that impatient and he wasnt offended that i couldnt offer him our hospitality immediately no doubt he has business of his own to take care of before he can afford a formal visit the seneschal murmured as if to himself more likely he is taking the time to see who is and is not our ally going back to the time we all left evelon lydiell replied tartly someone of his rank and status cant afford an ally with an inconvenient number of deadly enemies well the only enemy we have that i know of is aelmarkin kyrtian said letting his voice trail off and looking at his mother questioningly correct aelmarkin is our only open enemy with the remote possibility that his allies might choose to throw in on his side his mother confirmed though once they see that lyon has thrown in with us however briefly they are unlikely to back aelmarkin against us in anything important thank the ancestors we never meddled in politics on either side of the family well have a clean slate so far as lord lyon is concerned all we have to worry about is keeping up appearances for a few days at most idont intend to ask anything of lord lyon for this mother kyrtian said hesitantly and i dont intend to make it seem as if i consider it a great favor on my part to teach him my methods i want it to seem as if i consider this to behow shall put thissomething that i truly believe should be offered part of my duty to the elvenlords as a whole i want to give him the impression of a solemn young man who is devoted to the welfare of his people which i am just not the people that he thinks he smiled theres no point in disillusioning him on that exactly right any of the ordinary statusgrubbers would do the opposite she confirmed by acting differently than he expects youll catch him off guard and he wont know quite what to think of us at best he may decide that were worth having as a permanent ally the worst hell assume is that we are so quietly provincial so wrapped up in our own ways and life with such quaint ideas of loyalty and duty that we are no threat or challenge to anyone well be safe to patronize and hell be motivated to protect us from any more of aelmarkins maneuverings for my part i would say that this would be the best thing he could assume kyrtian replied relieved can i take it that you approve completely lady lydiell said as tenebrinth nodded kyrtian smiled a little thrill of pleasure tickling his spirit at the notion that his first foray into the dangerous world of great lords and politics had come off so successfully even though i almost turned it into a disaster he reminded himself this is not the time for hubris he took his leave of both of them and stepped into the tube which held him in place until the platform rose to receive him once he had been deposited on the ground floor he headed straight for the west tower which held all five floors of the great library he planned to do a little genealogical investigation himself before his own plans went any further in the home of every elvenlord great or lesser there was always a great book of ancestors kept up to date by either the lady of the clan or a clerk she personally supervised every birth death and wedding was promptly reported to the council which sent out immediate notification to every household however small and insignificant no marriage or alliance could be made without consulting the great book which dated back to the exile from evelon kyrtian sat at the table holding the great book on its slanting stand and drew it closer to him as he always did because those first days fascinated him kyrtian opened the book to the first page where the names of all of those who had dared the gate out of evelon were written fully half of them were inscribed with deathdates that came within days or weeks of the crossing some had died of the strain of the crossing itself or of injuries sustained in evelon before the crossing few in these days realized that those who had made the crossing had been the losers in a war that had split elvenkind and set one half warring against the other the crossing had been the desperate attempt of the defeated to escape rather than surrender not the valiant and bold move of those who were in search of a new world to conquer that was one fact that those who ruled here now preferred to forget and bury in the past of the survivors that remained after the crossing none were still alive at the present day elvenlords lived long provided no accident illness inherited weakness or murder disposed of them before the normal span of four or five centuries but they were hardly immortal kyrtians paternal greatgrandfather had been one of the longestlived survivors as he now learned had lyon lord kyndreths greatgrandsire most other elvenlords in these days were yet a further generation down the line from the original inhabitants of the new land he turned the page to trace his mothers line rather than his fathers odd he thought as he noted something that had never seemed important before im literally the first male any woman of her line has produced since evelon that is why there was no great objection when i wedded your father said lydiell behind him as if she had the human gift of reading thoughts he was too used to her uncanny ability to do this with him to be startled he simply turned and smiled at her as she stepped forward another pace and placed her hand affectionately on his shoulder no oneleast of all aelmarkinever thought i would produce a male heir she said quietly that was why there was no objection raised to the marriage and why aelmarkin is so intent on dispossessing you of your inheritance now he assumed that the ripe plum of our estate would drop into his lap without any effort on his partor that he could somehow connive or force me to wed my presumed daughter to him lydiell smiled down at her son whose birth had spoiled aelmarkins plans but hes really a cousin in name only kyrtian objected tracing back aelmarkins line his people havent been directly related to ours since evelon itself it was our great grandfathers who were cousins and theres been no closer marriage since then but if you trace carefully hes the only other male heir to the clan lydiell pointed out thats as much your greatgrandfathers and grandfathers fault as anything else once they had a single living child the need to protect what we had built here took precedence over trying to sire any more children they each had one male heir by one marriage and no further children no daughters to wed outside the clan no second sons to secure alliances granted they were exceptionally longlived and thats what saved us but i was the first bride to come from a family not bound in any way to your clan and if your father was still with us by now you would have at least a younger sister or brother because i would have personally seen to it rather than accepted the edict that there was no need for further children now kyrtian noted something else that had somehow escaped his attention his ageless mother was nearer in age to his grandfather than his father she saw his eyes resting on the birthdate under her name and chuckled richly i wondered when you would uncover that she said yes ill admit it i robbed the cradle when your grandmother wiser or more pragmatic than her husbandknew that she would not survive your fathers birth she had enough time to handpick a successor she turned to our family who had been her friends she wanted my sister but the family had already wed her off so she chose me but she had reckoned without your grandfathers love and devotion he refused to take another wife especially one as barelynubile as i was still for the sake of my friendship with her i visited often and long trying to amuse your grandfather and possibly even persuade him in time that i was fascinating and desirable i wish you had seen me still barely past my presentation fete slinking around here as if i was a hardened seductress since kyrtian couldnt imagine his mother slinking around like a seductress at any age he spluttered a little and reddened well when seduction failed i thought i would win him by showing him what a devoted mother i could be to his son she continued there was one little wrinkle in that plan by the time i thought of it your father was hardly of an age to need mothering but i persisted in cultivating him only to find that his son and i were mutually falling head over heels in love as soon as he was old enough to think of such things your grandsire was much amused and so was my sister moth moth of course was vtern morthena lady arada nearly a full century lydiells senior and the only surviving relict of lord aradas tiny clan she held a small estate granted her by her late husband in her own right with no inconvenient cousins to pester her kyrtian sighed when he looked at the great book in the complicated web of intermarriages and second and third marriages his family stood all alone like a single strand of silk off to one side of the greater pattern i have not told you this before but aelmarkin tried to force a marriage on me when your father first disappeared she continued as calmly as if it had happened to someone else that was when moth came to my rescue she dug up an obscure law preventing a man from marrying the widow of his cousin if she already had a male heir she visited each of the great lords herself and pointed out to each one of themwith examples how that law would protect their own sons from certain of their opponents if anything happened to the lord himself needless to say they upheld the law to a man and aelmarkin had to slink away with his tail between his legs no wonder he hates you kyrtian replied enlightened she sniffed delicately personally i prefer not to waste an emotion as empowering as hatred on that worm it was obvious from the start what his plans were when he came slinking around here oozing false sympathy and groomed and jewelbedecked to within an inch of his life even if i had been the foolish woman he thought i was i would quickly have seen that such an alliance would mean your death no matter what my personal feelings were on the subject i would never have placed you or our people in the hands of the odious aelmarkin thank you for that kyrtian laughed and sometime you might thank your aunt for devising the means to protect us both she replied cheerfully with a light squeeze of her hand on his shoulder well however much you play at modesty i think that you would have found the solution just as quickly as lady moth if you hadnt had her help he told her you are two out of the same mold as clever as you are beautiful and far more intelligent than any mere males i only needed to be clever enough to take advantage of our isolation she said with a laugh at his attempt to compliment her after all we are out back of beyond of nowhere and i doubt that anyone other than aelmarkin would even consider wanting our estate for that reason her tone turned scornful and frankly i think if aelmarkin knew how much work it is to keep this estate so profitable hed quickly change his mind about wanting it i only wish that were true kyrtian sighed its only a lot of work because of the way we treat our human friends if this estate were run on the same lines as any other the profits would probably be much higher at least he amended thats what tenebrinth told me once thats beside the point lydiell said resolutely the point now is to make sure we get the most out of lord lyons visit without making any blunders and without sacrificing any of our independence you go off and consult with gel over dinner ill do the same with tenebrinth were going to want to please lyon without dazzling him charm him without making it look as if we have anything he really wants other than your knowledge and expertise and you and gel ought to put your heads together to see if you can think of anything else he might want out of you in particular kyrtian closed the great book with a determined snap youre perfectly right as usual he said ill go change into something less ostentatious and find gel and well get down to business but in spite of the excitement of the moment there was one thing he had realized as he walked off in search of gel with all of the conversation about marriages and alliances for the first time since hed come of age lydiell had not even mentioned the prospect of his own marriage and that was enough of a relief that his steps became noticeably lighter over the next several days he and gel were so busy with preparations for lord kyndreths visit that he hardly had time to do anything other than eat and sleep he certainly didnt have any time for staging even combatpractice so the fighters were left to fend for themselves until gel could take over their practicesessions using the old blunted wooden weapons instead of the magic ones he already knew that he did not have to worry about the fighters taking advantage of his inattention thanks to a very real sense of what gel would have to sayand doabout it if they spent their time idle they took it upon themselves to follow the usual course of exercise and simple drill varied with handtohand unarmed contests in which the worst accident that could befall would be a broken bone or two kyrtian also knew that the fighters would not give the game away by acting outofcharacter they were military heart and soul and would no more speak outofturn or hesitate to obey an order than fly no the fighters could be counted upon to play their parts like the professionals that they were it was the regular servants and fieldhands who had to be drilled in subservience until it became second nature and many times kyrtian was strongly tempted to meddle with their minds by means of magic to keep them from forgetting it was finally gel who came up with the excellent solution of actually working through the elfstones on their seldomworn collars setting up a warning tingle whenever the wearer altered his or her posture from that of complete servility that worked and far better than kyrtian had expected the servile pose with shoulders slightly hunched and eyes on the ground forcibly reminded people of how they were expected to act it wont matter if they look cowed and afraid all the time gel pointed out lord kyndreth wont know its all acting a part no matter how exaggerated it seems to us a real slave just cant be too servile if they grovel a lot hell only think youre keeping their leashes short and using the whip a great deal nowmuch as i hate to bring this up but what if kyndreth doesnt bring along some of his own women hell expect to be offered entertainment even if he turns it down i dont have any concubines to offer him kyrtian pointed out i suspect thats one of the things aelmarkin tries to use against me with the other lords that imah virginal and chasteand probably sexless hence no fit heir gel growled bluntly well you may not have a harem to offer him at the moment but what are you going to do have you made any plans mother had an idea kyrtian replied but made a face of distaste i dont like it mind you but she thinks its just that im too fastidious shes going to send tenebrinth to the slave markets and buy a pretty concubine or two just before the visit shell meddle with their memories to make them think theyve been here for the last couple of years keep them isolated in a tiny harem of their own and have me offer them to lord kyndreth youre too fastidious gel told him bluntly its perfect they wont know anything about us and they wont be related to anyone here if theres an accident we wont be losing any of our people kyrtians distaste grew but he couldnt deny that gels pragmatic view was at least practical and what do we do with them afterwards he asked sourly gel shrugged hardly matters concubines arent the brightest as a whole and i suspect any that your mother picks will be very pretty and very dimmuch safer that way we could probably marry them off to someone if youve got no taste for having them around or sell them again he raised an eyebrow at kyrtians expression and snorted do yourself a favor let your mother and tenebrinth deal with it keep your hands clean if you dislike it that much as if my not knowing makes it any better he thought grimly no thats no answer ill tell mother you agree with her idea and even though i dont like the idea i agree its necessary there really doesnt seem to be a better solution there isnt gel said with emphasis what else do you want to do ask for volunteers that was definitely no answer he shook his head ill do the memory manipulationmother isnt going to be able to impart many convincing illusions aboutumi mean its not as if shes a male he flushed and didnt complete the sentence but got the distinct feeling that gel found his embarrassment highly amusing well do what we have to all of us and try to make things up afterwards if theres anyone hurt by this he just hoped that lord kyndreth wasnt one of those who left women damaged i can always make the girls forget everything when hes gone he added as much for his own benefit as for gels gel looked relieved youll never be a real commander if you cant make the difficult decisions and carry them out he reminded his erstwhile superiorperhaps just a touch smugly i just did didnt i he replied irritated enough were spending more time on this than the issue warrants and it has nothing to do with your part in this which is getting the fighters ready well gel grinned oh theyre ready very eager to show their paces and just as eager to see you vindicated have no fear they know their parts well give lord kyndreth a show he isnt likely to forget for the next three centuries triana considered the slave dispassionatelya rare state of mind for her there were several considerations here not the least of which was this how far could one trust a human as she had told aelmarkin she seldom trained female slaves never was not the operative word never was not a word to be used at all among the elvenlords whose long lives had no room in them for never sooner or later whatever it was that had been vowed against would happen mind there were elvenlords so rigid in their thinking that they actually believed that they could say they would never do somethingbut triana knew better this woman was not of her breeding the female slaves that triana bred on her own estate were strictly utilitarian and while not plain she couldnt bear to have anything plain or ugly about her were about as animated as statues in the presence of their mistress this girl bought not at auction but handpicked from among the offerings of a private sale was the opposite of stoic and unanimated she was trained as a dancer as well as in harem skills she was very intelligent triana needed a woman who was intelligent but with intelligence came the liability of thinking for ones self how far to trust her that was the question would it surprise you very much to learn that i need a spy she asked aloud the slave shook her head slightly enough to indicate that she was not surprised but not so much that the mute reply could be considered impertinent the mother of a certain young lord is purchasing harem slaves and i intend that you should number among them triana continued i need to know what goes on in his household and harem slaves are in a unique position to find that out but harem slaves are kept in isolation the girl responded tentatively triana smiled but men do not heed their tongues when among them she corrected i could have merely planted a telesonring on you and sent you on as a passive listenerbut i would not learn a tenth as much as i will when you work for me in full knowledge of what i want she considered the girl further it is your duty to give me that but your previous master indicated that you are bothersomely intelligent here the girl flushed and looked down at her feet and as a consequence i am aware that mere duty is not going to extract what i want from the place to which i am going to send you triana chuckled and the girl looked up again in surprise oh come nowi am not one of those lords who prefers slaves to have no thoughts of their own you little mayfly humans may not have the capacity to appreciate what your masters can but you are still as motivated by the prospect of gain as we are i know full well that once planted in this household your leash will be slipped and you can and will do as you please in this matter she leaned forward catching and holding the girls gaze with her own i have an incentive to offer you so that you will work that dear little mind of yours to the fullest on my behalf a flicker of emotion passed across the girls face and she flushed again incentive mistress she ventured breathily satisfied that she had found the correct key to the lock of the girls ambition triana leaned back a reward if that word pleases you better a reward for exemplary service exert yourself to the utmost on my behalf find a way to convince kyrtian to leave the harem door unbarred to your comings and goings and above all report everything you see and hear however small and seemingly inconsequential to me do that satisfy me and at the end of a year in his service i will have you retrieved you can retire here and name what you will for your conditions of living never again being required to do anything you do not care for from a cottage and mate of your choice to the suite and service of a young lady orif this is more to your likingyou may go to your wild brethren among the wizards i can arrange for that as well from the slight quickening of the girls breath triana knew she had caught her mine she thought with satisfaction and nodded to set the hook now that the bait had been taken this will not be easy she warned you will have to bend your whole mind to the task and you will have to keep lord kyrtian and his mother from ever guessing that you are not what you seem if you do not satisfy me she shrugged i will not be able to punish you obviously but i can and will leave you in place and you will live and die the concubine of a minor lord in a tiny harem with unvarying routine kyrtian does not often have guests so you would not even have that prospect to brighten your days i believe that someone like you would find that sort of life maddeningly restrictive the slave did not hesitate even for the smallest part of a moment i will serve you lady the girl replied decisively you will find nothing lacking in my zeal triana laughed aloud with a glance at the girl to invite her to join in her good humor ah aelmarkin she thought as she settled down to instruct the girl in the use of the telesonring and her initial duties this wager is already won gel knew his business none better kyrtian left the matter of the household to his mother and took charge of the rest now that the warnings were in place and the attitude of the fieldhands and farmers had been established he judged that it was time to prepare the general outward appearance of his people they must look selfsufficient and prosperous but not too prosperous the servants must not look too healthy too happy in fact the ones in the fields must not look happy at all he spent a day considering how to accomplish that researching spells of illusion wondering what he would do if lord kyndreth detected them or broke them kyndreth had not gotten where he was by being a fool and if he detected illusions he would want to know what they hidhe would first suspect treachery but he would definitely want to know why there were illusions on human slaves finally in the twilight he decided to take a walk to see if the fresh air would clear his head out and let some fresh thoughts in the stars were just coming out and a fine breeze carried the scents of the gardens on its wings he took a moment to extinguish the glowing globes illuminating the pathways for he knew the garden paths by heart and had no need of the lights at the moment he would rather enjoy the darkness not because he was brooding but because he wanted his mind to rest how did aelmarkins servants look that would be the sort of thing to get his own people to emulate despite their servile stances there was still something wrong about them that he could not put a finger on he took slow deliberate steps and cast his mind back a few days trying not to frown in concentration it wasnt an exact memory he wanted after all but an impression how did the ordinary servants the ones who cleaned the rooms and brought the food from the kitchen seem to an observer it was easy enough to remember the pretty ones the upperlevel slaves whose duties included being decorative those werent the ones he wanted at least in part because he wasnt certain any of his people could manage a convincing imitation of a pleasureslave and in part because it wouldnt do any harm for lord kyndreth to believe that his household was on the austere and sober side let kyndreth think of him as hardworking somewhat obsessed with his hobby and not really interested in the opulent life that would do no harm at all it will also reinforce the impression that we arent worth the attempt to take us over profit can only be stretched so far we might be austere because we cant afford too many luxuries try as he might all he could come up with was a vague impression of sameness as if the lesser servants were all as alike as ants and as interchangeable they could have been furniture floortiles the plinths upon which statues stood they blended so well into the background with a flash of insight he realized at that moment that this was what he wanted they must have all been in some drably uniform tunics or the like he decided they arent supposed to stand outthey should be invisible drab tunics would do that no matter that he didnt know what such a tunic or whatnot should look likeany of the seamstresses could deal with that detail hed take the need to them first thing in the morning and let them decide how to make everyone on the manor lands uniformly drab as for making people look unhappy he grinned as another idea came to him ill have the fieldworkers stick a burr or a pin somewhere in their clothing where itll irritate them without really hurting themor put stones in their shoes or wear shoes too tight or too big thatll give them all sour expressions should any of kyndreths people come snooping about he yawned and realized that hed been up far too longbut they were all going short on sleep trying to get themselves ready bed he decided and first thing in the morning the manor seamstresses even though he woke very very earlyjust at the break of dawn in factwhen he showed up unannounced at the seamstresss workrooms they were already well into the days labors that surprised him hed always known in a vague way that his people began their work early long before he awoke but he hadnt ever given much thought to what that meant here was a large welllit room furnished with comfortable chairs in which several women were seated sewing diligently there was a large table covered with a piece of fabric at the far side of the room and a woman with a wickedlybladed pair of scissors made deft cuts in it folding and laying aside the pieces she had made as she went along bolts of fabric were arrayed in a rack along one wall ribbons and other trim were wound around wooden cones on pegs and spools of thread were arranged in little racks beside them he put his need to the chief of the ladies a formidable dame with silverstreaked hair explaining the effect he wanted and why she pursed her lips and frowned my lorddo you realize what you are asking when you request common uniform tunics for the entire estate aye weve enough seedsack material about but no timeeven a simple tabard with no hems would need side and shoulder seams and itd be so crude it would look makeshift dye interrupted one of the women engaged in some mysterious task that seemed to involve the edges of a great deal of fabric that pooled on either side of her dont bother with making anything new just fire up dyepots and have everyone come in and dunk an old tunic and trews so you get the look of wear as well as having it look uniform oh wellthought the older woman exclaimed her brow clearing that might be a problem mightnt itif it looked as if everyone in the place had new clothes for colorblackd be best walnutblack the cheapest and weve got plenty of that soon or late everybody needs some bit of black and that way i doubt therell be much complaining about spoiling something good the woman was very pleased with her ingenuity and so were kyrtian and her supervisor aye thats the way thenkee margyt the head seamstress beamed and patted kyrtian on the shoulder as if he was a small boy dont worry your head about it my young lord well handle this for you when the day comes everybodyu be making a nice depressing background she actually pushed himgently but pushed him neverthelessout the door he didnt resist in fact he was rather amused at the situation hed had no idea how things were run on the domestic side but clearly this woman was as much a commander in her own ranks as gel was in his and he had no doubt that she would get the job done either she had the air about her that said she would ride right over the top of anyone and anything to complete whatever shed promised he went back to his own preparations calling in each of the supervisors of workparties and explaining to them what he wanted donethe burrs and alland why hed discovered a very long time ago that if people knew why they were being asked to do something that seemed senseless they were much more likely to comply now i dont want anyone to start getting too creative he warned dont let anyone go maim himself or try to counterfeit plague or something but if people get other ideas about how to look less than happy and healthy let them go to it particularly im a bit worried about the little children giving things awaythe older ones will be all right if you put it to them as being important but the littlest are used to running right up to any stranger and saying what they think therere several of the parents figuring on that now my lord one of the supervisors assured him if nothing else everybodys agreed that we can hide the littlest off somewhere nobodyll see them all in a group perhaps we could take them out into the woods and let them have a campingexcursion leave it to us well take care of it tell them its a holiday treat and theyll be good as lambs so many detailsas soon as kyrtian thought hed dealt successfully with the last another occurred to him it wasnt until days later that his mother approached him as he was arranging with one of the building crews to make alterations to the workers quarters it had occurred to him by then that it was unusual enough for his people to have their own little homes and villages instead of being herded into vast warehouses when they werent workingand hed better have their quarters look shabby and illmade lady lydiell waited patiently as he and the builders quickly worked out what was needed it was pretty clear that she wanted to speak with him alone so he dismissed them as soon as he could and closed the door of his own new office behind them she sat with a rustle of silk and a swirl of scarlet skirts you told me to come to you when i had your harem and i have she said simply and the words hit him like a splash of cold water in his face theyre ready for you to prepare them he didnt allow the shock to freeze his thoughts though i dont have anything on my plate at the moment so i had best see to them then he told her and was pleased to see a bit of surprise in her eyes that he was willing to deal with the unpleasant duty so quickly she knew that he hated meddling with humans minds through their collars especially for a purpose like this but on the whole hed rather just get it over with so that he wouldnt have to dwell on it thats fine she replied quickly getting to her feet with that grace he admired so much and was so much a part of her come along ive converted your old nursery to a harem it was the most secure suite in the manor and the only one not in use it had to be the most secure didnt it he chuckled opening the door for her not only did you have to worry about something getting in at me you had to worry about me getting out and a mischievous escapeartist you were too she retorted well i can tell you that i am very proud of tenebrinth and you will be too when you see these women with all of the upheavals the slavetrade has been very much disrupted which i will not shed tears over he responded with a hint of a frown nevertheless it has made his task harder the look she gave back to him was one of reproach many of the slavemarkets have been closed down and others have only the most meager of selection on the other hand if it hadnt been so disrupted i doubt we would have found three women so perfectly suited to our purposes i doubt that even the great lord kyndreth will wonder why your harem is so small once he sees these girls oh now his curiosity was piqued she nodded her hair falling in a graceful curve across her brow as she did so she pushed it back with an impatient hand firstly i very much doubt that anyone other than their trainer and former owner have ever seen them which makes it much easier to carry off the fiction that you would have owned them yourself for several years secondly if the trade were not so disrupted i doubt if we would have been able to get them at all theyd have been snapped up before they reached the greater markets now he was surprised are they that attractive then he asked his curiosity more than piqued they are not precisely great beauties although they are quite handsomewell make that judgment for yourself by this time they had reached the doorand now guardedof his former nursery the guards stepped aside faces as expressionless as statues and lady lydiell opened the door gesturing to him to go in ahead he did so feeling the faint tingle of a second door as he crossed the threshold that would prevent the women from crossing it until it was taken down that was usual enough in harems to keep them out of the ladys bower it was necessary here to keep them from wandering and seeing things they shouldnt the three women had clearly been told to await him for they were standing in poses that were a little too contrived to be natural that was when he understood what his mother had meant there could not possibly have been three women more strikingly different the first tall with pale gold hair and vivid blue eyes had an angular face and a figure as slender and willowy as any elven lady and a faraway expression as if she lived entirely in a cloud of dreams she had posed herself beside a giant vase of flowers musing on a single enormous lilyblossom her frilled and lacy gown echoing the pastel colors of the blooms the second a brunette with brown eyes full of passion full lips and a sensuous body fairly radiated promises she lounged against a pillar in a way that thrust her bosom forwardstraining the silk of her scarlet formfitting wrapand allowed her to watch him with a provocative flirtatious sideways glance the third had a tumble of flaming curls and merry green eyes a dancers body of strength and agility clothed in a simple blue tunic that left her legs bare and the expression of a completely innocent child she looked up from the kitten she was playing with to smile at him with a face full of laughter it seemed that in these three all the variety of an entire harem was encompassed and only a statue could have failed to respond to the silent invitations each of them sent to him in her own way you see lady lydiell said quietly as the three sank to the ground in deep curtsies he glanced at her and saw that she had a glint of mischief in her own eyes well dearest is it safe to leave you alone with them he couldnt help it he flushedbut he covered it with a halfmocking bow youre going to have to if im to give them convincing memories he told her causing her to blush it was with a bit of satisfaction that he bowed her out and turned to face his new acquisitions he was trying to think of something to say when they descended on him as a body and made speech irrelevant at least for that moment and the many that followed sergeant gel followed lord tenebrinth into the old tower his mood not precisely apprehensive but tinged with that emotion lady lydiell rarely spoke to him facetoface and this was the first time that she had ever required him to attend her in her private office he had never been inside the old tower few humans had only the one or two required to clean lydiells and tenebrinths offices one of the lords or the lady herself would have to have brought him personally there was no other way for him to use the only means of access which was a bizarre transparent tube he couldnt imagine how he was supposed to climb it and entered it with tenebrinth rather dubiouslyonly to suppress a start as the floor beneath him began to rise it gave him a queasy sensation despite his familiarity with magic to ride this contraption it just didnt seem natural round empty room after room passed himor rather he passed themas he rose with no real sensation of movement he began to wonder if he would ever reach the top when finally one of the rooms showed signs of occupationas did the next after thatand then the platform slowed and came to a stop at the topmost level lydiells office at the top of the tower had a dizzying and unrestricted view that he as a military commander could see was of incalculable value for the chatelaine of the manoror the commander of its defenses the office walls were all window and he wondered as he stepped gingerly off the platform what a storm would be like up here lydiell greeted him with a smile which made his apprehension vanish she even rose that was an unexpected honor and he bowed as deeply as he could without looking ridiculous the lady did not like groveling none of her clan did sergeant gel please make yourself easy she said as she gestured with that grace only the elvenlords possessed towards an unoccupied chair this is not an official summonsrather it is a personal one i have a desire to consult you tenebrinth evidently took this as the signal to depart he stepped back on the little platform and discreetly dropped back to the next level leaving them alone gel took his seat and examined the ladys face and swiftly understood why she wanted to see him kyrtian he asked wasting no words she nodded and took her place behind her desk clasping her hands on the surface before her i had hoped she said hesi tantly as if she was voicing thoughts long held in secret that i could keep kyrtian isolated from the politics of the great lords and the council unfortunately it seems that the times conspire against my hopes it does look like hes going to get tangled up whether he likes it or not gel said cautiously his eyes never leaving her face unnerving as it was to look her straight in the eyes my lady i dont mind telling you that i dont like the idea any better than you do im not certain you realize just how tangled hes likely to get lydiell replied a faint frownline creasing her ageless brow gel couldnt for the life of him read those odd emerald eyes the elvenlords all had but at least she wasnt trying to hide her facial expressions lord kyndreth is not going to be content merely to learn a few tricks with magic to help train humanswhen he realizes just how extensive kyrtians knowledge and practical experience of military matters is he is going to want my son to exercise his talents in the service of the old lords he will certainly want kyrtian to command a force against the young lords and possibly keep him on after the young lords are crushed to move against the wizards and the wild humans gel swore under his breath angry at himself for not thinking of that himself and it was far too late to try to talk kyrtian out of abandoning the fullscale maneuvers he had planned the boy was determined to prove to lord kyndreth that this was the only way to train fighters and nothing would do but to show him how easy it was to hold the spells needed on entire armies lady lydiell sighed your face tells me that my fears are likely to be realized oh why couldnt he have been an artist or a musician or obsessed withwithoh horticulture or something equally frivolous at least he isnt bent on being the dead opposite of his father my lady gel replied grimly youd not like him as a fop or a lazy layabout or worse falling in with he hesitated after all he was a human and lydiell was elven blood was blood but lydiell surprised him with a bitter smile and a light an swer falling in with the pampered perverts that most of my kind are you dont need to spare my feelings gel we cannot afford to be less than honest with each other if we are going to be able to keep kyrtian out of the pitfalls lying before him ah cowflops why do i have to feel like its me thats his father id rest easier at night he might be only a few actual years older than kyrtian but in real terms he might just as well have been the elvenlords father by the standards of his race kyrtian was the equivalent of a stripling although by human reckoning he was in his late thirties in knowledge and general responsibility he was certainly thatbut in the unconscious things that characterized an adolescent he was very much gels junior his boundless energy his enthusiasm his tendency to act rather than sitting back and waiting for events to come to himthose were the characteristics of the young and made gel feel very old the strength speed and endurance of youth were also his and might be for the next century or two which made gel feel even older hed noticed of late much to his chagrin that he was slowing down losing some of his edge in fact he and that man of lord kyndreths had talked about that kaeth wasnt getting any younger either and if he ever had to actually foil a fellowassassin that could be fatal if he didnt take steps to compensate we ii both just have to be sneakier to make up for what we re losing he reminded himself youth and enthusiasm are no match for experience and treachery i hate to admit this my lady he said feeling ashamed that he had not anticipated this situation but ive kept him as ignorant as you have of the way things are he waved his hand vaguely at the windows out there and i did it for pretty much the same reasons as you i figure why throw something at him that he couldnt change and would only worry about ah all those old lessons came back to him now of being taken off the estate as tenebrinths page so he could see just how the other elvenlords really acted and thought tenebrinth had collared him of course and if hed done something even slightly stupidwhich even as a child he hadnt been likely tothe elvenlord could have quickly controlled him and in a peculiar way that too had been part of the lessons in just how fragile and precious the life humans led here was lydiell nodded and at this point if we try to tell him that lord kyndreth is no more to be trusted than aelmarkin he would only make the wrong decisions hed try to put kyndreth off oror something and now that hes aroused kyndreths interest he cant do that without arousing suspicion as well damn all politics anyway gel said sourly kyndreth is going to use him make a tool out of him and give him nothing but fine words and empty praise for his troubles yesbut lydiell began gel waited but she didnt complete the thought he spoke into the heavy silence but it might not be bad for him so long as hes valuable to kyndreth hes not going to be wasted and as long as hes valuable kyndreth will see that were left alone no matter how peculiar some things around here may look to him lydiell nodded and gel felt a certain relief that she agreed with him there was selfishness in his motivation and he knew that as long as kyrtian was not only alive and well but under the open protection of someone like lord kyndreth gel and the other humans on the estate would be perfectly safe aelmarkin wouldnt dare try to interfere or continue in his attempts to gain control of the manor and lands as for the humans living elsewherehumans that kyrtian would be very concerned about if he knew how bad things could be on other estatesgel found it difficult to worry about the wellbeing of people he didnt know the sufferings of human slaves on other estates were just stories to him and although he believed them in the abstract he just couldnt make himself care when people he knew needed his whole concentration and concern he couldnt really believe in anything he hadnt seen with his own eyes not deep down where it counted those are all old stories anyway and it makes no sense these days that the elvenlords would wantonly waste or mar their own possessions with wild humans on the border drag ons in the sky the wizards threatening to start the war up again and their own children in armed revolt they cant afford the sort of goingson they did in the past slaveryyes there was no doubt that the elvenlords were harsh masters and kept their humans under complete control it was a terrible thing that humans elsewhere had every action controlled by someone else that they could make not even the smallest decision about their own lives but starvation torture abusewhy theres no reason to do any of those things a starved abused or injured slave works less and is worth less than a healthy one who is punished only when he deserves it lady i pledge you i will not let the boy out of my sight or care no matter what lord kyndreth wants of him he promised coming back to concerns he could understand and see for himself im a treacherous old bastard and if i think hes in trouble ill dose the boys wine make kyndreth think hes had a fit and drag him home myself he surprised himself with his own sudden fierce protectiveness and tried feebly to smile once weve got him safe we can talk him into playing witless if hes lost his senses he might not be of value to kyndreth but he wont be a threat either and that was the best promise he could think of to give her poor as it was lydiell sent gel back to his work without feeling much comfort from his words she was very troubled and could see no immediate way out of the dilemma that had come at them out of nowhere i had hoped to keep him isolated from all of this but events have conspired against us she thought somberly staring out the window at the placid fields spread so invitingly below thanks to the two latest wizard wars kyrtian s obscure skills are no longer without value he will be drawn into elvenlord politics whether he likes it or not but gel is right telling him some of the realities of the situation wont help him he might be better if he remains in ignorance if he knows what the elvenlords are really like his own sense of honor just might drive him to make some very dangerous choices if however kyndreth feeds him what the old lords want him to know and con vinces him to help themthen keeps him ignorant of the truth he will serve them well and stay out of trouble there was one positive effect of all the warfare and quarreling there were nowhere near as many of the old lords as there once had been and those that remained were mostly very shrewd they have little power to spare and wont waste any tool that comes to their hands when it costs little to keep that tool content there are very few dyrans about in the higher councils these days she sighed tasting the bitterness of her own expedience the sour knowledge that by keeping him ignorant she was playing the same manipulative games as those she despised kyrtian would be used indeed but wasnt it better to be an unwitting tool than a dead hero i cannot see any other options keeping him purposefully blinded about the true nature of his fellow elvenlords might have been a mistake but she could not see how she could have done anything else gel did have a good idea she reminded herself if it looks as if kyrtian is in danger everyone thinks his father was mad and no one would be particularly surprised if he went mad under the strains they will probably put him under oh ancestors why did i try to keep him sheltered why couldn t i have given him some armor against the thornmaze he is about to walk into she only prayed that her decision would not cause more harm than she had ever dreamt possible i hope i dont look as nervous as i feel kyrtian muttered to himself as he rechecked his appearance in the giltedged mirror to his right hed lost count of the number of times hed glanced into mirrors today making certainof what he wasnt quite sure he only knew that he didnt want to look like lord kyndreths son gildor and his cronies nor did he want to ape the appearance of lord kyndreth himself he wanted to look mature sober perhaps a touch on the scholarly side but able to hold his own in physical combat as well looking prosperous but not necessarily opulent was as important on reflection perhaps what he wanted was to look as if he could be lord kyndreths intellectual equal but not as if he already assumed that he was after going through at least four changes of clothing and nearly driving his poor servants mad he finally settled on a conservative tunic and tightfitting trews of soft doeskin dyed a rich blue and slashed to display the silver satin of his shirt matching boots suitable for some hard walking completed the outfit with a heavy silver chain and fillet confining his hair as his only jewelry jewels would not impress lord kyndreth who was a powerful mage and knew how easily such things could be produced by illusion the mirror he kept glancing into was just outside the portal chamber at any moment now lord kyndreth and his entourage should be coming through the door to the chamber was open it was really too small to allow for a graceful exit of so large a group servants in the household colors lined the chamber and the hall outside but kyrtian was the sole representative of the family he was the head of the clan now and it would betray an unhealthy influence from his mother if she were here to receive the guests as well as he the servants wellschooled in their roles kept their eyes cast down as kyrtian fidgeted with the chain around his neck at long last the portal shimmered with energy and kyrtian snapped to attention presenting a mask of calm the perfect picture of a welcoming host the first figures through the portal were naturally lord kyrtians bodyguards one of whom was the fighter called kaeth that kyrtian remembered from the combat they deployed themselves on either side of the portal with smooth efficient and practiced movements making a barrier of themselves between the portal and kyrtians servants they must go through such maneuvers constantly what surprised him was that they looked alert and suspicious not bored the servants took no notice gel had lectured them on what they could expect and what they shouldor more appropriately should notdo they kept their places as if this sort of quasimilitary invasion happened every day lord kyndreth was next through the door followed by his son gildor kaeth moved in closer to his lord standing unobtrusively nearby close enough to intercept any aggressive action kyrtian moved immediately to welcome the elvenlord making sure that his own movements were nonaggressive welcome my lord he said pitching his voice low but putting warmth into it and thank you for being patient enough to wait until we could welcome you with all the honor and comfort that is your due i hope that you will be pleased with what we have to show you lord kyndreth took kyrtians extended hand in his in a firm clasp that was clearly a test kyrtian returned an equal pressure and lord kyndreth smiled ever so slightly as he released kyrtians hand it is i who should be thanking you for your hospitality lord kyrtian he replied as they moved forward to permit the rest of the entourage to come through your household is a quiet one and i understand that you have few visitors we are creating quite a disruption for you kyrtian made the expected disclaimers as he kept one eye on lord kyndreth and the other on lord gildor and the part of the entourage that was composed of gildors friends i hesitate to mention this my lord but we were not expecting so large a groupperhaps some of the guests would accept accommodation in a pavilion lord kyndreth east an eye back at his son and his sons followers who were clearly intoxicated and likely to remain that way for some time lord gildor and his associates are not remaining he replied smoothly they came only to view the pitched battle and will depart as soon as the demonstration is complete kyrtian did not let out a sigh of relief but some of his concern left him housing gildor and his cronies was the last of his potential problems and the only one he hadnt anticipated lord kyndreth and his servants should behave in predictable ways but gildor and his drunken friends were neither predictable nor safe for the servants to be around they were used to getting their way in all things used to taking what they wanted and it was entirely possible that what they wanted would invoke automatic unthinking rebellion in the human servants who were not used to being treated as objects to be used and discarded at will but if gildor and his cronies were already planning to leave right after the demonstrationwell kyrtian was confident his people could hold things together for that long the demonstration is ready my lord he said and gestured bringing several preselected servants forward my people will guide your servants to your quarters so that all will be in readiness for your comfort when the battle is over excellent kyndreth did nothing but kaeth made a gesture sending two of the bodyguards and several of kyndreths slaves laden with baggage to join kyrtians servants kyrtians people quickly took over most of the burdens of the luggage and led the others down the corridor towards the guestquarters lord kyndreth gave an expectant glance at kyrtian who took the hint and led the rest of the group through the maze of corridors to the balcony outside the lesser diningroom this same balcony overlooked the field usually used for celebrations today it would be the site of a battle for this occasion the balcony was sheltered from the glare of the sun with an awning made of tapestry giving it the look of a viewingstand for a formal tournament banks of comfortable seats awaited the visitors and refreshments had been prepared and set out to greet them all under the watchful eye of lady lydiell out of the corner of his eye kyrtian saw the smugly superior expressions of gildor and his friends changed to looks of gratification and pleasure obviously they had not thought to find a sophisticated level of hospitality in this provincial household now kyrtian presented his mother to the guests lydiell had gone to great effort to appear as a typical elven lady gowned and coiffed as her son had seldom seen her before her expres sion that of a flawless statue she resembled her everyday self very little indeed kyrtian had not seen her until this moment and winced inwardly as he thought how long she must have spent in the hands of her servants to achieve her appearance her silver hair had been divided into hundreds of tiny braids which had then been arranged in a series of draped loops and knots held in place with jeweled pins her pastelhued gown of multiple layers of misty cobweblike blue fabric with sleeves and train that trailed behind her could not possibly be more impractical for her normal duties each and every hem had been edged in lace so fine it was close to transparent and likely to snag on everything unless great pains were taken to prevent such a disaster tiny sparkling motes of gems winked amid the misty folds of the gown and more gems strung on gossamer strands of silver wreathed her neck from her toes to the last hair lydiells costume was so fragile it invited ruin in the mere acts of moving and walking that however was not an elven ladys business to worry about it was the duty of her slaves to manage sleeves and hems and see to it that her gown remained perfect and pristine at all times so it was today any time lydiell moved she was trailed by four women whose only purpose was to see that she could move about as easily as a graceful image in a perfect daydream this of course was exactly what lord kyndreth expected to see so he simply bowed over lydiells hand and escorted her back to her chair while gildor and the rest chose seats lord kyndreth took the place of honor at lydiells right hand and kyrtian assumed the seat at her left as soon as each guest was in his chosen seat a servant presented him with a chilled glass of sparkling wine and a platter of dainties from which to make a choice gel and kyrtian had left nothing to chance not even the number of guests a young page had sprinted to the balcony while kyrtian and lord kyndreth spoke to report the exact number of elvenlords that had arrived there was neither one chair too many nor too few and precisely the correct number of servants one to each guest the human slaves lord kyndreths bodyguards included all stood of course no slave sat in the presence of his masters only when everyone was settled did the two armies move out onto the field lord kyndreth leaned forward in his seat immediately his attention riveted on the combatants for his part kyrtian tried not to fidget nervously though not because the success of the combat was in doubt no it was only that he was not on the field himself this would be the first time he was only an observer rather than a participant he found somewhat to his own chagrin that he did not make a very good observer as the two forces charged towards each other shouting taunts and battlecries gildor and his friends were momentarily diverted but as the combat continuedand it was clear that it would be a bloodless combat as man after man glowed scarlet or blue and had to retire to the sidelinesthey quickly lost interest how many men can you hold this magic on at a time lord kyndreth asked quietly as kyrtian ignored the muttered jeers and scornful laughter of gildor and his friends i dont know for certain my lord kyrtian said honestly ive never had occasion to try it on more than a thousand so i have not yet found an upper limit a thousand kyndreth was clearly impressed even if his son was underwhelmed by the ancestors that is remarkable there should be no difficulty then in training battalions of fighters in field maneuvers so long as several mages are used to hold the magic in place i should think not my lord kyrtian responded deferentially especially if the mages concerned are powerful ones such as yourself i am certain that you would find it a trivial task to hold the magic on twice that number behind them gildor and his friends were making deep inroads on the wine showing quite clearly just how bored they were with the combat nevertheless given lord kyndreths interest and approval they didnt dare be too vocal in their contempt finally their restlessness got to the point where it annoyed lord kyndreth himself the battle had devolved into a mass of single combats between the most skilled of the fighters and it was obvious it would be some time before sheer weariness be came the undoing of many of the fighters lord kyndreth abruptly stood up and kyrtian took that as he was meant to blowing the shrill whistle that signaled the end of the demonstration obedient to the signal fighting ceased immediately and in the sudden silence lord kyndreth turned to his host with a broad smile this has been a most impressive demonstration lord kyrtian he said with as much warmth as kyrtian had ever seen him display until now even more so than the singlecombat you originally showed us i am looking forward to learning this new application of magic in the next few daysbut i fear than my son and his friends have previous commitments and must be on their way now he leveled a gaze on his bemused son that shook the young elvenlord into momentary sobriety mustnt you gildor the younger lord startled by his sires abrupt change of mood stammered out his reply ofof course certainly he babbled previous commitments pressing engagements and all that so sorry excellent show be on our way now my people will show you the way back to the portal chamber lord gildor kyrtian replied with as fine a display of the height of good manners as anyone could have asked he gave no hint that he had heard the disparaging remarks nor that he was well aware that gildor was so drank he probably could not have found the door without help i cannot tell you how gratified i was by your presence or by your appreciation i hope that we will be able to give you a better demonstration of our hospitality at some time in the future gildor and his friends filed back into the dining hall subdued by lord kyndreths enthusiastic reception of the demonstration there were no more jeering asides no more snickers kyrtian was under no illusions about this he fully expected that the moment the younger elvenlords passed the portal they would begin their scornful gossip again but for now it was obvious who the master was and what the master approvedand all the young lords fell obediently into line odd kyrtian thought as lord kyndreth exchanged some polite compliments with lady lydiell and the last of the unwanted visitors passed through the doors of the lesser dining hall i would have thought given the way he likes to puff himself up and bluster that gildor would have sided with the young lords against his father lord kyndreth isnt going to pass over power any time in the foreseeable future and i would have thought that by now gildor would be hungry for that power perhaps though gildor liked comfort better than power perhaps he already knew he didnt dare to challenge his father or perhaps gildor was less ambitious than kyrtian would have been in his place as it was gildor had prestige status and a carefree pampered existence if he sat where his father now hejd sway he might actually have to work kyndreth turned to kyrtian who collected his scattered thoughts i believe that i would like to retire to my quarters to prejpare for dinner and think about all you have shown me he said unless you have something more planned to show me today only one thing and that is on the way kyrtian replied with a slight smile please allow me to escort you perhaps some questions will occur to you that i can answer as we walk they both bowed to lady lydiell who nodded gravely to both of them without speaking kyrtian waited while one of the servants held the door open for them he also waited for the bodyguards to flank his guest before taking his own place beside kyndreth other than that he paid no attention to the bodyguards kyndreth glanced sharply around as they passed along the hallways for a moment kyrtian wondered what had caught his attention then kyndreth answered his question with a query of his own you use no illusion here do you kyndreth asked as if surprised very little my lord kyrtian replied and smiled slightly perhaps we are somewhat conservative in nature but wemy mother and i that isprefer the real to the illusory illusion is he groped for words cheap kyndreth surprised him with the word he had been trying to avoid and the ironic lifting of his eyebrow i tend to agree actually any halfway competent mage can cloak rotting timber and motheaten tapestry in illusion to maintain a gracious and attractive home without illusion requires dedication and effort illusion is i believe the lazy mans way i agree my lord we here prefer substance to style one might say again he ventured a smile our home may be oldfashioned in style but that is the price of preferring substance by this time they had reached the area of the old nursery which was now the new haremand kyrtian paused i would like to offer you all the comforts of our house my lord if you would care to pass within lord kyndreth could easily see the shimmer of power that cloaked the door which meant his bodyguards would not be able to follow him inside but there was also no doubt what kyrtians words had implied and he was probably curious just what sort of harem the notoriously ascetic kyrtian had he signaled to his bodyguards to join the two guards at the door and followed kyrtian within the three young women were waiting for them and rose instantly to their feet pausing just long enough for lord kyndreth to get a good look at them before they sank to the ground in deep curtsies for the very first time kyrtian saw the great lord surprised so surprised in fact that his jaw dropped just a trifle the he recovered his composure and turned to kyrtian with a sly grin you young dog he exclaimed and clapped kyrtian on the shoulder no wonder nothing tempts you to mix with the other youngsters they havent anything to offer that could ever match these treasures kyrtian bowed his head slightly so i believe my lord he gestured and the young women flushing prettily rose again lord kyndreth surveyed them again his eyes lingering on each in turn i believe i shall take up your offer he said with a chuckle but after dinner there is as the ancestors said a pleasure in anticipation that the wise man learns to cherish as much as the fulfillment of that anticipation very true my lord kyrtian murmured deferentially very true lord kyndreth was a surprisingly good dinnerguest he ate and drank moderately gave praise to the cook and took care to involve lady lydiell in the conversation kyrtian gradually relaxed the visit was going well if it continued in this vein the entire expenditure of time and energy would have been well repaid as the dessert course was brought in lord kyndreth turned to kyrtian and for the first time there was a hint of hesitation in his expression lord kyrtian there is something that i have been curious about for a very long time but i hesitate to bring up a subject that would cause you or your ladymother any discomfort what subject would that be kyrtian asked cautiously i amand have beenvery curious about your late father came the surprising answer more to the point i am curious as to his reasons for vanishing into the wilderness i know some have made inappropriate observations about him but i saw nothing in your fathers demeanor before he vanished to make me believe that he had anything but very good reasons for his actions kyrtian glanced at his mother who nodded slightly the unspoken message was clear he could go ahead and reveal some of what he already knew kyrtian cleared his throat there is a traditionsome might call it a legendin our family that when the elves first came across from evelon the machines and most of the books they had brought with them were too burdensome to carry more pressing concerns had to be dealt within the hunt for a place to live and the means to do so ancient knowledge was of no use in such a brand new world so all these things were more of a handicap than an advantage and they were cached shortly after the search for more hospitable territory began for some reason no one ever went back for themperhaps only because the elvenlords were too busy subduing the natives those caches of ancient knowledge were what my father was hunting when he vanished interesting lord kyndreth pulled at his lower lip in thought assuming that there is useful knowledge there that we have lost which is quite possible whoever found those cached materials could have a distinct advantage since i replicated my methods of combattraining by means of research into the old books we still have i suspect there is a great deal of knowledge that has been lost or forgotten kyrtian replied somberly frankly i have no idea what might lie out there nor did my father we simply havent got enough information even to make a guess what he did not observe was that lady lydiell knew something more and had told kyrtian her family traditions as well as his fathers and it was not particularly flattering to the great lords of this land the tale of the crossing was one that the great lords had probably done their best to forget there had been a civil war in evelon and their side was the one that was at the time of the crossing the losing side the ancestors of the current ervenlords decided to escape through the gate they would build together taking their chances on finding a hospitable land with easily cowed natives on the other side it was either that or face surrender and have their power reft from them by the winners the result would be that the losers would live on but enslaved and disgraced official history said little of the war and did not even hint that the elvenlords might have been getting the worst of the conflict instead by common consent the ancestors were regarded as bold fearless pioneers striking out on their own when life in evelon grew wearisome through its neverchanging sameness lady lydiell knew more preserved through the female line even though it had been agreed that all of the elven mages would pool their strength and magic the more unscrupulous and selfish held back as a result when the gate went up some were drained of magic power while others still had enough to make them the rulers on the other side that was the difference between the original great lords and the lesser lords and not as the great lords would have everyone believe a matter of intelligence and inherited power the machines that came over seemed to encounter difficulties possibly due to the disruptive effect of the gate on their spells and may have been abandoned as a consequence my father had found a speculative document suggesting that the warmachines they brought with them could be drained for power even if they no longer worked correctly kyrtian went on if so they could provide a reservoir of magic to fall back on when a mages own powers were depleted once again he saw lord kyndreths eyes narrow slightly as he contemplated this possibility kyrtians father had intendedif it could be doneto restore the magic to those elves who lacked it lord kyndreth was probably thinking in terms of keeping all that power to himself to be doled out as he chose that would give him unprecedented power among his own peers and an unprecedented tool to manipulate them a mage with such a resource at his disposal would be what the elvenlords had never yet had a king at any rate that was why father was out huntinglooking for the machines and the books and obviously this was not something that a rational man would have human slaves doing because of the dangers implicit in exposing slaves to things so unknown and unpredictable kyrtian finished the humans do have their own form of magic after alland who knows what exposure to those machines would do it might free them of their collarsmight give them powers to match ours no that was a task he preferred to keep to himself i can see whyand your father was a far wiser man than anyone has given him credit for being lord kyndreth said gravely now you have given me twice as much to think about kyrtian shook his head but this talk of lost machines and cached bookssuch things surely must wait until we have dealt with the halfbloods and our own rebellious youth he deliberately framed the reply to include himself in the opposite party to the young lords and he saw lord kyndreth smile in reply you are correct the great lord replied and long before we do that there is much we must accomplishnot the least of which is to do justice to the finale of this excellent meal kyrtian signed internally and answered kyndreths smile with one of his own he had been acceptedperhaps not as an equal but certainly as an ally and that should put paid to cousin aelmarkins plans for the near future at least very true my lord he murmured you are entirely correct as usual one worry at least was off kyrtians mind by the next morning as soon as he awoke he paid a cautious visit to the harem if anything unpleasant had happened to the young women he wanted to be the one to deal with it he was after all the one responsible for them but as it happened lord kyndreth had treated all three of the harem women very well had in fact given them each a handsome gift of jewelry for pleasing him they were excited and happy and did not make much of an effort to disguise their hopes that there might be more such visitsand presents from the great lord kyrtian found it rather touching actually they were so like three little girls in their innocent pleasure at being rewarded with baubles there were three other elvenlords in kyndreths entourage but none of them were of high enough status to be offered the services of the harem they would have to put up with enforced chastity until they returned to their own homes for houseservants unless they actually offered themselves or were of fered by the host were considered offlimits if lord kyndreth had shown himself to be lukewarm in his regard for kyrtian such a breach of etiquette could have taken place anyway but not when kyndreth had shown his favor kyrtian could remove at least this one minor concern from his long list of worries the girls would not be abused by his guest nor would his servants be mistreated by kyndreths underlings as soon as lord kyndreth put in an appearance and had broken his fast the rest of the day was spent in an odd rolereversal as kyrtian tutored the older lord in the magic of mockcombat it felt awkward it was also dangerous work and not from a magical standpoint somehow kyrtian had to simultaneously be teacher and deferential but not groveling lesser lord to kyndreths greater kyrtian walked a narrow line between those two extremes and he dared not deviate from it if he wanted lord kyndreths protection but lord kyndreth wanted this knowledge badly enough to exert himself to be accommodating and charming and slowly kyrtian began to relax forget about his own careful pose and simply instruct hed called in all of his fighters to act as subjects for the practice though initially the magic was only cast on one kyrtian was sure enough of his own mastery that he reckoned he could counter any mistakes lord kyndreth made before they caused any harm and it was a very real measure of the trust his men had in him that the fighters took that for granted standing relaxed and unconcerned while lord kyndreth felt his way through the weaving of the complicated magery the first time it took a fine touch a delicate touch to ensure that the fighter enspelled felt enough of a warning tingle to tell him that hed been hit even in the excitement of combatyet was kept from actually being hurt which would be counterproductive this is the opposite of the way we train our gladiators now kyndreth observed pausing to wipe his brow with a spotless scrap of white silk which he then dropped without thinking about it on the ground behind him his own man automatically retrieved the handkerchief and stepped back again kyndreth never even noticed when they practice even with blunted weapons the point is that they will be hurt if they allow a blow to fall and so their defensework is supposed to improve yes but if that blow falls even in practice it can disable a man kyrtian pointed out as the fighter waited patiently for kyndreth to complete the spellcasting whats the good of learning from your mistake if you end up losing so much time in recovering from your injury that you have to go back to the beginning again conditioning is as important as training or so my experience leads me to believe oh you are arguing with the converted young friend kyndreth chuckled casually massaging his hands as if they felt stiff ive lost far too many fine and promising specimens permanently to socalled training accidents its a costly business too costly when now we need fighters for real combat more than we need gladiators he resumed the task before him and the fighter began to have a faintly glowing aura in the case of men who are stubborn about acknowledging hits i do set it high enough to hurt though kyrtian admitted as he supervised lord kyndreths effort there are some fellows who get so worked up during a fight that nothing less than real pain seems to get through to them those men i would put in the front lines kyndreth observed wryly with a side glance at kyrtian if they are that impervious ive seen a few of those they have a kind of madness in battle its useful if theyre in the front line but theyre as much a danger to friend as to foe anywhere else i put em on the point of a thrust let them carve their way in and take ground behind them with fighters that can keep their heads kyrtian nodded although he hated to think of any of his fighters being in the front lines of real combat his eyes narrowed as he kept track of lord kyndreths progress there he cautioned that is exactly the level you can usually set it at thats perfect as kyndreth let go of his control of the field around the fighter kyrtian flexed his shoulders to ease some of the strain in them now we build the weapon he smiled thats not as difficult its just a little different from a truly expert illusion once kyndreth had the initial magic set he was able to swiftly make copies upon as many fighters as kyrtian had present this is amazing he observed his eyes widening a little as his total passed twenty the first one is difficult but there is very little drain once the initial fighter is done had expected this to be quite expensive in terms of personal energy i believe that is because you arent exactly replicating the magici believe you are simply spreading it to include every subsequent fighter kyrtian observed pleased with how quickly lord kyndreth had learned the special techniques the sooner he has mastered all this the sooner he can be gone and we can get this masquerade over with i hope that makes sense to you perfect sense kyndreth gave him an odd look do you also make a study of the mechanics and theory of magic its an esoteric branch of study and one i had not associated with someone who is so clearly awell a soldier so to speak rather than a pure scholar only a littlei had to do a certain amount of study to replicate this he waved his hand vaguely at the assembled fighters i wont claim to be a genius or even to have a particular knack for research only a great deal of patience and persistence when it comes to something im interested in lord kyndreths expression blanked for a moment as if kyrtians attitude had taken him aback but he said nothing well lets have the fighters pair off and see the magic in action shall we kyrtian continued wondering what that look meant have i been too modest have i tipped my hand or is it just that he isnt used to hearing someone that doesnt boast about his prowess an excellent plan lord kyndreth stepped to the sidelines and kyrtian signaled to the fighters to begin sparring lord kyndreths pleasure in the discovery that his replication of the magic functioned exactly the same as kyrtians was obvious for his own part kyrtian was just as pleased for once he didnt have to hold both sides in the spell and that freed up enough of his attention that he could more fully appreciate the skill of his men kyrtian signaled to his men to stop and turned to his guest his own feeling of accomplishment matching lord kyndreths you are a marvelously quick study my lord and no one would doubt your mastery of magic he said wim no intent to flatter i do not think you need to learn anything else from me you have the technique now and all that you need is practice in time you will probably be faster even than i at setting the magic practice is something i can get at home i will not strain your generous hospitality longer than i have to the great lord replied immediately much to kyrtians veiled relief he wants to leave so soon thank the ancestors truly it is a great honor to be your host he protested anyway for forms sake and truly it is a great inconvenience for you kyndreth said with just a touch of mockery in his voice i am not blind kyrtian for all that you and your lady mother live graciously your means are limited and i am a burden on them this is a small and very private manor and my folk are an intrusion and an inconvenience to your routine no matter how you cloak that in good manners i shall beg your forbearance for just this one night more for there is something i would like to discuss with you but tomorrow my folk and i will leave you and yours in peace meanwhilei feel in strong need of a bath and a rest before kyrtian had a chance to react to the first part of that statement lord kyndreth had clapped him on the back like an old friend then turned to dismiss the magic he had cast over the fighters he strode off in the direction of the manor presumably to return to the guest quarters leaving kyrtian in charge of his own people you did well men gel take over the practice was all he dared say not knowing whether he was under some covert observation he recast the magic and sergeant gel assumed command barking out orders to pair off and start sparring he watched an observer rather than a participant as the fighters went through their usual paces changing weapons changing sparringpartners until they were all drenched with sweat and exhausted it was very difficult to remain aloof his hands twitched to hold a sword and several times he had to force himself to remain quiet when someone required correction it would not do for him to correct the men himself he must be patient and wait for gel to spot the problem and deal with it kyndreth might have a man watching he could have a magical eye observing them it would not do for kyrtian to be seen wading in as if he was of no higher estate than his own drillmaster only when the men were completely exhausted did he dismiss them and permit them to return to their own quarters under the supervision of sergeant gel and only then could he return to his mothers office and find out what lord kyndreths three underlings had been doing while he and kyndreth were occupied with the fighters lady lydiell was waiting for him as he rose through the floor of her office she must have seen him approaching from the practicefield tenebrinth took them riding she said immediately knowing with that acuity that sometimes resembled a humans magic what he wanted before he even voiced the question they just wanted exercise i think they were bored tenebrinth took them on a tour of the huntingreserve which is far enough away from any of our little villages to keep anything untoward from happening and i think they may actually have done a little hunting themselves lookyou can see them from here she pointed and he went to the western side of the office peering into the distance until he caught sight of four brilliantly colored atomies making their way alongside a tree line that had been reduced by distance to a mere blur of green what about kyndreths human slaves he asked without taking his eyes off the distant riders they remained within the guestquarters except for the bodyguards who were keeping you and kyndreth under surveillance lydiell told him calmly and some of our people were in turn watching them it made me wonder how many layers of watcherswatchingwatchers we could have had before people began running into each other kyrtian turned away from the window and caught his mothers ironic smile it would be an interesting experiment that human kaeth is a very sharp fellow i have no doubt that he knew his people were being overlooked i shouldnt like to have to pit gel against him i think that gel might be outmatched in certain areas then let us hope we never need to lydiell looked at him sharply what is it that you have not told me something kyndreth said something he has yet to say kyrtian sighed chagrined that she was able to read him so easily i should know better than to think i can hide anything from her he learned the magic quite quickly actually more quickly than i had anticipated whatever else his accomplishments may be there is no doubt that he deserves his position as a mage and a great lord do not attempt to distract me i am too old to play that game with lydiell responded a touch sharply what was this about something he has yet to say he implied that he wishes to discuss something with me possibly at or after dinner have no idea what it is kyrtian tried to shrug it all off as of no importance but his mother immediately looked concerned then tried to conceal it did he say anything else she asked a little too casually one thing morethat he and his people will be leaving in the morning which is not too soon for me feeling overly confined by the relatively formal garments hed been buttoned into this morning kyrtian ruined the efforts of his bodyservants by restlessly unbuttoning the collar of his tunic and running his hands distractedly through his hair at least that is good news lady lydiell sank into her seat behind her desk i knew this charade of ours would be a strain but i hadnt expected it to be as much of a strain as it has been kyrtian nodded in agreement and took a quick glance back at the window the tiny figures were no longer so tiny and were growing larger by the momentthe riders must have decided that they had exercised enough for one day either that or kyndreth sent a magical summons to them if i am going to continue the game i had best get down to my quarters to dress for dinner ladymother since this is to be lord kyndreths last nightshouldnt we do somethingwellelaborate indeed we should and i will follow your example as soon as ive seen the cooks she rose from her chair and moved around her desk to kiss him fondly on the cheek we must show him every possible honor we need to drive it home to lord kyndreth that we are reclusive but neither mad nor barbaric kyrtian was tempted to break his longstanding habit and use illusion to augment his costume for the clothing his servants laid out for him was not the sort of thing he would have chosen for himself it was impressive yes but the plush velvet tunic of a sober midnightblue was so heavily ornamented with gold bullion and tiny beads made from sapphires and emeralds that it weighed as much as armor and the high collar was probably going to drive him to distraction before the evening was over and he could take it off nevertheless he allowed his men to assist him into the stiff costume and made his appearance in the grand dining room well ahead of their guest somehow lady lydiell had worked miracles among the cooks for there was every evidence of a meal worthy of the room in the offing the table decked in snowy damask was adorned with a dozen different glasses at each place and the sideboard was laden with small dishes and a myriad of specialized knives forks and spoons each by the rules of etiquette suited only to very particular sorts of courses also by the rules of etiquette there was only a single plate and no utensils at each place the particular silverware needed for each course would be laid with the course and whisked away again to prevent any faux pas in dining on the part of a guest when lord kyndreth and his three underlings appeared conducted by a household servant even they seemed surprised and impressed by the preparations lydiell arrived last in a gown of deceptive simplicity one that kyrtian had never seen her wear before it was only when she drew near that it was obvious that only the cut of the gown was simple with closefitting sleeves and a modest neckline it was composed entirely of miniature interwoven links and plaques of silver each no larger than a gnat each plaque studded with diamonds no larger than the head of a pin she seemed to be gowned in shimmering fishscales or that fabulous substance dragon skin and i thought my costume was uncomfortably heavy he thought in awe hed had no idea she even possessed such a thing it couldnt be illusion but where had it come from i wonder if it could turn a blade he thought as he waited for lydiell to be seated there was no telling how old such a garment might beit might even date back to evelon itself if so perhaps the ladies of those longgone days had made a virtue of the necessity of wearing protective armor even to a festive meal they took their places and the ceremonial meal began course after course until kyrtian lost count of them each course was no more than a taste a bite or two of some delicacy then the plates and cutlery were whisked away to be replaced by a new setting another dish cold dishes and hot savory salty sweet sourfragrant noodles lightly cooked and seasoned vegetables sculpted like flowers flowers made into tiny salads of petals tiny portions of barely seared meat garnished with rare herbs and sauces soups hot and chilledeach course was accompanied with a different drink this was not always wine it could be a spiced juice a tea or delicately flavored spring water whatever best complemented the course it could not be called a meal it was an event unto itself a thing which swiftly acquired its own momentum if kyrtian was amazed lord kyndreth was notalthough it seemed he was very very pleased hours passed the sunset faded outside the windows and was replaced by the night and stars kyndreth and his people exerted themselves to be charming and lady lydiell was equally charming and witty kyrtian was awed hed never seen his mother quite like this before and he had to stretch his own wits to keep pace with the others finally the last course was placed before themand the fact that it was the final course was signaled by the disappearance of every human servant the moment each plate was placed before the diners each plate held a single delicate gilded fruitice the size of lydiells graceful hand each scoop of ice had been molded into the lion of lord kyndreths house with the details picked out in sugarcrystals and pearlescent icing lord kyndreth stood up and raised his cup to lady lydiell my dear hostess he said in a voice full of warmth and admiration i cannot imagine how you conjured up a court feast on less than no notice but allow me to declare that you are surely the equal of any great mage in the land and i bow to your prowess i drink to you lady lydiell the rest answered his toast and lydiell gracefully acknowledged the compliment with a nod of her head kyndreth sat down again i can see by all of this that my judgment of your house was not mistaken if you do not move in the circles of the council it is not because you do not merit such attention but because you chose not to seek it he looked from lydiell to kyrtian and back again it was lydiell he evidently expected to answer and it was lydiell who made the reply my lord kyndreth our family has long preferred to keep our own company and live quietly and even reclusively lydiell murmured it is not out of unseemly pride i beg to urge but out of modesty and a genuine preference for a quiet and reclusive life all of usmy late husband his father before him and my son as well as myselfare more of the temperament of a scholar than of a courtier and the life of a seeming hermit suits us well perhaps our needs and pleasures may seem simple to you but we find that they satisfy every wish and desire we have for our wishes and desires are for the inner world of thought rather than the outer world which others might find stimulating but we find contentious and disturbing kyndreth sighed a bit melodramatically perhaps and i wish that you could continue to enjoy that quiet life my lady but the times i fear will not permit your modesty to deny the genuine talents that lie hidden in this little haven of yours now he turned to kyrtian lord kyrtian i do not have to tell you what your reputation is among the ignorant you have heard it already from the mouth of your kinsman aelmarkin i was prepared to discount that reputation when i accepted your invitation but now i find that your kinsman was not only incorrect he was kyndreth shook his head words fail me aelmarkin is either poisonously prejudiced against you or completely blind i have seen and heard enough in two days to convince me that despite your own disclaimers you lord kyrtian are nothing short of a military genius this is no mere eccentric hobby that you have it is a genuine vocation kyrtian opened his mouth to protest but kyndreth silenced him with a wave of his hand you have with no help other than that of some ancient manuscripts uncovered a training method that creates expert fighters in a fraction of the time we have taken heretofore and as you yourself pointed out with none of the criminal wastage that our method entails i have seen your strategic ability in action i have seen your careful attention to every aspect of military life lord kyrtian you cannot remain a hermit any longer you are desperately needed the high council needs you icannot imagine why you would think that kyrtian stammered taken completely by surprise you already hold the key to the trainingmagic and you are a greater mage than i we need your military knowledge kyndreth insisted between the wars with the wizards and the revolt of our own ungrateful offspring there are precious few with the wisdom and knowledge to command and none with your talent we need you lord kyrtian we need you to lead our armies out of the corner of his eye kyrtian saw his mother tense and realized that although he had not anticipated this demand she had you already have leaders he protested leaders of higher rank than would not dare with my backing no one would dare dispute you kyndreth countered grimly with my backing i can easily persuade every councilor that matters that you are the only possible commanding general for our forces kyrtian was dumbfounded he had hoped that kyndreths gratitude would bring them a respite from aelmarkins enmity but he had not expected kyndreth to propose he take his place among the greatest of the great lords lord kyndreth please do not think me ungratefulrather i am stunned he managed and surely you realize that i have no practical experience lord kyndreth raised his eyebrow all the practical experience of our current commander has availed him nothing he pointed out the situation with our young rebels has been in stalemate for the last month and more he paused and that is to go no further than this table only the members of the council are aware of it stalemate kyrtian bit his lip how much territory are they holding roughly half of the estates are in the hands of the rebels kyndreth replied we are fortunate that none of them are vital to the economythey were mostly estates producing little except slaves and luxuries nevertheless that is a great deal of territory to be in unfriendly handsand there are isolated estates within that territory that are still in the hands of our people loyal folk who need and deserve succor now he looked shrewdly at lydiell unless i am very much mistaken one of those is the estate of lady morthena your kinswoman lady moth lydiell paled kyrtian bit his lip granted lady moth had conspicuously not taken sides and if the rebels had troubled her lydiell certainly would have heard about it by now still she might be presumed to be in danger lady morthena is encircled and certainly trapped kyndreth continued his eyes nicking from lydiell to kyrtian as yet she has held control over her slaves so that she has prevented any incursions onto her lands as yet the rebels have not attempted any serious effort at capturing her but how long will it be until they see her as a valuable bargaining tool she is a great lady the honor of the high lords and the council would be compromised if she were to be captured and held against her will we would either be forced to abandon her which is unthinkableor make concessions to the rebels which is also unthinkable it is all unthinkable kyrtian gritted his teeth kyndreth either knew or guessed that he would be extremely loyal to those members of his familyunlike aelmarkinwho deserved loy alty he had known that lady moth was close to the territory held by the rebels for she herself had told them the young lords could not block teleson messages and did not even try so far lady moth had seemed entirely unconcerned about her position in the midst of the young lords even professing to a certain detached sympathy for their cause but lord kyndreth was right if the young lords cared to they could take lady moth captive to use her as a bargainingchip a quick glance at lydielfs face told him all he needed to know this was no idle speculation but a real possibility you must give me time to consider all you have said lord kyndreth he managed finally i amstunned i need time to shake my thoughts loose i can sympathize kyndreth said gravely but there was a smile of satisfaction in his eyes he already knew that kyrtian would agree just as kyrtian already knew he must agree it was only a matter of time and time was not his friend lord kyndreth retired to his guestsuite and the competent hands of his bodyslaves with a feeling of total contentment not only had he just savored the pleasure of enjoying an exquisitely prepared presented and served high court feast but he was perfectly well aware that he was about to acquire a most useful adherent he had seen young kyrtians reaction to the double temptations of power and the opportunity to play the hero he had also noted lady lydiells the boy might be naive but his mother was no fool and she knew that the great lord and high councilor lord kyndreth would not have made those offers if it was possible to refuse them she also knows that without my patronage that cousin of theirs will continue to be a thorn in their sides at the very least and might well find a patron powerful enough that he can take everything from them he thought with satisfaction she read that implicit threat clearly enough hed mentioned aelmarkin for just that reason in this particular game of houndsandalicorns lord kyndreth had herded the hounds into exactly the positions he wanted them his slaves undressed him and he slipped into the silk loungingrobe one of them held out for him as always his bodyguard kaeth was in unobtrusive attendance and when the last slave left the room kaeth remained a faithful shadow to be ignoredor not kaeth was equally receptive to either condition kaeths training must have been impeccable lord kyndreth only wished that he could have gotten kaeths trainers along with the bodyguard when the slave grew too old to serve it would be difficult to replace him and it would by necessity be with an inferior specimen kyndreth turned his back on his bodyguard and took a seat beside an illusory fire burning in the very real marble fireplaceone of the few illusions in this suite the flames danced with rainbow colors and as the fire burned it gave off a pleasant scent of cedar and aloeswood but no heat well kaeth kyndreth said to the fire the boy will take the bait ive no doubt he doesnt dare refuse it true my lord as always kaeth was as economical with words as with everything else hell accept by morning i expect hes as good as i think that was a statement kyndreth didnt expect kaeth to disagree the boy is going to break the deadlock for us the only reason aelmarkin managed to convince everyone that he was halfmad was because he stayed mewed up here anyone who had bothered to talk with him for more than half an hour would have known he was saneand brilliant if hed been out in society aelmarkin wouldnt have had a chance of making a laughingstock out of him he is better than you think my lord astonished lord kyndreth swiveled his head to look at his normally laconic bodyguard indeed he managed by the ancestors i cant remember the last time kaeth volunteered a comment much less an opinion this youngster must be something truly out of the ordinary i have examined his library his strategyroom and some of his own writings my lord i also watched his men when he commanded them it is one thing to command men it is another to lead them lord kyrtian is a leader men may not always obey a commanderor at least they may only obey the letter of his commands but not exert themselves beyond thatbut they will always follow a leader kaeths unreadable expression did not change by so much as a hair but lord kyndreth fancied hed heard the faintest hint of approval in the bodyguards voice interesting very interesting he turned back to the fire it wouldnt do to give kaeth too much direct attention the slave was intelligent highly intelligent and kyndreth needed to be very careful how he handled the man too much attention might give him a sense of selfimportance that could affect his usefulness all the more reason to put him in charge of the army half the time lord levelis has to drive the troops into action with pain and punishment if the troops had some other motivation that alone might ensure our victory lord levelis came the surprising reply will be mortally offended by being replaced by alesser lord again kaeth had volunteered an observation lord kyrtian must have impressed the man so much that kaeths careful selfcontrol was cracking a trifle kyndreth laughed mirthlessly by an eccentric nobody you mean but of course cannot say if his dear cousin is to be believed a halfmad nobody lord levelis will have to survive being offended he has done nothing to endear himself to me he has bungled every attempt at putting down the rebels and he is not one of my adherents i can afford to offend him let his patron find a way to console him there was no reply the human really couldnt reply to the statements without being insolent and lord kyndreth would not tolerate insolence even from a slave as trusted as his bodyguard the boys position will be safe enough when it is clear that i am his patron kyndreth continued for kaeths benefit i could have him installed tomorrow if i chose levelis has bungled too many times and he will not dare move against me or anyone i choose to replace him with perhaps not against youbut out on the battlefield lord kyrtian will no longer be under your direct supervision or protection lord levelis may move against him there my lord the battlefield is a chanceridden place and accidents do happen to even the most careful well well i do believe that is another opinion kyndreth could not resist the temptation to see what else he could draw out of kaethfurther observations even suggestions this was more than the bodyguard had shown of himself in years perhaps i should send you to watch out for his welfare he halfjested i will do whatever you direct my lord came the expressionless reply and kyndreth sighed with disappointment kaeth had revealed all that he was going toand probably would not venture so much as a bland comment for the next year kyndreth had no intention of assigning kaethwho was far too valuable where he wasto the task of seeing to kyrtians wellbeing the boy will either be able to protect himself or not and if he cannot then he does not deserve my patronage there was that bodyguard of his own after alla man who had come very close to defeating kaeth in combat having that particular slave in his train showed a certain amount of selfpreserving sense levelis wouldnt be able to eliminate him until after hed broken the stalemate anyway and by then the real work would be done and levelis could have his old position back if he really wanted it by that point kyndreth would have what he wanted credit for breaking the backs of the rebels and when the rebels were defeated kyrtian would be expendable still useful perhaps but expendable gel had stood silent watch throughout the long meal listening to the conversation with a face as impassive as that of the bodyguard kaethand when the servants vanished he did the same but he didnt go far like every public room in this manor there was a spyhole where a trusted confederate could listen to the elvenlords when they thought they were speaking among themselves he didnt trust lord kyndreth no matter how that particular elvenlord acted he would never do anything that wasnt in his own interest solely and completely in his own interest he might lull others into believing that he acted out ofsay friendship or even the altruistic wish to do someone who might deserve help a favor but there would always be a hidden reason for such actions and either a later cost or a current benefit it was moderately interesting to hear kyndreth speaking so openly in front of and to his bodyguard kaeth it wasnt unheard of or outofcharacter though after all what was the use of having a fullytrained and intelligent bodyguard if you didnt make use of all of his skills the spyhole was a clever little construction built where the chimney would have actually been had the fireplace been real and functional there was enough room to sit comfortably with one ear to the wall forehead resting against a padded projection in the utter darknessnot a single peephole not even a thin little crack to betray the possible presence of a spy here so the current commander is going to be an enemy that was no surprise though it was a good thing to have the mans name tenebrinth could put some time into investigating the fellow it might well be possible to compensate him in some way for the loss of his important post it might be possible to placate him with no more than a simple visit kyrtian plays the humble soul very well the murmur of voices in the other room continued and he strained to hear every nuance wishing he also had some way to read lord kyndreths thoughts the current commander isnt kyndreths thats good to know kyndreth probably knows next to nothing about him and if kaeth does hes only said that the fellow is going to be insulted well insults can be negated with a purging dose of humility if kyrtian paid an immediate call on levelis after accepting the appointment but before it became generally known and groveled must ask tenebrinth that can be a twoedged sword assuming that the current commander could not be placated or bought off there was a possibility that levelis would revert to the ancient ways of evelon the elvenlord was not likely to act openlyafter the display at the challengeduel hosted by aelmarkin no one was going to issue a challenge that they knew they were going to lose a challenge to a duelbymagic was possible and there were several potential ways of dealing with it kyndreth and the council could forbid it kyrtian could accept and the duel could go on and he could either win or loseand in either case gel would have to be certain that the stakes werent too high to lose what is the limit on stakes in these things must ask tenebrinth if its pretty much a token it might pay kyrtian to lose anyway but if the council forbade a duel altogether on the grounds that the challenge was specious and made purely out of pique levelis could decide to take matters into his own hands that left the possibilityif levelis had or could purchase a properlytrained slaveof assassination he wished very strongly that he had kaeth at his disposal about nowan assassin would be the best possible expert at spotting another but he didnt and i spotted kaeth so i suppose i could spot another provided he was operating in the open and not making an attempt at sniping from a distance damn he made another note make sure that kyrtians tent and person were always out of bow shot of any cover fine provided that the current battlefield site wasnt in the middle of a forest but he knew that there was no use in trying to persuade kyrtian not to go he didnt even consider the option it was too dangerous to try and decline the invitation at least in the shortterm so long as kyndreth was kyrtians sponsor aelmarkin would keep his distance damn them all for a nest of twisty snakes anyway why couldnt anyone among these pointyeared bastards ever do anything in a straightforward manner but the subject had changed and gel shoved his ear even tighter against the wall hoping for more insights kara and gianna were fussing with their clothing again hoping for a second visit from the great lord and a second present of jewels no doubt what good jewels were with only their master to see them rennati had no idea rennati sighed but quietly kara had gone through three changes of costume already and still she wasnt satisfied with the impression she was going to make she looked back at the window a doe and fawn appeared at the very edge of the lawn but quickly darted back out of view before she got more than a glimpse of them i would like a fawn more than jewels or a kitten of my own like the one that slipped in when we first came here any kind of pet kara and gianna wouldnt want to share the harem with an animal though kara tried another gown and rejected it immediatelynot that there was anything wrong with it but because she had worn it two days ago well maybe lady lydiell shouldn t have given us such extensive wardrobes when she bought us and installed us here rennati thought half of all this costumechanging is only because karas got an excuse to try on everything in her closet kara and gianna twittered at each other what did rennati need with a bird when she had them the black she said in the first available moment of silence wear the black its at the right end of the closet two heads swiveled on two swanlike necks to peer in her direction both sets of eyes blue and brown equally uncertain black kara said doubtfully but she shuddered hell think blacks not for mourning not with them rennati said anticipating karas objection i know its not a color you usually wear but lady lydiell has perfect taste and she wouldnt have put the black in your wardrobe if she didnt think youd look good in it the fair and deceptively fragile kara pursed her lips in thought i could try it i suppose the thought was mother to the act in a mere moment the gown of seventeen overdresses made of sheerest silk was in a heap on the floor and kara slid the heavy satin black over her head while gianna picked up the discarded gown shook it out and put it back in the wardrobe gianna fortunately had a mania for neatness kara smoothed the biascut gown over her flat stomach settled the pointed neckline and twitched the long sleeves so that the points of the cuffs came down precisely over the backs of her hands then turned to gaze at her reflection gianna was already staring in awe her lips pursed oooh kara she enthused its perfect rens right wear it and it was perfect karas mistyblue eyes in the reflection were wide with surprise as she pulled her long hair over one shoulder to fall in a silvergilt cascade along the shining black satin rennati smothered a smile remember those silverandjet ornaments that puzzled you in the jewelchest she prompted i would bet that theyre meant to go with the black as the other two women dove for the jewelchest rennati went back to her own thoughts she and gianna were more than ready for any potential call for their services it was only kara whod been indecisive kara could never make up her mind about anything and preferred to be led by the other two which was fine with rennati gianna was the natural leader of the harem if one could be called a leader in a group of three rennati was indifferent to who took the lead in such pressing questions as what to eat what music to play or what to wear even now kara sat passively while gianna decided what to do with her hair and the wealth of silver and black ornaments that were obviously supposed to go into a coiffure gianna had been ready hours ago last night she had worn a closecut scarlet velvet gown with a cleavage so low and tight that she nearly popped out of itnot that with her generous features she wasnt perilously close to popping out of anything she wore tonight she favored a dusty rose that was not tightfitting at all but plunged so low in the back that there was not a single one of her perfectlysculptured vertebrae that was not on show and as usual she had made up her mind after swiftly rifling through her closet rennati had been ready even earlier last night she had worn an emeraldgreen sheath that matched her eyes slit to the hips on either side and tonight it was a pale green tunic with an asymmetrical hem and no shoes she didnt expect lord kyndreth to get to her anyway she expected to dance while the other two worked their wiles on him lord kyndreth had expressed pleasure with her dancing last night and she hadnt even begun to show off her talent if the other two occupied his bed that would give her a rare moment alone to activate her telesonring to speak with her real mistress she hadnt learned muchexcept that kyndreth was pleased very pleased with lord kyrtian and intended to become his patronbut she remembered lady trianas instructions to report everything they hadnt yet been allowed out of the tiny harem though neither kara nor gianna particularly cared rennati would have liked the chance to get out rare though it might be for a concubine to have that chance but she had to admit that although the suite was relatively small it was sumptuously appointed and should satisfy most cravings it even had windows gazing out on the world from the look of things their suite was in a tower for the windowseat where rennati lounged was at some height above a wide green lawn there were trees in the far distance although with twilight darkening the sky it was hard to distinguish anything but a vague bluish blur at the end of the lawn this was a novelty rennati had never been in a harem that had a view of the world she had last seen as a young child and she spent as much time as possible in the windows watching the rest of lord kyrtians slaves walking from here to there with purpose in their steps or even working on that plushy grass anything they might possibly have wanted had been supplied to them there were the usual lutes and harps to play on if they desired or they could leave the instruments to play by themselves with a touch of the hand on a little silver stud in the neck if they chose the latter the instruments somehow also supplied an accompaniment of drums bells and flutes there were materials for embroidery and beadwork scents cosmetics of every sort hairdressing instruments and even books though rennati was the only one of the three of them who could read with any proficiency the bathroom was small but one didnt necessarily need a bath one could swim in and the food invariably pleasant if not sumptuous still one didnt particularly want a feast presented to one every day in a harem it was altogether too easy to overeat and that would be a disaster for the figure the doorchime sent the other two into a flutter and rennati rose from the window seat to join them as they flew into the receptionchamber together lord kyndreth tall broadshouldered and handsome enough for any two humans strode unaccompanied into the room all three of them dropped to the floor in a profoundly deep curtsy the moment his foot crossed the threshold he laughed at karas eager face as she looked up at him well last night you were a lily so what are you tonight hmm he teased a black narcissus perhaps i am whatever your lordship pleases to call me kara replied rising first with an expression of adoration she probably didnt feel adoration but she was adept at assuming any expression she thought might be met with pleasure as it should be he responded gesturing to kara and gianna and gathering each into an arm come now last night i had but a brief introduction to flamehairs dancing and i am eager to see more he took a seat on a couch piled high with silk and velvet pillows still with a girl on either side to minister to him rennati made the rounds of the room touching each of the waiting instruments in turn then set the time for the dance by clapping her hands for a measure the instruments in concert struck up a lively piece she let it play through for four measures before leaping out into the room and setting her flying feet into motion this if anything was what she lived for she would rather have died than not dance her first owner a lord of discriminating tastes so he styled himself and limited means had grown bored with her passion and had decided to dispose of her in a private sale to finance the purchase of a new girl to train theres nothing at all wrong with her hed told lady triana its just that shes always dancing id really like to find a new girl who has talents that are a little more restful one doesnt always want prancing about its very fatiguing to watch after a while for lord kyndreth however rennatis passion apparently had the virtue of novelty even if he was so busy with kara and gianna that he paid scant attention to the nuances of rennatis performance and long before she was weary he was fully involved with them ornaments had been removed and set carefully aside along with a few bits of clothing and when rennati signaled the instruments to play quietly to themselves and stole out of the room none of the three even noticed that was fair enough shed been lord kyndreths first last night which had left kara out kara no doubt wanted a chance for a better present tonight rennati stole up the stairs to the uppermost story of the tower where their bedrooms werenot so much bedrooms as curtainedoff alcoves of a room meant never to be seen by the eyes of a lord here they could practice with cosmetics sometimes to hilarious effect here they kept the litter of their previous lives personal belongings too shabby for a lord to see kara had a battered old doll much loved and worn and every bit of jewelry she ever owned going right back to a string of pierced seashells some little boychild had once given her up to her own efforts with needle and beads there were a dozen worksinprogress on a table along with a doll being costumed with beads and bits gianna had managed to keep hold of all of her attempts at artwork and kept her supplies and easel up here she was making an attempt at a stilllife of karas worktable but kara kept moving things around much to her frustration rennati had booksnot the pretty leatherbound volumes of poetry downstairs but dirty old things with torn covers or no covers at all on every subject under the sun rescued from the lords trashheaps and of course she had lady trianas telesonring with a few hesitant words she activated it it was too small to allow a picture it sent and received voices only as she had been told to expect the first voice was unfamiliar who calls the voice asked rennati she replied breathlessly a little astonished and a little fearful to be holding a thing of such great magic in her hand ahwait one moment lady triana will wish to speak with you herself the ring a beryl like the one in her collar fell silent rennati waited patiently so long as no one came up here to interrupt her she would wait for as long as she was told to elvenlords were busy and it was not reasonable to expect one to drop whatever she was doing simply to come and hear what a mere concubine had to say finally speak said an imperious female voice from the ring i have been here since your agent sent me to lady lydiell rennati said instantly i am with two other concubines in a tower in a small harem i can see outside from the windows but i have not yet been allowed to venture past the door lord kyrtian has been here once only he is entertaining lyon lord kyndreth who was here last night and is here now lord kyndreth is going to become lord kyrtians patron he told kara tonight that lord kyrtian has pleased him and that we must not expect to see very much of our master for some time since he is going to go away to take charge of an army there was an odd laugh well that rather puts a kink in my plans if he wont be there you wont be able to learn much from him on the other hand if you do manage to get out you can see a great deal more when the lord himself is away and this other newsmore than interesting i take it that this is all you have for me for now rennati nodded forgetting for a moment that she could not be seen then hastily said i am sorry but that is indeed all i have learned it is not a great deal but the quality is good and i am pleased notify me the moment you learn anything more you may deactivate the ring now obediently rennati passed her hand over the ring shutting out the light from the room for a moment which turned it into an ordinary beryl again then she placed the ring in the darkest comer of her jewelbox and hurried back downstairs after all it was not too late to earn another generous present from lord kyndrethand more importantly he might be inclined to talk afterwards elvenlord or human if they didnt sleep they were all often inclined to talkafterwards the sun shining down on the top of the highest tower of the ladykeep imparted a drowsy warmth to lady moths back that she was thoroughly enjoying she had always liked the gentle heat of the sun her late husband had once scornfully accused her of being halflizard for the way she enjoyed basking in the garden but even if it had been the dead of winter she would have been up here for this was the only place on the entire estate that gave an unrestricted view down into the valley below and what she watched through the eyepiece of her bit of antique equipment was fascinating indeed there was no breeze to stir the silken silveryblue folds of her dress or disturb the simple straight fall of her hair nor to make breezes wave distant branches between her and the interesting scene so far away in the valley she felt sorry for the tiny little figures that she knew by their drab tunics were human slaves first one brightlycolored creature in scarlet paraded them out and set them to work in the kitchengarden then a second appeared clad in a violent blue far too soon for them to have accomplished much and marched them off to drill with weapons then a third emerged from the stables this one in bronze satin and ran them off into the farmfields what those poor bewildered slaves must be thinking now she could not even begin to guess lady morthena said a diffident voice from behind the elven lady what are you doing lady moth took her eye away from the eyepiece of the oldfashioned goldandbronze telescope and turned to smile at her most recent guest i am using an old device my dear she said to the younger woman in a kindly voice knowing that lady viridina would never have seen such a thing as a telescope in fact it dates quite back to evelonor at least the lenses in it do it is called a telescope and although i normally use it to examine stars at the moment i am using it to spy upon our neighbors she patted the long cylinder of bronze with ornate curlicues chased into the metal and inlaid with gold wire for it was a very old friend and longtime companion lady viridinas pale brow wrinkled with puzzlement with a faint frown on a face that was attenuated by long illness why are you bothering to do that she wondered they already tell you everything dont they that my dear is what i am ascertaining for myself lady moth put her eye back to the eyepiece and continued to make mental notes on the movements of the young lords slaves outside the great house in point of fact i rather doubt that they are telling me everything for instance there seems to be some disagreement down there about just who is in charge of what just during the time i have been sitting here i have seen one hapless group of slaves herded from one uncompleted task to another by three different young lords she chuckled and her laughter was echoed faintly by her companion who patted the knot of long silver hair at the back of her head selfconsciously that is what comes with age viridina suspicion i stopped taking things at face value a very very long time ago so did ibut the difference between us i think is that you found other ways of finding out what you needed to know and i didnt even try viridina said ruefully twisting her hands in the fine silk of her flowing and manylayered violet gown if i had perhaps she didnt finish the sentence but lady moth was not about to allow her to sink into selfrecrimination if you had i doubt that it would have materially changed anything you and i were firmly under the thumbs of our unlamented lords and no knowledge or even foreknowledge would have allowed us to change what happened to us knowledge is not always power she smiled again if it was fond as i am of my tower it would be lady moth who ruled the manor down there and not that rabble of young lords lady moth had known very well that there was going to be a slave revolt when the young lords staged their own revolution against their elders her own slaves had told her she had already taken herself out of her disagreeable husbands home she had made a bargain with himif he gave her the ladykeep which had been the dowagerhouse attached to his estate she would make no trouble for him when he filed a divorcement with the council he had his eye on a very young elven girl his tastes had begun to run to the barelypubescent in the past few yearsand he was heartily tired of the wife who could not or would not take him as seriously as he thought he should be taken i wish you had managed to take the manor lady viridina sighed wistfully i hate to think what damage those careless boys are wreaking to your beautiful home lady moth only shrugged i have an equally beautiful home hereand much more manageable she pointed out its probably just as well that i didnt try for her part she had been so heartily tired of her lord that given that she would not be required to remarry and could have an establishment however small of her ownshe was prepared to allow him to say whatever he pleased about her in order to obtain his freedom she suspected that he would claim she was pleasuring herself with human slavesbut as it fell out he never got the chance so her reputation survived intact may i look viridina finally asked allowing her curiosity to overcome her reticence moth just laughed showed her how to focus the instrument and rose so that dina could take her seat moths husband had not even lived to encounter the revolt though without a doubt if he had he and his son would have been on opposite sides of the conflict her son who had suddenly become as conservative as his father once he was in the ruling seat had managed to be slaughtered almost immediately and her daughter had fled after an abortive attempt to rule the manor herself had failed miserably lady moth as was the tradition in her family had always treated her slaves with consideration and respect entirely as if they were servants not slaves and as if they were free to leave her service if they chose to she had taken all her slaves with her to the tower every slave for which she could concoct even the remotest excuse to have with her a fact which probably would have provided ample fodder for her husbands accusations once there she had deactivated the elfstones in all of their collars making them merely decorative shams and told them frankly that they now were free to go or stay they all to a man and woman chose to stay when the revolt was at the breakingpoint her slaves had told her they had fortified the place she had armed those who knew how to use weapons together they had outfaced rebellious exslaves and young lords in fact her burly young guards called her little mother and took as much care of her as if she had truly given birth to themunlike her own offspring why not use scrying instead of this device dina asked moving the telescope to gaze at another part of the valley because my dear the place is adequately shielded against scryingoh not by magic by all that iron and steel theyve managed to collect she stared down at the valley one finger tapping her lips thoughtfully very clever of them actually there arent three of them together that are a match for a single one of the old lords but the metal does their work for them needless to say her sons magic had not been enough to save him from enraged and mistreated humans who came in the middle of the night to beat him to death in his own bedespecially not when they arrived bedecked in thin iron armbands during the chaos of the revolt itself some of her sons slaves had escaped to her the rest fled to the wizards and the wilderness when more armed bands of escaped slaves had come upon the tower her people protected and guarded her while she stood ready to use deadly warmagics if it became necessary she knew about the effects of iron and steel she would not have made any attempt to blast attackers unlike those foolish elvenlords like dinas husband she planned to blast holes into the earth beneath their feetor to use her magic to launch large and heavy objects at them most of her anxiety had not been for herself but for her people if they could not convince their fellow humans to go away peaceably she didnt want them hurt on her behalf and she didnt want them to have to witness what she might have to do to protect them all dina stood and relinquished her seat with a smile very clever of you to know the things that cant be interfered with by that metal she said as moth took her seat again not clever dear only resourceful if i were clever id have managed to find a way to eavesdrop on them that irritated her she still hadnt managed to insinuate a reliable spy into their slavestock she was not entirely certain what her people had told marauders during those first weeks of the revolt to dissuade them from attacking the tower there probably had been several different stories specifically tailored to each group it was true enough that a few select escapees had decided to swell the ranks of her own folkno doubt because they were unwilling or unable to make the strenuous journey over the mountains to an uncertain and probably uncomfortably barbaric existence in the wilderness not that she blamed them in the least she had always had an ample portion of ladymagic and although her husband had not been aware of the fact she was his equal in the realms of elven magic usually taught only to men had it been necessary she could have defended the tower as well as many elvenlords and probably better than most now her magic went to ensuring the continued survival of her diminished estate she did everything needed to ensure exactly the right weather for the farm fields she went over the fields and gardens daily to monitor and encourage growth and health in plants and animals she had the knowledge and the long memory to tell them what they needed to do and when they trusted her her learning her judgment her experience that was what she had brought to the table they had brought their labor returning to the grand tradition of her family they had worked together to make sure that elvenblood and humanblood prospered is there anything youd like me to do this afternoon dina asked diffidently moth examined her friend carefully there had been moments in those first days after viridina took refuge with her that she truly felt that viridina would never be entirely sane again but dina was stronger than moth had first thought even after escaping murder at her lords hands and seeing her lord incinerated virtually at her feet she had not truly had a breakdown of her senses it took time and careful tending but she had recovered moth decided that it was time for her to help do her part here would you make the rounds of the kitchengardens for me dear i would really appreciate it and i know you must have tended your own gardens thousands of times i neednt tell you what to do moth felt herself both justified and rewarded when dinas face lit up gladly i have been feeling so she gestured frustration with both hands so useless and a burden on you you have never been a burden moth lied gracefully dina only smiled recognizing the lie and the graciousness behind it and turned to go back down the stairs her sleeves and trailing hem fluttering behind her after most of the escaping slaves were gone but before moth had a chance to move herself and her people back to the great house the young lords had moved in occasionally even now she cursed herself for hesitatingbut on the other hand the great house was much less defensible and even with her new followers she still had really not enough people to adequately staff and run a property that was ten times the size of that attached to the tower the young lords had taken over the abandoned estate they had brought their own slaves with them lady moth was not entirely certain where they had gotten those slaves many of them seemed terribly young for the work they were required to do she suspected that the young lords had raided the breedingfarms of some of the old lords while the latter were occupied with the fighting carrying off hordes of confused and frightened creatures barely out of childhood poor poor things she thought taking one last look through the telescope her lips tightening well at least there are enough of them to do the work they are ordered to do and they are saved one horror their masters are too busy with their own concerns to abuse them confusion is the worst they have to face the reason she had asked dina to take her place in working the garden was that she had an appointment with the young lords quite soon and it was bound to be stressful she had come up here in the first place to get a little more information before she faced them now it was time to change into a ridinghabit and make the short journey over to their stronghold she chose her clothing carefully a tailored severe habit of stark black with only the barest hints of silver at the cuffs and throat she dressed to intimidate the last thing she wished to be thought was feminine her groom brought her horse around along with her guards and she mounted and made the short journey to what had once been her home she was accompanied by four burly young menhumans not elves and humans that wore scalearmor of iron not bronze and had ostentatiously bare necks moth had played the game of wits and treachery for centuries before these striplings had ever been born they were one and all less than a century old when she swept into the meetingchamber in her trim sablesilk riding habit her hair in an uncompromising knot bound in a black silk snood with all four of her escorts flanking her they found themselves rising from their seats despite whatever their original intentions had been in the way of greeting she paused at her seat looked gravely up and down the table with an unreadable expression and only then did she sit which in turn allowed them to resume their seats she might not be the leader here but in their hearts they all acknowledged her power which is more than their fathers would then again she probably wouldnt ever use tactics this crude with their fathers she listened without comment to the reports of their progressor lack of itagainst their fathers the situation was clearly at stalemate and had been for some time now this was not necessarily bad and had they asked her opinion she would have advised patience when there is stalemate it is often possible for frustration to drive one side or the other to make a crucial mistake but of course they didnt ask her opinion and she didnt offer itsince it was clear that they would not believe a mere female would have any experience relevant to the mans work of warfare as if they have any she thought without amusement but warfare was not why she had come to this meeting eventually they got around to the topic she wished to cover in the form of a single casual comment by one of the least intelligent to her mind of the lot occasioned by one of her bodyguards stifling a cough at one of the more fatuous suggestions lady morthena said lord alrethane with a frown on his face i really do not know what you are thinking allowing armed and uncontrolled slaves to continue in your service they are not slaves they are my willing servants she countered smoothly i find that i sleep better knowing that my sleep is guarded by faithful people who serve me from loyalty and not because they are forced to loyalty loyalty alrethane exploded are you actually ascribing a civilized emotion to these simpleminded barbarians theyre a bare step above the beasts another discreet cough reminded him that he was insulting people who were freemen armed and protected with armor that would stop both magic and blades he stopped abruptly and averted his eyes he has a point someone said morthena looked up and down the table again examining expressions and was disappointed so nothing has changed she had hoped that some at least of the young lords would have started to see sense insofar as the humans were concerned the young lords were of two camps the majoritya scant majority but enoughheld humans and halfbloods in the same contempt as did their elders the minority led and coached by lady moth wanted to see humans and halfbloods given equal status with elves so far none of those she considered to be wavering had changed their minds she had hoped that this particular display showing just how far she trusted her people would have had some effect at least the minority saw to it that the human slaves owned by the rest were not mistreated and there have been enough chances already that those who had the courage and initiative to escape to the wizards have already done so the slaves they now had probably served out of the usual mix of fear of the collar an inability to imagine that anything could be different and an inability to get their hands on any iron or steel which would render a slavecollar useless she suspected that it was the former two reasons that were the strongest since anyone who really wanted the metal rings that would negate the collars could have one from moths people just by asking pity would only take her so far if the slaves here couldnt look beyond their fear if they didnt have the basic intelligence to imagine something different from their current life she couldnt help them i wont press the issue any further if i do ill only weaken my own party and if the rest of these young fools turn on me i will have to barricade myself within my own lands and hope they grow bored with me there would be no point in trying to flee i am not at all sanguine about the likelihood of a full elvenlord finding a welcome among the wizards even if dinas children are among them her thoughts were momentarily distracted by that reminder of dinas children poor dina she hadnt heard anything from them since they parted from her on moths doorstep it was af ter all just as likely they were in hiding somewhere other than among the halfblooded wizards only one of them was a halfblood anywaylorryn the boy sheyrena was of full elven blood and she could not imagine the girl being welcomed by the wizards its likely that although lorryn might have been able to convince the wizards that sheyrena was not actually an immediate danger to them when he first encountered them he would never be able to convince them that rena is completely harmless and if he couldnt convince them that his own sister wasnt going to bring disaster on them hed never be able to make them believe that an ancient elven lady like moth was on their side poor poor dina she worried so much about them although she tried not to show it the one regret that moth had was that there was no way for her to discover if dinas two children were all right or even where they were it is the most likely actually that rena is ensconced somewhere off in the wilderness far from elvenlord human or halfblood she has magic enough to keep herself safewell according to dina she has magic enough to control alicorns and lorryn would never allow her to come to harm or suffer any wantif hes with the wizards hell see to it that shes got food enough and shelter in a way she envied the two youngsters if id had the youth and the opportunity id have gone right off the map the world is wide after all wide enough to hide dragons from us for all these centuries it can certainly hide a few elves who dont wish to be found the conversation had made a wide detour around the question of the slaves and was back on the topic of the war someone wished aloud for some secret that would allow the select elimination of some of the leaders that would throw a good fright into them the callow youngster said with a savagery worthy of any barbarian and bestial human let a few more of them die the way lord dyran died and theyll give us whatever we want moth held her tongue it was just as well that the young lords were not aware that dina and her daughter managed to incinerate dinas husband the lord treves in a way very sim ilar to the way lord dyrans son slew him her own trusted servants knew and they had kept it a strict secret and she was quite grateful to them for preserving that secret these young hotheads should never learn something that dangerous they d probably manage to kill each other with it eventually the meeting ground down to its inevitable conclusion and moth rose with your permission gentlemen i should like to go tend to the library until sunset if i may she asked politely they didnt even take a second thought about her request young lord ketaliarn waved vaguely at her and she took that as permission and left trailed faithfully by her escort of all the things that showed how callow they were this was by far the most blatant they considered the library to be useless fit only for the concern of silly old ladies half living in the past they thought all she was doing was cleaning and preserving the booksremoving a few now and then for her own amusement in her bower oh the young fools the room she now entered one of the finest libraries ever assembled in this world was had they only had the wit to realize it full of information the young lords could use to help their own cause she breathed deeply of the scent of leather vellum parchment and paper took a long look around the shelves that her husband had only seldom permitted her to access while he was alive and set to work many of the oldest books had not been tended in far too long she would not permit any book however trivial to suffer from the worms tooth or the decay of age whenever she was here she spent a few hours in cleaning and restoring those ancient booksno matter how trivial they seemed to be there was no telling when some scrap of knowledge in them might prove useful most of her time however was spent in looking for the ones that she would rather not leave to the curious eyes of the young lords lady moth had helped young kyrtians father with his research in this very library once or twice before his disappear ance and she was well aware that he had known better than she what lay here she only knew within her own books was a set of very very ancient works that kyrtians father had consulted in his searches for ancient secrets she did not know which books they were nor what they held nevertheless since she had been forced to quit the place she had been determined that at the first chance she would get in here and find them again since the young lords got here she had been using her visits to find each and every one of those precious volumes and take them back to the tower a few at a time whatever was in them had led to the death of one ervenlord she suspected that what he had gone seeking had somehow killed him which implied that the secrets to be found in those books could be very very dangerous indeed none of the young lords cared what she did in there so as she worked on the task of keeping the library cleaned and preserved and she ferreted out those precious few books so that one day perhaps she could present them to kyrtian they were completely oblivious to the value of what she was taking out right underneath their very noses i shall have to do some research of my own im afraid she reflected a dangerous secret was exactly what she was looking for after all there were a few old halfremembered stories of things that had been abandoned right after the crossing and techniques that had been forgotten in the haste to find and build a secure haven for her part at the moment she would be happy to find some way to communicate with her nephew other than by teleson or messenger she had just been informed this morning of a very disturbing rumoras yet unconfirmed but she had been hoping to hear something either to confirm or deny it at todays meeting one of her servants took periodic and very risky ventures into the lands still held by the old lords coming back just after dawn with the situation as viewed from the enemys vantageand he had told her that there was a report that kyrtian had taken command of the old lords army if that was true if that is true then the other side has made a desperate gamble and all unknowing has hit upon the one thing that will probably give them victory and the thing is these young fools will be dead certain that putting kyrtian in command of the enemy is going to be the one thing that will ensure the old lords defeat young idiots if only she could speak to him and persuade him that she was one of the rebels surely he would think twice about his current allegiance i dont dare use a telesonthose are too easily monitored and none of my humans have the human type of magic that lets them talk mindtomind with each other and i wont send one of my people where he might be captured or conscripted into the army it is a terrible position to be in she was going to have to start studying these old tomes herself after all it was a far better idea than sitting with her hands folded waiting for disaster to overtake all of them besides she decided firmly shoving another ancient volume into the saddlebag for her guard to take with him i will never sit by with folded hands while things fall to pieces not even if someone ties me into the chair and binds my hands together in the heart of the citadel the home of the halfblooded wizards lorryn ignored the drone of voices around the table and took just a moment to marvel at his surroundings it seems so strange even now to finally be myself no illusions no carefully hiding what i am in spite of everything all the hardships all the danger even the silly aggravations lorryn was not sorry to be here among halfbloods like himself at last this most spacious of caverns in their new home that the wizards used as a meetinghall was a pleasant place in which to find oneselfso long as no one was meeting in it a peculiarity of the caverns allowed a wonderful flow of fresh air through here so long as certain openings that served as doors and windows were left open to catch the summer breezes last winter things had gotten a little stale in this room and with such a high ceiling it tended to be dank and chill unfortunately for his sheer pleasure there was a meeting going on and lorryn was glad that he had ample experience in keeping a pleasant expression plastered on his face while he himself was not feeling in the least pleasant he had a headache like a tight band around his head and he had inserted his tongue a trifle between his teeth to keep from grinding them and making the headache worse how is it that caellach gwain has managed to find the precise nasal whine best calculated to set my nerves on edge he asked himself as he nodded affably at the elder wizard he actually couldnt make out more than half of what the man said thanks to the weird acoustics in the place but then he didnt have to listen to caellach to know what he was going to say the man is like a teleson stuck on endless repetition of the last thing it sent this was supposed to be a meeting about the progress made in setting up the sheep and cattle farm below the citadel but caellach had taken it over as usual he was intent only on recreating as much of the old comfort of the first citadel in their new home as he could manage and he had taken the opportunity of a brief allusion to the old citadel to air his usual grievance which is of course that the wizards are not treated like elvenlords of the high council old fool hasnt he figured out yet that when one group lords it over another the underlings are going to want to strike back the old mans litany of complaints was as familiar to lorryn as the texture of the wooden table he stared at as he controlled his temper and his expression the beginning middle and end of caellachs troubles were seated in his own greed he wanted all the effort of the younger wizards and the humans to go into making him as cossetted as he had been before the second halfblood war he didnt care that they had to be selfsufficient now and couldnt steal magically from the elvenlords anymore he didnt trouble himself to think that it was far more important to see to the raising of sheep goats and cattle the cultivation of fields than to scrub an old wizards floor on a daily basis and he absolutely hated that the majority of the halfbloods voting down caellach and his cronies had made treaties of alliance with the iron people and with the trader clans giving them the status of full equals and honored partners these were fullblooded humans who had the status of full equals and honored partners though he did not dare come out and say so directly this attitude incensed caellach and his ilk for to their minds the halfblooded wizards were clearly superior in every way to mere humans and thus should be treated as such and we should all be running and fetching for them tending to their comfort giving them of ourselves and the first fruits of our labors so as to reward them for the fatiguing effort of their magics on our behalf lorryn who was not only halfblooded himself but had been brought up as an elvenlord with all of the attendant privileges found caellachs attitude just as insulting and absurd as any of the highly independent iron people or trader clan folk did there was nothing inherently superior about a wizard yes they had magics but so did the humans and since they had been settled here in the new citadel the older wizards had not exerted themselves once for the common goodexcept rarely to teach some of the children how to use their powers rather than listening to caellachs words lorryn listened to the tone behind the words hed discovered he possessed an interesting knack for ferreting out the emotions and motives behind what people said provided that they werent as skilled at covering themselves as he was he heard injured selfesteem and affrontthat was expectedbut he also heard fear and that was interesting he had not anticipated that i should have though he thought raising his eyes and study ing caellachs expression as the man shifted his eyes away from lorryns direct gaze caellach was looking a bit unkempt now that there was no one to wait on him his clothing the usual long robe affected by most of the older wizards was a bit stained and frayed about the hem his grey hair was brushed but no longer hung about his shoulders in a kind of thick mantleinstead it was held back untidily in a tail and it seemed to lorryn that it had gotten a bit thin at the temples people do tend to react to new things either with interest or fear and really i think caellach gwain is too hidebound to react with interest to anything new lorryn already knew that caellach was afraid of the dragons that was abundantly clear to anyone with half an eye the old wizard wouldnt set foot outside when there were dragons about in their natural form and as for the ones shifted into halfblood or human shapewell if they took seats on one side of the table it was a safe bet that caellach would place himself as far from them as physically possible while still remaining at the table his dislike of the traders and the iron people was a little more complicated and harder to understand lorryn let a few of the old wizards actual wordsladen with anger and apprehensionsift in past his own thoughts what in the world had the old mans trews in a wad and how dare they demand payment in advance much less at all for ah that was enough to get the key lorryn had the tail of the treesnake now caellach wasnt incensed that he was expected to pay in advance for the goods that the traders brought here he was angry that he was expected to pay at all possibly because caellachs only available coin was quite frankly debased he wasnt the most powerful wizard anymore he wasnt the most skilled and his greed had led him to expend most of his energies on his own comforts leaving him with little that he could use to barter for things he wanted and as for thosebarbarians third leg to the stool he was incensed that the iron people showed him no deference at alland didnt need his magic though why caellach should think that a mob of illregulated cavedwelling refugees should consider themselves more civilized than a wellregulated nomadic people was beyond lorryns imagination but prejudice has nothing to do with logic perhaps it was because the iron people were completely unimpressed by the wizards they didnt need wizards to defend themselves from the elvenlords they had their iron ornaments and a powerful warrior class not to put too fine a point on it they had actually held two elvenlords as enslaved prisoners for the purposes of their own amusement the most that caellach gwain had ever managed was to escape relatively unscathed from them that had been a near thing too caellach and his cronies either did not realize or would not admit that it wasnt the elvenbanes fault entirely that the old citadel and its dwellers had been discovered the wizards had been dancing on the edge of a knife for a very long time what with their pilferings from the elvenlords and all so far as the elves were concerned there was only one kind of good halfblooda dead one halfbloods werent even supposed to exist and most of the elvenlords were utterly devoted to making certain that they didnt lashanas actions had only triggered the avalanche of elven retribution not caused it and if it hadnt been for her quick thinking and her draconic friends the wizards wouldnt have survived it what was more they werent out of the woods yet as long as the halfblooded wizards lived the elvenlords would try to eliminated them treaty or no treaty if caellach gwain and his circle thought any differently they were deluding themselves not that there was anything new in the notion of caellach gwain deluding himself finally caellach ran out of things to say and sat down lorryn had very quickly figured out that allowing the old wizard to rant and whine while unpleasant to listen to generally had the salubrious effect of making him silent for the rest of any meeting of which he was a part thank you caellach your experience is as always apparent to all of us he said graciously caellach began to preen your observations are continuously fascinating he ignored the grimace that one of the younger halfbloods made at him from behind the shelter of one hand and the spasms that crossed several other faces in an effort to keep from bursting out into laughter nowid like to put the matter of the proposed upper pasture for the goats to a vote all in favor even caellach raised his hand seduced no doubt into thinking that the goats would look after themselves and not require shepherds now that they had some of the huge cattledogs raised by the iron people at their disposal lorryn made certain that there were no dissenters and nodded good were all agreed halfden would you see about finding some volunteers for the job and getting them to me to be interviewed he needed humans for this task preferably children with the ability to speak mindtomind so that they could call for help if they saw anything or if there was something out there that neither they nor the dogs could handle more of the servants that caellach gwain thinks are his personal property halfden one of the older exslaves nodded and lorryn called the meeting to a close but like it or not he wasnt quite done with caellachat least so far as caellach was concerned i really need to talk with you about the quality of my quarters lorryn the wizard said grabbing him by the elbow before he could make his escape lorryn leveled a blank gaze at him my good sir he said with the kind of polite tone in which a specious warmth and charm were mixed with utter calm if you think you are being slighted i invite you to come and inspect my quartersor shanas for that matter i think you will find that they are by no means superior to yours in fact given that neither of us chose our rooms until everyone else had gotten their pick youll find them far inferior to yours yes but caellach protestedalthough weakly since he had been in the little nook of a cave that lorryn used and knew that it was scarcely larger than the closet in his own suite of linked cavelets i know that it is trying to you to be in such primitive sur roundings after having to abandon such a wonderful and comfortable place as your old home lorryn said now interjecting a soothing note into his voice who could know better than i do think what i left behind i was the only male heir to a powerful lord but you will soon find this life as exhilarating as i do if you regard it as an opportunity rather than a loss think of it you now have the chance to design your very own quarters in precisely the way youd most like themrather than be forced to endure inconveniences and awkwardnesses that countless generations of wizards before you created with a little effort you can for the first time have everything perfect yesbut caellach faltered there you see lorryn slapped him lightly on the back that seems better already doesnt it i knew i could rely on you and with that he strolled away leaving caellach to go over the conversation in his mind and try to determine what could possibly have gone wrong as he rounded a corner someone jumped at him from the shadows instinctively he sidestepped and drew his hidden dagger with a defensive magic meant deflect a levinbolt already in place youre getting better shana laughed leaning against the rock wall with her arms crossed over her chest looking quite as if she had not been catapulting herself across the hallway from a natural niche just at the level of his head a moment before i should hope so he retorted you certainly give me enough practice were you listening in on the meeting i wasand you are a genius and some sort of mage that i havent quite figured out she tilted her head to the side quizzically how you manage caellachand how you manage to not strangle caellachis quite beyond me lorryn laughed and offered her his hand which she took no magicjust politics he told her verbal selfdefense i didnt spend much time among the schemers and plotters but i did hobnob with some of them and of course i always had to be able to placate my father i learned early how to say nothing while seeming to say everything she squeezed his hand its still sheer genius no matter how hard i try i cant manage people half as well as you do he glanced aside at the young woman called the elvenbane she didnt look like the stuff of legends her scarlet tresses were tied up onto the top of her head in a very practical tail which she often tossed like an impatient horse plagued with flies her handsome face was nothing in beauty compared to the homeliest of elven ladies and her figure was so wellmuscled that most of them would have recoiled in horror at the notion of looking like her today she had on a sleeveless tunic of leather and a pair of coarse slavescloth trewsbut to his eyes she couldnt have looked better if shed been enrobed in his sister sheyrenas presentationgown i hope you arentbothered by me taking on all these meetings like this he said hesitantly youre supposed to be the leader i know but am i jealous oh fire and rain get that idea out of your head this moment she replied with a laugh i never asked to be the elvenbane you knowand the only reason besides that stupid legend that people pay any attention to what i think is that i think quicker than they do handling the old goats is not a job that requires quick thinkingand you have the she considered for a moment head tilted to one side the manner born is how id put it you say things and people do them instead of arguing with you about it he thought that if she was dissembling in any way he would be able to tell he was getting pretty sensitive to her nuances not that she had many for she was a strikingly open person no she seemed to be happy with him taking her leadership role if i could find a double to play elvenbane for me id do that in a heartbeat she continued onwards oblivious of his scrutiny and then i could just be shana again speaking of just being shanaoh crafty one he led her down a side passage that brought them out onto the top of the citadel into the warm air and sunshine where they could sit and talk without being overheard she didnt fling herself down onto the grass as she usually did when brought outside crafty one hmm i know what that means she sauntered casually up the hill a little ways to a grassy knoll with a shadetree atop itdownwind of the halfhidden entrance now they could speak without being overheard only then did she drop down into the grass in the sun with all of the pleasure of her fostermother dragon in basking ask away she said as he plopped down beside her ive just spent the better part of the morning talking to keman but i need your help to reach shadow shana freed from the responsibilities of the daytoday running of the citadel was concentrating on the vastly more important project of collecting intelligence reports by means of amplified telepathy from keman and some of the other people she and lorryn had out in the greater world although it would not be possible to send either a human or a halfblood into the midst of elves to spy under a spell of illusion the halfbloods were not limited to illusion as long as they had dragons with them for the dragons could actually shift their shape to appear like anyone or anything they liked shanas fosterbrother keman and his probable mate dora were shanas shapechanged spies among both camps of elves your mother is not only doing well so far as dora can tell shes taking over some of lady moths duties on the homefields shana told him smiling at his sigh of relief it might not be the most important piece of information but it was the one that was most likely to relieve his mind dora thinks that shes probably well over the shock ofwell you knowby now i know i do her a disservice by thinking of her as being so frail he replied chafing one finger against another nervously but thats how she looks and shes my mother you cant help being protective of your mother i know i feel the same way about my mother by this she meant not her real mother who presumably had been an elvenlords concubine but her fostermother who was a dragon and not much in need of anyones protection but lorryn refrained from saying this is there any change in the situation there he asked and shana shook her head stalemate the old lords cant break in and the young lords cant break out occasional skirmishes and feints but nothing worth talking about lady moths no closer to getting the young lords to see that humans arewellpeople and until she does theyre going to be ignoring the one resource they have that might tip the scales in their favor shana sounded curiously indifferent to the situation more as if it was a chess game that she was observing rather than playing in lorryn wondered how she could detach herself from it so easily he couldnt now on the other sidetheres something just come up that keman thinks is going to give the old lords the advantage and a major one at that she tossed her head and her tail switched like an impatient horses theyve got a new commander and from what keman says hes absolutely brilliant there was no indifference in her voice now and he sat up a bit straighter a new commander who i thought that there wasnt an old lord in the lot that could coordinate a proper attack keman says his name is kyrtian kyrtian vdyll lord prastaran she turned her head to look keenly into his emerald eyes with her own the mark of their elvenlord blood along with the pointed ears and elven magics heard of him vaguely and that in and of itself was interesting it suggested that for some reason the high council had elevated a nobody into a position of major importance with no steps in between i think his father was supposed to be a scholari know there was something when i was a child about lord prastaran who vanished off in the waste lands between here and the site of the gate that brought us from evelon he waved vaguely in a southerly direction he keepskeptto himself and his son did the same until now and why one wonders apparently because hes brilliant and according to keman because hes got a way of training slaves to be soldiers without the untidy process of having half of them cut to ribbons in order that the rest get experience in fighting she drammed her fingers silently on the side of her leg and you realize of course that this is not good news for us no that was clear enough if this kyrtian was as brilliant as shana said he wasnt bound by traditionhe would use what worked being encased in tradition like a chrysalis never meant to be opened was the only thing that kept the old lords from hammering their lessexperienced offspring a good commander with the resources of the old lords behind him can take the defenses of the young lords to pieces she continued turning her gaze in the direction of elvenheld lands when he does that hell have proved himself to his masters lorryn agreed and it wont take them any time at all to break the treaty and send him after us he felt his stomach turn over uneasily i dont suppose you have any good news for me do you he asked plaintively she shook off her own somber mood i know what youre thinking and youre right until we know something about this kyrtian there is no point in imagining all the things he might or might notdo besides mero and rena are doing very well for us and the iron people seem to like them a great deal the iron people helped us hold off the elvenlords the last time without actually getting involved lorryn mused feeling a bit less hagridden at the thought of another conflict with the elvenlords if they joined us this timebetween them and the dragons it might be the elvenlords doing the retreating shana finished for him one of doras lair is helping them to find grazing and oreand lately there have been small groups of wild humans turning up who speak some dialect that the iron people understand do you suppose they could be what is left of the corn people lorryn asked his curiosity now piqued shana shrugged they could just be traderswe knew already that the iron people have had some contact with traders keman says they are slowly bringing in their families and dependents to join the encampment and some of them have been saying its safer than hiding in the wilderness they do know farming though grazingand farmers to help with crops lorryn pulled a grass stem to chew on it that would suit the iron people down to the bone theyd prefer to make a settlement if they can its hard to run proper forges unless youre settled did you tell mero about this new elven commander she nodded i told him to pass the information on as he sees fit theres been a complication we really need to find a reliable source of iron mero and rena cant do anything about finding some and if were going to keep the iron people as allies we have to get a dragon to find us a mine that reminds meweve got an ironrelated problem of our own lorryn wished profoundly that caellach gwain wasnt at the heart of so many of his problems there is another problem among the wizards so far as caellach gwain and his cronies are concerned the magictwisting shana made a face well weve known about that for as long as weve had any amount of iron around us you just increase your focus to get around the way the magic warps or you use the warpive seen orien actually lob a levinbolt around a corner whats the problem younger wizards can learn how to deal with it because theyre used to using semiprecious stones as focuses caellach just doesnt want the iron around at all so far as hes concerned its one more change in the way things were and thats what he wants to go back to lorryn sighed and felt his headache coming back why was it that so many of the problems seemed to begin and end in caellach gwain hes just lazy shana snorted welli agree he is but not all of the older wizards are and theyre having the same problems adjusting and they arent complaining theyre just suffering quietly suffering shana raised a skeptical eyebrow well not suffering then but its hard for the old ones they arent as fit they arent as healthy and its harder for them to learn new things none of its out of stubbornness he felt very sorry for themhed seen some of them struggling to use a focusstone to do things that preadolescents were accomplishing without a thought hed watched them suffer with aching joints and coughs and colds from living in caverns rather than the comfortable rooms of the old citadel most importantly hed seen them disheartened and frustrated thinking that after all of their years in hiding they were now considered to be little better than useless i know it was her turn to sigh its not fair is it if it wasnt for them i wouldnt be here but i dont know what to do about it we cant stop things from changing no butlet me think about this one he offered her a shy smile youve said it yourself youre the one thats good with plans and strategy im the one thats good with people maybe we can find a way to turn all this to our advantage how that skeptical look againbut this time he had just the glimmering of an idea and he met her gaze firmly i dont knowbut theres always possibilities as long as you keep your eyes open for them and on that positive note he got to his feet and offered her his hand lets go take a walk and blow the cobwebs out of our brains before we go back to work cobwebs do get in the way of clear sight she agreed to his great pleasure and i could use a walkwith you and those last two words increased his pleasure tenfold rena had been working hard most of yesterday changing grasses and leaves with her elven magic into sweet treats with which the iron people could lure in the young bulls for their first lessons in being accustomed to saddles and being ridden horses could be broken to saddleit was not the best way to teach them but it was successfulbut bulls never their stubborn natures and the great courage bred into their line made it impossible to break their spirit so the only way to train them for their duties as warbulls was to begin by tempting them gently into captivity and rewarding them for every sign of cooperation with the one thing they always responded to food more specifically a treat a taste they couldnt find on their own like people cattle had a sweet tooth and now that rena was acting as an envoy to these people she was determined to do everything that she could to bring the weight of debt over to the wizards side of the scales if that meant that she spent half a day changing grass into the goodies with which the bulltrainers could reward their animals so be it the magic that elven ladies were traditionally trained in was a gentle art of transformation which they usually used to tailor garments seamlessly to fit like silken skins to sculpt flowers into gossamer and fantastic shapes or to make other cosmetic changes rena had learned to use it to turn the relatively inedible into edible and tastyand at need to stop a beating heart it had lately occurred to her that she could also use it to start a heart that had stopped or perhaps to cure disease or mend a wound but she had not yet had the opportunity or the courage to try the normal noise of the camp woke her just after dawn the sounds of voices and cooking the faroff lowing of the cattle herds she lived with the iron priest diric and his wife kala the great friend of the elvenbane lashana halfblooded mero who was openly courting rena also lived with them but kala watched over both of them with as stern an eye to propriety as if rena was their own child diric and kala had given them separate sleepingchambers on opposite sides of the family tent rena found that reassuring raised as a sheltered elven maiden isolated for the most part from all males but her brother and father she enjoyed meros attentions but she was also uncomfortably shy about being courted not that she wanted him to stop by no means but she was not yet prepared to go any further than a hesitant kiss or two still waking up in the cool of the dawn with the bustle of the camp around her and a breath of breeze carrying the scents of grass and the smoke from dungfires wafting under the skirts of the tent she felt just a little lonely in her solitary bed lorryn isn t so shybut then lorryn isn t a girl she sighed i wish i was like shana shana is always so strong so brave and she never worries about what people will think she won dered if shana and lorryn shared a bed she wondered in the freedom of thought that being only halfawake lent to her just what went on when one did share a bed meros careful kisses and caresses sent strange sensations through her pleasant oh my yes but strange surely it wasntwelllike the cattle or the birds of her garden her thoughts drifted she listened to the cheerful voices of women preparing the morning meal outside she liked the sound of their voices they were deeper than those of the women she was used to even the human slaves lovely instead of that annoying birdlike twitter this was a melodious murmur then of course the mood was broken as a child did something wrong its mother raised her voice in a scold and another child began to cry in sympathy rena woke entirely at that and laughed at herself and her notions how typical of an elven girl to try and cast a specious glamorie over something rich and satisfying in and of itself if less than perfect and not at all tranquil she stretched yawned and wriggled out of her blankets giving herself a quick wash in the leather bucket of water that stood just inside the flap that connected her portion of the tent with that of dirics wife the iron people wore loose and comfortable clothing perfectly suited to their nomadic way of life kala had fitted rena out with the outgrown clothing of her eldest daughterwell suited to the slim build of an elven female women of these people either wore a similar outfit to the menloose trousers with a drawstring waist and a sleeveless vnecked shirtor long embroidered gowns fitted to the waist with a pair of ties in the back in either case the colors were earthy and bold rena could not imagine anything less like the gowns she had once worn in the bower with their trailing hems and sleeves tightlylaced waists and pastel colors all in the most delicate silks and satins today she slipped into one of the dresses a warm brown linen that would have made her look like a bleachedout little wax doll if she still looked like the pallid timid girl who had escaped from her fathers manor but although she still had the pale silvergilt hair of that girl her skin was a warm ivory sun kissed and glowing with health and there was nothing that was bleached about her anymore she sighed though as she pulled the dress on over her head and tied the straps behind her back her first duty today as ever was to see if she could do anything with the captive elvenlord haldor as if there was anything lordlike about him now neither haldor nor his fellowcaptive kelyan were entirely sane anymore but haldor was worse when she and mero had come back to the camp of the iron people one of the first things that diric had requested of her was to see if anything could be done about the two captives who had been taken by the greatgrandsires of the current iron people and pressed into service as entertainers using their magic to create illusions they clearly couldnt release either of the elves for even if they werent mentally competent anymore they still knew too muchand they couldnt give them over to the wizards either at least not in renas opinion in the time theyd been gone haldor had lapsed into a stupor or torpor and could scarcely be roused enough to eat it had fallen upon his fellow captive kelyan to take care of him but at least they were no longer forced to entertain the iron people and thanks to renas transformative magics their diet was something other than curds milk and meat she hated going near them to tell the truth she wasnt afraid of them but there wasnt anything she could really do for them either she had the rather sick feeling that they were both too far gone to help if only there was some way to wipe their minds clean of everything that had happened to them since theyd been captured then they could be put to sleep and set down by a dragon somewhereperhaps where one of the elvenlords tradingcaravans crossed she paused one hand on the tentflap thats no bad idea she thought struck by the notion and maybe mero is the one who could do just that mero like all the halfbloods had both the magics of his human mother and those of his elven father the human magics included the ability to understand the thoughts of otherscould mero change them as well she lifted the partitionflap intending to ask him as soon as she saw him but to her disappointment he was nowhere to be found neither was diric for that matter only kala was in the part of the tent that served as a common area for eating and social functions the iron priests ample wife was bent over her breakfastpreparations and looked up at renas entrance her teeth shining in a startlingly white smile against her dark brown skin the iron people were unlike any humans that rena had ever seen their skins were a blackbronze nearer to black than to bronze and their ebony hair curled more tightly than sheeps fleece nomads though not by nature they descended from a long line of cattle goat and grelbreeders whose religion and lives centered around their forges in the longago when the elvenlords first came to this world they had a close alliance with another human race of farmers now vanished called the corn people the iron people provided the meaty side of the dietary equation the corn people the grains and vegetables the iron people worked in leather and metal the corn people in pottery and fabric then the elvenlords had descended and drove the moremobile iron people into the south presumably adding the corn people to their long list of slavenations there is another group of corn people come kala said cheerfully diric and mero have gone to speak with them i expect them back before too long they went off without any food and i have never yet seen a man who can do without his morning meal without becoming cross rena laughed and went outside to their little fire to help kala with her mealpreparations ever since the iron people had arrived in what now appeared to be their ancient pasturage this plain below the mountains where the wizards and traderkin lived small groups of people with flaxcolored hair had been drifting into their camp claiming the right of ancient alliance they resembled the descriptions that lorryn had read in the old histories and they certainly spoke a language similar to that of the iron people so there was every reason to think that they were the remnants of the corn people certainly dirics folk believed it and welcomed them as longlost kin mero was perfectly pleased to see them coming to the iron folk if the old alliance could be reestablished with the corn people farming part of the plains for grain the fibercrops of hemp and flax and vegetables as they once had the iron people would have one more reason to settle there was plenty of good grazing here all they needed to be perfectly happy was a steady supply of iron ore if we can induce them to settleif we could just work out a way to find them enough iron she thought helping kala by spreading the thin batter for morning cakes on the hot stone that served her as an oven all of the families had such a stone flat and black polished smooth which served as a cooking surface or to keep foods or liquids warm and they were cherished as the important objects they were the thin tough pancakes that they used for bread were cooked on these stones eggs could be fried atop them pots of tea or soup kept warm on them they were buried in coals to heat them for cooking the coals and ashes brushed to one side when the surface was needed rena spread the batter atop the stone with circular motions of a horn spoon kala performed the trickier task of judging when the thin cakes were done enough to peel off and flip and she did it with fingers toughened by many years of working at her own jewelryforge rena wouldnt have dared to try shed have come up with blisters on the tips of every finger the finished cakes paperthin and tasty were tossed into a basket to wait breakfast was always cakes milk a little cheese or meat and whatever fruit could be found there were brambles out here and the berries were just coming ripe rena herself had gathered some yesterday after cheating a bit by softening the thorns with her magic so that they wouldnt stick her while she gathered the fruit just as they finished the last of the batter they heard the voices of the two men dirics a low cheerful rumble like the wheels of a heavy cart on a bumpy road meros a clear tenor i havent any idea where this lord kyrtian came from mero was saying as they came around the side of the round tent there certainly wasnt any elvenlord commander by that name when i had any regular contact with the elvenlords by that rena realized that mero had been catching the iron priest up on what hed been told last night when shana had finally been able to reach him with her thoughts but this can mean very little to us diric objected then paused to bend and give his wife a morningkiss by way of a greeting he was a tall roundfaced human heavily muscled not surprising given that he was the chief priest of a religion that centered around the forge rena was no good at judging the ages of humans but mero said he guessed that both diric and kala were probably in their fifties kala my rockdove the young one tells me that the demons have a new warcaptain in their battle with their own rebellious youth this one seems to have rather more sense than the last and is making progress in his campaign to bring them to heel mero is concerned that this could mean trouble for us this can have very little to do with us kala agreed complacently except perhaps good let them concentrate on each other and forget that we are here but thats just what wont happen if this kyrtian is successful dont you see mero objected as rena nodded vigorously but the grayhaired iron priest only shook his head time enough to be concerned if it happens he responded with a shrug my people will be more fretful that their forges are dark than that some war among demons has possibly taken another turn mero bit his lip and looked to rena for help but she couldnt offer him any diric was right the iron people hadnt had to engage the elvenlords in combat for generations and legends were unlikely to arouse any anxiety in their hearts at this point but the lack of iron for their forges was a problem and a current even urgent one it was a concern for the wizards as wellthe young lords rebellion had been grounded on the foundation of the iron jewelry that the iron people had made and the wizards had distributed wearing this jewelry the rebelsnot just younger sons but the abused and reviled lesser lords with very little magic who often were treated as badly as any human slavewere protected from the great lords magic for the first time they were able to act without fear of levinbolt and paralyzing pain and act they had but that had used up the scant store of raw iron and the iron people were grumbling about the lack of material to work with and wondering if their sacrifice to help save the wizards by giving the great lords a new threat to worry about had been worth it so far the only bits of iron that the dragons had been able to find had been coaxed out of the ground and dropped as raw lumps between the territory claimed by the wizards and the strongholds of the elves they formed a barrier of protection difficult to find and disruptive far out of proportion to their small size and the wizards were very reluctant to remove them however badly the iron people wanted them the plain fact was that the iron people were not going to make any more of their jewelry for the wizards unless and until the wizards came up with more iron and the supply of jewelry to sneak in among the rebels had long ago run out how much more disruption could be accomplished if simple iron torques could be sent in among the human slaves those iron bands could negate the magic that controlled the slaves through their collarswith them escapes could be successful and even the takeover of an entire estate without themnothing would change if this lord kyrtian managed to conquer the young lords by power of arms alone the wizards would desperately need another diversion to keep the elvenlords occupied and the human slaves could only look forward to more abuse more repression diric ate his breakfast with a placid face oblivious to the concerns of his guests the traderpeople are to come also at last he offered between bites one of the new corn people told me that they were following no more than a few days behind with burdens of tradegoods i am eager to see them and i think the rest will be also rena smiled despite her concerns i have no doubt she replied thinking of the excitement that each new boatload of traders caused among the wizards they are good people mero offered you wont be sorry that you decided to open full trade with them so you said in council though there are still those of my folk who think we should simply take them as slaves and have them and their goods the gleam in dirics eye reminded rena that the iron people were quite used to the idea of having other humans as slaves there werent many slaves among the tents mostly ton people who had been sold by their parents or who had sold themselves to repay debts but they did exist mero had been rather taken aback when he discovered their existence and i pointed out then as i will repeat that it will be far more profitable to trade honorably if you take them and their goods mero reminded the iron priest shrewdly you will only have a few slaves and the goods they carried no more will come to you but if you trademore will pour into your camp and you will likely be able to barter what is common to you for what is worth a great deal to you eh now did i say that i did not feel the same way diric asked ingenuously pretending that he had never even entertained the notion although both rena and mero knew how hard they had argued to sway him to their way of thinking this would be one more hold on the iron people one more reason for them to stay here instead of looking for another spot to settle right now with a growing number of voices calling for another move to some place that might have more to offer than just water and grazing the traders could provide what mero and rena needed until somehow somewhere they could come up with a source for the allimportant iron the traders arrived riding onof all improbable things packgrels these incredibly ugly animals longlegged longnecked with bulging eyes and blubbery lips served the tradingcaravans into the desert commanded by the elvenlords but mero had hardly expected that the traderclans would have any up until this point he had thought that they traveled exclusively afoot or on water the iron people were just as surprised and even more excited to see a halfdozen of the creatures they themselves had once depended on in the oldest chronicles the iron people had even been referred to as the grelriders it was only when they had been driven south that they had lost the grels which had not survived the arduous journey and the new pests that the cattle had shrugged off the grels were less enthused to see these new darkskinned humansthey had no long tradition of association and they shied and bellowed at the unfamiliar dark faces much to the iron peoples disappointment im sorry but they arent very bright and they think anything they dont recognize is going to eat them the grelhandler kept saying over and over stumbling a little over the unfamiliar syllables of the iron peoples tongue eventually when the beasts refused to cooperate the curious got over their disappointment and settled down to serious trading each side laid out the goods that they had brought the iron people offered hides dried meat baskets ornamental beadwork skilled leather work horn bows and weaving they had linenflax grew abundantly on the plains and outriders made sure that the cattle didnt devour it before the women had a chance to gather it they did not have sheep although they did have goats and were skilled at spinning and weaving goathair the traders had raw wool glass stone and pottery objects flour and salt some very specific wood productslike longbows of yew which the warriors were very impressed with and arrowheads which were always in short supply they also had some copper trinkets copper pots and a few ingots of copper but most of all of course the iron people really wanted iron more than anything else and at the initial trading session it was clear to rena that they were disappointed not to see any still they covered their disappointment well and trading on the first day proceeded briskly at the end of the day halkan the spokesman and leader of this particular group invited the important members of the tribe to dinner in his tent and included mero and rena in on the invitation more out of politeness than anything else the trader clans had a set of firm agreements with the wizards and it wasnt as if he could have expected anything new out of two envoys to these odd ebonyskinned folk mero had never seen an actual camp of the trader clans before and looked around with lively interest as they accompanied diric and kala to the modest feast the iron people lived in round tents constructed of hides and felt the traders had square and rectangular pavilions of sturdy heavilywaxed cloth beneath the wax random patterns of blotches of green and brown had been painted on the canvas and he thought that it would be difficult to spot such tents in the middle of a forest out here of course they looked a bit odd all around the outskirts of the camp were wicker cages on poles they werent torches or lamps and mero couldnt even guess what function they were supposed to serve as they all took their places beneath an ornamental pavilion to enjoy their hosts hospitality he found that the traders had elected to place their guests on flat cushions around a central serving area with traders alternating with their guests that put one of the traders a nervous thin fellow between him and rena which was a little annoying he was worried that she might be uncomfortable with the seating arrangements but he hadnt reckoned with her early trainingif she was uncomfortable between two strangers she didnt show it mero mostly stuck to smalltalk with his two neighbors allowing diric and his fellow chiefs to monopolize the conversation but just as they were served a dessert of honeydrenched fruits from the traders stores and beaten cream supplied by the iron people something reminded him of those curious wicker cages and he asked about them out of courtesy so that the iron people could understand everything that was said around the circle they both spoke in the iron peoples tongue ah those are to protect us from the demons and their magic said the young trader whose name mero hadnt caught we put fools gold in them and it works as the iron jewelry does heads snapped in their direction from all around the circle the moment that the word iron was spoken what is this diric demanded the clanchief explained and tried to describe the contents of the wardbaskets in such a way that the iron people would understand but diric was baffled wait he said finally and sent one of the younger traders to fetch one of the baskets in front of dirics interested gaze he opened the top of the basket and poured out about three fistfulls worth of glittering goldcolored stones with rough surfaces fools gold the traderchief said dismissively fools think it is real gold it is good only for keeping the he stopped his face a study in bewilderment as diric uttered a cry of triumph and scooped up two handfuls of the stones brandishing them over his head tell him the redhaired traderchief said whirling and addressing mero frantically tell him it is not gold tell him that it is worthless but what diric and the others were shouting was not gold nor would they have been half so excited over a basketful of true gold nuggets iron diric bellowed with joy iron and he and the others ran out of the camp leaving mero and rena to try to explain we call these things iron pyrites and there are things we can do with them that we cannot with other iron kala said to rena as she bent gloating over her precious pile of rocks once the traders realized how much their fools gold was valued by the iron people it didnt take long for them to trade away all they had trusting to their own skills and a promised escort of bullriders to make it back to the cover of forested lands safely they didnt have much but at least they knew where there was more and the iron people were no longer threatening to take their herds and the corn people and go elsewhere it is the women who will most value these kala continued the men would only wish to melt them down there are better things to be done with these stones rena watched in fascination as kala made good her words her plump stubby fingers moving with great skill and surpris ing delicacy as she cut and faceted tiny gemstones from the iron pyrites little things that glittered like black diamonds it took unbelievable patience what are you going to do with these rena asked stirring a finished one in the palm of her hand with one finger oh i shall melt down the waste and cast it into a setting for it kala responded absently it will be a different style than you have seen heretofore but i think you will like it we have agreed to exchange it for the raw pyrites so that the traders need no longer waste these precious things in baskets on poles in order to protect themselves one weight of jewelry to ten weights of pyrites there was no doubt in renas mind that kala thought she was getting the better part of the bargain rena continued to watch her for a while but kala became so involved in her work that it seemed an intrusion to stay and she got up and went to look for mero we have a problem she said to him worriedly as soon as she caught sight of him hurrying towards her through the tents i know diric told me the tradeagreement he replied just as worried i mean its a good thing that theyve got some iron but this cuts us right out of everything they can get most of what they need from either the corn people or the traders so what use are the wizards to them rena concluded for him if the elvenlords do manage to defeat the young lords and come after us why should the iron people bother to help now theres nothing in the alliance for them mero nodded theyre nothing if not practical he set his chin right first of all we need to get in touch with shana and let her know whats happened maybe shell have some ideas and next rena asked hopefully mero was resourceful surely he could think of something they could do i cant think of a next he replied dashing her hopes i only wish i could kyrtian sat wearily on his horse beneath the broiling sun and waited for his scout to come report to him ahead of himsomewherewere the retreating forces of the young lords they were far enough ahead of his troops that there wasnt even the telltale sign of a dustcloud on the horizon it was uncanny it was indeed the moment the very moment that the council agreedreluctantlyto put him in charge of their forces someone must have alerted the rebels and that same someone must have told them that in lord kyrtian they were going to face a trained commander and trained troops because he never even got a chance to face an army in the field only a few skirmishers meant to delay him while the army itself retreated that was what his scouts were out looking for nowskirmishers traps false trails and just possibly signs that the young lords had chosen a place to make a stand but he didnt really expect that not for some time yet they were too far from areas they held secure nor was the ground particularly good for turning at bay meanwhile the scoutone of his own peoplecame running up the man stopped at his stirrup and saluted report kyrtian commanded my lordalls clear and the others have marked out a secure campsite the man said crisply no sign of the enemy other than the marks of retreat very good kyrtian saluted in dismissal and the scout trotted off to return to his own group he looked over at gel who was also mounted and waiting just beside him well he asked gel barked a laugh its making your reputation easily enough he said but i wouldnt count on it to last im not he sighed lets get them moving if we camp early enough i can drill them some more good plan gel wheeled his horse away and headed towards the main body of the army paused for a rest to relay kyrtians orders kyrtian stared at the horizonand wondered when the inevitable blow was going to fall rennati sighed brushed her hair back over her shoulders and bent to look out of the window in her sleepingalcove craning her neck to see as much of the view below her as possible since lord kyrtian had leftand she did not know why only that their servants said that he had gonethere had been nothing to report to lady triana and nothing whatsoever had happened here in the harem no more visitors had come and nothing had been told to the concubines rennati had assiduously practiced her dancing but one couldnt fill every hour of the day with dancing it had been her one passion but now she had all the leisure she could ever have dreamed of to practice and perfect her art and she realized that without an audience to appreciate what she did simply practicing and perfecting no longer was enough for her the other two concubines were happily occupied with the contents of several chests that lady lydiell had thoughtfully sent up somehow she had known that the last batch of dressmaking materials was exhausted and she had supplied a true horde of precious thingsswaths of silks satins and velvets yards of trim buckets of glittering glass shell and stone beads gold and silver and silken embroidery threads and everything the heart could desire for the making of dresses and ornaments a thoughtful gift that had rather surprised rennati actually nothing in her life would have led her to expect any such attentions from the chatelaine and mother of a young lord and if rennati had been just a little more like the other two slaves of lord kyrtians harem she would have been right down there beside gianna and kara planning dresses sewing and making delicate little amuletnecklaces with the wealth of beads she had done some of that but like her dancing there was only so much puttering with trinkets that she could do before she lost interest concubines were supposed to be obsessed with clothing and selfornamentation rennati liked clothing well enough and she enjoyed looking pretty but she had always felt frustrated and confined by life in the harem though she had taken very great care never to show it the alternative to the harem was the life of a field or houseslave and they were not treated nearly as well as the concubines the view from her window though restricted was more interesting than anything inside the harem at least there was something going on out there something different from the interior of the harem tower weather changed slaves walked past birds flew by and she was frankly putting off reporting to lady triana the lady had been increasingly impatient with rennatis lack of information and the last time had threatened to revoke her bargain unless rennati had more to report the next time she called at last with a grimace she decided that she couldnt put it off any longer she picked up the little box of personal jewelry and dug the telesonring out from its hidingplace among her tiny treasures carefully she put it on spoke the few words that activated it and stared into the dark green murk of the beryl waiting for a voice to call to her thinly across the vast distance between this manor and lady trianas well so this is where the disturbance has been coming from rennati started and looked up for the voice did not come from the ring nor was it lady trianas lady lydiell stood in the doorway and in her shock rennati could only stare at her dumbly elven ladies never entered the harem much less came into the concubines private quarters she had feared discovery by gianna or kara or perhaps even lord kyrtian himself but never ever by his mother the lady was not dressed in the same fashion that she had been when rennati first met with her in fact she looked very little like the sheltered lady of the manor that rennati knew her to be with her long silver hair bound into a severe knot at the nape of her neck no cosmetics on her face and no jewels wearing a soft brown divided skirt and matching longsleeved tuniconly her air of authority betrayed her rank her eyes were quiet unreadable pools of murky green exactly like the beryl in rennatis ring her face as expressionless as a statue lady lydiell calmly took the few steps needed to cross the distance between the doorway and rennati and held out her hand whomever you have been reporting to wont answer you child the lady said with no sign of anger or any other emotion that rennati could detect ive taken care of that you might as well give that telesonring to me numbly rennati took the ring off and handed it to herthen automatically dropped to her knees beside the couch she had been seated on and bowed her head clasping her hands behind her back waiting for the lady to punish her her vivid imagination painted a dozen pictures for her of what to expect in the next few moments as her heart beat so rapidly she had trouble breathing and she shivered with fear her mouth dried her throat closed and she felt as if she was about to faint she would be punished of course she had betrayed her masterat the behest of another elvenlord true but that was no excuse no slave could betray her master and be caught and expect to escape without punishment at the least she would be sent out into the fields at the worst what on earth are you doing child lady lydiell asked in an astonished voice which turned exasperated as rennati remained where she was oh forget up little fool im not going to hurt you and look at me automatically rennati leapt obediently to her feet turning her astonished eyes to the ladys face as her heart skipped beats and her chest tightened along with her throat for a moment she thought she would faint lady lydiell frowned but not in such a way assaylady triana had frowned this frown was just annoyance not something that would freeze the blood it was an impersonal frownthere was no real anger in it though rennatis skin felt cold and clammy her heart slowed just a little and the tension in her chest eased sit down lady lydiell said shortly and rennati obeyed her eyes fixed on the ladys face and tell me about this ring who gave it to you why and what have you been telling him her rennati corrected automatically and clapped her hand to her mouth in renewed alarm but when no slap sting of the collar or indeed any other correction came she took her courage in both hands and began her tale there was no reason to lie if lady lydiell cared to she could have it all out of her in a moment either under the influence of drugs or by application of pain through the collar and at this point there was no chance that lady triana would keep her side of the bargain which had specified that rennati remain undetected so rennati told everything from the moment that lady triana picked her out of a slavesale to the last thing that she had reported as she spoke lady lydiells frown softened until when at last rennati fell silent the elven ladys expression was no worse than thoughtful and slightly disapproving as she spoke and lydiells expression eased so too did the feeling of panic and fear the awful sick feeling in her stomach as she finished her last words lydiell nodded it could have been worse she said when rennati fell silent you havent given that creature much thats going to be of any use to her and forewarned is forearmed as they say she watched rennati for a few moments then appeared to make up her mind about something stand up child she said i want you to come with me the fear returned redoubled and her heart raced again her breath coming quickly as she tried to get air past the terrible tightness of her throat and chest now it comes rennati thought heart sinking with dread but of course she couldnt disobey she followed lady lydiell down the stairs past gianna and kara and out past the barrier at the door that kept unauthorized slaves from getting into the haremand the concubines from leaving it there was a faint tingle on her skin as she passed through the shimmering curtain of magic power and she shivered now she was outside and away from the scant protection of the presence of the other two what was lady lydiell going to do with her hand her over to the gladiators youre intelligent and i dont think youre a bad child at heart lydiell said as if to herself then looked over her shoulder at rennati who shrank inside herself when those penetrating green eyes met hers im usually considered a good judge of character by the way yes my lady rennati whispered since it seemed that lady lydiell was waiting for an answer as they walked down a marblefaced hallway im going to take a chance with you lydiell continued still holding her with thatsharp gaze im going to do something that has never been done with a human from outside our own circle born and raised among us im going to show you exactly what youve jeopardized with your actions and for the next several hours rennati found herself hauled all over lord kyrtians estate seeing things that left her gaping too overwhelmed to speak thisthis place was nothing like anywhere she had ever been before at first it only seemed as if this was just an ordinary estate although the master and mistress of it were unusually kind to their slaves and treated them extraordinarily well first the lady took her to every nook and cranny of the great house not only through the rooms that she and her son and the other elvenlords of the household used but into the kitchen the stillroom the laundry the sewing and weaving room everywhere the lady was greeted with respect though not servility more importantly she didnt expect or seem to demand servility in every other household rennati had been in slaves were expected never to speak unless directly addressed never to raise their eyes to the mistresss face unless given permission and never ever to do as these slaves did and actually approach the mistress with a report or a query but rennati quickly began to realize that lady lydiell not only was incredibly approachable she was also greeted with actual affection by her slaves affection from slaves how was that possible what do you think of our home so far lydiell asked as they moved outside and headed for a long low building this was a question that would have been appropriate if asked of an equal or one only slightly inferior but not of a concubine concubines were not supposed to have opinions they were barely supposed to think the question surprised her into honesty not the least because the slaves in the kitchen had actually called cheerful and welcoming greetings when the lady had first entered leaving rennati dumbfounded i dont understand she said they like you how can slaves like you she hadnt really expected a reply unless it came as a reproof but what lady lydiell said in response to the impulsive exclamation shocked her to the core and left her speechless they like me because they are not slaves lydiell said neither they nor their ancestors were ever slaves here in this one manor no elvenlord has ever enslaved a human what rennati felt her heart actually stop for a moment they are in my employ lady lydiell continued they are my helpers and we respect each other kyrtian and i protect them from the outside world as his father did for their ancestors and his grandfather for theirs and for that protection they and their families serve us the lady said quietly we have never had slaves here and never shall if we are left alone by the lady trianas of the world it was such an astonishing statement that it had to be a lie it was simply not possible that there was a family of the elvenlords that hadnt enslaved humans and yethow could it be a lie why should the lady make up such an astonishing story what purpose would it serve and how could she have gotten all of her slaves to act in such a natural way unless it was true and not a lie as rennati continued to follow lady lydiell out into the fields to the cottages of the farmlaborers to the barracks of the fighters she had been protected by a core of utter disbelief but the more she saw the more that core eroded if the lady had only shown her the household servants she would not have trusted what she saw but here were people who should never have set eyes on the lady who if they ever by some chance had seen her should never recognize the plainlydressed lady for the authority that she was but time after time the lady was met with welcome and greeting with the kind of common talk that might be shared with a trusted human overseer but never with an elvenlord and she herself asked questions about the farming training or the slaves themselves and their families families impossible that showed she was intimately familiar with the minutiae of their lives even so rennati clung to her stubborn refusal to believe in this miracle of elven kindness right up until the two of them approached a set of small buildings constructed around a garden rennati could not imagine what they could be but to her incredulous ears came the sound of high shrill voicesthe voices of children as lady lydiell came into view of the garden the children playing there caught sight of her and ran toward her shrieking greetings at the tops of their lungs lady lidi lady lidi come see my puppy will you make us sweeties lady lidi jordy found a frog lady lydiell only smiled serenely as the horde of small children some of them very grubby indeed swarmed all around her holding up flowers a frog a puppy dolls and toy bows and arrows for her approval as rennati stared her mouth dropping completely open the lady gave each of the children her gravest attention now she knew why there were no breeding pens no mass nurseries no other signs that human slaves were bred here with the same care to selection and carelessness as to feelings as were cattle and horses the cluster of small buildings were houses houses for families families who were allowed to keep their children with them and since there were no breeding pens this must be the norm here not the exception as it was on the estate that had bred rennati these children were utterly fearless in the presence of the chatelaine of the manor they must never have received so much as an unkindness from an elvenlord and look at the lady herself she couldnt have been more patient with this horde of exuberant children if she had been their nursemaid or beloved relative rennati let fall the last of her disbelief and felt the world whirling around her turned utterly upside down will you please make us sweeties lady lidi asked one of the boys polite but bold as a young rooster lady lydiell laughed all right one flower each go pick fresh ones she turned to rennati who clutched a beam embedded in the corner of the house beside her feeling actually dizzy elven women are trained to use their magic in small ways rather than largeyoull find most of them making foolish sculptures out of flowers but thats a bastardization of what we originally did in evelon we healed wounds and sometimes sicknessbut most important of all we made the inedible edible lady moth taught me that little trick which she learned from her mother i still use it to make honeysweets from flowers for the childrenah here they come there were plenty of flowers in the little gardens that rennati now noticed around the houses and it hadnt taken the children long to pick out which flower they wished made into a treat she noticed that the girls generally chose roses well she was partial to rosepetal candies herself many of them sucked thornwounded fingers but none of them complained the boys seemed to prefer sunflowers dahlias anything large but one little girl at the rear of the group came up holding a single violet and looked to lady lydiell with eyes filled with disappointment sahshi whats the matter lydiell asked seeing her and her distress at once and motioning for the others to let her through you said only one sahshi whispered imploringly but i like vilets oh dearchildren do you think its fair for sahshi only to have one tiny violet lydiell applied to the rest of the children and had they been penborn and nurseryraised where it was every child for himself rennati knew what the answer would have been but not here no came the clamor instantly and without prompting several of them ran to nearby gardens bringing back bunches of violets that they pressed into sahshis hands until the child couldnt hold any more her face glowing with happiness sahshi held up the violets for lady lydiell to transmuteand then gave rennati a further surprise as if she needed one at this point by sharing out her sweets with the others as they waited in their turn for lady lydiell to get to them this was probably just as well for had she eaten them all herself she would surely have earned herself a bellyache but never before had rennati seen a child of the lowest field worker class who would not have immediately shoveled a treat into her mouth with both hands and devoured it as fast as she could stuffing herself until she was sick because it would be ages before she might taste any other good thing it was all in a word impossible when lydiell had finished with the last flower the children thanked her and streamed back to their playground a small square surrounded by roughhewn logs enclosing an area of soft sand that held stumps and bars to climb on a board with seats on either end poised on a hewn block of wood that allowed the ends to rise and fall with children balanced on seats there and other things that the children seemed to enjoy swarming over these things all showed signs of a great deal of wear they hadnt been placed there recently this was no artificial setting made for her benefit to sway her opinion as if my opinion the attitude of a mortal actually means something but to lady lydiell it did it patently did lydiell turned back to face rennati with a quizzical smile on her face well she said pointedly rennati felt cold and hot at the same time and there was a faint buzzing in her ears whatisthisplace she asked thickly ah that is a very good question lady lydiell took rennatis arm as if she was rennatis oldest friend come back to the manor with me i think when you have had something to drink to steady you you will have a great many more questions and i will try to answer them in the end rennati thought she would never come to an end of her questions lydiell answered each and every one with infinite patience as they sat in elegant chairs on either side of a little table on one of the outdoor terraces here she waseating dainties that in her excitement she did not truly taste drinking something that might just as well have been water for all the attention she paid to it and arranged across from a highborn elven lady on one of the private terraces as if she too was elvenborn the sun shone down on the gardens below them although they were shaded by a fine cloth canopy of tapestried linen a few women worked in the gardens below the very picture of bucolic contentmentwellclothed in practical leggings and long loose linen tunics protected from the sun by broadbrimmed straw hats and no supervisor in sight slowly she began to really understand just what it was that lord kyrtians family protected here that was when the enormity of her own treachery dawned on her hitting her with the force of a blow if she had still been able to weep she would have then shed have broken down and howled with the pain of what she had done to these amazing elvenlords and their human charges she wanted to her throat closed and she nearly choked on her unshed tears but weeping had long since been trained out of her and she could not cry not even for this concubines did not weep it spoiled their looks and only annoyed their masters but the depth of her despair could not be measured and she could not simply sit there and bear it invisibly she slipped from her seat and sank down to her knees then prostrated herself on the stone of the terrace not daring to look at the lady lest she crack into a thousand pieces ah said the lady softly now you understand it was hard hard to speak hard to get words around that lump of guilt and pain in her throat yes it was all she could manage now i have questions for you lady lydiell said in a voice that warned she would insist on answers rennati could not bear to look into the face of the one she had so vilely betrayed and she remained where she was prostrated on the stone of the terrace speaking brokenly to the soft grey slab just below her nose the ladys questions went on as long as rennatis had every detail of her life of her bargain with lady triana pulled from her gently but inexorably it seemed to go on forever and when she was done she felt drained of everything except pain there was nothing that lady lydiell did not know about her now and surely surely the punishment she so richly deserved would be forthcoming the lady finally made a sounda weary sigh get up child and sit down so that i can talk to you properly rennati couldnt movebut a moment later she found herself being moved as lady lydiell took her elbows lifted her to her feet and replaced her in her seat as effortlessly as if she weighed nothing perhaps for the lady she was nearweightless she was clearly a past mistress of elven magic and how could rennati know what was and was not possible in magic now the lady said her eyes boring into rennatis as if to stare into her very thoughts you understand what you have done to us are you prepared to make amends by now rennati had exhausted all emotions but onehope and underneath all that heavy black despair hope stirred and eased the constriction of her throat enough to let her breathe a little numbly she nodded speaking carefully and exactly lady lydiell outlined what rennati was to do and rennati agreed to it without ever once making a single objection or asking what would happen to her when the inevitable moment came when she was no longer useful it had been a long very hard day most of it spent in the saddle and kyrtian was already wearied when his mother called him so far the campaign against the young lords was turning into something other than the hardslogging battle hed been led to believe it would be in fact if it wasnt for the evidence of the devastated estates hed seen with manors halfburned and fields left to weeds it would have been something of a farce because the moment he took command of the armyquite literally from the moment he took command of the armythe young lords direct opposition melted away quite simply they turned and ran now as a commander he had to agree with their tactics he brought with him his own people who would have strengthened the line as nothing else could have the next pitched battle would have been a conclusive one the young lords army was not near any area that could be used as a secure base and supplies had to be problematic even with the use of magic if he had been in their situation hed have done the same but now he was in pursuit which meant that when they did take a stand it would come as a surprise to him and would be on ground of their choosing and very probably he would be facing their rested force with his own weary one kyrtian stared down at the tiny image of his mother in the telesonscreen set into his campaigndesk with gel watching over his shoulder making interested noises triana he said finally aelmarkin i could understand but why would triana want an agent in our household gel snorted before lydiell could answer thats simple enough theyre working together or aelmarkin thinks they are from all ive heard that b he coughed ah female is an even nastier piece of work than your cousin if thats pos sible sneakier anyway what do you think about this girl can you trust what she says can you trust what shell do now that you lydiell smiled oh come now gel this is the lady youre talking to how many of our people have the human magic and how many do you think were keeping watch on the girls thoughts while i questioned her besides the ones i asked to just to make sure that the others didnt miss something gel had the grace to blush shouldnt try and teach my grandam what mushrooms to pick you mean sorry mlady so shes safe more than safe i think we should keep her came the rather surprising reply shes very intelligent shes cleverwhich is not at all the same thing as being intelligentand shes got a kind nature id be very happy to see her make her home with our people she could be very useful to uswe havent got many people whove been raised in the slavepens she gives us a look into that world that is beyond price not as my concubine kyrtian blurted and flushed when gel chuckled i rather doubt that by the time shes learned to take her place among our people shed be willing to be anyones concubine lydiell replied dryly and after all that would be the point wouldnt it i take it that your plan is to have her send dearest triana as much disinformation as you think shell swallow kyrtian said hastily changing the subject it seems a pity to waste the opportunity lydiell agreed her eyes twinkling a little or so kyrtian thought although the image was so small it was difficult to tell if it seems that the ploy is working perhaps you might want to have her with you i understand that many officers have a concubine or two with them before kyrtian could object gel replied thats a good idea when youre sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can trust her lady he enthused if triana is reporting back to aelmarkin we can feed her nonsense leavened with just enough truth to make it seem that the girl is doing more than the bwoman ever expected i wouldnt call triana a bitch gel lydiell said mildly its a terrible insult to all female canines which are on the whole rather nice creatures gel nearly choked on his laughter and kyrtian felt his face grow hot what had gotten into his mother lately or was it only that now his mother considered him enough of an adult not to mince words around him in the abstract it sounds like a good idea to me provided that bringing her out here doesnt put her in any danger he temporized and i dont mean danger from the fighting thats turning out to be ratherwelltamer than i thought for now anyway someones convinced the young lords to run rather than stand and fight i cant say im unhappy about thatit certainly makes me look like a brilliant commander but while this girl is within the walls of our estate shes safe enough from trianaif she comes out here and triana decides that she wants more than a few words over a telesonring it would be no great chore to find some way to kidnap her human slaves and elvenlords are coming and going from my quarters all the time gel is the only person id trust to keep her safe and he and i cant have her on the battlefield with us and i really don twant a female complicating things around here he added but only in thought he really did not want his mother worrying about the danger there was of course a great deal more of that than he was going to tell her about when the inevitable happened and the young lords turned at bay lydiell pursed her lips in thought that hadnt occurred to me she admitted for that matter it wouldnt take a great deal of effort on trianas part to send someone to your quarters to intimidate the girl and we cant have that well lets hold that ploy in reserve for a while in case triana starts urging it on her it may be that concocting a story that ive made her into my private maid while youre gone and she can overhear my conversations with you will be enough i should think kyrtian said firmly ancestors for once you have been the one with all the interesting news all i can tell you is what i have before that and im nearer to lady moths estate and i think i can push the lines back far enough to put her in our hands again within the week assuming she wants to be came the thoughtful reply all things considereddo you think you might be able to push just far enough that she can send a message or come to you herself without cutting her off from the young lords again kyrtian was surprised by the question but he saw immediately why his mother had asked it no one is likely to question me as long as i push them backsomewhere he responded you think she has worked her way into their confidence dont you yes and im not entirely sure you should be working so hard to defeat them lady lydiell frowned slightly there is this while the great lords are concentrating on the rebels they arent paying any attention to us or the wizards gel added or the wizards she agreed but if you defeat the young lords they are certain to want you to lead an army against the wizards next the very idea made kyrtians heart sink and he felt a little sick for not thinking of that himself of course they would and while he didnt in the least mind bringing the young pups to heel for the old dogs the very idea of pitting an army of slaves against their fellow humans ill resign first he said hurriedly ill find an excuse or gel can break my leg or your skull gel growled but there was approval in his voice well worry about that when the time comes in the meantime in the meantime ill say goodbye and you can think about what to do about moth lydiell said firmly if we talk any longer someone is bound to try and mirror this sending watch your back my love i will kyrtian promised and the teleson winked out leaving both him and gel with far too much to think about and far too little time for thinking the plight of one young woman could not hold kyrtians attention for long so long as she was no longer a threat he didnt particularly care what his mother did with her truthfully he couldnt even remember which of the three girls she was she was lydiells problem now and he would just as soon that things stayed that way within a few moments he had even forgotten her name as his attention turned to the more urgent task of changing his strategy to deal with moth and the young lords in light of this new information it was just a good thing that they had already settled at their evening campsite outside the tent was the usual cacophony of hundreds of humans setting up campfires and bedrolls getting fed at the messwagons and being ordered about by their elven officers the mellow golden light of nearsunset made the western wall of kyrtians tent glow the air was full of dust and the scent of trampled grass and wood smoke there was food on a tray on his campbed virtually the same sort of food that the human fighters would be eating but kyrtian ignored it gel would probably nag him into eating it eventually well we need to rethink our battleplan he said to gel spreading his terrainmap out over the blank black glass of the telesonscreen set into the top of his campaigndesk the question is what can we push towards now that will allow us to get close enough to moth that she can send someone out to us if she wants without making straight for her estate or look as if were trying to avoid that estate good question gel pulled at his chin while he studied the map frowning damn good question what about here his finger stabbed down at a spot on the map where they had noted a possible slavecamp one full of former gladiators we can let it out that we think this is a trainingcamp for the young lords soldiers that ought to be reason enough for anyone taking the army in that direction would allow them to skirt moths estate without actually taking itand would give them a corridor for a strike deeper into young lords territory kyrtian nodded and reached absently for his mug of water taking a sip to ease a throat tickling with inhaled dust lets make a report to lord kyndreth and suggest the change of plan i want him to argue against me for a little why gel gave him a quizzical glance brows knitted kyrtian refolded the map carefully and set it aside because this is going to serve us in more ways than one hes going to point out that with a very little effort i can rescue moth im go ing to counter that moth is probably safe where she is that the young lords probably havent even thought about one old woman in a tiny estate and pushing towards the young lords at that point will make them think that moth is valuable to us i want him to see that its possible some of the old retainers held behind the lines that have been ignored until now could be used as hostages it doesnt seem to have occurred to the young lords to do that yet but i want kyndreth to realize he doesnt want to give them the idea i do want kyndreth to focus on that and not look for other reasons why i might not want to push at that point thatll give him something more to think about gel said pulling on his chin until kyrtian wondered if he was going to stretch it out of shape somehow aye and thatll give him one more thing to warn the others about which will give the council something else to think about besides the wizards it might even give them a reason to order me to hold back until they can find ways to get the people they want out of harms way kyrtian nodded as gels eyes widened you see you know i never thought id be trying to think up ways to get kyndreth to pull our forces backbut that could be the best strategy at the moment the back of his neck ached with tension and he rubbed it hoping that a headache wasnt coming on i never thought this would be so complicated he said plaintively to no one at all if i had known if youd known you still wouldnt have been able to escape this gel pointed out bluntly kyndreth wanted you what kyndreth wants happens there was no real answer to that and gel knew it kyrtian just shook his head and winced a little at the start of that headache hed hoped to avoid he keyed the teleson with kyndreths seal placing it facedown in the little round depression made for receiving such seals in the upper righthand corner and with a touch and a word activated the spell as he expected he contacted not kyndreth directly but one of the great lords many underlings the plainlyclad elvenlord stared up at him with a solemn and expectant expression on his long face would you please consult with lyon lord kyndreth kyrtian asked politely please inform him that i believe we need to change our battleplans he explained his new plans carefully and the reasons for them while the underling took detailed and copious notes occasionally stopping and asking him politely to repeat or elaborate on something kyrtian was impressed hed encountered no few of lord kyrtians flunkies who had been utterly bored with him and his campaign since hed been put in charge of the army but this fellow was not of that ilk im to be your liaison with lord kyndreth for the foreseeable future lord kyrtian the underling said solemnly lord kyndreth has made it very clear that your reports are to be given his first consideration and i have the authority to break in upon him at any timeincluding in his sleep if you should deem your report to be sufficiently urgent well well well kyrtian blinked its not urgent since well still be moving through territory that the young lords have abandoned for at least two more days but i should like to hear his opinion before we break camp and move at dawn tomorrow the underling gave a slight bow of his head i shall see to it that he reads this report and communicate your request to him within the hour lord kyrtian the telesonscreen went blank again and gel who had stayed carefully out of range for the duration of the conversation chuckled it seems that your value has gone up in the world kyrtian so it does kyrtian replied and put a thin flat plate of bespelled bronze over the telesonscreen fitting it into the slight depression where the glass had been inset there to prevent it from being inadvertently activated should someonelord kyndreth hopefullywish to contact him while the plate was in place the plate itself would glow and emit a pleasant repeating chime to alert him kyrtian always plated his teleson when he wasnt using it himself it was possible for outsiders to activate ones screen and spy on what was going on within its range if they had a key to itlike the ones he had to lord kyndreths teleson and his mothers and keys could be duplicated by even the weakest of mages with the plate in place he turned to gel interesting dont you think he asked are you thinking what im thinking that lord kyndreths own status is going up because of what youve managed to do out here gel countered at kyrtians nod he pursed his lips if thats the case he may want you to press ahead to moths estate anyway so we have to think of an alternate plan the more kyrtian thought about it the less he wanted to press the young lords now holding the estate that moths husband had once owned weve got to give him a richer victory not just the possibility but the real thing ah horse turds gel said sourly you dont ask much do you let me get some scouts out maybe they can find us a juicy prize he stalked out of the tent to round up a few of the scouts who had in all likelihood settled in at their campfire and would not be pleased to be sent out again the scouts were all elvenlords of coursethe previous commander had not trusted humans to run free and act as scouts and kyrtian was not going to risk any of his own people in this situation none of them had more than the bare minimum of magic they were elven only by benefit of birth and blood in the world of the great lords they were useful only as overseers and supervisors of humans and breeders of possible mates for unmarried sons or themselves they were expendable and often treated worse than slaves deemed to be more valuable such as treasured concubines or skilled gladiators from the beginning kyrtian treated them with respect and as a consequence had gradually won their loyalty to the point where they had accepted gel as kyrtians secondincommand something no great lord would ever do he took pains never to show them that he felt sorry for them but he did in the long story of the elvenlords in this place next to the history of the enslaved and abused humans theirs was the saddest a chiming from the bronze plate at his elbow broke into his thoughts and he hastily uncovered the teleson the craggily handsome face of lord kyndreth himself stared up at him and kyrtian made a sketchy salute hrotheran passed on your request and the reason for it kyndreth rumbled my first thought was that the young pups wouldnt dare threaten harm to another elvenlord or lady but he chuckled harshly my next thought was that they already have well kyrtian replied yes frankly weve no way of knowing if the deaths of some of the lesser lords on their estates were at the hands of revolting slaves or of the young lords they wouldnt admit it if they had killed one of us not when they know very well how harsh the penalties will be when we defeat them kyndreth smiled without any humor you show a fine grasp of reality for such a young man id expected a little more idealism from you until this last message of yours my lord i have studied our history since evelon well enough to realize that honor is only for those who can afford it kyrtian replied without any expression in his voice we have the all the advantages and can afford to be honorable they cannot and the only reason they havent taken such a step before this is probably because it hasnt occurred to them he paused and added judiciously i am afraid that i have not yet detected much in the way of imagination in their tactics i should not like to be the one to give them ideas that would not have arisen on their own well said now ill handle the council you go on as you have kyndreth chuckled dryly this time with just a touch of real amusement given their past performance its entirely possible that the puppies will panic and just abandon their stronghold anyway when youve flanked them keep me informed yes my lord kyrtian said but the great lord had already broken his spell and the connection the telesonplate reflected only kyrtians own face it was moths own people and not the young lords headquartered on her old estate who gave her the astonishing news that kyrtians forces were inexplicably turning aside without trying to take the young lords stronghold shed had the cleverest of her boys out shadowing the army and it was one of these who had come back in the dawn to report that the army was up and away at right angles to their previous line of march they were not merely clever four of them had the human magic the knack of listening to the thoughts of others when they were close enough they were able to hear what the common fighters and even some of the officers knew and that was invaluable the army was now headed presumably for the trainingcamp that the young lords had set up to retrain some of the gladiators that they had taken as soldiers they just up and changed march little mother the swarthy squat young human told her as she kept refilling his glass and his plate the boys tended to forget about eating and drinking while they were out there and came back starved and ready to drink a lake its as if they got different orders last night lady moth considered this information for a moment then made up her mind lasen on a fast horse how long do you think it would take me to catch up to the army she asked the man stared at her understanding slowly coming into his brown eyes his brow wrinkled with concern so that he looked like a worried hound he knew her he knew better than to try and dissuade her he didnt have to read her thoughts to know what they were although if he had cared to he probably could have since he was one of the four with wizardpowers he wont though those boys think its impolite to hear thoughts without permission if you re a friend he probably wouldnt even think of doing it unless my life or his was at stake the dear child there was nothing in her thoughts she cared to hide from anyone these daysthough when shed been younger you could catch them by sundown he told her slowly but the question is can you come at lord kyrtian through all of his army and come away again back to us a fleeting ghost of fear traveled across his face then and it was that fear she answered before she addressed the spoken question i have no intention of abandoning all of you my lad she said fondly and tapped his shoulder in mockadmonition with the book she was holding never fear that you and the rest are all the family i have now and all the family i want i want to talk to kyrtian thats all i think i can do a lot for all of us if i can just talk to him lasen looked skeptical and lady moth smiled little mother this is the army commander not one of your young lords hes no older than the young lords my lad and whats more if you think im good to my people you should see his i pledge you my word for it lasen nodded slowly moth didnt often pledge her word all her humans knew that when she did she was beyond certain of what she promised a little of the concern cleared from his face as for getting in and out she chuckled no fear there either so long as there isnt another elvenlord i have to outwit ill get in and out again ill have starfoot saddled and waitingand its myself that will come with you then lasen said in a voice that told her that he would be just as stubborn as she on that point she inclined her head in tacit agreement and went off to tell viridina what she intended and to change her gown for something more suited to the task at hand lasen waited at the door of the stable starfoot and another horse saddled and ready when she arrived clad in breeches and somber tunic of brown doeskin starfoot was a mare so named not because she was lovely for in actual fact she was as ugly as a mudpie and scrawny as a sapling but because she was fleet as any shootingstar she was perfect for such a task her mudcolor would hide her just as the brown of moths clothing would serve the same purpose lasen had chosen another mudcolored swift horse a gelding that was starfoots halfbrother and already wore dustgrey tunic and breeches for the same camouflaging purpose and lasen had one other advantage as her guide and guard he had the human magic of speaking and hearing in thoughts no one would get near to them without him knowing and they could avoid the armys own scouts and sentries easily that was the one thing that idiot elvenlords always forget moth thought sourly as she mounted starfoot a little stiffly human magic makes it possible for them to know long before an enemy arrives it was a long hard ride even for moth who was used to riding the bounds of her own estate every day they did not stop except to rest the horses and allow them to drink and snatch a mouthful of oats and it was after sunset when they finally saw the campfires of kyrtians army from the top of a hill like strange yellow stars sprinkled across the hillside opposite them lasen stared at the encampment the password is a fine satin sheep he said after a moments pause sheep not sheet she asked nonplused definitely sheep he replied theyre using nonsense phrases just to make things a bit more secure moth dismounted no need to order lasen to watch the horses and lie concealed while she made her way into the army he vanished into the darkness behind her she worked her magic on herself she was already as thin and bony as many human men and her loose tunic concealed what there was of her figure with her long hair knotted on the top of her head and hidden beneath a cap she needed only to alter her appearance a trifle to pass as a slave round her ears darken her skin and so long as she kept her head down simply darkening her eyes would suffice to hide what she was and the magic of elven women after all was to alter small things it hurt that was the worst of it her ears burned as if she had dipped them in boiling water as she rounded the points and she bit her nether lip until it bled to keep from crying out then it was the turn of her eyesnot so difficult this to change the color and not as painful then following the whispered conversation that lasen had given her before he vanished she walked into the army encampment thanks to lasen she had the password she needed to pass the sentries quite as if she was part of the army herself no one even gave her a second glance as she strode stiffly among the campfires in the flickering light from fire and torch that made it possible to pull off the next part of her ruse she kept a sharp eye out for something she could use to get up as far as and even into kyrtians tent one piece at a time she managed to pilfer a tray a plate and a roughhewn wooden cup with a breath of her own magic they acquired a patina of silver water took on the rosy hue of wine and a couple of chunks of wood became meat cheese and bread at least on the surface a snatched handful of weeds transformed into tastylooking garden greens put the final touches on this all looked edible although it wasnt but by no means more than a scant touch above the ordinary soldiers ra tions she knew her nephew knew that was what he would eat by choice she didnt want her excuse for entrance to be snatched away by the officious servant of some lesser elvenlord just because it looked tasty enough to be appetizing to his master by this time she was well up to the cluster of tents of the commanders the larger size of kyrtians made it obvious which was his there were guards on the tent but her age size and burden made her status and errand obvious and they gave her the merest of cursory onceovers to ensure that she wasnt armed before holding the flap aside and sending her in kyrtian and his human shadow gel were bent over maps seemingly oblivious to anything else she cleared her throat ostentatiously neither of them turned around or even so much as started we know youre there gel said crosslywhich relieved her somewhat since shed been a little alarmed at how easily she had gotten close to her nephew unchallenged put it down and get out thats a fine way to talk to your lords aunt she replied loudly enough so they could hear her but softly enough that her voice shouldnt carry to the guards outside they pivoted so fast to look at her their eyes so wide and shocked that she chuckled moth moth kyrtian squeaked voice just now starting to break boy moth replied with a grin putting down her inedible burden always knew everything about you was slow to grow but your mind but isnt that a bit much so thats the situation then kyrtian finished the arrival of his aunt on his very doorstepand disguised as a human slave no lesshad been something of a shock a pleasant shock however and i dont mind telling you that ive been scrambling to find some excuse not to rescue you he and moth had been talking nonstop for so long that they were both hoarse and once he got over his surprise he had never been so glad to see anyone in his life well she ruminated you can see why i was in no great hurry to be rescued these young rebels are still not the best answer to our troubles but theyre a damn sight better than their fathers he reached for a pitcher of something she had conjured up out of water a handful of blossoms and a bit of magic and poured cups of the stuff for both of them whatever it was it had as good an effect on a hoarse throat as honeyed tea i dont know what to do he admitted i cant stop commanding the armyit will just mean humans slaughtering humans at least this way im keeping bloodshed to a minimum but if i defeat the young lords mother thinks the great lords will turn the army against the wizards and never mind the treaty your mothers right moth said sourly her mouth twisted up into a scowl there was never an agreement reached by any of the great lords that wasnt broken as soon as one or the other of them could manage it and thats a fact youd better get used to theres no honor among them your cousin is just a bit more open about his treachery than most of them are if he was good hed have had your estate years ago kyrtian could only shake his head since taking command he had gotten one example after another of the duplicity of his own race and he was still having a hard time getting used to it what was the point of all this doubleand triplecrossing anyway wasnt the world wide enough for everyone to prosper evidently not or at least not so far as the great lords were concerned gels sardonic expression and occasional sarcastic comments had made it very clear that he was not anywhere near as innocent as kyrtian had been and all things considered lady lydiell probably wasnt either look gel said breaking into his thoughts we need a plan and i think i have one but it depends on moths ability to scare the whey out of these pet rebels of hers he raised an eyebrow at her can you depends on what you and this army of yours can do she temporized whats the plan you can go as yourself to this trainingcamp the gladiators will trust your humans i suspect fighters tend to trust other fighters whatever it takes see if you can get them to listen to you and agree to what you want to do she smiled it wont take much she told them both wearing an expression that told them she was mightily pleased with herself i can negate their collars ive enough bits of iron to do that weve done some experimenting and all it takes is a thin sheet of it slipped in behind and around the lock and beryl and you can pry the collar off without hurting the slave i always carry a few pieces with me now just in case hah gel hit the table with his fist greatly pleased good you tell em that when we attack if they scatter instead of fighting well open up our lines at a particular point inside the forest to let em through then swallow them up into the army kyrtian immediately saw what gel had in mindthey had a cadre of fighters that gel trusted trained up now who were actually loyal to kyrtian so even if say lord kyndreth was watching via magic all he would see was that the enemy gladiators scattered and nothing more he also had a good idea what gel was going to suggest next then he took over moth you go to your rebels and suggest that they break up and get out of the estates take to the hills with small groups to avoid being captured and start a guerrilla war his aunt absorbed all this for a moment then a smile broke out on her face i see i scare the youngsters by telling them what i personally witnessed of the slaughter of their best troops and convince them that they cant possibly hold out directly they abandon the estates or at least the ones that still have older relatives among the great lords to claim them which is half of what their fathers want i can be rescued and serve as their eyes and ears into what their fathers are up to which gives you eyes and ears into what theyre doing so you can arrange things to your liking you still have a war that you can fight in tiny skirmishes without ever coming to a conclusion her grin widened i can even offer to hide the ringleaders and some of the rest on the property i hold now and they can run their fight from there kyrtian gave her a little bow of respect she should have been a general which means the great lords wont send me against the wizards at least not for a while he considered the next move in the plan we can delay things for a while while i try and come up with a better solution lady moth laughed mockingly and my reward is to get my husbands estate back which is no bad bribe for my complicity boy there has to be something in this bargain for you my lady he demurred she shook her head at him i think this will work for a while anyway gel voiced his own opinion i like it and ive got no particular objection to patching together temporary solutions for the next two decades lady moth stood up time for me to go boy when you have the time find an excuse to come to the estateive found some things in the library i think will interest you she didnt waste time on farewells lady moth was not one to waste time on anything as kyrtian recalled a brief embrace for him and a sketchy salute for gel was all she gave then she was out of the tent and back on her way to her waiting human escort gel followed her out to be sure she got back safely through the lines while he was gone kyrtian folded the maps tidied the tent and removed the bronze plaque from the teleson he wanted to talk to lady lydiell about this while it was all still fresh in his mind it was worth the chance of being overheard although given that this was a very odd hour to be talking to her that was less likely this time lydiell listened to his brief summary with her eyes alight if this had been anyone other than moth i would have said it was too good to be true she said when he was finished but it is moth and frankly its exactly the sort of thing i would expect out of her welllook what shes done on her own discovering how to negate the collarspells and get them off without hurting the slaves useful bit of information that kyrtian murmured thinking out loud it would have to be a human that did it though i wouldnt want to chance either poisoning by the metal or magical backlash mother how am i going to keep lord kyndreth from suspecting that something is up when all resistance suddenly melts away by staging more of a rout at this next mockbattle than youre likely to get from the handful of former gladiators there she said instantly you and i will create a gate from here to there and well send through all of our people that can fight theyll pose as slaves of the young lordstheyll hold a line then break and routstraight back to the gate and home that will give you something to convince kyndreth that youve won a conclusive victory a gate can i do that he asked doubtfully am i strong enough not by yourselfbut remember what you discovered about combining magic from several people she countered you have me and the others here together we will have quite enough to create a gate he nodded and began to feel more confident perhaps i should invite lord kyndreth to observe at a distance she answered with the council theres an old viewingteleson in the council chamber they probably havent used it since the disastrous debacle with lord dyran but if i choose where to put the telesonsender theyll see what i want them to see this was coming out better and better and with all of the great lords jostling about they arent going to notice the gate they wont notice it anyway lydiell said with confidence its very noisy but they wont be expecting it and theyll be too far away theyd have to know something like that was going on oh i can cover it with some levinbolts anyway kyrtian decided theyd be expecting something of the sort mother i think this is going to work i never doubted that you would find a way she said serenely when they ended their conversation and he had covered the telesonscreen again he waited impatiently for gel to return so that he could work out all the details of this addition to the plan for the first time since he had taken over the command of the great lords army he began to hope he could save not only his own people but everyone involved or at least almost everyone and that was so much more than he had ever thought hed be able to do that he felt as if he had just drunk an entire bottle of sparkling wine now lets hope all this doesnt prove to be as ephemeral as winejoy the ears outside lord kyrtians tent are a lot keener than he has any reason to guess keman thought with glee as he heard kyrtian concluding the second conversation of the day with lady lydiell so elvenlord why havent you figured out that you have dragons on your doorstepliterally keman shanas fosterbrother was of course that dragon so was his partner in this spying endeavor although she came from a lair that had never known there were other dragons in the world until she met him dragons with their ability to shapechange into virtually anything they chose were uniquely suited to spying on the elves who could easily crack any disguise wrought with illusions in spite of the fact that in his real form he was easily forty or fifty times the bulk of even the strongest and tallest male human or elf hed ever seen the draconic gift of being able to push mass and weight elsewherethey called it into the outmade it possible for him to masquerade as even a small child he and dora had shapechanged themselves into human fighters and insinuated themselves into the great lords army as soon as it became obvious that this new commander was just as brilliant as the old one had been incompetent when they first began this task on shanas behalf they had gone from one great lords household to another in the forms of various slavessince no great lord ever bothered to take note of a mere human so long as he didnt disobey and had no hint of magic as an elf understood it about him they had actually been in lord kyndreths household as a pair of pages when the first news of lord kyrtians victories came in from there it had been a matter of simplicity to insinuate themselves into the company of fighters the great lord sent to augment the army the only hard part had been slipping away at night every so often to hunt for a dragon needed vastly more food than a human even that hadnt been too horribly difficult and they had been keeping shana informed faithfully of all that this new commander was doing it had taken him a little time to get used to his partners outward appearance however having a grizzled musclebound surly male look at him while he was hearing doras voice in his mind was a little unsettling and it hardly needed to be said that while they were in these guises they could not even make the most casual of affectionate gestures towards one another not even the sorts of things that had been possible as pages only when they flew in their own shapes could he court her as she deserved keman and dora werent the guards just outside the tent flaps of lord kyrtians tentthat position was reserved for the handful of men that sergeant gel had tested and tried and found trustworthy for one thing although both dragons might look like fighters they didnt have any real skill with the formidable weapons that they heldskill did not come with the shape alas they hadnt even been among the volunteers hoping for such a position no they were guarding the wagons holding the possessions of the other elvenlords serving as kyrtians officers possessions which had not been unpacked for days much to the disgruntlement of their owners since the speed of march had not permitted the kind of leisurely camping with luxuries that the previous commander had allowed it was a good thing that darkness cloaked any faint signs of his impatience for keman could hardly contain himself they had known for some time that lord kyrtian was very unlike lord levelis the previous commander in more ways than simple competence for one thing his method of training was astoundingusing magic to counterfeit blades and other weapons so that it was possible to acquire real skill without ever getting hurt for the first time a human slave delegated to the position of fighter stood a decent chance of surviving and would manage to get through his training period without being killed or maimed that in and of itself had brought excitement among the ranks to a fever pitch but there was soon more to rejoice in rumor in the ranks had soon been proved truththat lord kyrtian actually cared about the humans who served in the ranks and was not inclined to throw them into combat and use them up the way his predecessor had but until tonight they had not realized how wildly different his attitudes toward humans were from those of other elvenlords it seemed that lady moth and the late and lamented lord valyn were not the only ones of their kind to regard humans as something other than objects of possession creatures destined by birth to serve and be consumed and tossed away at the whims of their elven masters even the rebellious young lords had proved something of a disappointment once they had a modicum of powerthe humans under their control might not have to fear the terrible punishments inflicted on them by magic anymore but they were still slaves and treated as such not so with lord kyrtian whose very secondincommand was a human much to the further disgruntlement of the elvenlords serving as officers wait until shana hears all this he thought hardly able to contain himself and wait for the next shift of guards to come and relieve them it was clear to keman at least that someone from the wizards was going to have to approach lord kyrtian they couldnt afford not to now it was clear from his two conversations that he did not want to find himself forced to hunt down the wizards which he would if he managed to defeat the young lords what was more it was entirely likely that he could find them and beat them in combat the one thing that had saved them in the past was that the elvenlords had used mostly magic against the wizardsand the wizards had used mostly magic against their foes the problem was that the wizards main defense now was the use of ironwhich was brilliant but did prevent them from using magic offensively the dragons could help but they were as vulnerable to real weapons as humans and halfbloods wereand lord kyrtian could field an army of slaves that would have no difficulty in defeating any wizard army unless of course the iron people could be convinced to help ah but why should they why should they actually fight when they themselves were in no real danger from the elvenlords and they could always go back to the south and safety their leader the iron priest diric certainly liked shana and her friends but he was a pragmatic sort and he could lose his position if he advocated something that would bring danger to the iron people with little or no reward ah but now they knew that lord kyrtian didnt want to fight the wizards true he might find himself in the position where he had to appear to fight them but if the wizards were in secret partnership with lord kyrtian he could obey the orders to do so with every appearance of obedience to the council if for instance he knew where the wizards actually were he could hunt unsuccessfully but dutifully everywhere that they werent until the council got tired of it all and disbanded the army sooner or later they would do just that especially if the wizards were able to help in that direction it wouldnt be difficult to stage scenes of abandoned camps and great desolation to make it look as if once chased from the haven of the citadel the wizards had found it impossible to survive in the wilderness kemans thoughts filled with contempt for the old whiners they would have had that very problem if it hadnt been for shana and the dragons caellach gwain and the others like him were no more equipped to take care of themselves than the pampered elvenlords themselves would have been if stripped of magical powers put some forlorn settlements together made of mud huts with crumbling walls and cavedin roofs and scatter a few bones about and leave them for lord kyrtian to discover and the elvenlords might be convinced that if any halfbloods did survive they were not worth pursuing and then keman thought when were secure again we might even be able to secretly trade with lord kyrtian for things that we need although he liked diric and the iron people and the folk of the trader clans enormously it made him very uneasy that the wizards now depended on these two sets of relative strangers who after all had agendas of their own for the things they couldnt produce themselves keman could never forget that the iron people had once held him shana mero and father dragon captiveiron priest diric had nearly been toppled from his seat of power once and it could happen again keman would rather that his friends and fostersister had one more layer to their net of survival the wizards had once stolen what they wanted from the supplywagons of the elvenlords themselves but that had all come to an end when the elvenlords realized that they still existed and were pilfering supplies such thefts were too dangerous now and in fact had been forbidden by the tenuous treaty that the elvenlords had agreed to with thembut the wizards were not craftsfolk or terribly successful farmers huntersoh my yesthey merely had to magically transport an animal from the forest or fields by magic to kill it and even the least skilled of them could do that for magic was one stalker that no beast could scent meat of all sorts they had in abundance and hides and the rather lovely horns of alicorns but the best they were able to do in the way of agriculture was a bit of vegetablegardening shana one of the few wizards to manage the transportation spell that enabled her to move living creatures intact had been able to bring the flock of sheep that had been at the old citadel and had purloined some chickens that had strayed and so were technically not elvenlord property keman and kalamadea had brought them goats and even horses but the terrain around the caves they had taken to live in was simply unsuited for cultivating grain and as for crafts well at some point they were going to run out of cloth and there werent more than a dozen of the fullyhuman exslaves among them that knew how to spin and weave there was one single potter and no glassmakers as for metalsmiths well the less said the better true the iron people had smiths in plenty but they were down in the plain and thus far there hadnt been a great deal that the wizards could provide that the iron people wanted in trade at least three quarters of that lack of skilled workers was due to the attitudes of caellach gwain and his cronies what sensible wild human or even a former slave especially one with skills and a trade would care to settle among people who regarded him as an inferior peon who should be happy to serve his betters with no thought for compensation no few of the slaves that had escaped during the young lords initial revolt had settled briefly with the wizards then drifted off with the traders to settle elsewhere theyre as bad as the elvenlords keman thought not for the first time for now they were relying on the things that had once been stockpiled in the citadel they hadnt been able to carry those things away with them but the citadel had somehow remained unpenetratedor at least no one had bothered to loot it or destroy what was in it shana had teams of the younger wizards working together to transport everything possible out of there and into the hands of those who actually owned the things or into the storagerooms of their new home some things were in surplusanything that didnt get used up or suffer much from wear and tear nevertheless they had moremany more bodies to clothe and mouths to feed than theyd had back when only halfblooded wizards lived in the old citadel but if they could set up a tradingagreement with a real elven estate well then their transportation magics could be used to swap hides and meat raw lumber even the gems and precious metals that were so easy for the dragons to coax up out of the earth for most of those things that they now depended on the traders and iron people for dont depend on that egg to hatch just yet keman he warned himself report to shana first its more important to get to the point where we ve got an agreement with this kyrtian that will prevent him and the army from coming after us their relief party arrived just then two stripling humans that had been recruited from the ranks of the gladiators and looked itmuscled everywhere including between their ears they presented themselves with the proper password and he and dora gratefully surrendered their arms to the new sentries and plodded down the hill to their own campsite they had managed to make themselves unpopular not by unpleasant behavior but simply by being unfriendly and taciturn no one disliked them but no one wanted to associate with them either humans in kemans experience when away from their familiar surroundings needed to socialize when any particular human offered a cold shoulder he was generally shut out tacitly so keman and dora had a little fire to themselves they undertook their duties in silence and now they collected their rations from the common campkitchen without comment beyond a grunt or a nod they brought their food back to their camp and to all appearances settled down to their belated dinners ah but beneath the surface thoughts were flying between them they were in fact mostly finished with that rather meager by draconic standards meal before the exchanges got beyond incredulous can you believe what he said and similar exclamations of astonishment how soon tonight do you think shana will try and make contact with us dora asked at last we have to tell her about this if we can somehow get this kyrtian on our side it will make all the difference kemans face showed no expression but there was nothing but glee in his thoughts its what weve needed all along reallywhat shana has needed he amended oh we dragons have thrown our lot in with the wizards now no matter what some of us think dora said cheerfully its what we need an ally and a person inside the ranks of the elvenlords keman thought a chuckle it wouldn t hurt the trader clans to discover theyve got some competition either he was beginning to resent the casual way in which the traders had assumed that the wizards were totally at their mercy now when it came to things that the wizards couldnt produce his persistent fear was that the traders would learn that the iron folk most valued and needed the metal that gave them their name and would find a way to supply it in quantity thereby giving the iron people no reason to continue their alliance with the wizards that could be a disaster without the iron people the wizards didnt have a lot of fightingtypes if it came to real combat but if we can get this new commander on our side we wont need any fighters dora reminded him excitedly i wouldnt want to abandon the alliance though he replied with caution as he took her tin plate and his own and scraped coals into both of them to burn off the remains of their stew the most common way any of these humans here cleaned their dishes when they were done with them even the cooks cleaned their great pots this way sometimes especially lately with kyrtian moving the army from dawn to just before dark chasing the young lords army well do you think youve sufficiently calmed down enough to help me reach shana he teased as he sat down across the fire from her her reply was not translatable but was rude he almost cracked his disguise with a grin then they settled into their tasklooking from the outside as if they were two middleaged weary men dozing by their fire shana had hardly been able to believe what keman told her in fact the moment hed told her what lord kyrtian was plotting with his aunt morthena shed asked him to wait for a moment then her blood singing with excitement she ran to get lorryn so that he could hear and verify it before it actually sank in as truth she pounded down the rough stone corridors red hair streaming behind her from her chambers to the commonroom where he was sitting with zed and one or two others practicing working in concert and using gemstones to focus and amplify their powers these were the skills that the younger wizards had developed that enabled them to do so much more than their eldersabilities which caellach gwain and his cronies resented without actually troubling themselves to learn keman has some news she said breathlessly as the little group looked up with some surprise at her hasty entrance id like to hear what you think about it if you can spare the time lorryn certainly we were just about finished anyway lorryn stood up and handed the basketfull of baby chicks hed been cradling in his lap to zed with a grin i never thought that id find myself purloining chickens with magic when i ran off to join the wizards hah can you think of any better way to practice the safe transportation spell zed countered with his own wide grin splitting his tanned and swarthy face if you flatten a chick or two its no great loss but theyre sowell cuteid feel guilty lorryn protested looking down at the yellow balls of fluff while they cheeped sleepily zed only grinned wider all the more incentive then he pointed out lets take a walk shana suggesteda good excuse to get away from the others she didnt want to raise hopes that might be crushed lorryn could be trusted to consider all possible outcomes and not just the most desired together they could discuss possibilitiesgrim as well as hopeful which is just another reason why im glad hes with me shed fallen into the habit of considering him as a partner so quickly it was almost as magical as any spell how not she knew she could depend on him to do something when she asked him to but even more importantly she knew she could depend on him to do something he saw needed doing even if she didnt ask after a quick walk up to one of the concealed exits on the top of the hill covering their cavecomplex the two of them were out under the stars it wasnt likely that theyd be overheard but shana related what keman had told her mindtomind anyway just because something wasnt likely that was no reason to assume it wouldnt happen and the old whiners are just as like to set someone to spy on us as not she thought resentfully the fat would be in the fire if they even thought that i was going to open negotiations with an elvenlord ancestors lorryn exclaimed this is fantastic news i would never ever have anticipated this while shana went to get lorryn keman had been waiting patiently now she sat down on a rock and concentrated on the focusstone in her hand contacting him once again i have lorryn she told him opening her thoughts slightly so that lorryn could sense what keman was telling her can you go through all that again for both of us keman was only too willing to shana sensed both lorryns growing excitement and that of dora behind kemans carefully controlled thoughts but lorryn sobered immediately after the first burst of incredulous enthusiasm and didnt interrupt anymore while keman concluded his report to shana it was difficult enough for them to maintain contact at such extreme distance and shana appreciated that he kept his own thoughts quiet while she and her fosterbrother finished their business but keman had an idea of his own for their situation that he voiced before they broke off contactshana why dont you ask mother and kalamadea to find iron for you oh i know it interferes too much even with our magic for them to bring it to the surface but surely they can find it and once its been found you can work out how to mine it surely the iron people know how can ask she replied good the more claws we have sharpened the better was his final reply thats not a bad thought shana said aloud as a mental silence filled the place where kemans wordthoughts had been she headed back down into the caverns with lorryn following beside her but i thought the dragons didnt much like being around iron they dont lorryn agreed but father dragon and your fostermother alara are likely to agree to do just about anything within reason that you ask them to dont you think hmm somehow i cant believe that its going to be that easy shana told him skeptically still theres no harm in asking and no time like the present lorryn agreed she was not at all displeased when he took her hand and squeezed it encouragingly then didnt bother to let it go as they descended once again into the citadel corridors and when they found the two dragons who next to keman had most closely aligned themselves with the wizards she put the question to them they had made themselves real lairs here which was no great difficulty for a dragon a creature who could shape rock and earth to its will the two of them were in alaras lair reclining in their natural forms in smooth hollows filled with the soft sand that dragons preferred to rest in father dragon kalamadea by actual namewas not at his full size in here for dragons never really stopped growing as long as they lived and father dragon was very very old and his size was immense he would hardly have fit in one of alaras hollows if he hadnt shifted part of his bulk into the out first even so both of them were huge dwarfing the two halfbloods next to them alaras scarletscaled torso could have served as a hut if it were hollow i thought what you needed were gemstones and precious metals to trade with alara responded to shanas question her bobbing head indicating her confusion thats what weve all been looking for thats what you asked us to find shana grimaced i know that was my mistake i thought so tooactually i didnt really think not even when shadow told us how nervy the iron people were getting without any new source of metal for their forges two mistakes then i suppose if i had thought about it at all i just assumed that now that the iron people were settling theyd find their own iron so can you find it more or less kalamadea rumbled lifting his head from his foreclaws remember after all that we use magic to find things and since the rotten metal interferes with magic its very presence is going to interfere with locating it well actually have to do some roundabout reckoning on where the interference is strongest to find veins of ore i knew it couldnt be all that easy shana muttered to herself but at least father dragon seemed to think that there was a way to work around the problem and that was more than she had expected we also wont be able to bring it to the surface the way we can the silver and gold alara sighed regretfully so once we find it youll still have to dig for it and itll be ore rather than the nice pure nuggets of other things we can bring up oh ancestors lorryn said in mock dismay think of itone more reason for ablebodied folks to have to leave the citadel which means fewer servants to attend to the whims of the old whiners they might actually have to learn to clean up after themselves once in a while shana had noticed that lorryn had if anything less patience with caellach gwain than she did although you would never have known it by the way he acted with the old wizard and his cronies she smiled i wouldnt mind taking my turn on the end of a shovel she volunteered especially if it meant that you would take over dealing with them instead of me he groaned and shook his head oh shanaall right i suppose that among the three of us parth agon denelor and i can handle them ive noticed a distinct improvement in parths attitude ever since hes seen just what an idiot caellach is being and denelor always was a dear shana said speaking fondly of her former teacher and the master to her apprentice kalamadea snorted i would not have used that description he said but he certainly is far more willing to adapt accommodate and change than any of the other older wizards well i would say that we have something of a plan then alara and one or two of the others should be the ones to go looking for rotten metal when they find some that is not too far beneath the surface you and a few hardy souls shana can see about digging some up meanwhile lorryn will advise parth agon with the help of denelorand me shana almost laughed aloud at that last if caellach was afraid of anything it was of the dragons and kalamadea was the most imposing of his kind caellach had triedand nearly succeededin undoing all of the reforms of the younger wizards once when shana had been away from the citadel as it happened she had been the captive at the time of the iron people as had kalamadea and keman so there had been no one in place to keep caellach gwain in check you or i shana will always have a presence here and lorryn too i think father dragon rumbled confirming her thought at least until the day when caellach gwain swells up with indignation and explodes they all laughed so hard at the images conjured up by that statement that a sleepy older wizard padded grumbling into the lair to lodge a protest at having her sleep disturbed and went away muttering under her breath kyrtian sat uneasily on his horse in the chill darkness just before dawn he had brought in his troops just after midnight positioning them as if this was going to be a real fight and not the sham thing that he and moth had arranged after all the only people that knew it was a sham were his own people on both sides of the coming battle all of moths people and he and gel it was a given that some of his commanders if not all of them were reporting to one or more of the great lords kyrtian wanted them to report the most impressive victory yetand the most decisive this would be enjoyable only if he was down there with his troops he would have given a great deal to be able to leap out of his saddle and head up the men he knew so well well the only reason it would be enjoyable is because i know how much of this attack is sham ancestors but it was cold armor and padded gambeson werent doing a lot against the dankness which penetrated everything in fact the armor was only making things worse it sucked heat away from him instead of holding it in andwas there actually dew condensing on it a cold droplet sparkled for a moment just before his eyes then dropped off the tip of his helm to splash onto his nose there was he shivered and tried to stop himself it only made his ridiculous useless overornamented armor rattle not possible for him to join his men where they waited for the signal to attack of course the great lords who were his ultimate masters here would one and all have had him hauled up in front of them for recklessness and blatant disregard for his position so he had to sit on a horse on a hillmaking an excellent target incidentally had his magic not been so strongand direct his fighters from afar never once dirtying his hands with actual combat oh no that was beneath his dignity as a commander and damaging to the authority of elves in general and the great council in the person of its designated commander in particular at least this time he would have something to do besides sit and watch and issue an occasional order moths young rebels were going to be very visibly in the field today they were also going to be wearing some of that bizarre jewelry shed told him about they couldnt work any magic while wearing it but that didnt matter since most of them didnt have that much in the first place it would protect them from his levinbolts they wanted to demonstrate in the most public forum possible that their fathers could no longer threaten to strike them down in that particular fashion i cannot imagine that i just cant i know intellectually that there are men out there who think of their sons as possessions and are perfectly willing to destroy them and try begetting a son again if their possessions offend them but i still cannot fathom it in my heart since their fathers didnt know it was only sets of goldplated cuffs and torques that protected the rebellious young lords and not some new sort of magic this demonstration was going to set the council rather well aback the rebels aren t just young lords either though most of them here are moth had given him a brief summary of the rebellionand to say that hed been shocked was an understatement theres a considerable number of the ones who are lords only because they arent human the scornfully disregarded elvenlords no one talks aboutthe ones with little magic moth had introduced him to two of those bitter rebels men lord kyndreths age if not older i wonder if the great lords have any idea how cordially they are hated by so many of their inferiors mind this invulnerability to levinbolts wasnt going to do the rebels any practical good in the planned scenario kyrtians army was too large and wellorganized and when the rebels fled their army would fall apart kyrtians men had orders to take anyone who surrendered as a prisoner the rebels had no illusions about the loyalty of their slavefighters when they fled their army would drop weapons and capitulate kyrtians victory was a certaintyas finely scripted as a court dance and as predictable it was definitely getting lighter when hed first brought his reluctant mount up here beneath these trees it had been too dark to see now the horizon had lightened and he could make out the dark shapes of trees and undergrowth beneath him and in the distance the square and rectangular bulks of the buildings where their quarry waitedsupposedly asleep and unaware of the army about to descend on them good thing we arent going to have to besiege this place wed be here for months before battles or even the practices he and gel had held on the estate he usually got a tightening in his stomach a dry mouth and his skin felt hypersensitive not today in fact if anything he was bored and he wanted it over with the conclusion here was foregone the only question was whether or not any of moths people would be injured before they could surrender the young lords had actually chosen their supposed stronghold wellalthough there wasnt a man on the great council who would have valued it properly for the last couple of centuries it had been the very minor holding of a very minor elvenlord who had not been swallowed up by some greater lord only because he never quarreled with anyone never gave offense to anyone and raised nothing more desirable than herbs and spices this was finicky work far more than any great lord had any interest in undertaking so vtrayn ildren lord jeremin and his wife daughter and slaves had been left in peace until the rebellion that is at the moment lord ildren and his household were safely waiting out the conflict in their caravanserie in one of the cities so much for him what was of interest was his manor which in the far past had been one of the original fortified manors of this region built back when humans had armies and were considered at least a threat to elvenkind it had been further fortified at the beginning of the first wizard war making it quite a snug little retreat it was kyrtians opinion that its former owner would have done better to remain buttoned up inside it rather than fleeing to the city and the cramped discomfort of his tiny caravanserie but he hadnt and the rebels had appropriated it as a place to house and train their human fighters it had been therefore of minor strategic importance until this moment but he and moth had decided that for todays purpose it would play the role of the rebels headquarters so that when the young lords all went to ground on moths estate after a spectacular rout no one would be looking for them there it was a given that no one on the council would wonder why people who had been clever enough to choose a defensible structure like this one as their headquarters would also leave it for a pitched battle outside the walls of the structure analyzing the enemys strategy was not a skill that the great lords of the council exercised so long as things went their way they were not inclined to ask why or look the situation over very closely which is why they are in this particular quandary in the first place birds twittered softly and sleepily overhead they had begun to wake it wouldnt be much longer before the attack light seeped into the landscape revealing it in shades of bluegrey rounded shapes were bushes trees pointed ones rocky outcrops and in the far distance leagues below his hill the squares and rectangles were the fortified manor the light strengthened although the only sign of the sunrise to come was the steady brightening in the east a single figure stood sentry on the walls below those of the great lords observing this in their telesons must be laughing now one sentry and the gates wide open the gates were wide open so that the army within could boil out easilywhich in a moment when the sentry spotted the first of his troops attempting to approach by stealth and sounded the alert they would the distant figure suddenly moved and the thin wail of a trumpet carried up to kyrtians ears and the peace of the morning shattered like brittle glass as fighters erupted from every gate shouting their voices rising to kyrtian in a confused babble time to give the signal kyrtian stood up in his stirrups pointed his right hand skyward and launched a bolt of magic up to the deep bluegrey bowl of the predawn sky not a levinbolt but one of the harmless illusionbolts often used to enliven evening entertainments a soundless shower of colored sparks of light high in the air and now it was the turn of his army to emerge from the places where the men had lain hidden half the night not shouting but eerily silent like an army of spirits but they didnt stay silent for long that was too much to expect of flesh and blood halfway down the hill their nerves or their excitement got the better of them and their own throats opened with a collective roar beneath his horses hooves the ground shook and the terrified birds burst out of the tree above him at that moment before the two armies had even met kyrtian spotted the young lords coming out of the gates of their fortress he knew them by their colorful armor riding out through the flood of their own fighters their horses carried along like flotsam in a stream ha he had been told not to hold back and he didnt as soon as the foremost of the riders got free of the human sea about him kyrtian aimedgathered his power from the depths of his soulclasped both hands above his head and let loose a levinbolt at the nearest the levinbolt streaked from his clasped hands across the space between them a firestreaming comet and those who saw it and had the time to react flung themselves screaming out of its path anyone with any experience of levinbolts would see that this one was deadlyand strong it hitit hit kyrtians throat closed for a momentwhat if moth was wrong but in the same moment he knew he knew that moth had not been wrong for his fatal levinbolt in the moment of striking fragmented into a thousand shards of light blinding his view of his target for just a moment in the next moment there was his target unharmedthough the poor horse was frozen in place all four hooves planted yes it works now sure that he would not kill someone kyrtian didnt hesitate and at last he had a little of the thrill of battle the exultation of success bolt after bolt flew down the hill and into the chests of the young lords bolt after bolt shattered on their defenses just as the first had by now the fighters of both sides had cleared out of the way of the bolts which meant that aside from a few scattered pairs locked in combat the main body of troops werent actually fighting anyone that too was part of the plan but instead of taking heart from the failure of his levinbolts to killas any sane commander would havethe young lords apparently panicked when confronted by a mage of superior power they turned tail and fled not in a body but breaking from their army sending fighters tumbling out of the way of the hooves of their bolting steeds and scattering in every possible direction except towards the enemy whipping their horses in a frenzy of feigned fear and at the sight of their leaders in a rout which was of course the signal to certain of the human fighters to move into the next phase of the plan the rebel army itself suddenly broke off combat before it had even begun leaderless it was every man for himself and the humans were under no obligation to carry out the orders of masters who had abandoned them most surrendered or fled within moments the lions share of the ones who fled were kyrtiansbrought to augment the young lords troops and make the army look formidable enough to have been a real threat kyrtians men throwing down their weapons the better to flee unencumbered were heading for a gate that would take them home the rest dropped their weapons as well but threw themselves on their faces to surrenderkyrtian had counted on that and he had the satisfaction of seeing that the surrendering fighters managed to impede those who might have followed the ones who fled now there was some pleasure the thrill of seeing a plan unfold perfectly though there was and would not be any of the excitement and triumph of a real victory the great lords fighters pursuedbut the vanguard was composed of more of his own men and they managed to obstruct the passage of the men behind them by getting tangled up with those who were surrendering this managed to impede the rest of the fighters slowing them and permitting the vanquished to get a head start by the time real pursuit got underway the enemy was already too far ahead to pursue effectively afoot so given that kyrtian gave no orders to urge them on from his hilltop commandpost they began the easier task of taking charge of those who surrendered moth and lady virid ina had taken the precaution of tampering with every slavecollar to make it seem that the young lords had found a way to override the rightful owners compulsions gladiatorial slavesthe only ones that were reasonable candidates for combatwerent so plentiful these days that anyone would even consider killing or punishing these men for something they could not help if their original owners couldnt be determined theyd probably be allotted among the great lords as booty further enrichening the coffers of those who dont need it kyrtian felt almost depressed as he watched the chaos of the battlefield sort itself into tidy groups of prisoners and captors there didnt seem to be many dead or seriously wounded there were a few distant figures still on the ground but they were moving in a way that suggested injury but not serious trauma i should be glad of that and he wasbut he also felt as if hed been cheated somehow all of the preparation for a battlemore far more in the way of planning and organization but none of the excitement the most he felt was gratitude that it was done with and there were so few casualties the sun was only just cresting the eastern horizon the merest fingernailparing of hot rose and the battle was over so far as the great lords were concerned the war with their rebel offspring was over too now would come the hard part hunting them down individually or waiting for them to come crawling back looking for forgiveness that was what they would be thinking anyway and kyrtian was not about to allow them to discover any part of the truth he signaled to his horse and let it plod back down the hill to his tent time to prepare himself for lord kyndreths congratulations and pretend to an elation he didnt feel the subcommanders milled about in the background not daring to approach such exalted personages as lords of the council without being summoned but clearly hoping to be noticed kyrtian on the other hand was very much the center of attention and not feeling particularly comfortable in that position brilliant kyndreth boomed as kyrtian ducked his head modestly brilliant clearly they never guessed you would force a march after dark to get into place before sunrise i had made a point of always bivouacking before sunset until i knew where they had made their headquarters my lord kyrtian said as lord kyndreth accepted a glass of wine from one of the slaves i wanted them to see a pattern and become used to it kyrtians tent had been cleared of everything except tables and chairs borrowed from those of his underlings who insisted on traveling with suites of furniture with carpets on the floor and slaves holding trays of refreshments it could not have looked less like his campaign headquarters but lord kyndreth had insisted on gating here with a select few of the council nothing to trouble yourself about to tender his congratulations in person nothing to trouble yourself about had entailed nonstop frantic work on the part of his staff up until the very moment that the temporary gate opened and kyndreth and entourage marched through haof course youd never done such a thing before so they lacked the imagination to suppose that you would do it now kyndreth laughed as the other three great lords he had brought with him nodded wisely of course old levelis never did such a thing either levelis said one longfaced lord sourly never exerted himself to travel more than a league or two at a time levelis is an old fool lady moth snapped joining the discussion wineglass in hand and if it had been left up to him id still be penned up on my estate next midwinter moth rode over escorted by her bodyguards soon enough to welcome the councilors along with kyrtian and to serve as his hostess this was not the first time in the conversation that she had made a point of mentioning that kyrtian had rescued her from the rebels and it probably would not be the last entirely possible my lady the sourface councilor said with a slight bow and now what do you plan young commander he continued turning to kyrtian kyrtian sighed now my lord comes the most tedious most timeconsuming and leastrewarding part of this cam paign he replied we hunt down the fugitives one at a time and bring them back to the council for judgment id calculated that something like this would occur and planned for it from the beginning this is a task for smaller parties of men and if you will permit me my lords i would prefer to use my own men if possible i can count on them not to damage the fugitives when they are caught as for the rest of the forcewell if it were my decision to make i would disband it an army is essentially a great beast that is all mouth and stomach out of which no useful work can be gotten when it is not engaged in a campaign we willtake that under consideration lord kyndreth replied with a glance at his fellow council members it does make sense however hes thinking about the wizards kyrtian took a sip of wine and tried to look unconcerned oh come now kyndreth the boys right said the sour one appropriating a tidbit from one of the trays and examining it as if he expected to find a bug on it before putting it cautiously in his mouth theres no point in keeping these men sitting about doing nothing more useful than military maneuvers when we could have them all back on our estates doing some meaningful work even if its only in the breeding pens hes not and he might not be in favor of another wizard war if the subject were broached at the moment and levelis pointed out a council member in midnight blue and deep green who was making steady inroads on the wine without showing the least sign of intoxication would immediately advise to keep these men out here under his command and you know how i feel about levelis kyndreth acknowledged with a faint smile another salient point but one that is better discussed in council dont you think hmmm said the fellow in blue but didnt add anything more how is he drinking so much and staying sober kyndreth immediately changed the subject back to the current victory but kyrtian couldnt help but notice that there was an aspect of it that he did not touch onthe rebels ability to counteract his own levinbolts it was the fourth member of kyndreths party who brought it up i had no notion that you had so much magic of your own and how were those brats managing to dodge your levinbolts kyrtian he asked incredulously i thought they hadnt but driblets of magic of their own he shrugged i never saw anything like it he admitted even if they had been using shields as i know them the levinbolts wouldnt have acted in that way when contacting a shield im baffled huh i wonder if they found anything in my library moth mused as if thinking aloudbut her sly glance at kyrtian alerted him that she was about to present him with an opportunity for something but what your library my lady kyrtian asked obeying her prompting what do you mean oh when i got into the great house on the estate the library was in a right mess she replied promptly books down off the shelves piled up on the tables left lying opensomething on the order of the hugglemuggle your father used to create in there when he was doing his research kyrtian but on a larger scale my household is cleaning up the chaos now but to tell you the truth its as if they were following his lead and looking for something perhaps they found it kyndreth said slowly speculation creeping into his gaze as he looked from moth to kyrtian and back again perhapshaving discovered that the sons little eccentric hobby was so deadly to their cause they thought to counter it by following the fathers example kyrtian did his best not to stare at moth with his mouth open in shock gathered his wits and seized the opportunity hed been given with both hands if that is trueand i do recall my father being very enthusiastic over something he found in lady morthenas booksthen the rebels might have done just that and we need to discover what it is that they found agreed said the councilor in blue instantly someone should begin immediately i wish mother could hear that my father has just gone in an instant from crazed eccentric to vindicated he turned to lord kyndreth my lord if i may be so bold anyone can track down fugitives its only a matter of having good hunters and endless patiencebut i know the direction of my fathers research as no one else could would the council be pleased to permit me to course this particular hare lord kyndreths speculative expression gave kyrtian the thrill of excitement that the sham battle had not what precisely was he looking for a way or perhaps a device kyrtian said very slowly for those with little magic to amplify that magic even as he said that he realized that this would not be pleasant hearing for those whose powerful magic kept them at the top of the hierarchy presumably it would do the same for those with great magic as well he added quickly i would assume it would work for anyone who used it whether it is a device an object or a method what sent your father into lady morthenas library lord kyrtian asked the wineloving lord with every evidence of interest he was a student of our history and could not fathom why we were unable to replicate some of the feats of the ancestors when according to the fragments of chronicles he found even the least of the ancestors could accomplish what the great lords could kyrtian replied carefully looking earnestly into the older lords intent eyes and he could see no reason why magic should be thinning in our bloodlines a good point kyndreth mulled that one over as the other councilors looked interested even eager even the sourfaced one lost some of his dour look kyrtian thought about saying more thought again and held his peace it was moth who dropped another tidbit into the pool for the shining carp to gobble it was all of the oldest books that were left lying about she observed innocently the same sorts of chronicles exactly that kyrtians father used to look at and my wordthe dust was unbelievable kyndreth i think we ought to let the boy investigate this the sourfaced councilor said decisively let him keep his own fighting slaves in case he finds nothing and elects to hunt down our fugitives while you take the rest of the army back to the musteringbarracks we can decide what to do with it after kyrtian determines if theres anything to this hunting about in the old chronicles or not meanwhile weve got men and arms ready to send out on the chance that one of our puppies manages to scrape together another force and mounts an attack on one of the outlying manors good plan seconded the one in blue and drained his wineglass personally i think theyre going to crawl back to us begging for mercy but id rather be ready for the treacherous young dogs just in case lord kyndreth looked in bemusement from one to another of his fellow councilorsevidently he was the one who normally concocted all the plans in council of late and he was somewhat taken aback that these three had suddenly devised a solution of their own we dont need a majority vote for this kyndreth the winelover pointed out kyrtian wont actually be doing anything not unless he decides that theres nothing to be found in that library and by then the whole council will have had a chance to sit lord kyndreth laughed i see that you have already made up your minds he said geniallythough kyrtian wondered if there was a hint of annoyance and even anger under his smooth words as it happens i am entirely in agreement with you if for no other reason than that it gives our fine young commander an opportunity for some wellearned leisure before we lay any further burdens on his shoulders he cocked an eyebrow at kyrtian i am correct in recalling that you consider delving into mountains of musty old books to be an enjoyable leisure activity kyrtian laughed you are correct my lord he agreed smiling a genuine smile for the first time that afternoon like father like son you see well then the smile lord kyndreth returned never reached his eyes but there was no sign of disapproval that kyrtian could detect in it i suspect his annoyance is reserved at this moment for his fellow councilors kyndreth spun and fixed one of kyrtians subordinates with a steely gaze youve heard the plan astolan youre in charge of everything but kyrtians slaves give the lot a good feed and good rest then march them and the prisoners back to musteringbarracks well sort out the prisoners there and see to it that you make as good time coming back as lord kyrtian did going out lord astolan went flushed then pale and drew himself up straight as any of gels recruits my lord he responded with a crisp salute followed by a bow just for good measure kyndreth transferred his gaze to the others the rest of you see that he succeeds in making good time he concluded making it perfectly clear that the penalty for failure would land on all of their shoulders before they could make any reply kyndreths attention had already gone back to the other councilors shall we make our departures my lords he asked making it very clear that he was leaving and if the others wanted to remain they would have to find their own ways back and since he held the key to the temporary gate there was no dissension kyrtian escorted them to the gate and watched the strangely shining structure fade and disappear after they passed through it he returned to his tent to find lady moth entertaining his subordinates with scandal well astolan he said cheerfully as he pushed the tentflap aside my things are already packed up and out of the way and yours are herewell part of them anywayso why dont i just round up my slaves and escort lady moth back to her estate and leave you free to follow lord kyndreths orders astolan swelled with pride and selfimportance clearly he hadnt expected to be confirmed in his newif temporary command so soon certainly my lord if that is your wish it is if we start now we will all be at lady moths estate well before sundown he said firmly and offered lady moth his arm my lady she swept him a curtsy and allowed him to see a glimpse of the wicked amusement in her eyes before accepting his arm my lord she replied let us go in search of that soadmirable chief of your slaves that sostern fellow gel and be on our way i cannot wait to be home now that i know that my home is safe again how is she managing to keep a straight face i shall be at pains to keep it ever so my lady he replied deadpan and was rewarded by the shaking of her shoulders as she tried to keep from laughing as they swept out her guide paused at the edge of the miningpit and shana surveyed the activity below her with an intense feeling of satisfaction the dragons had incredibly found a place not that far from the new citadel where iron ore lay near to the surface of the earth making it possible to extract the precious substance without having to dig dangerous underground tunnels the dragons however had given some strict orders regarding mining operations the fertile topsoil was to be carefully removed before true mining began and set aside when a spot had been played out the harvested soil was to be returned and replanted with saplings culled from the forest or clumps of meadowflowers although this made very little sense to most of the wizards and all of the humans the dragons were so adamant about this that no one argued shana however fully agreed with this injunction she had lived among dragons for too long not to think in terms of centuries rather than yearsand the scars left on the land by unconsidered mining would last for centuries in the desert and the mountains resources were not inexhaustible to scar the land and leave it that much less able to support the humans and wizards of the citadel was unthinkably stupid no matter what else she was she hoped that even her own worst enemies would never think of her as that stupid a great deal of work was required to produce a few ingots of iron in the pit below her twenty or thirty quite burly men broad shoulders and backs pouring sweat labored with picks and shovels to fill crude wheelbarrows the barrows were in their turn trundled up a dirt ramp to the rim of the pit by less burly men some women and even a few adolescent boys with the muscle to make the grueling trip over and over at the opposite rim of the pit stood their primitive smelter the mysteries of which were of no interest to shana that was zeds purview and so far as shana was concerned as long as his fuelcutters and charcoalburners cut their timber selectively and replanted where they cut she didnt care her concern was for the iron to trade with and the land it came out of not for how the iron was produced it was the number of people at work here that surprised herand their ages she had sent zed and his wouldbe miners off with the young dragon whod found this place and there hadnt been a single one of them much over the age of twentynor were any of them particularly muscular but down there in the pit were men that could have been laborslaves for an elvenlord what do you think of my crew called zed as he waved at her from across the pit the miners looked up glanced from him to shana and grinned broadly fire and rain they looked like laborslaves and were scarred like gladiators not a familiar face among them i think theyre very impressive she called back as she and her guide made their way around the edge of the pit but what id really like to know she continued as she came closer and didnt have to shout is where they came from zed laughed theyre slavesexslaves actually the same exslaves that old caellach drove away from the new citadel by treating them as slaves rather than our fellowcreatures but she wrinkled her brow puzzled theyre working just as hardharderthan they would have if theyd stayed at the citadel but im not treating them as slaves zed pointed out i dont expect them to work here for the sheer gratitude of serving a wizard and getting nothing more generous than food and shelter they each get a fair share of the iron we smelt they can trade it back to me for whatever we wizards have that they want or for what ive gotten from the traders or the iron people that way the actual iron stays in our control but they get a fair wage for their work he raised an eyebrow were great believers in wages here she shook her head in admiration zed thats brilliant are they settled here do they want to stay can they build a village or something it would be wonderful to have these strong folk nearbythere was so much they needed simple laborers for and shana didnt in the least object to bartering for work done they want to know whether caellach is likely to poke his nose in here first before they actually build a settlement zed replied with a grimace shana glanced down and saw that all work had stopped while the former slaves all listened for her reply she was not at all loath to give it pitching her voice so that the workers could hear it as well as zed caellach gwain is about as likely to appear here as i am to be welcomed into the ranks of the elvenlords she said with a touch of acidic humor hes gotten so bad about having the tiniest bit of iron near him that weve taken to wearing the falsegold pendants when we arent working magic lorryn calls them caellachchasers zeds guffaw drowned anything from the workers but shana saw plenty of grins as they bent back to their work i think you can count on a settlement going up here then zed replied theres enough iron ore here to keep the smelter going for years and years and more than enough work for everyone whoever isnt mining smelting or hauling can be put to work on the replanting and restoration of playedout areas i was afraid after i saw that first load of ingots that i was pushing you too hard over here she said in tones aimed only for his ears once he stopped speaking im glad to see that i was mistaken zed patted her shoulder anything but he replied ah would you like to see the smelter or not not she said firmly im no caellach but this much iron kind of makes the inside of my head itch zed shrugged doesnt bother me as much but then ive never had as much of the elven magic as you do here ill show you where we want to put a settlement instead i think youll be surprised he turned away from the smelter and headed into the woods shana followed him glad to get out of the hot sun away from the smelter and under the treeshadows how did the iron people react to our first delivery zed asked with acuteand thoroughly understandableinterest by throwing a festival or so mero tells me she was happy to tell him im afraid that the traders are a bit disappointed though the traders can learn to live with their disappointment zed said smugly now we can start doing more to protect ourselvesand we can send out the jewelry again that cant happen too soon for me shana said fervently its not just the young lords who need it though the more jewelry we can get into their hands the more disruption theyll make with the great lords no i want to get pieces to the ladies and i especially want to get it into the hands of the slaves want was too mild a word ever since she had last heard from keman and dora she was positively wild to get the jewelry moving out into the elven lands again if they could get lord kyrtian on their side the jewelry might put lord kyrtian on their side if he had a way to protect his own people from elven magic to protect his lands from the magical attacks of other elvenlords there was no doubt in shanas mind that lord kyrtians own intensely loyal fighters would be more than a match for any physical force that the great lords could bring against him it was only attackmagical attackthat he needed to fear and treachery there was that and the great lords were past masters at treachery you think it might nullify the collars zed asked with interest remember if we cant do that we might as well not give the stuff to them i think i know how eagerly she outlined her idea which had come to her just that morning if we make a sort of clamshell device that closes over the beryl in the collar back and front she mimed the idea with her hands something that will lock in place tight even if we cant get the collar off we keep commands from getting to the elfstones and the stone from actually doing anything to the wearer zed considered the idea interesting it doesnt help someone like a concubine who might have a collar studded with beryls but a common worker wont have more than one so unless the lords start replacing all the collars on all their slaves which would be expensive even for them we could free whole groups at a time shana grinned with glee that was my ideathe clamshells wouldnt be big and it wouldnt be hard to distribute them for instance we could smuggle a whole bagful out to the workers in a field the slave taking the waterbucket around could pass them out and the whole group could bolt at once or the shells could be passed around an army at night under cover of darkness and when the morning comes and coercion no longer works on the fighters and they are safe from magical attack how many of them will remain to fight for their masters tricky zed said with admiration its too bad that collars are usually metal not leather we could incorporate cutters into the edges of the clamshell and nullify the beryl and remove the collar all in one go well this is where the camp is and where the men would like to put in a permanent settlement there wasnt much there at the moment and it was a good thing that not only was it high summer but there had been remarkably good weather for the shelters were barely enough to keep off the rain shana could see how it would make a perfect spot for a settlement however and she made all the right sounds of enthusiasm for zed and his people there was no doubt in her mind that she and lorryn had made the right decision in putting zed in charge of mining smelter and crews to man both operations although she would not have pictured him as a leader and caellach gwain had of course argued against the mere thought of putting someone as young as zed in charge of anything she completed her inspectionif that was not too official a word for merely looking the situation overin short order things could not possibly be better at the moment she really didnt want production going any faster it wouldnt hurt trade to keep the iron people waiting for their ingots just a little between each shipment she didnt want them to start thinking that the supply was unlimited and she had a long talk with zed on just that subject he was disappointed in one way and relieved in another he wouldnt have been unhappy to be asked to find more exslaves to recruit but on the other hand he didnt want his workforce growing past the point where he could handle everything himself in the end shana and the latest load of crude iron ingots returned overland to the new citadel by packmule arriving just about sunset just in time for caellach gwain to run straight into them he stared he began to shake with anger in a matter of moments he was practically beside himself with rage what are you doing girl he screamed at the top of his lungs drawing everyone within hearing distance to the mouth of the cavern where the unloading was taking place i should think that was perfectly obvious she retorted after the long walkfor she was not going to ride when she had two perfectly good legs and her weightequivalent in iron bars could be loaded on a mule in her placeshe was hot and tired and not in the mood for the tempertantrums of irascible old men you idiot he shrieked bringing thatfilthy stuff here bringing it inside the caves youre mad youre crazed how is anybody supposed to work magic with that foul garbage practically on top of us there were some grumbles and mutterings from the older wizards in the crowd that had gathered around them but this time shana stood her ground it was about time that the recalcitrant wizards adapted to the situation instead of expecting someone to work around their reluctance to change youll work magic around it the same way we youngsters do she said firmly hands on hips glaring at him i should think youd be grateful to me the more iron there is around here the safer you are havent you at least figured that out by now usually she made some pretense of politeness to the old man but she was in no mood for him at the moment and her attitude sent him into an incoherent frenzy that was just about the last straw shut up you stupid old man she screamedand since her soprano was considerably more piercing than his hoarse howls even he heard her and stared at her mouth agape ever since we arrived here all youve done is complain she shouted her face flushed weve fed you clothed you seen to it that you got your creature comforts and you have done nothing nothing to help the rest of us youre a parasite caellach gwain youre as useless as a second nose and you arent even half as entertaining now shut up and learn to work magic around iron like everyone else oror or what gwain sneered youll turn me over to the elvenlords thats just what you would do isnt it elvenbane as hot as she had been the moment before now she was cold no she said flatly but only you would think that i could no if you wont learn to adapt to our new life here caellach gwain i will see to it that no one else will cosset you from this moment on you will find your own food or starve clean your own clothing or go dirty cut your own firewood or freeze sooner or later youll figure out how to live like a responsible adult and high time too and with that she turned on her heel and stalked off pushing her way through the surrounding crowd of mingled young and old wizards someone grabbed her elbow she started to pull away blindly when she realized it was lorryn dont run off he muttered not now this isnt over yet he turned her back to face the crowd ive heard the mutters and the complaints he said loudly ive heard them from the moment that i arrived here i couldnt help but notice that most of them came from the same set of mouthsso lets just address this situation once and for all im calling a convocation of all wizards here someone gasped now here and now lorryn agreed i give you all a quartercandle to get everyone assembled whoever isnt here by then ill assume has no interest in the way things are run in the new citadel and doesnt feel the need to have his voice heard about half of those present shot or lumbered off in every direction to gather friends and enemies from every part of the citadel shana looked askance at lorryn is this a good idea she asked doubtfully it had to happen sometime soon lorryn replied better that it comes as a surprise to both sides caellach and his cronies wont have a chance to prepare themselves and were prepared she replied staring at him incredulously more than they areand whats the besetting sin of every one of the whiners he asked and answered himself triumphantly laziness thats why i only gave them a quartercandle how many will think its too much trouble to drag themselves away from whatever theyd planned or were in the middle of maybe enough to make a real difference she said slowly for already the young wizards were coming up to the clearing at the entrance brought in by the youngsters who had scattered like quail to bring the message to everyone within reach of a pair of fleet feet with the help of a couple of their friends lorryn prepared the area this was also the spot where firewood was chopped and stored and the young wizards got to work rolling in some logs for the lessthanhealthy to sit on down in front and setting up sawn sections of trunk for himself shana and presumably caellach to stand on so everyone could see them caellach of course merely stood about and observed them sourly more and more people were arriving with every passing moment and by the time the allotted span was gone the only wizards not present were a scant handful of the oldest or laziest the biggest surprise was the number of pure humans who had come as well virtually every full human in the citadel with a great deal of overacted infirmity caellach bullied a couple of human youngsters into helping him up onto one trunksection as shana and lorryn took the other two now settle down lorryn shouted very loudly so that those who were chattering and milling about obediently stopped talking aloud and turned their attention to where the three of them stood all right then i am going to moderate this convocation since im the one who called it but youre shanas lover caellach sputtered redfaced shana was going to protest but lorryn beat her to it the furious look that lorryn turned on him sent him from red to white and he even shrank back a little no one had ever seen lorryn angry beforeand he looked positively murderous i am not he replied into the silence lashanas lover we are friends and she has been relying upon my experience on my fathers estate to help her handle you unruly lot even if that were true it would have nothing to do with this situation and it would be none of your business so long as her foster mother approves i am offended caellach gwain i do suggest that you confine your words to the issues at hand or i will be tempted to challenge you challenge him what on earth does he mean by that shana thought bewildered caellach gwain evidently knew though for he turned even whiter and stammered an apology the primary issue at hand lorryn said when the old wizard was done is a greater one than just the presence of iron within the citadel or the number of people who are attending to tasks other than housekeeping his bland expression gave no hint as to his own feelings on the subject and although they were no secret to shana from the looks on the faces of caellachs cronies they were not sure if he was shanas partisan or not he might be courting her but he was also an aristocrat used to the attentions of hundreds of slaves so shouldnt he be on their side for that matter he might only be using her to get the power of leadership himselfshe saw that in the new speculation with which caellach regarded him caellach gwain lorryn continued turning to the old wizard you have voiced your opinions often enough for the ears of your friends and supportersi must insist that you allow everyone in the citadel to hear them caellach stared at him tried without success to stare him down his expression remained inscrutable as moderator i will not be questioning either of you instead you will answer questions from everyone except me i will see to it that there are no interruptions and that you both have a fair chance to be heard what that took shana completely by surprise and she felt seriously shaken what on earth was he after surely the old whiners would try to make her look a fool but it was too late to back out now for either of them as lorryn fielded those who wanted a chance and selected one of caellachs cronies for the first question you were the one that brought the elvenlords down on us in the first place girl so whatve you got to say for yourself shouted the old man who practically trembled with eagerness to finally have a chance to confront her in front of witnesses if it hadnt been for you and your pretensions of being some mythical elvenbane wed still all be back in the citadel and comfortable think dont react think i never called myself the elven bane she retorted throttling down panic and irritation that mingled uncomfortably setting her insides topsyturvy i never even heard of the elvenbane until after i was brought to the citadel and besides it was the dragons that made the elvenbane up in the first place not me she caught sight of father dragon back in the crowd in his halfbloodshape right kalamadea gazes followed hers and several of the more wary elderly wizards who found the dragons as uncanny as caellach did cleared away from him father dragon cleared his throat modestly well it was mostly my doing he admitted but yes we dragons created the legend of the elvenbane and we were just as surprised as the rest of you when the legend came to life he warmed to his subject we believe we dragonkin that certain creatures are endowed at birth with great hamenleai which is the power to become fate rather than to be steered by it and i tell you all now lashana even as an infant showed such tremendous hamenleai that even if she had been raised by alicorns in the wilderness the legend would have fitted itself around her every dragon acknowledges that now whether or not they count her as a friend where she walks great change will follow that was not what shana had hoped he would saynothing like it in factbut she gamely took up where she had left off as for all of you still being in the citadel i dont think you would have lasted undetected for much longer you were taking too many risks someone would have found out why goods and supplies were vanishing and where they were going if nothing else the elvenlords were already starting to wonder about that even before i joined you didnt i say that was too risky said a wizened old scrap of a wizard before he was hushed lorryn had already signaled someone else to ask a question and shana felt her heart sink as she surveyed the faces around her she had felt and sounded weak and uncertain she hadnt convinced anyone and father dragon hadnt helped what makes you think youre better than any of the rest of us at leading shouted someone from the back both of you i dont shana replied promptly but caellach was already swelling with selfimportance and ran right over the top of her i have decades of experience not to mention intelligence and wisdom he boasted which is far more than this impudent little girl can claim i do not make impetuous decisions and i do not rush to embrace something just because it is novel and new there is no doubt in my mind that the situation here is well on the way to becoming intolerable between these foolish innovations in magic and dangerous liaisons with barbaric wild humans not to mention creatures that arent even human the young should serve their elders not dictate absurd rules to them they should be thrilled to trade their service for the wisdom that we have gathered he warmed to his subject surrounded as he was by his own nodding supporters paying no attention at all to the expressions of some of those who were farthest away what should we wizards have to do with humans anywayexcept in that they too should be eager to serve us we are more powerful we are longerlived and have the opportunity to garner far more experience than what can be learned in the few years these mayfly humans enjoy it is clear that we are far superior in every wayand this girl this child thinks that we are to treat them as equals never i will never tolerate treating such debased creatures creatures who should be competing in devotion to me as my equals an actual growl arose from the humans who made up the bulk of the crowdperhaps few of them had ever realized just how deeply caellachs prejudices went nor how poisonous they were at that moment shana realized lorryns tactics in allowing this convocation to take place in the way it had for he had permitted caellach full freedom to say whatever he chose with his followers around him and the old wizards mouth had run away with him debased creatures are we came an angry shout from one of the carters who had brought the last batch of iron ingots up from the mine id like to see you try your hand at a little honest work you soft white worm you can just fetch and carry for yourself from now on came another disgusted voice along with a chorus of similar sentiments even some of the children that caellach had cowed into obeying his demands took heart from the sentiments of their elders and added their shrill voices to the rest caellach and the others woke to their danger but considerably too late for any retraction they gathered in a knot around caellach and it became painfully clear to them how tiny a minority they formed as a sea of angry faces surrounded them shana and her shortcomings were quite forgotten lorryn allowed them enough time to really begin to frighten caellach before using a little touch of magic to amplify his voice so that it carried over the noise of what was fast becoming a mob friends he boomed quiet please surprise silenced all the voices for the momentjust long enough for one single voice the voice of her foster mother alara to be heard shana the objections seem to be to all of the changes alara said in the first reasoned voice shana had heard in the last few moments and you really were the author of most of them so what have you to say about the objections if you dont change she said very slowly choosing each word as carefully as if she picked her way across a treacherous swamp i think you become just like the elvenlords that brought true silence in which even the sighing of the breeze in their clearing seemed loud it was a silence that begged for an explanation and drew further words however unwillingly out of her they havent changed not since they conquered this place and maybe not even in longer than that she continued they assume that theyre the proper lords of the universe and that nothing they want or think or do can be wrongno matter how many times things happen that prove that they are wrong when you dont change you get brittle and the next thing that hits you will break you she looked past the faces of her own friends out to the humans in whose eyes smoldered resentment for all wizards now even her changing means that we cant sit in our citadel and think were superior to anything just because we can do some things well dont you see she fumbled a little we all need each other oh i can bring in a live sheep from the hills with magic but i dont have the first idea of how to take clay and make a watertight cup and lets face it if im thirsty i need that cup and the person who can make it is superior to me at that moment dont you see she pleaded i never wanted to be a leader buti dont know maybe kalamadea is right and hamenleai has something to do with it and i just can see that we all need to change and we all need each other if we are going to surviveand maybe if theyll learn to change a little we even needthem she gestured helplessly at caellach and his friends unable to put what she wanted to show them into wordsthe great puzzle that she saw in her mind that somehow had places for all of them to fit into but evidently although there was some puzzlement out there she got part of her point across the resentment and anger had faded and although there were grimaces at the thought of including caellach and his ilk back into the fold there seemed to be acceptance of the idea too then came the thing she hadnt expected its hard on an old man all this changing said one of caellachs cronies plaintively its hard girl you go along with your life all even then suddenly its all upsetbut he took a deep breath and shuffled across the space between caellachs crowd and the rest of the convocation he looked up at her and heaved a sigh i hate all of this uncomfortableness and having to do without he continued half in complaint half in resignation but id rather stand with you than against you just dont ask too much all at once of an old tired man will you she got down off her slice of treetrunk and offered her hand he took it and that was the beginning of the end in ones and twos the rest of caellachs followers came over to her side although most of them just tried to blend back into the crowd and didnt actually come to stand with her it didnt matter theyd abandoned caellach even if they didnt entirely agree with her even if they were still going to argue and grumble theyd abandoned their leader and they had opened themselves up to the possibility of change it was enough for now it was enough rena took her place on the carpet next to mero in dirics tent the flaps were rolled kneehigh and scrims of loosely woven linen kept bugs out while allowing a breeze to flow through it was dinnertime a meal much enlivened these days by the addition of vegetables supplied by trading and the gardens that the corn people were growing as well as by the changed herbs provided by rena herself dinner shared with diric and kala was a morethanpleasant meal now that the first lot of crude iron ingots had arrived from the citadel once again dirics star was in the ascendant so far as his people were concerned and he had lost that worried frown kala was just as pleased and far more open about it after all the iron people now had everything they needediron good grazing and water and even the remains of their old allies the corn people to settle in somewhere nearby and commence the farming that they would not or could not do rena and mero were reaping the benefits as well as the representatives of the wizards everyone with a forge wanted to know what they knew about possible future production and there were no few folks who wanted to see if they could somehow ease to the head of the queue waiting for the next shipment the trader clans were a little discomfited to find that they were no longer the only source of iron but theyd gotten over it particularly now that the women among the iron people had begun to experiment with faceting the fools gold and polishing yet another form of mineral with a high iron content that the traders had brought in both made fine gems for setting the new oiliron in particular having a lovely liquidblack sheen to it that looked wonderful in blackenediron filigree so now the women had more material for their tiny jewelry workshops than theyd ever had before and the new materials had brought on a spate of creativity that had even the men intrigued and hovering over the womens work trying to reckon how they could coax their mates mothers sisters and friends to produce some of the new work for them diric already sported leather armguards inlaid with iron settings that held large oiliron cabochons courtesy of kalas hands and she was working on a matching collar as well he was setting something of a fashion much to renas silent amusement and kalas open glee it seemed an auspicious time for rena to see about something she had been planning for a while kala brought in plates of flatbread broiled meat thinly sliced vegetables and bowls of soured cream the iron people could now enjoy one of their favorite mealsflatbread rolled around spiced meat strips and vegetables garnished with dollops of cream rena and mero had come to enjoy these as much as their hosts and mero quickly made himself a roll as soon as kala set the platters on the carpet before them how badly do you want to keep your two elvenlords diric they dont look very healthy to me rena asked as diric reached for a piece of flatbread he didnt even pause in his motion they havent been a lot of use for some time he admitted laying a paperthin slice of cucunpod and some of renas sweetened and tenderized grasses on the flatbread following it with strips of meat and a dollop of soured cream out of respect for your wishes they havent been entertaining us but i dont think they would now even if we tried to force them into it with beatings i think theyre going mad actually their keeper can barely get them to eat and drink im told all they do is stare at whatever theyre pointed at i think theyve gone mad rena replied relieved to hear the matteroffact tone in his voice you can still get kelyan to talk if you try hard enough but haldoryour keepers are having to feed him by hand i want them if you dont tell me what you want to do with them first diric replied cautiously rena took a deep breath and looked to mero who gave her an encouraging smile she looked back into dirics sablebrown eyes and told herself what a fundamentally reasonable man he was i wanti want to try something i want to see if my magics can change peoples memories there have been rumors oh forever that some of the old lords can do that and i should think that since womens magics among my people are used delicately it should be easier for a woman to do that than a man since kelyan and his friend are already mad i cant hurt them further and i may be able to help them she steeled herself if i canhelp them that isthere are several things i want to do with them the first thing is to find out how the elfstones of the slaves controlling collars are made and how the slaves are controlled by them shanas got this idea that would take less iron than the jewelry mero put in helpfully his green eyes alight with enthusiasm for his friends plans sort of a clamshell arrangement to close around the beryl like this he demonstrated with his two hands snapping together and cut it off from magic getting out or in those would be easy to get in to the slaves in sackfuls and if everyone who was ready to escape all snapped their ironclamshells over their stones at once they could make a njn for it the elvenlords wouldnt be able to pursue any single individual or track him either and by the time someone with enough magic to cast levinbolts was summoned the slaves would be long gone but we have to know how the elfstones work so we can see if the plan would work rena continued as diric set down his halfeaten flatbread and leaned forward intrigued by the idea i never learned how and i dont think lorryn ever did either but kelyan probably did so i want to see if i can get him to show me if i cant trick him into doing it maybe mero can get the memory straight out of his mind once we know how to make the elfstones we can test the clamshells but that is not all you plan i gather diric asked with heavy eyebrows raised he looked more than intrigued now he looked enthusiastic umno she decided to go ahead and tell him her entire plan while he still was open to it i want to wipe away every trace in their minds of being captured of the iron people and replace it with something else what else diric wanted to know why i thought she faltered for a moment then went on i thought id construct some new memoriesillusions really out of the way lorryn and i wandered around in the wilderness or maybe mero can help me put things in their minds when ive blanked out the old memories and once i knew that they werent going to remember anything about the iron people or the wizards or dragons or anything id put them to sleep and get keman or one of the other dragons to drop them somewhere near enough to an estate for them to find their way back she bit her lip and waited for the inevitable reaction you mean that you intend to free them dirics eyebrows had crawled all the way up to the top of his forehead you think we should let them go to join the rest of our enemies well we cant kill them she said a little desperately for a moment she feared that diric would respond with and why cant we but he regarded her thoughtfully pulling on his lower lip and said nothing for a very long time if that was your plan he replied pitching his voice low it seems a waste of a perfectly good resource for deception that we can further use against the demons that you call elvenlords rather than giving the prisoners memories of wandering about in the wilderness why not give them memories that are completely erroneous such as rena asked her heart lifting he was going to let her do this finally she was going to be able to do something that would help poor kelyan and haldor but maybe help out shanaas well ohi think we can work out something make them think that they were held captive by the wizards more wizards than the elvenlords have any notion exist diric grinned in that sud den way that made him look like a boy full of mischief and in their minds we can locate their prison in some impregnable fortress somewhere in the opposite direction from the real citadel he winked wickedly for that matter concoct a set of wizards that have never even heard of our set make the demons think that they have an enemy that until that moment they had known nothing about make them waste time and warriors trying to find this new set of wizards mero uttered a whoop of laughter ancestors what an idea itll have them scrambling to guard their rear itll have them fighting over which set of wizards are the most dangerous and best of all it will buy us more time to get stronger exactly so diric picked up his forgotten meal and waved his free hand at rena if that is your plan child take them and welcome they are nothing but a burden now and if you can succeed in your plan you will convert them to an asset he said nothing about what would happen to them if she couldnt wipe their memories clean but she decided that she would deal with that if the occasion arose she thanked the iron priest and turned to her own untouched meal with a good appetite diric had something he wanted to discuss with mero after dinner and rena decided that she might as well tackle the first part of her plan straight off not being a halfblood was something of a handicap as she couldnt read the minds of the two elvenlords directlyso what she planned to do was to try and coax the information out of them using words illusion her own sex and gentle prodding shed had the traders bring her an old deactivated collar from one of the escaped slaves working with shana she brought this with her as she entered their tent kelyan she called shed put on die illusion of one of the fine gossamer gowns shed worn in her old life and as kelyan roused from his apathetic trance and slowly raised dull eyes to look at her she created a second illusion that they were in a typical room that one would find in an elven manor she used as her model one of the rooms in which her father would informally entertain guests but kept the place shrouded in shadows kelyan looked terrible his emerald eyes were clouded his pale hair hung lank and brittle the only time he changed his clothing was when his keepers stripped him of the soiled clothing rena wasnt sure what had triggered this dive into insanity perhaps hed just snapped when hed first seen keman in dragonform or perhaps he had just given up when it became obvious that even though the wizards had been accepted as allies there was no way that two elvenlords were going to be released but his current confusion and the way in which he drifted in and out of a world of his own making would help her she hoped that in his current mental state he would either believe that he was back among his own people or was dreaming either would serve her equally well it was unlikely that he would recognize the rena he knew in the elven ladyguise she had just created for herself shed even done herself up in highfete fashion with exaggerated cosmetics his eyes brightened as he took in her and her surroundings there still wasnt a great deal of sanity in them but there was more sense to reinforce the illusion she had created she hid kelyans companion in captivity in the shadows so that he wouldnt see haldors motionless form and have his illusion broken he didnt seem to notice or care my lady his head tilted inquiringly showing that he really didnt recognize her sheyrena she supplied welcome to my fete lord kelyan my lady sheyrena he nodded his head do i know you good he doesn t remember or recognize me or something deep in his mind doesnt want to hed much rather live in dreams than in the world hes in now i am the daughter of a friend of your mothers she replied aping as best she could her own mothers manner when with a guest thank you for coming with your mother to my little entertainment i wondered if i could impose upon your good nature for a trifling task i am at your command he responded with a hand over his heart and a slight bow i have taken a new bodyslave a little girl who has not yet been fitted with a collar she lied glibly as you know my fa ther will not return from his meetings with the council for several days and i wonderedcould youhelp me with clearing and setting this so that i can use it on the child she held out the collar and he took it from her fingers and frowned slightly this is hardly a fit collar for the neck of a ladys slave he pointed out she pouted it is the only one i could find that has not been set and placed on the neck of a living slave and i dont want to wait for someone to construct one for me she said with just a hint of petulance besides ive taken a particular fancy to this one child shes quite pretty and i dont want father to decide to give her to someone if shes sealed to me he shant be able to kelyan smiled and she smiled back instantly forming a conspiracy of two against their greedy elders in that case i shall be happy to set it to you on your behalf he replied easily he bent over the collar and went immediately to work on it and she followed the slightest nuance of that work with an intensity that surely would have startled him had he not been concentrating on the collar to the exclusion of all else she had been doublyprepared in case she needed to use this ploy again she didnt want him to think it was anything other than a dream when he finished his magics she thanked him prettily you have done me a great good turn lord kelyan she said flirting subtly with him in a way that would probably have had mero wild with suppressed jealousy how can i properly thank you she plied him with drugged wine as she fluttered her eyelashes at him perfectly aware that he wouldnt actually do anything other than flirt back there was a rhythm to this sort of courtship until he had her fathers tacit permission to approach her he would only indicate gallant interest he wouldnt want to find himself called into a challenge that he might not have the trained slaves to meet leasing gladiators to meet a challenge was possible but expensive since some of them would almost certainly die in the combat better to be cautious performing any service for a fair lady is a privilege not a burden he replied downing the wine in a single gulp as she had planned shed doctored the wine to make its taste smoother than honey and disguise its nature she refilled his glass and he downed that as well she passed him a little bowl of highlysalted toasted bits of rootalso manipulated by her magic the more he ate the thirstier he would become thank you he said after his first taste and when she left the plate there beside his hand he didnt object i do not have the company of a lovely lady often enough that i see it as less than a reward in and of itself he continued now sipping from his glass and nibbling at the snacks she laughed softly producing a tinkling little sound that surprised her and made his eyes widen with approval i do not have the company of fine young lords often enough to think it less than a treat she replied in the same vein tell me something of yourself he was not at all loath to do so and she continued to ply him with wine as well as conversation until his eyes drooped his head dropped and he collapsed limply down onto the pallet hed been sitting on all this time with a thought and a flick of her fingers she banished all the illusions she had created leaving him again in the feltwalled tent when he woke the next morning if he recalled the incident at all it would probably be as a dream then she blew out the lights and left him in the darkness turning the collar over triumphantly in her hands now it was kalas turn on the new project to liberate the slaves she examined the collar and the stone and set about making the clamshell clasp that would lock the stone away from wearer and mage she was certain she could make such a mechanism the trick would be to create one that was small enough to conceal but large enough and sturdy enough to have an effective seal meanwhile dropping her guise and coming as herself rena attempted to engage the two elves in conversations every day while mero eavesdropped on their minds as she talked to themor as often as not at themshe played delicately with her magic inside their heads when the great lords removed memories they did so wholesale leaving behind a blank she had delved into the mysterious workings of the brain as well as she could and now she suspected their crude efforts difficult as they were created a mental infant probably afterwards their victim had to be retaught even the simplest of things which was why sheit was usually a rebellious girl who was so cavalierly treated wouldnt make a reappearance for a year or more after she was subjected to the treatment rena wanted to be more subtle so while she talked and spied upon the physical workings inside their heads she did so on the same minute level that she worked when making the leaves and plants sweet and tastyor just plain edible when mero saw a memory that he knew they needed to expungewhich would be when one of the elves actually thought about ithe signaled rena she would know then where it physically resided and that she could change after a few days she began doing just that gently she broke the connections that made the memories then erased them altogether with the tiniest of shocksmuch much smaller and more subtle than those that caused brainstorms when she was done those particular memories were gone ask kelyan about them and he would look at her blankly she had hoped that she would be able to remove the memories sequentially but alas that was not possible memory it seemed was a peculiar thing it wasnt sequential memory chains led oddly to incidents that seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with the triggering recollection but one thing was absolutely certain and that was the more she erased the more normal kelyanand in particular haldor since he was the most withdrawnbecame when that happened memories were easier to trigger and thus to remove renas progress with them came in leaps and bounds and soon they were both as active and alert as theyd been when first captured that was promising since it would have been the next thing to murder to drop the two of them unconscious somewhere if haldor was still nearcatatonic but it created a new problem as they regressed into the past they no longer had the mem ories that told them that resistance was of no use that escape was not possible by having their evening food drugged building illusions and interrogating them separately rena was able to convince them that she and her questions were no more than an intriguing dream she didnt even have to convince them that they were in the midst of a dream sequence since she was able to erase the memory of each night before she left them drugged and sleeping but what are we going to do with them she asked mero desperately three days after she had begun this task when haldor had announced his intention to escape from their current captivity the next day she dropped down beside him on the grass outside their tent both of them staring up at the starbegemmed sky over their heads her hand reached for his only to find his reaching for hers she took comfort from the touch sooner or later theyre going to try to make a run and thats only going to make a terrible amount of trouble keep em drugged by day mero advised squeezing her hand we have to figure out how to give them a new past and i havent worked that one out yet moonlight flooded the camp almost bright enough to read by he shook his head at her i dont know illusions but that would take as much time to show them as it would for them to live it i might be able to stick new memories right in their heads where the old ones were but for one person to create all that does it have to be one person rena interrupted what if there were several she flushed with the excitement of suddenly seeing a possible solution we dont have to be the ones to make the new memories we could ask kalamadea and alara to come get them and shana and zed and some of the other wizards could all pitch together and do it mero shook his head i dont know he replied dubiously wouldnt those memories get awfully confusing with so many people meddling isnt it better for us if they are confusing rena countered feeling even more certain that this was the right way to handle the problem we dont want them to have a whole picture we just want them to have fragments dont we let them think they were drugged most of the time or enspelled but the more confusing their memories are the more confused the old lords will be and the more confused the old lords are the more likely that theyll be alarmedi see where youre going with this mero chuckled unexpectedly and hugged her youre right rena youre right ill try and reach shana and explain all this and see if she falls in with the plan ill keep trying until i reach her and ill wipe their memories back to their capture she said happily secure now that her plan would work exactly as she had hoped in a few days the dragons arrivedbut quietly without fanfare in the guise of wizards rena had never seen alara in that form shanas fostermother had chosen to resemble a very sturdy woman of indeterminate age with high cheekbones and hair of deep brown kalamadea of course wore the guise with which the iron people were already familiar and when he and she walked into the camp at dawn diric and the other leaders of the group welcomed himthough the welcome was tempered with the memory of the last time they had seen him in his real shape of a huge blueblack dragon weve come to carry off your inconvenient guests father dragon said genially beaming as if hed had the greatest of treats bestowed upon him no matter that the last time anyone of the iron people had seen him it was as a dragon he behaved so normally and looked so harmless so inoffensive that it was hard for anyone to think of the menacing dragon with those guileless green eyes peering at them out of a sea of wrinkles father dragon played the part of an eccentric little old man to perfection and soon had diric chatting with him like the old friend he was with diric acting so normally the rest of his people relaxed as well and what have you done with myre he asked at last we gave her over to the keeping of the corn people for now they do not trust her in the least for i told them only that she had nearly betrayed us and her own people to the demons diric looked smug and rena had to smile that was at least partly true after all they give her field tasks to do and no food if she will not work she has quickly learned the value of carrying out what she is told to do obviously you arent concerned about her escaping alara made that a question she couldnt quite control the pain she felt at this position her secondborn found herself in but diric misinterpreted it oh no lady if she wishes to run off we will let her she is not so great a help to us that we would miss her and she cannot remove the collar that keeps her looking as one of the demons slaves she cannot go back to the demons sothe wizards we the corn people and the traders all know of her treachery and would not remove it he smiled if she wishes to wander the plains alone and unaided in preference to remaining with the corn folk where she has food and shelter well let her savor her freedom alara sighed but said nothing kalamadea covered her silence with chatter rena gave her a look of sympathy for all that myre had been a miserably thankless child myre was her daughter it must have torn poor alaras heart to have to side with one childor children counting shana as alaras fosterdaughteragainst another well wait until dark to take them so we dont distress your people unduly kalamadea was saying quietly as the other elders of the tribe made their cautious greetings lost interest and went back to their usual tasks that is well diric said judiciously then brightened but you must also see the progress my kala has made upon your other need and you must see the new jewels my ladysmiths have made come rena and mero spent the rest of the day in the company of diric and the two dragons diric must have shown them every jewelry forge in the camp and although alara did not once ask to see her wayward daughter rena had to wonder if diric was trying to distract the dragon to keep her from making that very request at lastat long last for even rena was beginning to tire of watching jewelers at work a task she normally found fascinatingthe sun set and darkness fell she left then to see to the two she now considered her charges she found them insensible so thoroughly drugged that not even a hearty shaking could wake them nothing less would do obviously they couldnt ride out of here as she and mero had done adragonback they would have to be carried she and four of the younger iron priests bundled the unconscious elves into the same kind of swaddlings that the iron people used for their infants only adultsized complete with a rigid board very like a cradleboard the swaddlings would prevent them from moving the board would ensure that they wouldnt bend in the middle now they could be put in a net sling to be carried in dragonclaws back to the citadel once packaged up like a pair of parcels for delivery the iron priests each took an end and unceremoniously carried the motionless bundles out into the darkness rena followed behind as the young priests in their peculiar cloth headresses and leather aprons carried the bundles as far as the open grasslands outside of the camp put them down in the waiting nets and hurried off they didnt look back and rena didnt blame them if she herself hadnt spent so much time with keman in all of his forms she would have been nervous around the dragons and kalamadea and alara would be back from feeding at any moment the sudden wind that came up all around her the thunder of unseen wings overhead warned her that they were here silvered by the moonlight casting black shadows that stretched across the franticallywaving grasses in front of them they backwinged in beside their charges rena stepped back involuntarily she had somehow forgotten how big the fully adult dragons were in their true forms father dragon usually reduced his to fit in with the others and to be able to use the lairs inside the citadelbut dragons never stopped growing en tirely and he easily dwarfed alara and alara was twice the size of her son keman they were like forces of nature too big too powerful to really comprehend she put her hands out in an unconscious gesture of warding she might not even have been there for all the notice that they took of her they had eaten well among the herds and they had a long way to go all of it this very night before the two elves woke there was no time for farewells and in her heart rena couldnt blame alara for wanting to be gone from the place where her youngest languished in her prison of iron collar and human flesh instead each paused on the ground only long enough to seize a net and hook it into claws as long as renas arm then with a leap for the sky and a tremendous booming of wings they were off in moments they were only dark shadows beating slow wings against the silver moon then gone rena strained her eyes but couldnt see themand jumped when mero touched her arm well he said quietly its out of our hands now youve given shana a tremendous weapon my love and now its up to her to make the best use of it youve done your part you can relax only when he said that did she realize that she could and that mero had said that she had at last given shana material help unaided by anyone she glowed with pleasure at the mere thought and laughed a little i suppose i can cant i she replied and turned so that his arm went around her shoulders well then she continued playfully feeling strong and emboldened by her success dont you have someahcourting to catch up on for a moment he stared at her as if unsure of how to react i do he said a little stupidly then he grinned broadly i suppose i do he said with far more sense then proceeded to make a very good start on all that catchingup lady triana supervised the preparation of her reception chamber with the same care a good general would have given to the preparation of battleplans things were beginning to move at last although not entirely in the direction she had wanted aelmarkin was on his way to her manorshe knew this of course because she had not given him an accesskey to her portal and as a consequence he had to make the last leg of his journey the hard way overland from the manor where aelmarkin had a friend willing to allow him the use of his portal he probably didnt even know that she had a portal there werent many who she trusted with keys to it so it wasnt common knowledge shed had plenty of time to prepare for him by now and he knew that already she had an advantage over him she had been expecting this visit for some time in fact she was surprised that he hadnt turned up before this aelmarkins cousin lord kyrtian rather than disgracing himself was distinguishing himself on the battlefield against the rebellious young lords after that last rout of the young lords his star was particularly high with the council aelmarkin must be furious she only wished that she had nearly as much of an advantage over aelmarkin as she was going to pretend she had her little spy in the household kept as she was in the harem and with no access to young kyrtian when he was away on his martial business had proved of little use the domestic details that the slave had been sending were only of interest in that they showed how thoroughly kyrtians mother held the reins of the manor a pity that it appeared that triana was going to have to do most of the work of subverting lord kyrtian herself but it was of course not to her advantage to allow ael markin to know any of this and she didnt intend to she would probably let him know that she had the spy that would be useful without giving away too much when aelmarkin arrived what she did intend was that aelmarkin would see a side of her that he would never have expected all he had ever seen was the temptress and that was all he was ready for he probably expected that she would try to use her wiles on him men were so predictable she had two different reception chambers for two very different purposes this one also served as the office from which she ran her own little estate and as such it was both totally like her and completely unlike any of the faces she presented to the outside world it was not spare and ascetic by any means the desk behind which she sat was a work of art fitted together from massive pieces of handcarved petrified wood polished to a mirrorgleam and fitted around her so that she could keep every bit of work near at hand without having to reach for it the charcoalcolored leatherupholstered chair that cradled her was as comfortable as any sybaritic couch and glided on rails into and out of the niche within the curve of the desk there was a matching couch across from the desk it matched superficially that is but it had been made so that although it was extremely comfortable it was treacherous be the occupant ever so tall whoever sat there would find that his head was lower than hers and getting up created some awkward moments for the rest the chamber exuded a restrained opulence soft dark grey carpet with subtle greyongrey pattern silvergrey satin draperies covering the walls lighter in color than the carpet but with the same pattern the only color in the room lay in the stone of the desk which drew the eye like a magnet away from triana which was the point it was difficult for a beautiful elven lady to appear intimidating but the desk managed to overwhelm simply by being aelmarkin had reached the gates of her estate and been admitted not long ago he would arrive at any moment and she was perfectly ready for him meanwhile she busied herself with the accounts with the fall in her fortunes her little estate had to be selfsupporting for there were no more giftswell call them what they were bribesforthcoming from those who wished to attach themselves to a rising star she supposed she could have improved her fortunes by marrying but that was hardly a solution that was to her taste there wasnt anyone free among the old lords who wasnt a close match for her wits and who wouldnt hedge her around with so many constraints that it would take all of her energy just to continue to enjoy herself as she had and as for the young lords still loyal to their sires well she was not minded to wetnurse a callow youth who had no inclination to work no interests but his own amusement and no ambitions except to indulge in sex and games shed be better off adopting such a young fool than wedding him at least then she could treat the fellow like the child he was so following her fall from grace she had applied herself to the business of raising and training very special slaves exquisite creatures much in demand for their beauty and skills there was always a waitinglist for her pretty boys and decorative menshe was an expert after all in the things that made males both ornamental and useful there were plenty of elvenlords aelmarkin for onewho bred and trained lovely female slaves for the luxury trade but triana was the only supplier of males for the same purpose some were bought by elvenlords but not nearly as many as were bought by the ladiesnot that the lords these ladies answered to were ever made aware of the existence of these special slaves ladies might well be hedged about by rule and custom and kept close in the harembut nothing prevented the visits of another lady triana say with a small entourage of her special slaves now once triana and her slaves were within the walls of an estate it was childs play for the lady she visited to purchase one or more unless she was totally hedged about she had simply to order that the requisite price be sent to trianas steward by her own household steward who would not gainsay her the slaves then vanished into the household assigned to the ladys personal service never to be seenoh most certainly never by the master of the house it was easy enough to do for even on estates that bred their own slaves there were always more being purchaseda special skill might be needed or the slaves themselves disobliged by presenting one with too many of one sex and not enough of the other the purchase of a great many of these male slaves that triana so carefully trained was concealed under the bland heading household expenses one of trianas own slaves sleek in her livery of dark silver and midnight came to the door of the chamber and triana looked up and nodded acknowledgment of his silent signal a moment later a second arrived aelmarkin in tow vkel aelmarkin ellord tornal my lady he intoned as aelmarkin sauntered past him into the office both slaves vanished as soon as triana nodded to them aelmarkin it is a pleasure to see you she said exuding subdued warmth forgive me for not rising to greet you properly but as you see you have caught me in the midst of my little chores now aelmarkin knew very well that she had gotten ample enough warning of his imminent arrival to have set her little chores aside and she knew that he knew and he knew that she knew that he knew so they were most comfortable in their mutual knowledge he looked the visitors couch over before sitting in it and was probably not surprised to discover what a disadvantage it put him at my cursed cousin has covered himself with glory he grumbled as a slave appeared at the door offered him wine and disappeared again hope youve been making better progress than i it will be worth it to me to lose this bet if you can bring him down she smiled enigmatically you are aware that the key to all this is to either get rid of his mother or encourage him to put her in herappropriateplace aelmarkin wasnt stupid she had to grant him that he sat upor did so as much as the couch would allow him so its lady lydiell who rules that roost does she id suspected as much thats hardly surprising given how long she has been the sole authority on that estate he looked sour and would probably have added his disapproval of a lady assuming such authority but that was hardly politic in trianas presence but its high time that lord kyrtian assumed his proper role as head of the estate i should think triana replied carefully examining her flawlessly polished nails and i expect after all of his victories in the field hes not going to be content to sit back and let someone else manage his property anymore aelmarkin relaxed back in his seat and produced a thin smile and the right woman couldwouldcertainly encourage him in that direction wouldnt she the only question in my mind is to what effect the smile hardened it is not going to please me particularly to find that the mother has been supplanted by the equallycompetentwife she left off examining her nails and gave him a chill look how very like a male to assume that she intended to take the mothers place i do assure you aelmarkin that wedding that child is no part of my plans there is nothing about his estates or his person that could tempt me to the folly of putting my estates and my person into his legal control see that you remain of that mind aelmarkin responded shortly there was no mistake he fully expected her to be that foolish did he think that every female in existence lived only to wed the thought would never have crossed my mind and is no part of my plans she allowed a tinge of contempt to color her gaze did you come all this way to fence with me or have you another purpose you havent yet revealed he had come to discover what if anything she knew or had done of coursebut she suspected that he had also come to keep an eye on her of course he had begun to think her plans might include wedding kyrtian as well as seducing himhe was a male after all and he was blinded by the automatic assumption that every female wanted ultimately to be someones ladyas if the only possible identity a female had was through her male relatives idiot but she could use him this little exercise that had begun as a bet had taken on a life and a purpose for her far beyond its original no she did not want kyrtian or his estatesbut she did want that seat on the council that had been denied her for so long she wanted to be counted as the equal of any great lord she knewhow notthat lord kyndreth only intended to support kyrtian for as long as it took to destroy the young lords revolt and possibly the wizards once that was over kyrtian had the potential to become a dangerous rival for lord kyndreths ascendancy in the council he would be altogether pleased to find someone willing to help and placed to eliminate kyrtian when the time came not by assassination nothat was too crude and besides there was the small problem of getting away with murder once it had been committed that altogethertooefficient bodyguard of kyrtians was another problem but elimination by other meansthat was another covey of quail altogether once triana was close to kyrtian trusted by him there were any number of options open to her she could arrange for him to do something that would disgrace him entirelysomething to do with slaves perhaps he treated that bodyguard with suspicious softness and lydiells family was known for its ridiculous cosseting of humans perhaps something could be concocted linking him to the wizards as a sympathizer or if none of that seemed possible a female allowed closer than any male could do things that were not open to men she could administer drugs that would enfeeble mind or body but graduallyand most important of all irreversibly she could leak important financial or other details of the estate that would allow someone like kyndreth to work the magic that would ruin itits main source of income lay in foodstuffs after all and properly manipulated weather or insectplagues for several years in a row could bring the family to its knees she could and would encourage infatuation on kyrtians part along with the giving of very expensive gifts and reckless behavior to impress her it was possible that she could arrange him to bankrupt himself in games of chance and the likeor to break his own neck in sport and the hunt or even to emulate his father and vanish into the wilderness never to be seen again that in particular appealed to her encouraging him in that direction had great potential and shouldnt be all that difficult the wilderness had killed the father so why not the son there were so many options open to her once she got close to kyrtian that she had no intention of limiting herself to any one plan for the moment meanwhile it was actually possible for aelmarkin to prove useful if you would care to stay for a visit i think we can accommodate you she said smiling and surprising him have you come prepared to remain she knew he had of course although she might not know the contents of his baggage she certainly knew the weight and volume hed brought a cartfull and only two personal slaves so hed been intending to inflict himself on her for a good fortnight at least i confess i was hoping that you would tender the invitation he replied cautiously clearly he had hoped to trick or bully her into the invitation and had not thought for a moment that it would be offered freely then why dont you settle in she said airily waving a hand at the door where at her invisible signal the slave who had brought him here arrived having responded to that summons ill deal with my little household affairs and we can discuss plans over luncheon she kept invisible her amusement at his struggles to extricate himself from the couch and responded to his nonetoogracious bow with a nod of her head as he accompanied the slave to the guest quarters she went back to her accounts while not of spellbinding interest they were important after all and needed to be attended to these days she didnt trust that anything had been done properly unless she herself had run a critical eye over it nowluncheon was certainly going to be interesting she was quite looking forward to it after all she counted on the fact that she had welcomed aelmarkin and that there wasnt a great deal for him to amuse himself with on her estate to ensure that as soon as he had convinced himself that she wasnt playing a deeper game than he thought he would leave and in fact that was precisely what happened although he had clearly come prepared to remain for a week or more within three days he was gone she had speeded his departure by being ridiculously virtuous for the duration of his visit she held no parties entertained no other guests and although he did have access to some attractive female slaves she made it politely clear that if he damaged them he could consider them purchases his finances were not so secure that he could contemplate the purchase of one of her slaves at the uxorious valuation she would make that pretty much put paid to that possible amusement that left hunting which he detested landscapeviewing which bored him and gaming which he was illequipped for either mentally or physicallynor would he have enjoyed ei ther losing to a human slave or winning over one who was allowing him to win no indeed so off he went liberating her from his unwelcome company and allowing her the freedom to find out just what kyrtian was up to that meant a select dinnerparty not one of the libertine affairs that she threw for those of the young lords who were still loyal to their fathers but a sedate yet very luxurious dinner for those few of the great lords who found her amusing and could afford to be seen with her which included of course lord kyndreth first she spent a profitable hour in the kitchens informing the staff of her plans and terrifying them with casually dropped tales of what had happened to slaves whose food and service displeased the great lords who would be her guests of course one thing that separated her establishment from that of other elvenlords was that her meals relied on the skills of her kitchenslaves and not on illusionnow her servants would exert themselves to the utmost to please she did not trouble herself about the menu her chief cook would determine that he knew what was best freshest at its peak of ripeness he knew what fowl fish and meats were at perfection she could leave all that to him and set about delivering the invitations via teleson to her select great lordssix of them altogether including lord kyndreth and his son gildor gildor was a bore but she would see that his simple needs were taken care of all male of course there would be one female but only a human slave gildors favorite concubine he was absurdly faithful to the creature but when lord kyndreth issued a delicate hint that gildor would probably want to bring her she laughed lightly children must have their toys mustnt they she said with just a hint of mockery no matter my lord i shall supply the rest of you with comely companions so she will not be conspicuous i may not specialize in such slaves but i promise that you will be contented with what i supply that will suit me very well lord kyndreth replied from the depths of the teleson embedded in the wall across from her desk which was normally hidden behind the draperies there he seemed just as amused by his offsprings dogged infatuation as triana was your hospitality will be gracious as always then i can expect you tomorrow night she smiled at him exerting all her charm good you still have my telesonkey i assume i never let it out of my keeping he assured her as all of the others had till tomorrow night then till tomorrow night she allowed him to break the connection and sat back in her chair wellcontent for just a moment but only for a moment for she had a decision to make should she display her expertise in magic by creating a fantastical setting for her party or distinguish herself by hosting the dinner with no magic whatsoever with magic she decided after long consideration but it must be subtle these men were experts in powerful magic and it would be far more impressive to caress them with surroundings that had a calm depth than to bombard them withsayan enchanted exhibition of song and dance subtlety would take time to produce she had better start on it now she let the chair glide back on its rails and took herself to her dining room walking around it to study every angle should she attempt an illusion of space or create an atmosphere of intimate enclosure the aura of intimacy would be better for her purposes she called in her servants and set them to removing the dining table and chairs from her last party and replacing them with twoperson dining couches with attendant tables by the time they returned with the mossgreen velvety drapes she wanted for the couches she had decided on the theme overhead stars as a backdrop mosscovered stones as if this place was a deep and narrow secret valley slowly arid with great care triana built up the illusion as she sat on one of the couches spinning it out of air and energy she placed and replaced each stone each graceful tree each tiny violet until she was satisfied with the balance and harmony tendrils of energy formed into branches and dissolved again until she was happy with the effect a waterfall no everyone had waterfalls lately theyd been done to death instead she simulated the calls of frogs and crickets and a single nightingale she called for refreshments and real trees in tubs that would be masked with draped vines supervising the slaves as they moved the real trees into position around the six couches it was already past sundown but her guests would arrive well before dinner tomorrow and she must have the dining room ready long before then she overlaid an illusion of moss on the carpet visual only as the carpet itself was soft enough to the tread to please that left only scenteasily taken care of with no illusion at all she left orders for garlands of flowers and leaves to be draped between the tubbed trees and wreathed around the couches she sat down on one of the couches and surveyed her work with a critical eye making minute changes here and there so that the grotto appeared random entirely natural even the sky overhead was a clever variation she had keyed the stars to follow the movements of the real sky by the time she declared herself finished she was exhausted with the unaccustomed labor but it would all be worth it tomorrow triana surveyed her guests and smiled openly gildor and his favorite concubine were installed on the most private of the couches at the rear of the grotto gildor clearly considered this to be a favor not an insultand so evidently did his father each of the other five guests shared his couch with an attractive female slave too but these men were all powerful and probably had concubines that made these girls look like fieldslaves for them these slaves were nothing more than sentient furniture that served them silently without needing direction pleasant accoutrements which demonstrated the thoroughness and thoughtfulness of their hostess but nothing more they ate and talked as if the girls werent even there and the girls had been wellschooled if not given the kind of intensive training that triana lavished on her male slaves they acted on the needs of their temporary masters before those masters even knew they had a need cups were refilled after a single sip plates replaced with ones filled with new dainties the moment the hot foods began to cool or the cool ones to warm triana herself had no companion and ate very little her guests had loosened up enough to begin to speak of council business and she waited for the subject of lord kyrtian to come up as gildor dallied with his concubine completely oblivious to his elders it was lord kyndreth who broached the subject launching into a description of the aftermath of the climactic battle that routed the young lords so where are the wretches asked lord wendrelith his brow wrinkled with suppressed anger all thats been captured are slaves scattered like flushed quailbut unlike quail they arent regathering lord kyndreth replied i suspect that theyve each concocted boltholes during the time they were holding us off and now theyve gone to ground how much time and effort are you willing to spend in tracking them to their lairs not nearly as much as it will take i suspect said lord vandrien dryly it will be a massive effort lord kyndreth agreed every tracking team will have to have a lord with itone whose loyalty is unquestioned and cannot be subverted human slaves can be deceived or corrupted lord wendrelith shook his head in disgust ancestors wed either have to track them down one at a time which would take forever even by our standards triana interjected softly or strip our estates of supervisors neither is a viable option kyndreth said nodding triana seeing that she had not been rebuffed put in another of her observations arent they now crafting their own punishment another of the great lords turned his full attention to triana that is a very interesting idea my lady lord arentiellan said with an intensely alert expression in his eyes could you elaborate they cannot have more than one or two slaves apiece they dare not collect in groups of more than three they will not have anything that we think of as decent housingnot so much as a hunting lodge they are likely to be living in caves or other crude shelters none of them are truly powerful magicians if they wish to eat they must steal hunt gatherwith their own hands and those of the one or two slaves they still retain she laughed in a voice low and husky it is entirely possible that many of them are out there burning their dinners over smoking fires only to shiver through the night in scant shelter even as we speak she smiled sweetly i cannot imagine a punishment worse than thatliving like a wild human and knowing that the only way to rectify the situation is to come groveling back to us all five of the great lords stared at her for a long time then lord kyndreth broke out in unexpectedly loud laughter in which he was joined by the rest gildor looked up at them for a moment without interest then went back to his concubine by the ancestors my lady i think you have the right of it said lord arentiellan with admiration my miserable brat is certainly welcome to all the burned rabbit and rain he can stand what of the army kyndreth asked vandrien if it were up to me id disband them to trianas veiled joy the rest murmured agreement its up to the full council of course kyndreth demurred and there are the wizards to think of true vandrien mused who we will inevitably outlive triana pointed out quietly with half their blood coming from slavestock i cannot see that they would have our years with no more of the full blood they will dilute their stock to the point that they are no more longlived than mere slaves assuming that they dont kill each other off in their own quarrels once again my lady you surprise and delight me lord vandrien sat up enough to give her the full bow of respect i am in your debt for such reasoned observations thank you she lowered her gaze modestly still the wizards the question is whether it is possible that they could pose a threat to us simply by existing and serving as a temptation to the slaves to revolt kyndreth raised an eyebrow after all our own offspring did and slaves would have no difficulty with the notion of ofliving like wild humans arentiellan nodded still i dont know if you disbanded the army there is a question of what lord kyrtian would do with himself triana suggested gently if you ask me he ought to be on the council arentiellan said immediatelybut triana saw lord kyndreth exchange a pointed glance with one of the others she strove to catch his eye and nodded slightly lord kyndreth looked surprised then speculative then returned her nod she leaned back into her couch secure in the certainty that her message had been read and understood when the last honeyed grape had been eaten and the last pleasantry exchanged the great lords took their leave of their hostess one by one lord kyndreth sent his son and the concubine back through the portal and made as if to follow but found a sudden excuse to remain until all of the others had left but himself triana had accompanied them to the portal herself to bid them a polite farewell and now found herself as she had hoped alone with the great lord so my lady kyndreth said when the last haze of energy had died from the portal mouth you seem to have some notions about lord kyrtian you are coming to the point with unaccustomed abruptness if i may say so lord kyndreth triana demurred i amsomewhat concerned about lord kyrtian the great lord replied shifting his weight restlessly from his left foot to his right i may have awakened sleeping ambition in him and if now he finds no outlet for it he may bedistressed he may use his newwon reputation within the council to the disadvantage of others triana retorted coming to the point just as directly as lord kyndreth had the strategies of war and politics are not unalike on the other hand yes kyndreth prompted his energies could be turned elsewhere by someone who is clever enough to devise a channel for them she looked up at him from beneath her long lashes and smiled and what would this distraction cost me if i may ask my lady kyndreth was wasting no time it occurred to triana that he might be more worried about kyrtians ambitions than she had thought she decided to risk all on a single throw of the dice the council seat once held by my father his mouth pursed but he didnt look as if he particularly objected to the notion it could be done there have been females on the council before now but he hadnt committed to the bargain either the same clever person who found one outlet for his energies could turn them back to a moreunfortunatedirection if bargains made are not kept now he smiled wryly you have a way with words my lady the bargain will be keptand i believe that you will find our young commander at the estate of his aunt the lady morthena she smiled radiantly at him thank you my lord that is all i need he gave her a full court bow and all i require as well he stepped towards the portal which began to glow with energy in response to his proximity then he paused on the threshold to look back over his shoulder at her good hunting my lady he said and to you my lord she replied and he was gone shana hadnt seen kelyan and haldor in agesand she would have been hardpressed to recognize them now rena had been right to take action perhaps the change in the two young elvenlords had been so gradual that it had passed relatively unnoticed by the people who saw them every day but to shanas eyes the change was something of a shock elvenlords were rarely robust by human or halfblood standards but kelyan and haldor were wraiththin bones showing through skin gone quite translucent their silvergilt hair was lank and brittle and they bruised badly and easily the dragons had brought them to the citadel in a stupor induced by mero after waking them only enough to stuff them full of food and drink and clean them up after their journey shana had put them back to sleep again two elven captives summarily dumped on their doorstep one more problem to try and fix this time she was at a loss this was not her area of expertise if it hadnt been for lorryn coming in and volunteering to find a group to help her with them she wouldnt have known where to start now shana and the group of young wizards lorryn had called together stared down at their pair of captives as they slept in a magicinduced fog illuminated by a pair of magelights and it wasnt just wizards that lorryn had asked for help either the group included some of the strongest of the human mages that shana had ever met as well i wouldn t have thought of thatstupid of me humans are the ones with the magic that works on thoughts there were several of them now living among the wizards drawn down out of the hills by the promise of a place where they could live without fear of being captured by elvenled slavehunting expeditions they stayed because caellach had been very quiet ever since he had been defeated in the war of words with shana she was not altogether certain just how long he would remain quiet but for now she was going to take the gift and not worry about him one of these human magicians was a middleaged man called narshy whose ability to create illusions within the minds of those who were not adept at the iron peoples mindwall technique was nothing short of boggling it was he evidently that lorryn had first thought of when mero had first suggested that the wizards take over where mero and rena had been forced to leave off narshy could sometimes even get past the mindwalland because of that shana considered it a good thing he was on their side it made shana wonderbefore she dismissed the idea appalled that shed even considered itif narshy could be used to manipulate caellach gwain a base and immoral ideabut oh so tempting it had taken a distinct effort of will to put the idea firmly aside it was just a good thing that caellach regarded the full hu mans with so much disdain though she wouldnt have put it past him to use the weapon that she discarded as immoral for that matter was it immoral to be tinkering with the minds of the two elvenlords probably but they were already mad we d either have to kill them or fix them in such a way that they cant either betray us or the iron people she was caught between two equally distasteful solutionsbut had no real choice since mero and rena had already meddled with the situation past mending both elvenlords lay on pallets in the middle of a small disused room with their human and halfbloodedphysicians clustered around them well it shouldnt be too difficult for ten or twenty of us together to concoct whatever memories of being held you want us to narshy told shana with such supreme selfconfidence that shana felt a kind of grudging admiration whether he was right or wrong here it would be nice to be able to feel just once that same sort of selfconfidence with that many of us working at once we can justengrave the new memories in place within a few days so where do you want these two to have been held umm she hadnt thought that far to tell the truth but if she admitted that would she lose authority in their eyes they were all looking at her as if they expected her to present them with everything they needed ready to go what about the old citadel she suggested unable to think of anything more clever on such nonexistent notice that way we wont have to make anything upwouldnt real memories be better than ones we concocted but the elvenlords know about the old citadel someone protested wouldnt they have found these two before shana could answer that someone else did it for her with glee in their voice no because we can use our memories of the old citadel but we dont have to have them think that the place they were kept was the old citadel if we dont leave these two where the old citadel actually is whoever finds them will think that their prison was somewhere near where they were found let the elvenlords think that theres another hidden citadel somewhere what about the forest on the edge of lord cheynars estate lorryn suggested from the rear of the group its got a bad reputation anyway ancestors only know whats in there plenty of hunters have gone in and never come out again cheynar wont even send his own men in there after escaped slaves anymore thats true enough shana said thoughtfully i remember that mero told me about some spooky sort of invisible thing that got his horse in there and nearly got him when he and valyn were escaping she couldnt help it she caught herself smiling grimly there were plenty of things in those hills that were more than a match for elvenlords good enough narshy said taking the decision as made thats what well dothe lot of you that lived in the old citadel lets pry some of those memories out of your skulls and get them shared around so we can stuff these two full of them shana was pleased and amazed at the way he managed to take control of the little group and herd them off to a corner where they could work undisturbed with a sense of relief that was quite palpable she realized that this time for once someone else was going to take care of a problem unbelievable where did you find him she asked lorryn he acts as if hes been in charge of people mages even before this he has beenthats why i asked him to take charge of this group of yours lorryn replied then suddenly looked anxious you dont mindi hopehere ive gone and usurped your authority and now so has narshy please tell me you arent upset mind i should think not she shook her head and smiled tiredly i dont know how you just do this find the right people and get them to take over this or that jobi cant seem to find the right way to get people to think for themselvesor find the ones that can take the initiative on their own she bit her lip as the alltoofamiliar frustration arose maybe its because you cant believe that you dont have to do everything lorryn said gently thats all i do i find the people who are good at something i ask them to do the job and i believe that they can then i get out of the way and let them do it in their own way at their own pace there was no graceful way to reply to that and she just sat down on a stone ledge feeling totally inadequate and utterly deflated i never wanted to be a leader she said forlornly if anybody had asked me i could have had the chance to say no i know he sat down beside her id rather you were free to do what youre good at planning thinking coming up with solutions youre all bogged down with trying to get people to see that your solutions are sensibleor to come up with better ones you spend half your time trying to convince people and the other half trying to herd them into working on the solution rather than sitting around and arguing about it id rather you didnt have to worry about all that so would i suddenly she felt like weeping and swallowed the lump in her throat blinking rapidly but he interrupted her would you trust me to take what you arent good at off your plate he asked looking earnestly into her eyes im beginning to think that i am a leader that its in my naturepeople listen to me and im good at getting them to cooperate but would you trust me to do what im good at so that you can do what youre good at it took her a moment to work out what he was getting at and he probably wasnt entirely certain of it himself would she put him in the position that caellach gwain wanted so badly trust him to carry out what she could see were the right plans and decisions for her shouldnt she have someone older someone from the original wizards of the citadel but neither denelor nor parth agonwho should have been the leaders and who shana had expected would act as the leadersseemed to be up to the job instead they had been delegating more and more authority to her regardless of how she felt about it denelor never had cared to stir himself more than he had to after allshe already knew that his besetting sin was slothand parth parth she suddenly realized was old how old she didnt actually know not in yearsbut once they had gotten settled here and it seemed that she and her young wizards had the situ ation well in hand hed started taking a back seat letting her fight with caellach and his cronies waiting for her to make the decisions from vague hints over the years she realized that he must be at least a century old and perhaps more hes too old and tired to lead anymore especially now that the wizards are doing things and not just hiding he doesn t want the leadership position either its too much for him now maybe that was the case with denelor too but could she hand over that much authority to lorryn it would make her terribly vulnerable as vulnerable as if he truly is my lover the way everyone seems to think he isand this is the sort of thing theyd expect me to do start making him mymyruling consort this will only make them more certain that were lovers even though we re noteven though i she flushed as that thought came unbidden and she must have forgotten to shield it for suddenly he flushed too i cant help what other people think he said defensively i cant help it that wethat i she flushed again fumbled for words and couldnt find any this isnt a very nice position for you he said at last even my own sister thinks wereyou know no matter what we do people are going to make up their own minds about your personal life and theres nothing you can say or do that will change what they think but that doesnt make things easy for you when theres nothing going on between us nor for you she managed i mean here ive been dumping all these things on you and people are making all these assumptions and you arent even getting now her face reddened so it felt as if she were inches from a fire assumptions i dont mind but im not in the same position that you are its got to be intolerable for you he exclaimed ishanai wish suddenly everything fell beautifully into place as if the broken shards of a vase flew back together again before her eyes she knew what he wished he didnt need to say it he was projecting it so forcefully that he was almost shouting the words in her head he wanted those assumptions to be true but he had been afraid that if he tried to push himself onto her she would react by sending him away hehe loved her he really did and fire and rain i feel the same way lorryn wasnt just a supportive and clever friend anymore it wasnt just his friendship she needed and wanted how long had she been feeling this about him when did she stop feeling mere attraction just enjoying his company and suddenly start needing his presence the way she needed to breathe i didnti dont want to force you into anything he was saying a little wildly i knew how youd felt about valyn and i didnt want you to think i thought i could replace him i wanted us to be friends really good friends and i wanted it to be that we could depend on each other and then after a while when things started to get calmed down and we had the leisure to think about ourselves we couldi mean i know thati dont know oh hush she said suddenly full of a halfmad joy and kissed him putting everything she felt behind it just so she could get it all past the wild tide of his feelings oh she heard in her mind and then for some timeless time there was no room in either of their minds for words at all finally for that one moment no matter what would come after everything was perfectly completely right and she knew that she could trust lorryn more than she could even trust herself this isnt exactly the choicest spot he said finally into her hair were rather out in public not to mention our audience i suppose they could wake up shana sighed and reluctantly broke the embrace she smoothed down her hair selfconsciously he brushed a strand or two out of her eyes and tucked it behind her ear for her have you any time to spare he asked wistfully notheres this and the forges and the slavecollars and the defenses and ill make some she replied the irony of the situation was that the only people affected by this seachange in their relationship were lorryn and shana themselves but oh the difference for them no one seemed to have noticed that lorryns quarters had been stripped and converted into a storage area spiteful comments from caellach gwain as reported by shanas sharpeared observers among the children were in no wise changed and yetthe difference to her but the world outside their chamber was not going to go away a plana large and complicated plan to safeguard the citadel foreverwas beginning to take shape between the two of them when news came from keman that lord kyrtian had either given or been ordered to give the command of the army to someone else while the council debated its future the need for that plan took on a new sense of urgency the old citadel had defenses that this one didnt it was time to put them in place alara and kalamadea were the chief architects of the citadel and it was time to consult with them she and lorryn alara and father dragon sat together over a threedimensional map of the citadel sculpted in removable layers trying to plan what next needed to be molded out of the rocks of their mountain one grim considerationescape tunnels just in case the great lords decided to send the formidable lord kyrtian after them another a duplicate of the citadel far enough away to flee to but near enough that an evacuation could take place by means of the transportation spell there were enough wizards able to use it now that the entire population could be evacuated within hours and the advantage of the spell was that there would be no tracks to trace them by the existence of this duplicatewhich was near enough to zeds ironmines to provide extra protection but at this point hardly more than a few chambers molded out of the rock by some of the youngest dragonswas for now a closelykept secret even from the dragons working on it alara had told them it was nothing more than a new set of lairs which we also need shana thought wondering just how thin their resources could be stretched before things started snapping the prisonershow goes the memorymaking father dragon asked he and alara were in halfblood form at the moment or they would never have fit into the mapchamber i do not wish to alarm you unduly but the sooner we can drop those two where they can be found the better narshys sorted out whos the best at planting the new memories and hes got them stuffed with about a years worth shana replied tracing a possible exit tunnel from the lowest storage chamber onto the model with a wax pencil we decided to make the memories confused and foggy as if theyd been kept drugged we nominated caellach as the chief wizard of this imaginary lot lorryn put in getting a grin from father dragon and a head shake from alara we had to have somebody and at least hes memorable narshy says we should be able to plant them in a few days he took the real memories of being captured put new faces on the people doing the capture then took it from there shana brooded over the model hes using as much of their real memories as he can just changing the faces to wizards the tents to rock wallsand eliminating the iron collars hes making those into something like slavecollars so that the elvenlords will think that this new lot of concocted wizards are actually better at using elven magic than the elvenlords themselves are a good touch father dragon said admiringly now if only i could figure out a way to be in two places at the same time shana said staring down at the map keman and dora had not been able to get any nearer to lord kyrtian without revealing themselves thanks in no small part to the suspicious sargeant gel shana had not dared ask them to take that final irrevocable step i need desperately to see lord kyrtian for myself only then would she know whether or not he was truly to be trustedand if trusted to be approached but if she was gone from here there was no telling what mischief caellach might not get up to if she was delayedif something happenedcould lorryn control the old troublemaker for long or would caellach manage to regain his hold over his old faction and set this entire warren seething with so many quarrels and bad feelings that it would all fall to pieces your mind or your body kalamadea asked suddenly with an odd birdlike twist of his head what do you mean she replied wondering what had prompted that sort of reply wellif its your mind that needs to be in two places at oncethat is if you feel that you have to be able to see and make decisions yourself about things going on in two different places at the same time then we cant help you kalamadea said but if its your body that needs to be seen in two places if for instance you wanted to leave and had confidence in someone enough to let him make decisions for you but you needed a sort of figurehead or puppet of yourself so that certain people wouldnt decide to make trouble while you were gone a certain person whose name rhymes with drain alara put in with a sly wink exactlyand if thats whats concerning you well thats entirely different and its something alara and i can help you with father dragon looked particularly smug and it didnt take long for shana to realize why what he meant and she wanted to smack herself in the head for not thinking of it sooner of course she exclaimed oh mothertheres no reason why you cant shapeshift into me is there you know me well enough to counterfeit me for everybody she flushed as lorryn laughed and made a face well practically everybody no reason at all alara said agreeably and i dont know why we didnt think of this before when youknowwho became so interfering and disagreeable unless it was because we were too worried about what had happened to you to think of it already her mind was racing if alara could do this and was willing then she could go in person to see this lord kyrtian and make a decision about whether or not she should try to make an ally of him she exchanged a glance with lorryn lord kyrtian he said simply their minds following the same track i cant make a decision about him without seeing him myself she replied nodding nor should you kalamadea said firmly keman and dora are good children but if they make a poor choice they have the option of flying away from wizards and citadel and all not he added hastily that i believe that they would but the option is there lurking behind their thoughts and it could make them a bit less cautious he rubbed his chin thoughtfully i believe that same option might have made me too cavalier in my own decisions at the time of the first war since shana had occasionally wondered that herself there was no good answer she could make to that since she couldnt she held her tongue lorryn can control caellach better than i can she said with complete confidence and a wink to him and lorryn is someone the rest will listen to they listen to him more than they do to me actually maybe because he never was a wizards apprentice there were some profound disadvantages to having been the rawest of raw beginners within the old citadel and the old regime itself and that was one of them theres only one difficulty and thatswell if anyone looks into alaras mind theyre going to know she isnt me but the troublemakers are not the ones who are at all adept with the powers of human magic lorryn pointed out logically alara just shrugged off the difficulty how often is anyone likely to snoop on the thoughts of the elvenbane anyway she asked i shouldnt think it happens often and besides i can probably learn mindwall well enough to keep them out perhaps perhaps not dragon minds arent like ours but alara was right that in all this time shana had very seldom felt the touch of anothers mind on hers and even then it was someone wanting to communicate not snoop i can take you to where keman and dora are kalamadea continued serenely now that lord kyrtian has taken leave of his command while the great lords debate whether or not to disband the greater part of the army keman and dora have just today followed him to lady morthenas estate lady moth lorryns exclamation made them all turn to look at himand this news must have come as a surprise to him but thats where my mother is lady moth is one of her oldest friends really that was interesting but not overly so and it didnt seem particularly important to their current situation but lorryn was continuing you remember weve been getting some communications from motherirregular letters he continued lady moth isnt just any elven lady she has never mistreated her humans theyre servants not slaves to her in fact when we left mother with her just at the start of the revolt she was riding the bounds of her estate with armed human men who called her little mother and treated herwell with affection that got her attention the only elvenlord that she had ever seen treated with affection by humans had been valyn really and lord kyrtian had gone therewhy i wonder dont wonder go and find out father dragon urged her do it before the great lords make up their minds what to do about him because if they dont decide to use him you can be sure that theyll try to destroy him would that be so bad shana countered knowing that she sounded heartlessbut she had to bring up the point because others would if it came down to it her authority rested on one thing and that was the ability of the rest to trust her decisions with some rare exceptions the humans and wizards of the citadel would see elvenlords taking down other elvenlords as a step in the right direction and not trouble themselves as to what might follow it could be that was lorryn looking troubled for one thing shana if we can make him an ally hed be better than anyone here at the art of war for anotherhe has to be one of the rare ones like lady moth if hes removed all the humans on his estate will be in deadly danger from whoever they put in his place you cant want that she groaned but had to agree if all that was true even if they managed to rescue all of lord kyrtians slaves it would strain the capacity of the citadel to support them why was it that every turn of fate brought more and more people for whom she had to be responsible into her purview he may not realize just how treacherous the great lords are shana kalamadea said quietly he may not dream hes in danger if nothing else he deserves to be warned and the best person to warn him is me i suppose she tried to sound resigned but aside from the pressure and burden of apparently additional responsibilities she didnt really feel resigned at all she felt excitedthis was the sort of thing she was good at but lorrynto separate even temporarily now that they were together once again he read her feelings as well as her thoughts you go he said softly before she even looked at him you have to go ill see no one makes trouble here and youll be there and back again before you know it it cant take more than a few days at most can it i wouldnt think so but now she looked at him ill miss you every moment but this is something only you can do he might not trust a dragon he wont trust that some strange wizard has the authority to speak for all of us rena cant get here soon enough to talk to him even if shed be willing to leave mew but youre the elvenbane if you make him an offer hell believe you and there after all was the heart of the matter she was distinctive no one could mistake her for anything other than what she was her description had circulated to every part of the elvenlords domain now and once lord kyrtian set eyes on her he would know who she was just promise to come back to me that was the easiest promise she had ever made kyrtians nose tickled and he rubbed it absently why is it that in spite of decades of practice the ancestors had handwriting that was uniformly atrocious the tiny words not only looked as though they had been written with the aid of a lens they conformed to no school of calligraphy he d ever seen kyrtian labored his way through yet another personal journal making notes on sheets of foolscap for later transcription in his own neat and extremely legible hand this business of concocting a personal scriptstyle must have been a common affectation among the bored but why they should choose to also write as if paper was more valuable than gold was beyond his comprehension here in lady moths library it was so quiet he could almost hear dust motes falling out of the air to add to the accumulation on the books lady moth had brought back all the volumes that she had extracted during the time that the young lords were using the place as their headquarters the situation was reversed now and she commanded her late husbands estate and holdings as she should have done some time past with no army to command and no war to fight the young lords were hardly in need of a commandpost although they were still full of an impotent defiance kyrtian reached for a glass of water and absently took a sip for the moment the young lords were living on the grounds of the dowagerestate lady moths tower hiding in the one place where no one was likely to come looking for them wearing illusory disguises to make them look like human slaves it was unlikely that even if a search was made there for them that they would be found as long as they can hold together and not have someone get a change of heart and defect they should do all right hed talked to them all and at the moment he didnt think that likely not while they were safe and not having to suffer any serious hardships not even moths own slaves knew who they werethe story was that they had been part of the young lords army and that moth was sheltering them to keep them from being punished for having been conscripted in the first place it was a situation that made it hard for kyrtian to keep a straight face whenever he thought about it living among the slaves was going to do them a world of good already hed seen signs of a change in attitude towards the humans from some of them he had every confidence that if or whenthe revolt started again it would be on a very different footing if it happened they already counted on it having a very different ending their plans called for him to either join them openly or permit the great lords to place him back in command of the army and proceed to actually do as little as possible then at the right moment he could turn the councils army against the great lords themselves but i dont want to do that if i can help it such a warbecause it would be a war and not a revoltwould be bloody most of the casualties would be human there was just no getting around that and althoughif the young lords had changed their attitude towards slaveowning by thenthe humans on their side would have an active stake in the outcome they would still be the ones taking the full force of the fighting there were far more of them than there were elves and as physical fighterswell the young lords were not very good kyrtians plan which he hoped to talk the young lords into was more subtle he wanted them to creep back to their august fathers one at a time in secret and grovel they would still have the iron jewelry that kept their fathers from working magic on them that was key after they returned and once they managed to regain some freedom of movement he hoped they could work their own way back up through the hierarchy and attrition among the great lords would eventually put them in the seats of power such a plan however did have a number of drawbacks not the least of which was that there were plenty of the great lords who would quite readily slay their rebellious sons and underlings out of hand if they ever so much as showed their faces and once back in a fathers good graces there was always the chance that someone would turn traitor that would be awkward so for now they were in hiding and if they werent accomplishing anything at least they werent getting into trouble either meanwhileas the council debated the next use they were going to make of him and his erstwhile enemies cooled their heels in circumstances he hoped would teach them some empathy he was using his enforced leisure to get back to the search for his father the answer to his fathers whereabouts was in this room somewhere he was sure the trouble was that there was so much to wade through and none of it had ever been properly cataloged personal journals were crammed in next to the sort of romantic novels considered appropriate for ladies to while away their hours withbooks on flora and fauna were piled atop maps and volumes on magic his nose tickled again and he unsuccessfully tried to suppress a sneeze moth or her friend viridina were in here a dozen times a day trying to clean out the dust magically but every time he opened a volume more of it flew up into the air in clouds moths family had a mania of their ownfor collecting most of this library had come to her from various family members they were however indiscriminate in their mania in the case of the ones whod acquired books and manuscripts the definition of a book seemed to be any collection of paper with covers on it and the definition of manuscript was any collection of handwritten paper as far as he could tell there was no method in what theyd selected no categories no attempt to place a value on anything perhaps if hed been in here before the young lords took residence hed have been able to find the things his father had studied that had given him his real clue but they had simply shoveled everything they found to the side in heaps so that they could use the room for their own purposes and moth hadnt helped when she extracted the books that she thought were important moth bless her had been under the impression that she had kept some order and cleanliness to the library yes well that was before we found the boxes in the storagechamber moths husband had maintained a show library with things he thought worth keeping attractively shelved the restwhich amounted to four or five times the volume of works on showhad gotten packed into boxes and stacked up in a storeroom behind the library itself moth had thought that the storeroom was empty until theyd opened the door in their search for maps they could use to plan their campaign and the plans of manors and estatehouses the young lords had rummaged through it all bringing some things into the library and leaving them removing other things to make room for what they brought in whatever order had once been here was gone completely now the storeroom had shelves and so did the unused office next to it and the unused receptionroom next to that and kyrtian was trying to bring some order to the chaos kyrtian however was fast becoming convinced that his answer lay not in printed books or illuminated manuscripts interesting as those might be but in the personal journals kept often by elven ladies and infrequently by their lords his father had almost certainly divined the location of the portal from something in here that location was lost and what was more there seemed to be evidence that the ancestors who had built the thing had engaged in an active effort to hide that location from their descendantsand even from some of their own who had come through the portal why that was a good question perhaps they feared a traitor in their midst who would reopen the portal to their enemies the portal itself had cooperated in erasing memories it was fairly clear that the crossing was such a traumatic ordeal in and of itself that a substantial number of those who crossed could not remember a great deal of what happened immediately thereafter and perhaps some of those folk were helped to forget none not one of the great lords that had created the portal and survived the crossing left any substantive records about it that much was fact nor did any of the historiansanother fact so with no official records he was left with only one other source the unofficial onesand of those the best would be the records of those who were considered too insignificant to matter the ladies ah yes the ladies and the eccentrics some of those journals were attractively bound and might at one time have been shelved in the main roomand that might be where kyrtians father had gotten his information or he might have found something in official records that kyrtian had somehow completely overlooked kyrtian ran a dusty hand through his hair in frustration then told himself sternly not to get so impatient after all his father had been hunting for the portal for decades before kyrtian was born by the time he found what he was looking for he had probably gotten to the point that he was so familiar with the ancestors and the way their minds worked that he was able to intuit things that werent obvious so he was wading through everything handwritten that moth had in this library with the great book of ancestors beside him before he could eliminate any manuscript or journal he first had to figure out who wrote it or at least who the authors contemporaries were then discover whether or not the author lived far enough back to have made the crossing since it was almost a guarantee that most of the manuscripts he found would be from too late a period to mention the crossing except in passing he would then try to find every other manuscript that could be attributed to that person most people who were addicted to journalwriting had produced multiple volumes over the course of their very long lives if the author was of too late a period well it helped to be able to weed out everything that could be attributed to her pen it was a painfully logical and methodical plan of dealing with the situation it was also very tedious very timeconsuming and very very dusty kyrtian had two helpers at leastgel and that little female concubine that lady triana had been so considerate in planting on him hed sent for her apurpose once hed turned over his commission to lord kyndreth while the council debated if triana was so interested in what he was doing he was inclined to allow her more information than she could comfortably digest he had a notion that she was working with aelmarkin at least for the moment lady moth had been very helpful in presenting him with a summary of her past behavior and from that hed formed the opinion that whatever game she played whatever alliances she made her ultimate goal would serve no one but herself now to his mind the best possible way to handle her was to give her the information he wanted her to have gel had examined the girl himself interrogating her to the point of exhaustion and even tears and it was his opinion that lydiell had succeeded in turning her whenever she reported to triana and triana had been very interested to learn just where he was and what he was doing right nowgel was there making certain she stuck to the script theyd agreed on nevertheless she didnt know exactly what it was he was doing in moths library what she didnt know she couldnt be forced to reveal if triana or aelmarkin ever got their hands on her she knew only what she sawwhich was that he had ordered all the books down off the shelves to be sortedthat moths slaves had then reshelved and cataloged all of the printed material while they worked he examined the handwritten stuff creating a second catalog and she and gel shelved what he was done with she couldnt read elven handscript she didnt know what he was keeping and what he was rejecting so although she now had a wealth of information about his movements none of it was likely to do triana any good he actually expected the infamous triana to put in an appearance before too very much longer he couldnt see how she could possibly resist trying to pry into his affairs in person she would probably also try to seduce him that was her pattern in the past he had heard even from moth that she was a great beauty and not a passive statuesque creature either but lively witty aggressive and not afraid to show her intelligence such a woman had learned how to turn her looks and fascination into a weapon long ago she might even have approached lord kyndreth as well as aelmarkin prepared to use anyone and anything in her quest for personal power if that was the case she might well have met her match in lord kyndreth who had been playing deep games for far longer than little lady triana ancestorsive turned into such a cynic there were times when he longed for what he had been when the worst of his worries was working out little battleplans and conspiring with lydiell to keep aelmarkin at a distance to think that he had actually looked up to people like lord kyndreth well i know better now it hadnt just been his own experiences that had enlightened him nor the nightlong acidwashed frank talk that moth had had with him when he first arrived it was the testament of these very manuscripts beneath his hands that outlined the machinations and betrayals the abuse of power and the use of it from the point of view of those that the powerful considered too insignificant to monitor mind some of them were no prizes either acting like chickens in the hen yard turning when pecked to hammer on those beneath them but it had been an enlightening if distasteful education wading through the pages they probably thought no one else would ever read is it any better among the wizards and free humans i wonder with most of his illusions gone he had to guess that it was probably more a matter of degree the great lords were so powerful and those who aspired to their power were so fixated on achieving it that the very power they all held or craved corrupted them it was inevitable unless like moth they were acutely aware of just how dangerous that much power was the fact that they lived such very long lives only meant that the corruption and selfishness was etched deeper than it could ever possibly go with a mere human but there are the others like moth lydielland myself i hope power didnt have to corrupt if you knew just how dangerous it was and were well aware that it came burdened with incredible responsibilities he hoped that there were those among the wizards and free humans who knew that perhaps that was the key to those among the elvenlords who did treat the humans who had come under their protection with the same consideration that they would have given an elven underling and those elven underlings who treated humans as equals they were the ones who had felt the boot of the evelon overlords on their backs and had learned from the experience or who at least had determined never to treat one with less power as they themselves had been treated and those ancestors in their turn had passed their attitude down to their offspring were there more such households as hisand lady moths possiblyfor a moment he dared to hope that there were hiding their nature just as he and his father and grandfather had they were probably just like his familyremaining quietly selfsufficiently in the background permitting the great lords to believe that they were hopelessly provincial and not worth troubling with ancestors knew that if aelmarkin hadnt been such a thorn in their side their household would never have come under the scrutiny of kyndreth and he would never have been forced into the open to find himself recruited as a military expert he realized at that moment that hed been staring at the same page for quite some time and hadnt deciphered a word of it gah im a scholar not a philosopher he bent over the closelywritten page again whispers from the rear of the library intruded on his attention because one of the whisperers was gel and there was a tone in the mans voice hed never heard before he took a quick glance over the top of the manuscript sure enough there wasnt a great deal of shelving going on but gel and the pretty little concubine certainly had their heads close together well well well the granite crag cracks at last he didnt know whether to laugh or be annoyed not that he wanted the girl oh she was attractive and talented enough but so were the two other girls his mother had purchased for him but of all the times for his toughminded partner to pick to go soft over a woman this had to be the worst on the other hand this was gel he was talking about gel who had taught him the business of war and fighting gel who stuck by his side like a faithful dog gel who had never asked for anything for himself how could he possibly be annoyed that gel had finally found someone who touched his heart oh ancestors now how was he going to juggle all this hidden rebels possible treachery from his superiors the hunt for his father and now gel in love what next as he stared at the notsoyoung lover he felt a tap on his shoulder lady moth had come into the library without his noticing and she wore her maskface the one that generally meant that she waswell up to something we have a visitor that i believe you will want to meet yourself she whispered after a glance at gel and the girl who were completely oblivious to anything else going on around them oh nonot triana you may tell lady triana that he began but moths eyebrows shot up and she interrupted him i dont know why you should be expecting her moth replied but its not lady triana and i do think you should put down that stupid journal written by an equally stupid blockhead and come with me now seeing that she was not to be denied kyrtian sighed marked the place where he was leaving off and stood up the lovers never noticed that he was leaving that in itself was an indication of just how hard gel had fallen oh ancestors i only hope that triana didn t place that girl with me to get at gel rather than me with his thoughts flitting between amusement and concern he wasnt paying a great deal of attention when moth brought him into a tiny chamber kitted out as a sittingroom where a young woman waited pacing up and down in front of the windows displaying no great patience herself all he noticed at first was that she was redhaired and greeneyed clothed in the same sort of tunic boots and trews as a common laborer with the physique of someone who was athletic and very much used to taking care of herself in any and all circumstances he couldnt imagine why moth had insisted he meet this person unless perhaps she was one of moths human servants and had information about the young lords lord kyrtian moth said formally i believe that you have many things to discuss with lashana she tipped her head to the side as he sighed with exasperation still wondering what she was getting at she pursed her lips but her green eyes held the ghost of amusement in them i believe you might know her by another name elvenbane what he lost every vestige of exasperation annoyance impatience in that moment he stared at the woman who stood poised like a deer about to flee trying to make his mind believe what his ears had just heard red hairbut elven eyes and the ears wizard blood unless its an illusion but moth would never have been fooled by an illusion moth had met wizards moths friend viridinaher son was a wizard lashana arrived bearing a letter from viridinas halfblood son verifying her identity moth said as if divining his thoughts she probably is the old schemer she doesn t need to read thoughts she knows me like her favorite sonnet i amfascinated to meet you lashana he said carefully or should i call you elvenbane please dont the young woman said firmly she was still tense and very illatease its not a name i ever claimed for myself both of them stood so awkwardly so stiffly that moth began to chuckle kyrtian lashana for ancestors sake sit down you look like a pair of bad carvings i do swear kyrtian relaxed marginally and gestured to lashana to take a seat on the cushioned bench nearest her she did so moving as if she was an old creature with frozen joints he selected a slightly lower seat on a stool to put his eyes a little lower than hers i dont have much time she said finally and im not certain how to begin i can tell you that he offered and tried a smile begin with why you knew you could trust me not to kill you on sight as he had hoped such a direct and blunt approach was precisely the right way to approach her and she began telling him the most amazing story that he had ever heard in his life he listened and had to work not to allow his mouth to fall open with shock more than once to think that two of her people had gotten close enough to him to stand guard on his very tent so that they could spy on him he would have to have a word with gel about that later at some point his capacity for sheer astonishment was exhausted and he could only listen to her in a sort of trance it was all too impossible to believe and yet he had to believe in it the things she told him fit too well with what he already knew then after talking until she was hoarse she paused and exchanged a significant look with lady moth so she said now you tell me to take myself off or or i ask you if your wizards would dare accept the elvenlord commander as an ally he finished having already come to the conclusion that this and only this could be the reason why she had come to him brilliantaudaciousand completely logical and on the other hand completely illogical that she should ever trust a fullblood she stared at him and suddenly every bit of tension ran out of her just like water running out of a cracked jar fire and rain she exclaimed weakly youre just as keman claimed you are he wondered if she had read his thoughts using the same human magic that some of his own people hadand moths only the surface she replied instantly i dont pry none of us would and if you want i can teach you a method to keep even the surface thoughts private he looked deeply into her emerald eyes so like and unlike a fullbloods and saw only sincerity in them hed been around human mages too often to feel unnerved by her instant response to his thought id appreciate that he replied but it can wait so now i assume you know about my own people a sudden blinding idea occurred to him at that moment the way that he could finally safeguard his own people and his mother no matter what happened to him and he saw that she saw it in his thoughts by the surprise that flashed into her eyes yes she exclaimed oh indeed yes lord kyrtian we can and we will take your folk if they must be evacuated portalsthe transportation magicwhatever is needed between your people and mine we can do whatever it takes to get them to safety and you neednt fear for your mother and the other elves of your house eitherwe have lorryns halfsister with us and she is as welcome now among us as he is now it was his turn to feel relief that made him sag blessed ancestors he murmured passing a hand over his brow if you knew what it meant to me to hear that then he smiled weakly what am i saying of course you know but relief from one problem didnt help much with the others and if this young woman did not have much time they needed to make plans urgently bless you lashana now lets decide between us what i can do for you and yours gel was not happy with him next time gel muttered under his breath the next time you go making harebrained meetings without me with women youve never seen and dont know anything about ill take you to the horsetrough and hold your head under till you come to your senses i swear kyrtian sagged against the back of his chair but was not going to back down this time he didnt blame his old friendbut something had told him that lashana and gel shouldnt meet yet there wasnt enough time to negotiate all of gels suspi cions not and come to an understanding before she had to leave ancestors the danger she had put herself in by coming to him directly and the danger had increased with every moment that passed there was no telling who could have discovered her there gels dinner sat uneaten in front of him he had already stuffed his meal down his own throat as hed explained the miracle that had happened in that incongruously ordinary room this afternoon gel morthena was there the entire timeand what could one little wizardgirl possibly do to me he asked reasonably gel only growled i suppose you know she could have been talking things shes got no authority to promise morthena says she has the authority and thats good enough for me his mind was too full of plans now to be put off by gels irritation his old friend was mostly just annoyed that for the first time he had made plans and forged a pact without gels supervision i know what im doing gel he said with perfect conviction gel looked at him with one eyebrow raised then slowly and grudgingly nodded and his expression changed completely he went from angerto defeat i guess you do he said slowly i guess you dont need me anymore now it was his turn to feel exasperated and he tossed his fork down on his plate oh fordont be ridiculous id as soon cut off my right hand now lookwe need to try and think of all possible contingencies here and have some sort of skeleton in place if there was a tap on the door and lady moth poked her head into the library if i didnt know better id say you were a wizard or else you somehow conjured the baggage by saying her name she said sourly i seem to be attracting all manner of visitors today this time kyrtian knew that the name that sprang into his mind was the right one oh no he said grimacing lady triana just what we need moth can you keep the blady triana occupied for a little kyrtian asked a little desperately he ran both his hands through his hair frantically i cant see her just yet oh probably moths annoyance was turning to amusement in fact ill take it as a challenge obviously youd better talk to gel im sure he can advise you besides youre in no state to entertain a ladythe least you can do is clean yourself up moth eyed him with disfavor believe me youd better have your wits about you and present a marble facade to lady triana ill go and insist she tell me every tiny detail of every affair quarrel and inconsequential bit of maneuvering among the great households while you do so ive been isolated for some timeand everyone knows what a terrible old busybody i am if i cant engage her viridina can you are not old he protested earning a smile thank you moth was right he needed time to get his wits about him while lady moth left the library to keep her visitor busy with a flood of gossipunder the excuse that she needed to be caught up on all the news she had missed while surrounded by the young lordskyrtian had a lot of work to do and first on his list was to warn the girl that triana was here but when kyrtian got up from the table gel finally broke off the conversation with his young woman renna reanna rennati that was it both of them looked up as he approached ive been telling rennati that you had a visitor gel began and kyrtian felt a surge of panic which eased as gel went on with a lift of an eyebrow its a rather good thing that those poor misused slaves that the young lords commandeered have realized that no blame is going to be attached to them and sent one of their number to talk to you thank the ancestors he didnt give her the real story yet kyrtian thought relieved yes well you cant blame them for wanting to send a sort of delegate to me to plead their case he replied mendaciously they cant have realized that lady moth would treat her human servants exactly the way we treat ours but weve got another visitor it seems lady moth tells me that lady triana has come calling rennatis face went dead white that alone would have been a giveaway that she had been covertly serving triana even if kyrtian hadnt already known the whole story triana had chosen her tool very poorly on the whole if she so readily betrayed herself by her mere expressions but triana never really thought of humans much except as catspaws she probably never once considered that he or gelor anyone that matteredwould be around to see her reaction if trianas name was mentioned but gel immediately put his weathered paw over her slim hand and said gruffly now rennatishe neednt even know youre here on the contrary kyrtian said firmly i want triana to know shes here in fact i have something in mindit might be a little humiliating for you he continued turning to the girl but if you can weather a bit of humiliation i think we can turn her attention away from you completely and for all time if youll cooperate he explained what he wanted her to do and although the girl flushed with embarrassment and gel growled over the plan they both eventually agreed it was the only possible solution shell probably corner you at some point this evening if only to get her telesonring back he cautioned i think we can manage to interrupt that confrontation before she can do anything to you but you know if she does take back the ring it will effectively sever all contact with you and show that shes got no more interest in you and if what lashana told me is true we can also expect to have a device to completely neutralize the collar she placed on you in a day or so he thought but did not say aloud that was a secret he wished to keep to himself until lady triana was long gone rennati nodded and licked her lips i think that would be best my lord she whispered as gel squeezed her hand comfortingly ill go to my quarters and prepare and id better go to mine kyrtian said stifling a groan he left the two of them alone no doubt gel who had delivered encouraging speeches to fighters in the past could find the words to put courage into this little dancers heart he didnt have a great deal of clothing with him suitable for formal occasions but he had the run of lady moths mansion and asked her servants to rummage through the closets of her late husbands wardrobe and select something appropriate he worked a little judicious use of magic to adjust the fit of the sober black silk and silver outfit they brought him and it made him presentable enough he descended from the secondfloor guest quarters to lady moths drawing room looking he hoped like the successful but nononsense military commander he was the ladies broke off their conversation as he entered the spacious palepink and gold chamber lady viridina and lady moth flanked lady triana perched on delicate chairs on either side of the sofa that triana occupied if womens clothing served as a weaponand given all that kyrtian knew about triana there was no doubt in his mind that for her it didthen lady triana had come armed to the teeth nothing about her costume was excessive there was nothing about it that any other lady could take exception toexcept that the fleshcolored silk of her gown though it covered her literally from neck to knee could not have revealed more of her unless shed been stark naked but the effect was oh so subtle the silk was heavy not thin and her charms were disclosed by imperceptible degrees as she moved the color contributed to the effect and knowing what he knew now about the lady kyrtian couldnt help but admire her tactical expertise on her own battlefield that did not however mean he intended to fall victim to it he halfbowed to all three ladies then took a step forward and made a more formal bow over trianas hand lady triana i have heard a great deal in praise of you he said keeping the irony out of his voice likewise lord kyrtian she replied most especially from my friend lord kyndreth so much so that when i heard you were here with lady morthena i thought i would trespass on her hospitality and come to see you myself very nice drop kyndreths name so that i know i cant just dismiss you out of hand then turn on your charm she was certainly doing all of that and the amazing part was that it was not at all blatant if hed been the naive fellow he was when hed first taken on command of the army he probably would have fallen directly for her kyrtian had always been inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt until he met them himself if hed done that with triana he would have been certain that she could not be as bad as shed been painted so let me think what should my reaction be he really didnt want very much except to see the back of her he doubted that there was very much he could learn from her and frankly there was far too much that she could learn from or about him if she stayed very long i do hope that i am not a bitter disappointment to you but i fear that most people find me quite boring he said bluntly and they generally tell me so to my face i dont cultivate any interests outside of the battlefield my lady and at the moment i cant afford to that took her aback for a moment he watched her as she tried to think of something flattering to say that wouldnt sound like flattery well since i havent heard you speak more than a few sentences im not in any position to judge she replied with a throaty laugh that probably stole the breath of many an impressionable lad it wont take you very long to verify was his reply brusque to the point of rudeness then he was saved from further pleasantries by the servant come to announce dinnerto which of course triana was of necessity invited she would have to stay the night as well since she had come the way any uninvited guest would haveoverland from the nearest point to which she had a portal key possibly kyndreth himself had gotten her as far as the army camp which was quite near enough for an easy days ride if she was on any kind of terms with kyndreth he would have found that an easy thing to do which meant that it could be kyndreth and not aelmarkin that she was working with or both given what the elvenbane had told him about kyndreth there was very little doubt in his mind that the moment his erstwhile benefactor saw him as a possible rival he would be eliminatedand that of course played right into aelmarkins plans so it didnt matter whether she was working for his cousin or the great lord what he had to do was to paint himself as utterly unlikely to engage in politicsthe bluff soldier happiest when on the battlefield very well now he had his course of action moth had ordered dinner in an intimate setting that suited him very well over the course of the meal he worked hard to establish himself as a monomaniac obsessed with war and tactics primarilyand secondarily with discovering the whereabouts of his father or at least his fathers fate every hint that he might once the council had decided they needed his services as a commander no longerseek a council seat was rebuffed never he said at last when she stopped hinting and suggested it outright itd drive me mad in a day id rather take up flowersculpting at least the flowers wouldnt argue with me and that was very much to trianas surprise though interestingly enough not to her discomfiture in fact once he established that course she encouraged it in that casewell your training methods certainly work wonders with the gladiatorial slaves she said smoothly perhaps if you arent interested in breeding them yourself you could establish a training school in concert with a breeder i might then he threw her another mental puzzle to chew on of course he continued pompously as long as those wretched wizards are in existence the council will require the army to exterminate them and theyll need me to lead that army they may have been clever tacticians compared to well i wont mention namesbut im better thanks to lashana he knew what she didntthat two longheld elvenlords had just been turned loose in the vicinity of lord cheynars estate with false memories of being held by a second entirely unknown group of wizards hidden in the strange hills and forests somewhere near there he knew that once the council learned of these specious wizards so near them there would be panic and he would be called on to find them especially if triana brought word of his hubris to kyndreth or aelmarkin or both for kyndreth sending him on a hunt for these wizards was a winning strategy all around if they defeated him he would almost certainly diein the past the wizards had made killing the elven commanders a key part of their strategy and that wasnt likely to change if he defeated them kyndreth would get the credit and he could be deflected back into the hunt for his fathers fate for aelmarkin well doubtless his cousin would hope for his defeat and bide his time when kyndreth heard his plan for finding the imaginary wizards hed be doubly pleased pardon my lord said one of moths slaves in as formal and stiff a manner as even the most protocolobsessed elvenlord could have wished but the matter you wished to attend tothe slaves you requested have been brought and are awaiting your pleasure the lad almost gave himself away kyrtian caught the twinkle in his eye but his own sober expression only barely lightened with dour pleasure kept the liveried servant from losing his composure i beg your pardon my lady he said to triana but i had arranged for a certain matter to be dealt with at dinner this evening and i didnt think to cancel my orders i am sure you wont mind my attending to it whata chastisement for just a moment there was an avidity in her eyes that made him sick thank the ancestors i was warned against her no my ladya reward actually he turned to moths slave stiff in his formal livery have them brought in the lad bowed a moment later in came gel escorted by two of the fighters followed by rennati escorted by a pair of moths handmaidens all humans of course kyrtian allowed himself a smile sargeant gel he said in the most overbearing manner possible you have distinguished yourself in my service for years but in this campaign against the rebels you truly have outshone any other slave in my possession i am loath to lose you however i am even more loath to lose such a patently excellent bloodline i have decided to retire youand to ensure that your line continues and provides me with more outstanding fighters and tacticians in the future i am presenting you with this handsome wench as your mate he gestured and the two handmaidens ushered rennati forward the poor child was blushing furiously casting her eyes down gel had managed to contrive an expression of utter dumbfoundedness shes quite a little athlete in her own right he laughed coarsely which should complement your own attributes and im sure that providing me with more of your stock will be a pleasure to you given her expertise and accomplishments gel dropped his eyes and went stiffly to one knee and from the way that his neck had reddened kyrtian knew that it was only the full knowledge that this insulting speech was meant for trianas benefit alone that kept his old friend from exploding with rage thank you my gracious lord gel got out through clenched teeth fortunately with his head bowed it sounded sincere and humble i can never be worthy of this honor well go take the girl and see about rewarding my generosity as quickly as possible kyrtian said airily waving a dismissive hand gel got up took rennatis limp and unresisting hand in his own and rather abruptly hauled her away followed by the rest of the slaves oh im going to pay for this the next time we practice he turned to triana whose face was a study in shock nice little dancer my mother bought for me he said dismissively knows her business perfect to make sure the old fellow can do his duty by her and by mei can guarantee shes been well trained on top of that shes got a fantastic physique and re flexes if i dont get a set of unbelievable bodyguards out of those two ill eat my boots without sauce then he pretended belatedly to see trianas stunned expression oh your pardon my ladyi hope i didnt shock you by being so frank but i understood you were a breeder of some note she quickly got hold of herself and smiled falsely oh you didnt shock me in the least my lord she replied i was just contemplating what the results of that mating are likely to be splendid bodyguards no doubtbut forgive me for hoping that the stock takes after her looks rather than his she produced another of those low breathy laughs you will recall that i breed for esthetics of course of course he then turned the conversation to something else and eventually the dinner ground its way to its finale he left the ladies as was the custom to conclude their evening together over sweet wines and conversation blessing the custom for allowing him to escape the table before triana she would without a shadow of a doubt try to get at rennati but it wouldnt happen tonight and it wouldnt happen on her terms it would be tomorrowat the time and place that kyrtian had picked the pale pink marble hallway outside lady trianas guestsuite looked kyrtian reflected with no little amusement as if they had planned an ambush for the elven lady in a sense they had rennati waited in a marblepaneled niche close to the door a little farther along behind a second bronze door left just the tiniest bit open lady viridina waited and farther still watching from the end of the hallway behind the paneled door to one of the sittingrooms was kyrtian himself if triana gave the little dancer too much trouble lady viridina would appearand if viridinas presence didnt give rennati a chance to escape he would put in an appearance and claim his slave the doors made no sound as they opened of course and the only clue he had that triana had finally emerged was the soft patter of rennatis footsteps on the heavy carpet my lady i beg your favor rennatis high clear voice with a hint of desperation in it rang down the hallway a little judicious magic allowed him to hear every word as she ap proached the elven lady my lady rennati repeated as she flung herself to her knees beside the waiting triana who had paused beside the open door my lady forgive mei failed youi know i have failed you indeed you have triana said in a level voice the information you gave to me was of little use you were near lord kyrtian only once and that briefly and now he has turned you into a mere breeder which will remove you from the household altogether and occupy your time with things of no interest to me i am not pleased kyrtian peeked through a crack where the door met the frame rennati bent her head trembling with fear the poor child wasnt acting she really was afraid of triana it was terribly brave of her to take this step but it was the only possible way for her to escape trianas toils and both she and kyrtian knew it i had no choice my lady rennati replied humbly i am only a slave i have no control over how i am disposed of hmph kyrtian took another cautious peek triana stood over rennati looking down at the girl with a measure of disgust if youd had an ounce or two more of ambition she shook her head i do not reward incompetence girl a good part of your failure is your own fault you did not make yourself indispensable to lord kyrtian yes my lady rennati couldnt have gotten any lower to the ground without prostrating herself triana prodded at the dancer with her foot youve managed to maneuver yourself into your own punishment fool youll be nothing more than a breeder for the rest of your life and bred to that hideous old man you can expect to be beaten when you dont please him and taken like an animal when you do on the whole i must say i couldnt have contrived anything better as chastisement she laughed a cruel laugh that made even kyrtian shiver i trust hell make you suitably miserable now you have something of mine i believe she put out her hand rennati shaking like a willow in a windstorm pulled the telesonring from her finger and managed to place it in trianas palm triana slipped the ring on her own finger spurned the dancer with her foot pushing her offbalance so that she sprawled clumsily onto the carpet with a final nasty chuckle triana stalked off rennati lay where shed fallen shaking violently until triana was out of sight kyrtian and viridina remained in hiding as well once they were both sure she was gone they both rushed out into the hall only to find that rennati was shaking not with fear or in tears but with the weak laughter of relief kyrtian helped her to her feet and viridina fussed over her for a momenta strange sight that an elven lady seeing to the welfare of a mere human im all right really i am rennati protested at last thank you my lady thank you for being so closebut i am all right i was only afraid that if either of you had to intervene she would sense something wasnt quite right you did wonderfully well young lady kyrtian told her approvingly wonderfully well i couldnt have asked for better i must say that youve shown an ability to playact that i hadnt expected i was afraid i was going to start laughing when she described poor gel rennati told him dimpling and coloring prettily she couldnt have been more wrong about him and its just as well that she doesnt know that its my turn to apologize for putting you through all that embarrassment now and last night he continued and i hope youll forgive me for it only if you she colored more deeply only if you dont take back what you saidabout me and gel my dear child that is between you and gel he exclaimed holding up both hands in mockdefense as both rennati and viridina giggled like a pair of young girls i have nothing to do with it if you have the audacity to collar and tame that wretched man you may have joy of him stifling their laughter in their hands viridina and rennati retreated into viridinas suitefor some womanish reason he had no doubt perhaps to plan the conquest of poor gel ah gel you wretched man you havent a prayer against them whatever it was the important mission had been accomplished triana no longer had a spy in his household and it was vanishingly likely that shed get another in there now he could continue with his own library search and wait for the two lost elvenlords to be found for the council to learn of the new wizards and for the panic to begin triana left that very day and no one least of all kyrtian was sorry to see her leave although lady moth managed to convey the opposite with trianas departure everything went back to normal kyrtian however gave up trying to use rennati and gel as his helpers instead he commandeered a couple of the slaves that had been liberated from the young lords a pair of remarkably intelligent twins bred and trained to be household slaves not handsome enough to be put to front of the house duties they had been wasted both on the menial tasks theyd been assigned and as the fighters that the young lords wanted them to be they quickly learned what he wanted of them and as they had been taught to read and write were soon actually helping him with his hunt for information once he had identified the author of journals that were too late to be of any interest to him the boys could pick through the remaining volumes and eliminate any more by the same author as they shelved these books the task in front of him began to look a bit less daunting meanwhile rennati had evidently taken him at his word she was the aggressor in this courtship and in kyrtians opinion gel might just as well run up the flag of surrender because he hadnt a chance in the world not that he seemed to be unhappy about the prospect but it was certainly an odd thing to see tough old gel wandering about the gardens eyes faintly clouded with bemusement holding a basket for the flowers rennati was selecting to grace the vases of lady moths chambers three days passed then four and there was no sign that the two lost lords had yet been discovered on the one hand kyrtian was perfectly happy with this since it gave him more time among the books on the other hand he grew more anxious with every day that passed for there was no telling what lord kyndreth and the council were up to what they were thinking and perhaps most importantly of all whether triana had been convinced that he was not ambitious for a place on the grand council as a great lord only if she was convinced would she in turn convince kyndreth there was no further sign from the elvenbane either but kyrtian didnt truly expect anything it had been terribly risky for her to come to him it would be better for the next meeting to take place somewhere in the wilderness perhaps while he pursued the false wizards then on the fourth day after triana left came the summons to the teleson that he had been waiting for it took all of his selfcontrol to maintain a curious but calm expression when he greeted lord kyndreths image in the flat glass something entirely unexpected has come up my lord kyndreth said in tones of controlled urgency two minor elvenlords that we thought had somehow been killed on a hunting expedition decades ago have turned up they were found by two of lord cheynars slaves and brought straight to his manor and their storywell its terrifying ancestors they managed to walk all the way from the forest to the estate they must have been exhausted where were they all this time kyrtian asked carefully assuming an expression of concern i know that forest has an evil reputation but how could they have been lost for decades they say that they were held as prisoners by wizards kyndreth continued and the accident of a rockfall in the caves where they were held is what allowed them to escape there is only one problemthe wizards that held them are not the wizards with whom we fought ancestors kyrtian exclaimed falling back a little in feigned shock butthats terrible it is and the council was in an uproar about it kyndreth replied with visible unhappiness we have to find these creatures and eliminate them if they are laired up somewhere within striking distance of cheynars estate then they are too close however few in number they may be kyrtian said firmly i will deal with the matter my lord this is precisely the sort of thing my personal slaves are trained for we will take a small force into the forest to find the place then return with a larger one and wipe them out i knew i could rely on you kyndreth said with evident relief and broke the connection with a laugh kyrtian leapt to his feet feeling very like a racehorse finally let loosenow he could show what he was really made of this might have been what he had been training for all of his life and let kyndreth and the others scheme as they would for he was finally on the right side kyrtians own estate was roughly halfway between moth s property and lord cheynars around the perimeter of the ragged circle defined by the outermost elvenlord estates although it might have been shorter to cut through the heart of elven lands it was quicker to take moths portal to his own property select the men he wanted and go from there to the nearest estate with a portal that he could get access to in this case it was the estate of the late unlamented lord dyran which had eventually wound up in the hands of lord kyndreth dyrans estate bordered on the desert cheynars between dyrans land and the rest of the elvenheld world was in wellwatered hills that ran up to low forested mountains that were equally well watered so much water in fact that the estate spent most of the winter shrouded in grey clouds that drizzled continuously there could not have been a greater contrast in territory but that wasnt the most interesting part the interest ing part was beneath those hills and mountainscaves and a great many of them going home first also allowed him to take rennati back to the estate that took one burden off his mind and would give him an excuse to leave gel as well not that he didnt want gel alongbut this would not be a mission where gels expertise was needed given that he could not be at home he wanted someone he trusted to be there lady lydiell was clever and cunning but she was no soldier if soldiers were needed gel could command as well if not better than kyrtian as for his own troops those who were left were by this time heartily tired of real warfare and ready to go back to the farm field and household positions they had left it was time to take them home tooand by the greatest of good fortune he would be taking all of them home there had been only minor casualties among his own people no deaths at all and those injuries they sustained were neither crippling nor incapacitating that was not by accident or entirely by good fortune alone kyrtians men with their greater expertise in fighting than the young lords conscripts had shown their clear superiority in the field in all ways he was terribly proud of them the point was they werent professional trained fighters they were fanners houseservants herders but they had applied themselves with will and enthusiasm to his training and when called on to use that training they had done so with all the dedication he could have asked for he didnt quite know how to reward them the kind of great feast he usually held for a successful campaign was woefully inadequate as a recompense and as he shepherded the last of his people through moths portal he made a mental note to ask his mother her opinion of all people she surely should have some notion finally there were only the three of them left to crosshimself gel and rennati and as he watched the other two waiting patiently for the portal to clear with gels arm openly and protectively around the apprehensive little dancer he knew with considerable amusement that there was at least one person he had had no difficulty in fitting a reward to there had been a grain of truth in that pompous and incredibly insulting little speech hed made in front of lady triana he really did hope that gel would have a sonor severalto train to take the fathers place at kyrtians side no one could have had a better bodyguardor friendand kyrtian was not looking forward to the day when he would have to tell gel to stand down and let another take his place but like it or not the fact was that unless something happened to him kyrtian would likely be served by gels greatgreatgreatgreatgrandchildren nearimmortality came with its own costs he shook off the melancholy thought and brought his mind back to the present lady lydiell would be very amused he was sure when she realized what had happened between rennati and gel an inveterate matchmaker she had been trying to pair gel off for years shed find the current situation entirely to her liking shell have them tucked up in a little cottage or suite of their own in the manor before the two of them get a chance to turn around go on through you two he said waving at them he turned to moth as they stepped into the utter blackness within the portal are you going to be all right he asked can you keep those idiot children from trying to start the rebellion all over again or somehow getting caught she laughed the day i cant keep an unruly pack of puppies like that under my thumb now that theyve had a good scare is the day you might as well start planning my funeralgames you and your boys showed them that everything theyd won against their fathers was due to their incredible good luck the wizards iron and the great lords incompetence theyre happy enough to be escaping the hounds and i imagine theyll stay that way for some little while he had to smile at that i should have known better than to ask i should be asking them if they think theyll be safe from you indeed you should moth smiled and winked two or three of those lads are rather toothsome and still young enough to train properly im not too old to remarry she grinned as he laughed now get on with you by now poor lydiell is probably wondering if the portals broken down he embraced her then stepped across the threshold as soon as he recovered from the shock of crossing which was always disorienting he saw that his mother had already sorted out the new relationship between gel and rennati and much to gels surprise and bemusement she had taken it all in stride and with considerable aplomband from the sound of things had begun making plans for them without waiting for kyrtian heh i wonder if he expected mother to be shocked or outraged that rennati has managed to capture him he should have known better than thatgiven all the matchmaking shes done all over the estate hes just lucky she never seriously took it into her head to find a woman for him or he d have been tied up long before this our people will expect a weddingceremony and a feast of course she was explaining to a bewildered rennati our gel is a person of great importance here and if we did anything less people would feel cheated well have to have all of the fighters and their families of coursei wonder if we could have the whole thing in the open air i cant think of any building on the estate large enough to fit everyone inside but rennati said feebly looking alarmed oh i know youve no idea what to do child lydiell continued calmly but our people never had their traditions wrenched from them and buried past retrieval they have their priests and their rituals exactly as they did before we came on the scene dont concern yourself with it they know what to do and if you can learn a clever dance you can certainly learn a simple wedding ceremony now this could fit in very nicely with the general homecoming your wedding can be the start of a week of festivities and mother my love kyrtian interrupted her dont forget with all your planning i have to be off with a select crew on lord kyndreths wizardhunt as soon as may be this will have to look as if i consider it to be as urgent as he does so gel tells me lydiell said serenely all the more reason to have the wedding as soon as possible i have been planning these homecoming celebrations for a fortnight and you will be here for at least the first day and night of them and if kyndreth gets impatient i will tell him that you needed the time to select exactly the right group of scouts and hunters kyrtian bowed to the inevitable yes mother he said obediently and beat a hasty retreat to his own suite leaving gel and rennati to face his formidable mother and all her plans alone a cowards ploy and he would surely hear all about it from gel once the sargeant got away but in the meanwhile he can take care of himself at least for a while once rennati gets over being dazed she ii probably join forces with mother the females against the poor helpless male ive never seen a woman that could resist an opportunity for a celebration and a new gown gel wont have a chance but oh the more he thought about it the more he hoped that his own time to wed wouldnt arrive anytime soon i think ill run off and have moth take care of everything ill hide in her library until the very last moment so no one can swarm over me he pushed open the doors to his own rooms and sighed it seemed an age since hed been here and the sight of his own quarters was very welcome but more welcome still was the bathroom the ready tub and the smiling servants waiting to help him he didnt stop for their help he threw off his clothes and plunged into the hot water relaxing completely in the penetrating heat as he had not been able to do since he left much as he loved and trusted lady moth she had all those young lords still lurking on her premises and lady trianas unexpected arrival only proved that even the formidable lady morthena could be surprised by unexpected visitors furthermore she admitted later that she had no notion how many keys to her portal her late husband had handed about it could be many it could be few but the fact was they probably existed and if anyone was likely to ferret those keys out it would be kyndreth triana or aelmarkin as a result he had not really been able to relax even while on her estate and of course while on campaign hed had no such luxuries as this just the thought of all the times hed gone to bed aching and bruised and bathless made this all the more pleasurable it might be a while before i get to enjoy it again although his hunt for the nonexistent wizards was by its very nature a wildgoose chase he would have to conduct it as if it was serious the bare essentials for camping no more than six men and they would have to keep themselves fed off the land as much as possible there would be no hot soaking baths out there in the forests he was however too energetic by nature to relax for too long in a hot bath when he wasnt bonetired and wasnt currently aching and bruised soon enough he was out and dressed and went looking for his fathers notes they were still where he had left them in the library a quick glance through them told him everything he needed to know he sent his bodyservant lynder to find gel just about now gel should be frantic for a way to escape the two females who were planning a wedding around him willhe nillhe sure enough within moments lynder and gel were back lynders eyes dancing with merriment gel looking distinctly harried before everyone gets wrapped up in this festival business i want you to help me pick out six of our trackers for this pseudo wizardhunt he told gel i want men who didnt go out as fighters but who can still be spared its getting close to the first hayharvest and i dont want to leave mother shorthanded even by a trifle i can tell you who without even thinking about it gel replied immediately kar tem shalvan resso halean and noet theyre all the junior foresters they dont help with the harvest and their das can live without em for a bit why so many you plan on actually doing anything in there its dangerous it isnt going to be a pleasure trip kyrtian warned even if the new wizards are a fabrication there are still a lot of deadly creatures in that area and you arent going to be along gels face fell but he also looked resigned i was afraid you were going to decide that he grumbled damn it all kyrtian gel youre a fighter a tactician youre neither a hunter nor a forester kyrtian pointed out youd be of less use to me than one of those boys youll be of more user here to meand motheron the bare chance that aelmarkin tries something while im gone mother is many thingsbut not a soldier gels mouth tightened youre not thinking hed convince kyndreth to put this place under siege im not thinking anything he lied with a straight facebecause that was precisely what he was thinking he didnt trust aelmarkinand he didnt trust kyndreth either maybe he was still useful to the great lordbut maybe he wasnt anymore kyndreth still needs me as long as he thinks theres a tribe of wizards hiding right on our borders im more worried about what aelmarkin might door try but between you and mother with moth to feed you gossip youll see through anything he tries before hes done more than make a tentative probe he clapped gel on the shoulder i am not trying to put you out to stud like my favorite warhorse although i suggest you make that charming little dancer into a very happy wife i am allocating my resources where theyll do the most good i need you and mother here watching for trouble while i go into the forest and wait for the elvenbane to contact me again which she will since the forest is the most logical place for that he rubbed his chin thoughtfully theres one other thingbefore we had to leave moths i was reading some personal journals and something i ran into reminded me of some of fathers notes that he left behind its possible weve been looking for the great portal in the wrong place i think its underground and the area around cheynars estate has a lot in common with the forest our ancestors fled through when they first arrived gel knew exactly what he was hinting those hills are riddled with caves he exclaimed come to think of it if your ancestors found that their portal dropped em into a cave they wouldnt have been displeased about that i wouldnt think coming into a strange world in a protected spot its one possible place to look kyrtian agreed he didnt tell gel the one thing that concerned him deeplythe ancestors had fled the vicinity of the great portal in terror but why that was the very last thing he wanted gel thinking about when he was gone thats why i want your hunters and trackers as long as i have to pretend im hunting for wizards living in caves i have every excuse to check every cave we come across then you dont want hunters and trackersor at least not all hunters and trackers gel said decisively youll need men that can keep all of you fed but youll also need men whore used to clambering around underground instead of kar and tem i want you to take kars brother hobie and your laddy lynder there lynder kyrtian turned to his bodyservant in surprise lynder why lynder because lynder and hobie have been trying to kill themselves climbing down holes in the ground on their spare time ever since they were in their teens gel replied wryly as lynder flushed a brilliant scarlet if youre going to be doing the same i suggest you take people whove had the experience of nearly drowning when a cloudburst outside flooded the cave they were in we got out ahead of the flood lynder protested turning redder we heard it coming and it would be useful if you had a couple of lads whod been stuck in a passage they realized a bit too late was too small for them gel was clearly enjoying himself it wasnt too small originally lynder muttered the rock shifted i can see lynder has plenty of experience kyrtian interrupted trying not to laugh although he also felt very sorry for the poor young man havent you told me time and time again that the best teacher is experience hobie and i have been caveexploring for three years now without a single serious mishap lynder said getting his blushing under control and trying to gather the scattered shards of his shattered dignity and the kinds of minor injuries weve had could happen scouting through a forest or doing some heavy work on the farm he didnt glare at gel who was still clearly amused but kyrtian sensed that he wanted to gel finally took pity on the lad kyrtian i wouldnt have recommended young lynder if i didnt think he could guard your steps as well in his world as i can in mine he said generously and now lynder flushed with pleasure rather than embarrassment kyrtian nodded in that caselynder i want you to get the caveexploring gear together for seven gel and i will take care of the rest of the supplies well need id like everything ready by he thought and impishly decided to tease gel a little more id like to leave tomorrow but gel turned white lynder shook his head gear for seven well need some special climbing equipment and we dont have anything like that here ill have to get straight to the blacksmith and he and his helpers will have to work the rest of today and all tomorrow the rest will take a bit of hunting among the stores but you can have it by the day after tomorrow kyrtian persisted if you dare leave before this wedding folderol gel growled under his breath glowering kyrtian couldnt hold back his laughterand then he had to run for sargeant gel lunged for him and he knew that if gel got his hands on his master the master would wind up in the bathtub again but this time fully clothed they couldnt get away in less than three days after all on the evening of the second day gel and rennati were wed at sunset in an openair ceremony presided over by an old man wearing a long black robe so incredibly dignified was this individual and so full of solemnity kyrtian had a difficult time in recognizing hobies father rand the manors chief stablehand who always had a joke for everyone usually ribald rand first wafted smoke over the couple then while chanting under his breath sprinkled them with water waved a lighted taper around them and blew dust at them then he drew a wobbly circle around all three of them with the pointed end of a staff still droning a chant that kyrtian couldnt make head or tail of he conducted a long ritual that involved an amazing amount of sprinkling of herbs and water and salt on the part of the happy couple a great deal of walking in circles and figureeights and the sharing of bread and salt finally at rands lowvoiced order they held out their conjoined hands and rand bound their hands together then turning to the crowd as the last wink of the sun descended below the horizon and the first stars came out he spread his arms wide behind them hands are bound as hearts are bound two are one he shouted a tremendous cheer arose from the huge crowd come to see the ceremony then of course came the celebration there was a very great deal of wine and beer available there was dancing and willing girls to build up a thirst and all of kyrtians chosen party were young men with hard heads and the usual inability of young men to remember what a hangover felt like during the time that the drink was sliding smoothly down their throats as a consequence none of kyrtians six were good for much on the following day however that was not so bad because that was the day of some of the riskier competitionsthe wrestling the hurling of large objects the game pitting two teams against each other in competition for an inflated bladder with no holds barred nursing headaches and uncertain stomachs it was easy to persuade the six that they should be spectators not participants on the morning of the third day a day devoted to the gentler pursuits and competitions of the womenfolkfootraces targetshooting milking sewing and cooking competitions they were in fine fettle and high spirits and quite ready to go so was their equipment and kyrtian was not going to allow the temptation of another feast dance and drinking soiree incapacitate them all over again by midmorning he had them all lined up at the portal fullyladen with still more of the servants equally burdened lord kyndreth had promised horses on the other side and kyrtian was going to hold him to that promise he sent his party and all of the servants through first and waited for the servants to return before passing through the portal himself there were no farewells this time he had chosen a time when lydiell was busy supervising and judging a contest and as for gelwell he hadnt seen his old friend since the ceremony and he hoped that rennati was teaching him a few of the tricks shed shown him he passed the dark and cold and disorientation of the portal and with a jolt came out on the other side lord kyrtian he shook his head to clear it and forced his eyes to focus the person who had addressed him was a rare creaturean elderly elvenlord whose thinning silver hair and faintlylined face came as something of a shock yes he said im lord kyrtian the elderly gentleman bowed i am lord rathien lord kyndreth directed me to supply whatever you require well that was pleasant i need enough horses to carry all of this lot he said waving at the supplies and equipment heaped on either side of the corridor leading to the portal lord rathien eyed the piles with an experienced glance seven ridingmounts and as many packmules he said with authority you will find the mules can carry more than horses and their tempers are steadier when you camp in the forest tether each horse to a mule before you stake out the line should anything attack the mules will run unfailingly away from danger they will not plunge blindly into further danger and they will stop when pursuit stops he smiled then with great charm i am very fond of mules myself so i see kyrtian smiled back but lord rathien had already turned away and was ordering a set of human slaves to pick up the piled goods and take them to the stables all kyrtian and his party had to do was to follow by noon with the mules loaded horses saddled and a mule tethered behind each rider they were on their way his task completed lord rathien was gone by the time they rode out of the gates kyrtian wondered if he was one of lord kyndreths underlings or was a legacy from lord dyran he was certainly efficientand if he treated the slaves exactly as he did the mules well at least he didnt treat them worse kyrtians own young men had been cautioned as to how to behave once they were off the estate so they had not done anything to arouse rathiens suspicions their tension had been palpable during that time they hadnt dared to speak lest they say something unslavelike or to raise their eyes above kyrtians knees lest their posture or demeanor betray them once they were all on the road however they relaxed sargeant gel told us that we were going down in caves mlord hobie said urging his horse up beside kyrtians as lynder did so on the other side and the rest of the six got in as closely as they could the better to hear what he had to say whys that well you know that were chasing after wizards that dont really exist kyrtian began aye sir better than chasing ones that do replied hobie one of the men in the rear laughed theyre supposedly living in an underground stronghold where were going so well be exploring caves now as it happens i think my father may have been hunting these same caves when he disappeared and im hoping well find some sign of him there the man who had laughed sobered immediately and there were some sympathetic murmurs from all of them yousurely dont expect to find him after all this time do you mlord hobie asked hesitantly kyrtian sighed not after all this time nonot alive at any rate he said sadly but you knowmy claim to the estate is clouded as long as no one knows what became of him and until mother and i find out what really happened he let the sentence trail off hobie dropped his eyes for a moment well mlord lynder said into the silence if theres a sign to be found well find it hobie and i have found a great many strange things in caves such as kyrtian asked to change the subject and cheer the men up again touching as their sympathy was hed far rather have laughter around him than gloom it was after all a long ride to lord cheynars estate and there was no reason to make it under a cloud of depression there was quite enough that was depressing about lord cheynars estate to have suited a dozen funeral processions the manor surrounded by pine forest boasted nothing in the way of magical amenities no magelights to illuminate the darkness no illusions all work done by slaves or mechanical devices the pines were of a variety that kyrtian was unfamiliar withso dark a green as to be nearly black and inhabited by flocks of crows cheynar a taciturn individual with very little magic of his own warmed slightly to kyrtian when the latter congratulated him on some of his mechanical devicesand when kyrtian at darkness made cheerful use of the lanterns rather than showing off by creating his own magelights he warmed still more over dinner and finally came out with something entirely unexpected i knew your father cheynar offered i mean i met him he was here just before he disappeared that electrified kyrtian and he could not conceal his shock what he exclaimed butwhy didnt you why didnt i say something cheynar asked shrewdly i did to lord dyran i suppose he didnt think it important enough to pass it to your lady mother but then he wasnt at all pleased with what your father was hunting the old devices the ancestors brought with them kyrtian was torn between excitement and despair if his mother had known where her husband had last been seen would it have made a difference could they have found him still alive cheynar nodded one of thoseyour father saidwould put those of us with weak magic on a par with those who are stronger he told kyrtian i dont know if lord dyran knew that your father told me at least in part because he saw all the mechanical devices i use around here instead of magic but he might not have said anything to dyran he shrugged and lord dyran was one of the great lords of the council anyway kyrtian sighed and my father and iwell were nothing like the equals of any great lord i doubt that lord dyran even paid any heed to anything father said you know he halfsmiled at cheynar hoping that cheynar would warm a little further and see himself in the same position as kyrtian when were useful were equals at the feasttable but once they dont need us anymore cheynar took the bait probably he just thought that the man was halfcrazed if he even took time for a thought at all cheynar said and with some sympathy but i can tell you this he paused significantly if you are going wizardhunting in those caves youll be walking in the steps of your father because the last time anyone saw himthat was where he was going too one set of items in their packs was immediately useful the moment they entered the forest rain gear kyrtian had never seen so much rain in his life he was glad that hed checked on the climate when arranging for the supplies and oh the advantage of being on equal terms with ones females in an elven household he had not realized that silk could be made so completely waterproof evidently that oftderided womens magic used for flowersculpting had a great many other purposes that the women themselves knew but seldom shared he certainly didnt blame them the lords of creation that elvenlords considered themselves to be would probably greet such innovations as trivial and women kept pent up in their bowers disregarded and discarded as toys themselves could hardly be expected to share such knowledge vol untarily he could well imagine several disgruntled ladies sitting around in their bower contemplating their dripping menfolk and saying to each other with glee well why dont they just stop the rain raincapes with hoods snugged in around their faces coats with an outer waterproofed surface beneath that meant that what could have been a miserable situation was merely interesting provided that one could manage somehow to see past the gloom this was a truly unique forest more waterproofed sheetswhich would later serve as shelters for their three tentscovered the seven packs carried by the pack mules this meant that their supplies and belongings were dry and would stay dry no small consideration when at the end of the day they were going to be able to camp dry too much water was in the long run better than too little this could have been a hunt in the desert and even kyrtian was not entirely sure that magic would be enough to ensure water for everyone grels were the only option in the desert for transportation but neither he nor anyone on his estate knew anything about grels their main problem hereand to some extent in the caveswould be to prevent getting wet and cold with no way to get warm and dry again game was certainly available if not precisely plentiful one would expect large game here and yet the only animals that made an appearance were small game well the advantage of traveling with foresters was that they didnt scorn small game in a futile search for something larger the four foresters quickly traded their heavier bows and arrows for hand crossbows and took careful shots without ever seeming to aim one by one plump little bodies accumulated tied to the cantles and pommels of saddles the rain never stopped it let up from time to time decreasing to a mere drizzle which percolated down through the trees and dripped from every limb every needle then when the rain resumed it obscured everything in the distance far or near reducing visibility to a few horselengths ahead of the lead rider which was not kyrtian he knew very well that he was not a forester that was why he rode in the dead middle of the string with lynder in front of him and hobie behind two of the young foresters ahead and two behind it surprised him a little that an entire train of fourteen animals could make so little noise but the track that they followed which led in the general direction of a purported caveentrance was ankledeep in a layer of pine needles they proceeded at an ambling walk and not just to save the horses up at the head of the string noet rode with his head slightly cocked listening behind him shalvan concentrated on peering through the mist and rain at the rear of the train halean and resso shared the same duties beyond the omnipresent sounds of rain plopping onto their capes into the needlebed trickling down trunks and dripping onto leaves there were other sounds of life that kyrtian took to be good signs that nothing else was stalking them once the crows got used to their presence the birds stopped making alarmcalls and went back to their crowbusiness with only an occasional appearance as if to take note of their progress unexpected showers of droplets heralded the passage of small birds through the branches and little rustles betrayed the passage of those plump little squirrels and rabbits by midafternoon kyrtian knew his men were looking for a place to stop and make camp for the night already there was a change in the quality of light under these trees and his nerves were just a trifle on edge he didnt know why just that there was something odd noet held up a hand and the entire cavalcade stopped now kyrtian knew what had him on edgethe absolute absence of any sound other than the dripping of water even the crows were gone i dont like this noet said in a low voice but one that carried easily in the silence the horses and mules havent noticed anything but but maybe thats the point if this is a hunter resso replied if it works by ambush and stealth should we turn back kyrtian asked yesbut slowly and carefully just turn your horses and mules in place people shalvan and i will become rearguard well stop back at that stream we crossed and try following it for a while with any luck itll lead us to the caves anyway hobie opined one by one they turned their horses and drew the mules behind them the rearmost first shalvan and noet already had their heavy bows out with arrows nocked to the strings and as for kyrtian his fingers tingled with power at any moment he could and would launch a levinbolt into whatever might emerge its out there all right shalvan said grimly as noet turned his horse and mule its up the trailoff to one side in the bushes every so often the bush shakes and from the movement id say that its about the size of a haywain its not moving much though i dont know if thats because its not certain of us or if its territorial he turned his horse as noet stood guard and they moved at the same leisurely pace theyd maintained all along back up the way they had come the back of kyrtians neck prickled what wouldwhatever it wasthink of its prey moving away from it uhoh that was resso now in the lead and the hair on kyrtians head literally stood straight up pacing deliberately towards them wasnot onean entire herd of alicorns their red eyes flashed and the black stallion in the lead tossed his head with its wicked slightly curved spiral horn dont move halean said in a strangled voice kyrtian had no intention of moving one alicorn was dangerous what was a herd they were trapped between a very visible menace an invisible one the alicorn stallion snorted and moved towards them kyrtian wondered what was going on in those narrow heads should he fling a levinbolt at them but if he did what would the thing behind them do and wouldnt their horses spook if he did none of them were wartrained none of them are wartrained mules will run until theres no pursuit the mules are tethered to the horsesand vice versa give your horses free rein and hang on kyrtian ordered feeling that sense of presence and danger at his back increasing just a little and duck your heads on the count of three the alicornstallion pawed the ground and bared its fangs one two three on the count of three kyrtian fired a kind of levinbolt straight up over their heads it exploded in a blinding flash and a violent boom that actually shattered the nearby limbs of trees the horses as kyrtian had hoped boltedand so did the alicorns the horses shot forward in the direction they had been facing along the game trail the alicorns foe and prey forgotten scattered in all directions some off into the woods to either side of the trail some turning and fleeing and three following the stallion charging headdown towards them at the last moment the alicorns veered a little to the left and the hysterical horses to the right kyrtian hung onto his mount with every bit of strength that arms and legs possessed ducking low along its neck to keep from being knocked out of his saddle by lowhanging boughs hooves thundered all around him even if the horses werent sticking to the gametrail they were at least staying together behind him he heard a roar and the battlescream of an alicorn but whatever was going on would have to remain a mystery his heart raced his hands and legs ached and he clenched his teeth he couldnt see what was happening or where they were going his mounts mane lashed his face until his eyes watered then sooner than hed thought he felt the horse beginning to slow felt a weight tugging at the leadrein fastened to the saddle the horse didnt like it he tried to surge forward the mule wasnt having any gradually the mule won the headlong gallop slowed to a canter a trot and finally the horses sides heaving and sweat pouring from his neck and shoulders a walk kyrtian took up the slack in the reins and brought his mount to a stop and looked around the rain had slackened again and through the mizzle he counted his men scattered among the trees and quickly came up with the right number of riders and pack mules ancestors he breathed in profoundest relief the men said nothing they simply guided their weary beasts back towards him until once again they formed a coherent group everyone all right he asked as their horses stood with heads hanging and flanks afoam with sweat only the mules looked unperturbed ive been worse replied noet laconically gonna kill whoever designed this saddle with a pommel right where it dont belong though noet did look a little pale and in a certain amount of pain kyrtian winced and hastily changed the subject does anyone know where we are we bolted in the general direction of where we wanted to go reported shalvan so the stream should still be that way he pointed with his chin rather than his hand we might as well get on with it the horses arent going to be the better for standing in the cold and rain and theyre going to need water after this once again they formed up but this time not in single file since they werent following a trail halean rode on the right flank and resso on the left and not too much later they came to the stream much to everyones relief there wasnt much time before nightfall and with the overcast skies and the forest all around darkness would come soon they quickly made camp with kyrtian tending to the firemaking chores they pitched their three tents in a triangle with the fire in the center once the tents were pitched and resso took up the cooking the rest gathered more firewood while kyrtian ran a circle of magelights around the tents to stand between them and whatever was in the woods or across the stream as firewood was brought in he stacked it near enough to the fire that it stood a decent chance of drying out some before it was used the last thing he did was to run a string hung with small bells around the trunks of trees beyond the glow of the magelight at about ankleheight anything that brushed against that string would set the bells jingling do you think we need to worry about something coming in from above he asked noet with a frown of concern noet glanced up not through branches that thick he replied i wouldnt think anyway darkness as kyrtian had anticipated came quickly they tethered the horsesand tethered the mules to the horses within the circle of magelight the rain actually stopped once darkness fell and as they gathered around their fire kyrtian felt their mutual fear of what lurked outside that magic circle drawing them all together despite rank and race resso had managed to grill the days catch tastily with a minimum of burning skewered on twigs over the fire with that and journeycake and sweet water from the stream at their backs they made a satisfying meal they had thrown the bones into the fire and were ready to divide the night into watches when a voice from the darkness saluted them hello the camp kyrtian knew that voice and had been hoping to hear it he stood up eagerly and waved in the direction from which it had come the elvenbane walked calmly into the magelight circle without tripping over the line of bells well met lord kyrtian good idea those bells she remarked cheerfully as she joined them beside the fire and offered kyrtian her hand today she was wearing a pair of breeches and a tunic of something glittering and blue covered with jewellike scales a wickedlooking knife strapped over it her abundant auburn hair had been bound back at the nape of her neck in a severe knot the men were staring at this unexpected visitor with their mouths dropping wide open gentlemen kyrtian said solemnly firmly repressing the urge to laugh at them as he accepted lashanas hand may i present to you lashana also known as the elvenbane if he had set off another of those explosive levinbolts in their midst he couldnt have gotten a more interesting reaction noet practically choked hobie and shalvan let out involuntary whoops of surprise resso leapt to his feet wearing an expression of such utter shock that kyrtian would not have been surprised to see him faint dead away in the next moment only lynder managed to retain his composure he got to his feet gathered his young dignity about him and took the hand that kyrtian relinquished my lady this is an honor and a privilege he replied bowing over the hand before releasing it oh pish she said blushing a little but clearly pleased didnt lord kyrtian tell you that id be intercepting you out here lord kyrtian didnt know you would he only hoped you would kyrtian replied for himself wont you join us how she had gotten there how long she had been out in the woods watching them he didnt know and truth to tell it didnt matter as his men took their seats again and lashana settled easily among them it was very clear why this young lady wizard had become a leader she drew all eyes towards her in a way that had nothing to do with her looks or her sex well heres what i can tell you she began wethe wizardshave got watchers on your estate my lord and that of lady morthena if anything should threaten them well know and well be able to evacuate as many or as few people need to be gotten out she dimpled and may i say that is quite a celebration your people are putting on id like to ask your mother if she would organize one for us some day when things aremore stable kyrtian felt a great weight lift from his shoulders but lashanas next words made him tense again a certain lady triana she arched her brow at him and he nodded grimly his acknowledgement that he knew the lady paid another very short visit to lady morthena after you left she claimed that she wished to consult lady morthenas favorite library and indeed she left again within a few hours she arrived and departed by means of a temporary gate set up just outside the ladys estate i dont suppose you can cast any light on what she was looking for kyrtian shook his head reluctantly i havent a clue but knowing triana it cant be for anyones good but her own lashana snorted believe me i know ive hadsome experience of the lady myself my condolences that response startled a smile from her the armyminus your contribution of troopshas moved nearer to the tradecity of prethon where its easier to supply im assuming that in the absence of an actual place to put them permanently thats where theyll stay camped just outside the city walls lashanas green eyes twinkled which is of course precisely where wed like them as far from our new citadel as possible which was why we suggested this place as the location of the imaginary wizards even if they decided you werent moving fast enough for them this is miserable country to try and do any hunting of invisible people in and the place is absolutely hollow with caves you could spend a century trying to hunt through them all actuallyi wanted to ask you about that lashana kyrtian said hesitantly do you have the time to hear some history when she nodded he launched into the storyas he had puzzled it outof the ancestors arrival in this world and followed it with the more personal tale of his fathers own interest in that arrival and the things that might have been left behind so the last place where he was doing research before he disappeared was lady moths libraryand that was where i found some personal journals that gave descriptions that sounded like this area he waved his hand at the dripping forest beyond the camp you must admit that its pretty distinctive and the very few passages that described the crossing made me think that the ancestors might have come out into a cave and not aboveground as everyone has always assumed then when we staged at lord cheynars he concluded triumphantly lord cheynar admitted that my father had gone off into these forests and that he was probably the last elvenlord to see my father alive lashana pursed her lips thoughtfully thatthats interesting you know i discovered that wizards at least can use gemstones to help concentrate and amplify their powers i dont know if theyll work for elvenlords that way but it stands to reason that if our powers can be amplified by something so can yours i cant see any other way that the ancestors could have built the things that they did he admitted she tilted her head to the side its a very good thing that i trust you lord kyrtian she said in a measured tone otherwise i dont think i could allow you to leave these woods alive lynder leapt to his feet his hand on his daggerhilt and the others werent far behind lashana appeared unconcerned and she probably has good reason to be shed be a fool to have come here alone and no matter what the elvenbane is no one has ever suspected her of being a fool sit down all of you he said mildly dont you realize what a horrible menace would be let loose in the world if someone like aelmarkin got his hands on a way to make himself as strong as lord kyndreth shes only speaking sense she made a little gesture of thanks in his direction now theres one other thing id like to show you something my people will shortly be handing out to moths and yours among others then distributing covertly among the fieldslaves she held out a little object shaped rather like an open clamshell of a dull grey metal he started to reach for it and she hastily pulled it back dont touch it lord kyrtian she warned at least not with your bare hand thats what you call death metalforged iron he hastily drew back his fingers hed touched unprotected steel before in the shape of one of the iron collars that moths own slaves wore under their pseudoslave collars and it had burned him like acid he was in no hurry to repeat the experience i brought an active slavecollar with me to show you what it does she continued watchwith your magicsenses she took out a leather slavecollar set with a cloudy beryl which was indeed active she fitted the back half of the clamshell de vice behind the beryl then snapped the top half over it and nipped a catch to squeeze it closed and lock it the elfstone went dead to his senses he looked at her hand with the dullgrey object locked around what had been an active device for the complete control of a slave dumbfounded then he looked up into her knowing eyes ancestors he breathed youve done it youve found a waysnap one of those over a collarstone and you can cut the collar right off without hurting the slave or leave the collar on it wont matter and any magic that an overseer flings at a fleeing slave will simply misfire she pointed out barely concealing her glee we have the iron we have the craftsmen and we have the ways to get these into the hands of the slaves within months your young lords and my wizards will be the last things that the great lords will be worrying about slave revolts murmured shalvan wonderingly all over the estates lashana agreed which is why im here with you every moment of time that you can buy us with your wizardhunting will enable us to make that many more of these devices and bring the moment of freedom for all humans that much closer at which point my lord lynder pointed out diffidently our people will also be the very last thing that the great lords will be worrying about except thatif you and yours can pull this off lashana he bared his teeth in a feral grin the recollection of the stories hed heard from the mistreated slaves sheltering with moth fresh in his mind you may consider my estate to be the training ground for a new human army he held out his hand she clasped it joyfully as his men made the sounds of subdued cheeringeven now they didnt want to arouse the attention of things that might be out there in the darkness lord kyrtian she seemed to be searching for words then gave up altogether and just shook her head her face radiant with smiles thank youseems inadequate its early days yet he warned as the men settled down although he could not help but feel a little intoxicated with the heady intellectual wine she had just poured for him weve a long way to go so we have she sobered as well and started to stow the iron device and the collar in her beltpouch then evidently thought better of it and handed it to lynder here if youve got crafters and a source of death metal you might want to start duplicating these yourself lynder nodded and stowed the device away nowabout the caves and your fatheri think i might be able to help narrow your search a little you see ive run these hills myself lashana then began a tale of her own about the time when she a mere child then and not yet the elvenbane had rescued a band of human childrenwith human magic who were going to be culled by lord trevess overseer lord treveswould that be lady viridinas lord moths friend what an odd coincidence lashana had helped them escape and flee into these very hillsand by another odd coincidence had run into the infamous young lord valyn fleeing with his wizardling halfbrother and looking for wizards to protect them both the story was an absorbing one and lashana told it well he could see in his minds eye the huddle of frightened children the drenched and miserable young valyn and the equally miserable mero she described the strange monsters they had encountered one of which sounded eerily familiar i think we nearly ran into one of thoseinvisible lurking things back there noet said thoughtfully and described being trapped between it and the alicorn herd and how kyrtian had solved the situation which is why hes the general and we arent lynder put in as lashana shook her head in amazed admiration that certainly sounds like one of themwell as you move deeper into the hills more or less in that direction she pointed and dont worry we can guide you tomorrowthe wierdlings get thicker and odder now suppose that this portal of yours isnt entirely closed ive heard from sheyrena and lorryn that your ancestors left a pretty nasty place to come here she looked at him with speculation he nodded if the portal isnt quite closed and shut down yes things could slip over when enough residual power built up to let the portal open for a moment and what came over would be very unpleasant and the area nearest where they were coming through she prompted would be the place nearest the portal of course he felt another burst of elationbut then worry that would make it that much more dangerous im not sure i should ask you fellows to share in something like thisits pretty certain that father isdead there hed said it it couldnt be unsaid so looking for what became of him is really only my concern balderdash begging your pardon my lord lynder exclaimed your father and his father and his father before him are the ones that allowed us to grow up in freedom its as much our concern as yours and my people haveways of dealing with most of these creatures or getting you around them lashana added weve both got magic you know and mines enough different from yours that theyll combine well id be pleased to help you out here its settled then shalvan said as the rest of his men nodded once again kyrtian felt a surge of emotionspride gratitude a touch of embarrassment but most of all the warmth of knowing that they would support him and they knew that he would support them through anything and a different kind of warmth of discovering an unexpected friend and comrade in the woman called the elvenbane who was so very different and so very much more than he had ever imagined her to be then in the morning he made it a question she laughed and stood up in the morning you can expect meand a friend she promised and until then sleep well and dont worry youre being guarded so get a good nights sleep and with that she walked off into the darkness and managed again not to trip over the bells my lord said shalvan looking after her with undisguised admiration begging your pardon myself but that is one fine woman not to my taste he added hastily but one fine woman yes she is kyrtian agreed and not to my taste either but i hope she finds a man who deserves her assuming thats what she wants i will make no assumptions about anything the elvenbane might want that startled a laugh out of them and on that note they took to their tents and to bed knowing that the morrow would begin an entirely new and stranger quest than they had ever imagined triana set her jaw grimly as she paced in and out of the bars of sunlight pouring through the windows of her solara traditional part of the bower where she seldom spent any time why bother when she was the mistress of the entire manse it looked as if she was going to have to leave her domain for a short but distinctly uncomfortable quest of all the things she would have preferred not to do this was going to be right on the top of the list she did not enjoy the outdoors she loathed having to camp without proper amenities and she despised rain damp drizzle and cold but she was going to have to endure all of that because where she was going and what she needed to do required secrecy her skirts swished around her ankles with a hissing sound she hated this idea but she couldnt trust aelmarkin she couldnt trust him to be any fitter for trailing someone in the savage forest than she and she was pretty certain he would try to keep whatever he found all to himself she had failed in her attempt to subvert his boring cousin for nowshe was grateful that she hadnt put any term on the bet with aelmarkinbut kyrtians ongoing success was making aelmarkin impatient not that she cared whether she lost the bet it wouldnt be all that difficult to train one stupid slave for aelmarkins use no the thing itself had become a challenge an obsession she would not be beaten not in this not when it was only her own skill and wit that stood between her and failure for once she didnt have to rely on anyone else it hadnt taken long in a conversation via teleson with lord kyndreth to discover what kyrtian was up to and where he was goingopenly that was the key kyrtian might be pompous might be deadly dull but after his decisive victory over the young lords no one would ever claim that he was stupid she kicked the train of her skirt out of her way impatiently as she turned no he wasnt stupid and just because he was dull that didnt mean he wasnt capable of keeping some things to himself triana had her own ideas of what else might be going on when a quick check with lord kyndreth confirmed that kyrtian was planning on a new expedition at the behest of the council what hadnt made any sense was why he would have been interested in the caves beneath those hills before that second batch of wizards made an appearance because he had been she knew it because she knew some of the questions hed been asking and some of the maps and books hed been requesting before the two mindaddled captives had appeared in lord cheynars forest it hadnt made any sense that is until she visited morthena again determined what hed been doing there in the first place and ferreted out just what books hed been looking at the two slaves who had been helping him were no challenge to her within moments she had them eagerly pulling volumes down for her perusal now she knew and she was perhaps better than any other elvenlord equipped to figure out what kyrtians ulterior motives were there were her own familial traditions of the cross ing and journals she had idly leafed through in moments of boredom putting kyrtians sudden fascination with the journals in morthenas library together with his fathers lifelong obsession with finding the gate and she knew she knew that he expected to find at long last some trace of his father but as important given lord kyrtians newfound importance as a military leader to the great lords were the weapons supposedly left behind as useless with those weapons lord kyrtian would not need an army to impose the will of the great lords with those weapons he could become a great lord himself perhaps more than that perhapstheir first king perhaps that dull exterior might conceal a great deal of ambition unless someone else got there at the same time someone who could bring accurate information back tosaylord kyndreth or someone who could use that information for herself triana liked to keep her plans fluid which was why her slaves were putting together the gear that she and two male slavesmen who knew how to hunt and trackwould take through the nearest gate and on to the thricebedamned rainsoaked forest that lord cheynars estate bordered lord cheynar did not approve of triana no matter she didnt need his approval and she didnt need his help she didnt even need to get onto his lands she had only to journey to his estate and follow the fences and walls around it entering the forest where she pleased her men were good enough to find kyrtians track and follow it even if that meant she did have to camp in a wretched forest in the constant rain just because triana loved her comforts that didnt mean she wasnt perfectly prepared to sacrifice them without hesitation for the right incentive without hesitation not without complaint she kicked savagely at her train aelmarkin brooded over the injustice of the world from the comfort of a favorite lounge staring at a delicate stone sculpture of a dancer as if it had offended him personally aelmarkin did not trust his cousin there was more much more to this business of pursuing stupid wizards in a halfinaccessible forest than appeared on the surface kyrtian might be dull he might be obsessive but he wasnt stupid aelmarkin traced a circle in the upholstery with his fingernail kyrtian was not going on what aelmarkin would consider a military expedition he wasnt taking any other elvenlords with him nor was he taking a very large party in fact he wasnt taking any slaves other than those from his own household either he was ridiculously sure of himself or or he thought there was something in that forest that he could use for himself what could it be there had to be something there was no reason to take that sort of risk unless there was a powerful reason for it something to do with the wizards themselves aelmarkin hadnt heard anything that made them sound different from the ones that had already been driven out into the wilderness quite to the contrary in fact it seemed very much as if they were fewer except except that they also had that curious ability to nullify magic that the young lords had somehow acquired aelmarkin slapped the arm of his lounge with a feeling of angry triumph of course that was it so far no one had managed to catch any of the ringleaders so no one knew just what the trick wasbut if kyrtian could capture a wizard and get the answer that way hed be in a position to demand and get anything he wanted from the council including a council seat even if there were no vacancies and if that happenedaelmarkins chances of getting the estate dropped to less than zero for all their bickering no council member had ever been known to back a move to oust another council member from his lands position or seat and not just because it wasnt done they guarded their primacy jealously and when an outsider threatened one he threatened all and they closed ranks against him for a moment aelmarkin despaired and began pounding the arm of his lounge with frustrated fury he broke the underlying wooden frame with a crack but his anger didnt ease until the arm of the lounge sagged its structure reduced to fragments finally his temper wore out and he was able to think clearly he left his study and went out into his gardens to continue thinking the sky was overcast but the pall over his spirit was darker than the grey sky he had to think as he paced his feet making no noise on the velvety sod of the paths he ignored the murmur of fountains and artificial waterfalls he passed first this all might come to nothing but he didnt dare to take that chance kyrtian was too good at finding what he wanted to find persistentobstinately persistent second it was just barely possible that kyrtian would fail either he wouldnt find a wizard or he wouldnt be able to take one captive aelmarkin thought sourly that this was not something he should count on kyrtians luck had been disgustingly good persistence and good luck it was damnably unfair thirdthird it hit him blinding as a ray of sun lancing through the clouds he hadnt ever expected duplicity out of kyrtianbut he hadnt expected brilliance either what if all of this was a doublegame what if kyrtian planned not to capture a wizard but to treat with them what if he intended to ally with them ridiculous thought of course butit stopped him in his tracks both because of the audacity of it and the possibilities the mere idea opened up if the great lords thought that was what kyrtian had in mind their support of him would not only collapse theyd turn on him rightly so of course treason didnt even begin to cover it well there was only one way to find out and that was to follow kyrtian himself even if kyrtian didnt mean treason perhaps the appearance of treason could be manufactured for the first time in many days aelmarkins spirits rose he even laughed out loud at the thought his mind working busily the first thing of course would be to follow kyrtian and see if against all probability kyrtian really was a traitor it would be best not to have to manufacture anything out of whole cloth if he could find even the appearance of duplicity he could build on that this of course meant that he could not trust this to anyone else least of all lady triana he curled his lip in contempt trying to imagine lady triana actually exerting herself enough to follow kyrtian as far as cheynars much less entrust herself to the privations of rough camping she couldnt be bothered to visit her own gardens without a dozen slaves a pavilion and cushions no matter this wasnt something to be shared with anyone and the saying was after all that if you wanted to be sure of something you had better see to it yourself besides there was one last possibility one that he doubted even triana as ruthless as she was would think of he could arrange a little accident to befall kyrtian especially if he had left that bodyguard of his behind oh yes now he had it kyrtian would not leave that forest as he had entered it when he came out it would either be as a prisoner or in a shroud for the first time that day he smiled and the slave walking patiently and invisibly behind him to supply whatever the master needed shuddered at the sight of that smile caellach gwain paced the uneven stone floor of his miserable excuse for a room brow furrowed a banked fire of anger in his gut that hadnt diminished in the least in the time since that wretched girl had debated him in front of the entire population of the citadel how had he let himself get drawn into that a disaster a total disaster and he still couldnt see where it had all gone so horribly wrong hed only told everyone exactly the truth at the time it had seemed like a stroke of the purest luck the brat had no experience at making speeches and she didnt know how to exude the confident authority that he certainly could and over and above all of that he had been the one in the right miserable creature how had she managed it how when he had spoken nothing that was not true had she managed to turn virtually everyone in the citadel against him by the time he realized that every word he spoke was turning more people away from him it had been too late he kicked a shoe out of his path with a savage wish that it was the rear end of one of his socalled friends who had deserted him like the cowards that they were as a consequence of that debate he had been left utterly completely without servants no one would lift a finger to so much as keep him from tripping over an obstacle even the humans even the human children ignored any command he gave them if he wanted to eat rather than enjoying a meal in quiet dignity in his room alone he had to trudge up to the cavern used as a common dining hall sit down at one of the common benches wherever he could find a place and serve himself from a common pot there could not possibly be anything more degrading than thata regular punishment thrice daily how he hated it he didnt know what was worse having to starve himself until the last moment and content himself with whatever the rest had left him so that he could sit at a bench alone or braving the crowd to get something edible but having to bear the snickers and the way people ostentatiously spread themselves out so as to leave no room at their tables for him at least they were still permitting him to eat there were a growing number of loud remarks every time he appeared that there should be a rule in the new citadel about having to do some work if you wanted to eat ingrates hed show them if they forbade him meals hed go back to the old ways and steal his own food by magic from the elvenlords stores and to the netherworld with lashanas stupid treaty that would show them at least hed have something decent then real cheese real bread ham and sausage hah if he even filched food from the kitchens he could have anything he liked he thought sourly of his last meal harshlyflavored goatcheese stringy mutton and not much of it some nasty mess of wild greens and bread made with coarselyground flour heavy and dark if they wanted him punished die quality of the food around here was punishment enough how he longed for the good things filched from the elvenlords the delicatelysmoked meats the fine cheeses sweet butter and clotted cream the cakes made with proper flour and sweetened with white sugar his mouth watered at the mere thought of them he glared at the fire in his fireplacefortunately for him he had secured this room before his current disgrace so at least it had a fireplace if you wanted to call a mere alcove in the rock wall with an opentopped shaft punched up to the surface with draconic rockmagic a fireplace when it rained up above water dripped down into the fire and when the wind blew wrong it drove the smoke back down into his room right now it was raining and drops sizzled and spat in the flames threatening to put them out if he wanted a fire he now had to gather the wood himself and if he didnt want the plaguey thing clogged with ash he had to sweep it out and dispose of the ashes himself at least he was putting some things over on them all he knew very well when firewood was delivered to other rooms he just helped himself when the occupants were out and as for the ashes well he didnt sweep them any farther away than the hall and serve them all right they could either sweep them up themselves or trample them everywhere he didnt care it had finally come down to this a job hed spent most of the day on until the anger in his heart started to interfere with his scrying spell spying with his own magic on the wizardling children teaching his former cronies the magics that they used to transport themselves without harm and magnify their own powers so that he could learn to use those magics without having to humiliate himself further and he had to have those lessons because he had no choice if he wanted something he had to obtain it himself and he didnt have the power he needed alone and every day new humiliations were piled atop the old no one appeared to clean his quarters and he he had to either do it himself or find something one of the wretched children wanted and use it to bribe the little beast to do the work and of course what they wanted was never some useless trinket of his own or something he could just go and appropriate from the stores oh noit was always something difficult and usually something he had to use his own powers to fetch from the old citadel it made him so angry he could hardly think for hours afterwards he longed for the days when he could drop something on the floor in the supreme confidence that whatever it was would be whisked off immediately to be discarded put away or cleaned as the case might be and it was all the fault of that overweening female she was up to something too no good of course that went without saying he could tell that there was something in the air something clandestine going on from the way she acted from the way that lover of hers acted hed felt the transportation spell being triggered more times than it should have been of late now that he knew how to recognize it a noisy magic that nothing subtle about it and oh so typical of a female to use something that only drew attention to the caster he knew how to use it himself now of course no thanks to anyones effort but his own hed gone back to the old citadel in person to rummage through not only his own quarters but the rooms of as many other people as he could before he grew too tired and hungry to stay there any longer after all if you didnt know or remember what was in a particular place you couldnt bring it back by magic unless you did some fairly painstaking scrying hed piled what he wanted in his room when he could and hed made plenty of notes on what he couldnt pick up that he wanted in other rooms he was getting more possessions together now besides the armload of things hed brought back with him so he knew quite enough about the transportation spell to recognize it and there was no doubt in his mind that it was being used a great deal by lashana herself of late and for what there was no need to use it to bring living things here anymore now that they had flocks of sheep and goats and even cattle you could bring anything you wanted here quietly with the old magics that the wizards had always used before to steal what they wanted right out from beneath the noses of the elvenlords in factthat peculiar discordant feeling in the back of his skull signaled that someone within the citadel had used that particular magic again it had to be lashana and in no way could it be for anyones good except that selfish brats but no one no one would believe a single word he said against her not their dear elvenbane the person who had brought them the dragons treacherous sneaky beasts whose minds could shift as easily as their shapes the trader clans untrustworthy wild human barbarians and the iron people folly to put faith in any people who were not only wild human barbarians but who had their own defenses against the elvenlords and didnt need allies everyone so easily forgot that it was because of lashana that they had needed those allies and needed to leave their comfortable easy life in the old citadel in the first place she was up to something he knew it he could taste it she was up to something and it could only mean new trouble for everyone else if only he could find out about it before everything fell apartif he could catch her at some folly and prove she was up to something that would only drag everyone here into some new danger theyd all believe him again that was itthat was it he kicked another shoe from his path but this time with a triumphant cackle of laughter that would serve the brat her just desserts hed use her own fancy magics to spy on her and find out exactly where she was goingthen hed use more of them to find out what she was doing hed catch her redhanded and then hed haul her back to the citadel and make her confess in front of everyone oh it would serve her right for her own magic to be used against her he turned abruptly and rummaged through the litter on his desk for the piece of smokequartz that served him for a magnifier of his power then cleared a space and concentrated on the scrying spell lashana didnt discover everything about magic after all she hadnt been the one to learn that in scrying you didnt have to look for a place you knew or even a personjust a particular object or kind of object that was how they filched provisions from the elvenlords back in the good old days so rather than look for lashanabecause she might be alerted if she sensed someone scrying for herhe looked for an object something she always wore a dragonskin belt made from the shed hide of her socalled foster brother and unique in that it had been dulled with dye so that it didnt catch the eye the way the brilliantly colored skin normally did when he found it he would find herthen he would study where she was carefullyvery carefully then the next time she left he would follow a little behind hed find out where she was going and what she was doing and the moment that he found out her secret he closed his hand into a fist and smiled triana lay on her stomach on the cold hard ground beneath a bush peering down at an encampment in the tiny valley below her water dripped down on the hood of her cloak from the branches above her and although the cloak itself was waterproof mist permeated even the cleverlymagicked fabric somewhat it was not a comfortable position but her sheer astonishment at the sight that lay beneath her allowed her to ignore her discomfort there was a campsite down there in the mizzle with six or eight standing figures putting the place to rights and one sitting figure it was the seated one that had her attention you see my lady murmured the human tracker in trianas ear it is as i told you there is the elvenlord you wished to find well it was an elvenlord all right but it was not the one she had intended to find not that the tracker could be blamed in this case he didnt know what lord kyrtian looked like especially at a distance he couldnt know that kyrtian the fool would never have sat back and watched while his slaves put up a camp but what in the name of all the ancestors had gotten aelmarkin to stir his lazy behind and come out to this howling wilderness she was rather pleased to see that he didnt look very happy hunched over elbows on knees even from here she could see his frown ancestors she could feel his frown his slaves were trying to light a fire and not having a lot of success with the wet wood he slumped on a stool beneath the shelter of his tent watching them she couldnt tell what he was thinking from here but a moment later he pointed his finger at the pile of wood and it roared up causing his slaves to leap back lest they be scorched could it be that he too was following kyrtian and without ever bothering to inform her she ground her teeth in a sudden flare of temper the nerve of him how dare he but just as quickly the temper subsided because she couldnt honestly sustain it hadnt she expected this and had she bothered to tell him what she was planning of course not so why be angry with him when she was doing the same thing and although to her this was just a wager to him it was a great deal more than that enough to force him into a place that was as alien and uncomfortable to him as it was to her well if he was following kyrtian she would just follow him it would save her a great deal of work for he was by no means as woodswise as his cousin nor were his men only if he began to flounder would she have her men strike out on their own meanwhile kyrtian was bound to go underground eventually he had to look for wizards and he wanted to look for the great portal and both would be in caves if the caves were as extensive as rumor painted them it would be childs play to get ahead of aelmarkin youve done well she whispered back to the slave who beamed at her the smile of pride transforming an otherwise unhandsome face watch them i will send kartar to you when they leave you both follow send kartar back to fetch us to where they camp next my lady the slave bowed he was a hard man as were the others she had with her foresttrackers all they were used to the roughest of conditions he was outfitted for the forest in tough canvas sturdy boots and a waterproof hooded tunic she wore the same with modificationsan additional waterproof cloak and her clothing made of materials that were just as tough but softer to the skin from the look of it aelmarkin had taken no such precautions and she smiled grimly as she eased her way out from under the cover of the bush and back down the other side of the hill where another of her slaves awaited her he led her silently down a tangle of deertrails only the ancestors knew how he was finding his way and she didnt worry about it that was his job and hed been trained very very well for it she did wish however that the need for stealth had not required the horses be tied up quite so far from aelmarkins camp the thing about deertrails was that the deer didnt care a bit if there were branches stretched across the path or roots to trip up the unwary it was dusk by the time she and her escort rode into a camp that was thanks to her good sense in picking the right sort of slaves for this job in much better state than aelmarkins there was a very small fire burning beneath a clever shelter of branches that not only shielded it from most of the omnipresent rain but dissipated the smoke rising from it so there would be no plume above the trees to betray their presence good men she was glad that she had bought them from lord kyndreth once shed learned they were not only foresters but had been trained to serve as warscouts they were efficient unobtrusive quietthey already knew how to work together as a team and they didnt need constant supervision and they already knew their reward could be very great indeed if they served her well shed given them a taste of it there was a time for the lash and a time for the velvet glove and when you needed someones utmost effort in a skill the velvet glove was the only sensible choice besides they werent bad looking any of them although they were craggy and roughhewnand they were a pleasant change from her usual pretty toys so despite being chilled and damp she bestowed praise all around and made sure kartar was wellprovisioned as well as wellfed before he set off to join his fellow tracker to keep watch over aelmarkins camp dusk lingered for a long time out here and kartar had a clear trail to follow hed be in place by dark in spite of her dislike for this whole situation things were becoming interesting definitely interesting she smiled again as she accepted a plate of slightlycharred meat from one of the slaves and retired with it into the privacy of her tiny tent she might never forgive kyrtian if it turned out he had led her out here on some idiotic wildgoose chase but if he hadnt if he hadnt this might prove to be the best opportunity for upsetting the balance of power among the great lords that had come along in a while and there was always one other possibility she could pursueone which given the circumstances could provide a lot of satisfaction even if this was a wildgoose chase if aelmarkin hadnt told her where he was going and what he was up to he probably hadnt told anyone else except possibly cheynar and then it wouldnt have been much everyone knew these were dangerous forests her foresttrackers had been trained for war his hadnt and no one knew that she was in these hills as well so if he and his men justdisappearedno one would be surprised nor was it likely that anyone would come looking for him once cheynar reported where hed gone she wouldnt win her betbut she wouldnt lose it either and it just might be worth violating every law and compact the great lords had sworn just to see his face when she slit his throat this was the darkest forest kyrtian had ever had the misfortune of camping in he found himself wondering as he kept half of his concentration on the conversation around the fire and the other half on the sounds out in the woods beyond the camp if the overcast skies here ever lifted surely they had to at some point it couldnt rain all the time could it and yet there hadnt been so much as an hour since theyd entered the place when it hadnt at least misted and it was a good thing that he and his men werent depending on that old saw of finding north by looking for moss on a tree trunk because moss grew everywhere thick as a carpet in most places if ever there was a spot meant by nature for ambushes this was it so far theyd managed to avoid any more of those invisible whatevertheyweres but the very nature of the gloomladen landscape had his whole group edgy the snap of a twig brought kyrtian and everyone in his camp to instant alertness the whistle of a skylark came out of the darkness and they all relaxed again a moment later shana and a young male wizard walked into the circle of light cast by the fire the omnipresent mist sparkling like gems on the edges of their hoods i dont know how you do thatgetting past my sentries kyrtian complained goodnaturedly i hope no one else can only humans that have their special magic dragons and wizards shana told him grinning as she settled down on a bit of log that one of the men rolled to the fire for her speaking of whichthis is my fosterbrother keman i am pleased to make your acquaintance kyrtian said politely but warily so youre another wizard then ah actually im not the young man said diffidently with a glance at the elvenbane shana thinks its time you were ah if youre going to trust us we have to give you a reason shana said briskly ive already talked this over with the other leaders and they think its time for you to be entrusted with the biggest secret we have whichwould be what exactly kyrtian replied wishing she would just get straight to whatever she was going to say first just indulge me and do whatever it is that you normally do to dispel an illusion or a glamor keman isnt exactly what he seems shana said and there was a certaintone in her voice that made him look at her with suspicion for a moment just what was she up to anyway was this foster brother of hers fully elvenor perhaps human no if he was human there would be no need for all this secrecy and fiddling about but it was obvious that he wasnt going to get any further information out of the woman unless he did as she asked so with a sigh he gathered threads of magic and wove them into a net casting it over the two of them just for good measure he might as well see if the elvenbane herself was under a glamor nothing happened the two of them remained exactly as they had been when they walked into the firelight now kyrtian was puzzled had the magic been countered it couldnt have been deflected hed have seen that could they have absorbed it then negated it but how are you carrying something new that works like iron he asked or have you he never got a chance to finish his question because in the next moment the young man who had been standing at the fireside looking altogether as normal as it was possible for a wizard to look suddenly began to change he didnt writhe exactly but he blurred and twisted in a way that induced a really violent case of dizziness and nausea it felt as if something was wrenching kyrtians eyes out of their sockets and stirring up his guts at the same time and kyrtian clapped his hand over his mouth and turned away he wasnt alone the rest of his men were doing the same thing their complexions in varying shades of green what in the name of as soon as he turned his eyes away his symptoms subsided and he looked up glaring at lashana angry accusations on his lips which died as he continued to look upand upand up into the jewellike and surprisingly mild eyes of a very large sapphireblue dragon at least he thought it was a dragon he couldnt think of anything else it could be it was huge scaled winged fanged and taloned there werent many other creatures that fit that description as he stared he heard the men behind him reacting to the presence of the creature one was praying in the ancient language of the humans one was cursing with remarkable fluency and he distinctly heard the thud of a third dropping to the ground presumably having fainted dead away not that kyrtian blamed him in the least you can cast all the illusionbreaking spells you like but dragons can look like anything they care to and you wont know it the dragons are shapechangers you see he heard the elvenbane say quite cheerfully but it was as if he heard her in the far distance his mind was still too involved with the impossibility of what he had just witnessed and the sheer presence of the dragon itself thats our biggest secret and that gives us undetectable spies among you elvenlords the dragons can go anywhere and be anything or anybody and you can never tell that theyre there because theyre not taking on illusions theyre taking on the real form of whatever they imitate theyve been spying on your peopleoh forever from the moment the elvenlords arrived here the eldest say oh kyrtian said faintly i supposedragons must have been in my camp then lashana let out a peal of laughter my good lord kyrtian dragons were guarding your tent and neither you nor your good sargeant gel had any notion actually the dragon said with a note of apology in his deep voice i was one of them sorry hate to eavesdrop and all that but we really didnt have much choice we had to know what you were you understand suddenly you were doing all sorts of efficient things against the young lords and we calculated that youd be coming after us next kyrtian wasnt entirely certain how the dragon was speaking the voice seemed to rumble up out of the depths of that massive torso and the mouth opened and closed but the dragon didnt have anything like lips and he couldnt figure out how it could shape words with that mouth at any rate this is our biggest secret and now you know it lashana continued sowell you can see that we trust you ah yes carefully very carefully kyrtian felt blindly for the piece of log hed been sitting on and lowered himself down onto it i can see that the dragon lowered his head until his eyes were level with kyrtians face you can do us as much harm knowing this as we could ever do to you you know the creature said quietly forgive me kyrtian managed finally gathering some of his wits about him if at this momentwith a mouth big enough to swallow me whole not an armslength away from mei find that a little difficult to believe the dragon suddenly reared up and for a moment kyrtian was certain that they were all going to be swallowed up but then an enormous rumbling laugh started somewhere deep inside the dragon bubbled up through the long long throat and emerged from the upturned snout as a trumpeting hoot it should have terrified himand his menfurther still it was a completely alien sound something that could have meant the thing was about to attack them but somehow it wasnt frightening at all somehow in the depths of kyrtians mind where the basest of instincts gibbered in terror and tried to crouch as small as possible so as not to be noticed by this monster it translated as exactly what it wasthe laughter of a fellow creature who meant no harm at all and that primitive part of him stopped gibbering and relaxed look aside lord kyrtian the dragon said when hed finally done laughing i think id best comeback down to your level he didnt need urging not after his previous experience when keman looked again like an ordinary wizard poor resso had been revived and they were all seated around the fire kyrtian contemplated the wizarddragon from across the flames as lashana and the foresters discussed which of several possible caves they ought to penetrate first he couldnt help himself he couldnt reconcile the apparent size of the wizard with the obvious size of the dragon hed become the puzzle ate at him he couldnt explain it couldnt rationalize it and when he couldnt find an explanation for something he had the bad habit and he knew it was a bad habit of worrying at it to the exclusion of everything else finally the dragon himself leveled a stare across the flames and said what exactly is bothering you lord kyrtian in a tone of irritation mixed with amusement where did it come from kyrtian blurted as conversation ceased among the others i mean youre no larger than resso right now and youre not exactly having that log splitting under you from your weightbut when you were he waved his hands wildly that wasnt air that was masswell look at the imprints you left so where did it come from and where did it go keman shrugged elsewhere kyrtian he said thats all i can tell you we call it shifting into the out we move the real bulk of ourselves to and from the out butwell we dont know what the out is its here but its somewhere else but when you know what to look for a dragon casts a sort ofshadowwhen hes in another form lashana put in its not the kind of shadow you get from light falling on you but its there and when youve learned how to see it and look for it you can always tell whether something is a dragon or not kyrtian could only shake his head more puzzled by the explanation than by not having one but at least that obsessive part of his mind had it to turn inside out and examine while he set most of his attention to work on more important things never mind he said after a moment what in the name of the ancestors are thoseinvisible horrors that lie in wait for you on deer trails and what can we do about them lashana and keman exchanged a look and a nod and the planning moved into more practical spheres caellach gwain was beside himself with rage hed followed lashana to this benighted forest once hed scryed out her location and once shed abandoned it trusting to distance and preoccupation to keep her from noticing the noise of his arrival of course just as he apported into the spot the wretched trees delivered a load of water from their disturbed branches creating the effect of a localized downpour for a moment or two which was certainly enough to drench him from head to toe since he hadnt taken the precaution of wearing a waterproof cape never thinking that lashana would drop herself into the middle of a rainstorm he was hardly prepared for such a reception his temper wasnt improved when he followed the clear trail that she and whoever shed brought with her had left it led through underbrush just thick enough to be a nuisance catching in his soggy robes and snarling his hair and it was dark plague take it all if he hadnt kindled a magelight he wouldnt be able to see where he was going fortunately hed been on the alert for the thoughts of others because he managed to detect the sentries before they got a glimpse of his light and douse it and he was able to avoid them the same way though his command of thoughtsensing wasnt the equal of someone whod wasted his time honing it to a fine pitch stillhe knew human thoughts when he sensed them so what was lashana up to had she found yet another group of wild humans to bring to the new citadel using up more precious resources that should have gone to support wizards and not useless mouths he spotted a fire then and belatedly caution took over he would far rather have scryed out what was going on but that would have required lightso instead he crept on hands and knees with every bone creaking in protest until he was close enough to see most of the figures there if not hear what they were saying sure enough it looked like another plaguey lot of mere humans but then the one that had his back to caellach turned his head and caellach froze an elvenlord and there chatting away with him just as bold as could belashana and keman he very nearly rushed out from beneath his covering bush and accosted them then and there as it was sheer rage held him frozen in place how dare she traitor unnatural ungrateful wretched girl he wanted to throttle her there and then he wanted to blast her into a hundred thousand bits after everything she had done to the wizards who had taken her in taught her sheltered her he just sat and shook for a long time while she oblivious chattered on as if she was old friends with them all he didnt know how long it was that he sat encompassed by anger so hot it burned away every vestige of thought but finally it ebbed and when it did unholy glee flooded in replacing the anger with savage joy he had her now finally finally he had her let her try to deny this when the others heard about it theyd throw her into a prison she could never escape from he had to get back though before he could lay any charges and to do that he had to get far enough away from here that the noise of the transportation spell wouldnt be noticed and he mustnt get caught not now not when victory was so close he could taste it he opened his mind as he never had before paying obsessive attention to the whereabouts of all of the sentryslaves when he moved he did so only when he knew that they were nowhere near and the sounds of his movement would not reach them he literally felt his way along the path that had brought him here moving loose twigs out of the way so that he wouldnt step on them and betray himself at least now the sodden nature of this forest worked for him rather than against him thick moss apparently covered every surface and the fallen leaves he encountered were too wet to crackle when he was finally far enough away that he felt safe in doing so he kindled a magelight once again got to his feet and shoved his way along the first clear path he spotted he didnt particularly care where he was goingand it really didnt matter he could get back to the citadel from practically anywhere what really mattered now was that he get away from here the further he got the brighter he made his light at first as the light itself frightened nocturnal animals out of his path he was afraid that the disturbances they made would betray him or draw in something like an alicorn that could be a real danger to him but the further away he got the less wildlife he saw until at last there didnt seem to be anything at all along the path but himself they must have hunted it all out on the way here he thought vaguely most of his attention on what he was going to say when he got back to the citadel he recalled some vague admo nitions by the stupid dragons that one shouldnt hunt an area out but apparently that elvenlord paid as little heed to such things as he would have and now that the trail was wide and beautifully clear he was going to get to a point where he could transport himself back in a matter of moments nowjust as soon as he got past that cluster of bushes the violent shaking of the bushes was the only warning he got then he was engulfed in something horrid and slimy and his magelight went out there was a moment of absolute surprise followed by an eternity of hellish pain and in the end only nothingness and then there was no sound at all on the trail except the noises of something feeding in the dark keman and shana elected to remain with kyrtian and his men but only after modifying their appearance to that of ordinary humans that was a precautionary measure easy to maintain but vital just in case someone came looking for kyrtianor decided to scry for him besides as keman pointed out theyd been in these woods before theyd helped rescue a pen full of slaves from lord cheynar by taking them into this forest and even if they didnt exactly know every trail and rock at least they knew enough about the dangers to keep kyrtians people from walking into trouble or rather more trouble kyrtian had already had one narrow escape from the ambush beasts and they were both rather good at finding things keman in particular when kyrtian explained in detail what he thought he was looking forthe place where his father had gone hunting ancient artifacts probably within a cavecomplexand the details hed gleaned from the ancient journals they both volun teered their services shana went with kyrtian and his people to act as a lookout for alicorns ambush beasts and other unpleasantries while keman went off on his own it didnt take keman very long at all to come haring back to the main party with a find in his hands and a grin on his face where did you find that kyrtian exclaimed seizing the oddlyshaped chunk of metal that keman had found as if it were made of begemmed gold it had probably been flat once with rolled edges on two sides now it was twisted and crumpled like a piece of paper that had been wadded up then smoothed out again up that way keman pointed you know dragons can tell where caves are he could tell immediately by kyrtians expression that no he didn t know that but he continued with the explanation anyway ive just been cruising at treetop level probing for caverns i found a place where there had been a big entrance that led into a huge complex but thered been a rockfall that blocked the entrance and when i landed to look it over i found that this was caught in the rocks he tilted his head to the side with curiosity what is it anyway i havent the vaguest clue kyrtian replied turning it over in his hands with every evidence of fascination but feel it feel how light it is is it any metal that you recognize well no keman admitted the lightness and the lack of corrosion had been what attracted him in the first place the dull grey bit of debris twisted and distorted had blended very well into the fallen rocks and only a dragon would have been able to spot it at once by the different feel associated with it and look at this kyrtian pointed to a tiny line of engraved figures incised deeply enough that not even the mist collecting on the surface obscured them you see thats ancient scriptelven script keman peered at it what does it say he asked dubiously he couldnt begin to guess what an elvenlord would choose to engrave on a piece ofsomething that looked like nothing more than a bit of shelf but probably wasnt it could be anything a bit of a poem touch this who dares kyrtian chuckled it says keep this edge up not what you expected is it but his eyes were afire with excitement keman this ismust bea piece of one of the artifacts from the crossing weve found the great portal we have keman replied with surprise he shook water off his hood with a gesture of impatience i didnt know we were looking for it i thought we were looking for your father my father was looking for the great portal and im sure he found itbut something must have happened and he couldnt get back to us the elvenlords expression suddenly darkened kyrtian didnt say what he thought the something was and keman decided that he wasnt going to ask how recent was that rockfall there have been several i think now keman was on firmer ground if there was one thing that a dragon knew it was rocks and caves i managed to get this bit out from under the bottom layer but it looks to me as if there was one large fall quite some time ago and several since then theres still an opening big enough for a person to squeeze inside but the opening used to bewellbig enough for my mother much less me i didnt find anything likewell bones he added hastily realizing only then that he might well be describing the place where kyrtians father had died his addition didnt reassure kyrtian in the least kyrtians expression darkened further kyrtian handed the artifact to shana who examined it curiously but paid more attention to the elvenlord than to the piece of metal it suddenly seemed very quiet in their little camp under the trees quiet enough to hear water dripping everywhere to hear the far off calls of bellbirds his face shadowed now all excitement gone the elvenlord stared off into the trees for a moment how far is this can we get there soon two days i think over the trails keman told him after a moment to try and gauge distances i could fly you there one at a time but both shana and kyrtian shook their heads i dont want to divide the party kyrtian said first and lashana i know that you can use magic to bring us there but but ill fall on my nose afterwards shana said bluntly and if you need me i wont be able to do anything no overland it is she sighed then smiled and tried to make light of the situation ah well i havent gotten nearly enough hard exercise lately and you do have horses to help keman and i will be the only ones who have to walk keman burst into laughter as she hit her head with the heel of her palm i dont think youll be walking shana keman told her if youll just give me a chance to change into something more suitable kyrtian got the hint immediately it was only a moment of workas kyrtian hastily averted his eyesand an extra horse stared at shana mockingly what color would you like fostersister he asked shaping the mouth and larynx a bit off the horseform so he could talk properly roan bay black with each suggestion he changed his color to match how about a nice buckskin or spots stripes checks the changes flashed across his hide in bewildering succession ew shana wrinkled her nose at the last brown please brown will do very nicely not even alicornwhite with pretty blue eyes he teased fading out the checks into a uniform brown and for good measure making the hair much better at shedding water by this point he had concluded that he should have taken to the guise of a horse a lot soonerno need for raincapes and in fact the rain felt rather good it certainly kept the biting flies away their exchange had lightened kyrtians mood a little but it was very clear as he gave his men their new orders to move out that he was tense keman didnt have to ask why it had been clear when hed told them of his missing father that he didnt expect to find his parent alive after the initial burst of excitement faded how could you possibly look forward to finding a bodyor what was left of one he hurried them all into packing up the camp it was inter esting to keman that even under the press of urgency kyrtians people worked efficiently and without fumbling in far less time than keman would have thought possible given his experience even with the iron people everything was packed properly stowed on the horses and they were ready to leave the others looked to kyrtian for orders he gestured to keman who obviously was the only one who knew where they were going and keman and shana took the lead kyrtian rode behind them and everyone in his party gave him a respectful distance with a stony expression and his mouth set in a grim line it was pretty clear that he didnt want to talk to anyone and it seemed best to leave him alone it was a very very quiet ride none of the men wanted to break the silence and even shana didnt talk the rain started up again shortly after they took to the trail obscuring the distance behind a veil of grey but keman wasnt worried dragons couldnt get lost he knew where he was exactly in relationship to where their goal was the only thing standing between them and that rockcovered cave entrance was the trifling matter of several leagues it would have been funny if it hadnt been so important that triana keep the presence of her party secret not only from aelmarkin but from kyrtian as well as it was when everyone else suddenly packed up for no apparent reason and began to move trianas group had to scramble to clean out their camp and move deeper into the forest it was a near thing kyrtians party didnt ride in on top of where trianas camp had been but they came closer than triana liked and aelmarkins bunch did just blunder on through if his foresters had been half as good as trianas slaves theyd have spotted the signs of recent occupation for certain but after that it was a simple enough matter to trail behind aelmarkin he was leaving a trail as broad as a highway and making no effort to hide itbut interestingly enough kyrtian wasnt going to any effort to conceal his trail either he must have found something that was the only possible explanation triana wished she knew what it was only when they pushed on past dark was she certain that it couldnt be wizardsbecause kyrtian kindled magelights and sent them up above their heads to illuminate the trail her own scouts reported itand when her group was on the top of a hill she could often catch a glimpse of the lights flitting among the branches of a valley below like impossibly huge fireflies in the distance he wouldnt have betrayed his presence this way if he thought hed found signs of the wizards he was supposed to be looking for at least she didnt think he would the trouble was he could use lights but neither she nor aelmarkin dared that had her gritting her teeth in frustration until it occurred to her that there was one thing at least that she could do she could make magelights of a different sort not powerful enough to light their path but tiny things that would mark where kyrtians horses and aelmarkins had gone by following the scent in the air if the others saw them theyd either assume they were ordinary fireflies or were some bizarre creature native to these forests it took her the better part of an hour to get the magic right but in the end it was worth it the trick was to set the spell to seek horse but with the specific exclusions of the horses she and her group rodeotherwise all the little motes did was cluster around her so even if they were stumbling down the path in the darkness now they had something to follow what a miserable experience thoughwet cold the endless mizzle in the face and it seemed as if there were entire trees just waiting until they passed beneath to drop a load of water on their heads they didnt have to worry about moving quietly thoughthere were so many frogs calling in a dozen different tones throughout the woods that they could have blundered about thrashing through the bushes and never been heard presumably aelmarkin came up with something that worked equally well since they didnt run right into the back of his group triana was dreadfully afraid for some time that kyrtian was going to ride all night for he showed no signs of wanting to halt the rain poured on past dusk and only slackened to the usual mist long after dark but still kyrtian road on by this time she was convinced that kyrtian had gone quite mad but her best forester assured her that no not even someone as driven as kyrtian was going to be foolish enough to press himself and his men that hard and the slave was proved right after what seemed like half the night her foremost scout came back with the intelligence that both kyrtian and aelmarkin were settling in for the night and with the profoundest relief triana directed her own men to do the same but the moment that the first thin light showed among the trees the scouts who watched the camps came back and roused them and they were out of bedrolls that had just gotten comfortable and off again into the fog of predawn kyrtian was pushing hard and triana needed to make a decision she called her best man to ride alongside her can we outflank my cousinget ahead of him without him realizing that were out here she asked not for the first time she was glad she had bought these men from lord kyndreth whoever had trained them had done such a good job that she didnt have to give them exact instructionsshe had only to ask for what she wanted done and they worked out a way to accomplish it if they had the skills unfortunately there was one thing that they did not have the skills for they werent very good cooks they didnt seem to mind eating squirrel and hare that was half raw and half burned but she had begun eating the leathery journeybread in preference to the game they provided the slave pondered her question then nodded i believe so my lady but he looked uneasy and wiped a film of moisture from his forehead that wasnt from the mist it isnt the forest thats the problem its whats in the forest we know of alicorn herds at the very least and the outriders have seen signs of other things worse things my lady than alicorn stallions worse things she wrinkled her brow what sorts of signs one of them came across signs that something had killed and eaten several alicorns in the past week or so he grimaced i would not care to encounter anything that could do that and i suppose he didnt see it had no clue as to what it was if she knew what they needed to guard against she could perform some specific magicsmagic that would either repulse the creatures or at least give warning of their presence but without knowing what it was she was trying to ward off she could waste her energy and skill shooing away spiders only to have a giant slug descend on them nothing weve ever seen or heard of my ladythe scout didnt get near he said the place looked like an ambush in the making from what he told me the alicorns were torn in pieces and i wouldnt even expect one of those dragons weve heard about to do that she gave him a suspicious glance but he didnt look as if he was exaggerating well that did fit in with what shed been warned about this place kyndreth himself had been nonetooeager to go looking for purported wizards in these hills and had jumped to accept kyrtians offer to track them down shed probably lose some men in this now she was glad shed bought them outright from kyndreth instead of borrowing them when an accident happened to a borrowed slave it was amazing how the value of that slave suddenly increased do it she ordered him send the outriders ahead find us a clear path so we can get around aelmarkin and run alongside kyrtian youre supposed to be lord kyndreths best arent you he bowed yes my lady he said no hesitation no excuses no objections just obedience exactly what she had paid for well not all that she had paid for shed also invested in excellence so far these slaves had been most satisfactory but now they had better well prove that they could go beyond satisfactory or when she got back shed be having some words with lord kyndreth but right now she had better keep her own mind on the job at hand if these slaves couldnt rise to the challenge she might have to abandon them to their fate and narrow her goal to getting her own self out intact theyd just paused long enough to pass around rations for lunch eating in the saddle before the afternoon downpour arrived on schedule by nightfall they should be at kemans cavecomplex as rain drummed on the hood of her cape and a few cold drops slipped around the collar and got down her neck shana was grateful that her mount was keman and not a real horse she couldnt have fallen off if shed wanted to not even on the steep trails he was taking and at the moment she needed to be able to concentrate on holding the mental line of communication with lorryn as tightly as possible there was a lot of distance between themand something unexpected had happened something that made all the discomfort she felt completely irrelevant caellach gwain had vanished from the citadel so when he didn t turn up for breakfast either hala thought it was more than odd lorryn told her hes pulled sulks before usually when hes managed to squirrel away food in his room but missing three meals in a row was exceptional the door was bolted from the inside it wasnt hard to get it open not with a half dozen wizards working on itbut he wasn t there when we opened it caellach gwain gone it was so tempting to allow herself to wallow in sheer relief butcaellach gwain vanished out of his own room was a puzzle that only promised more trouble she wiped rain from her face and closed her eyes concentrating you dont suppose hes learned the transportation magic do you she asked apprehensively thats exactly what im afraid has happened was the grim reply well that made perfect sense you didnt have to attend lessons to get the advantage of them the miserable old toad could simply have sat in his room with a scrying glass and learned everything any of the other old whiners was learning youve got a good reason ill bet she felt lorryns nod his room was full of things from the old citadela good many of them not his property so many of the old ones tell me by the way thats put him beyond the pale if thats any comfort to you even the old whiners who were his most vocal supporters were wild with rage when they found their property in his room theres no way he could have known where some of those things were without going back in person because there were a lot of small valuable trinkets that were hidden away in drawers and chests he d never seen the inside of her heart sank so he could be anywhere if he knew the transportation spell all he had to do was be familiar with a place to go there she supposed it was even possible to become that familiar using simple scrying the old citadel some new hideaway of his own even out spying on you lorryn replied and there was apprehension in his thoughts you know what would happen if people found out where you are right now what you were doing and who you were doing it with never mind that lady moth was clearly the wizards friend that lorryns own mother and sister were fullbloods this was different this was consorting with the great lords chosen general she could try to explain until her face was blue but if caellach gwain broke the news at an inopportune time well thats my worst fear because there are some of the youngsters who think that there was a second burst of transportation noise right after you and keman left she sensed lorryns worry and she more than agreed with it fire and rain she swore angrily that would be just like him wouldn t it even through her anger she tried to think if shed detected anything since shed arrived he might be here he might not if he came in far enough from us i wouldnt have heard the arrival look im going to do two things and the first is that im going to turn his room into an iron cage lorryn told her and when he tries to transport back inhell get a shock zed tried it with a rock and what happens is that you bounce back to where you came from with a demon of a headache i can only hope she said sourly hell try to go to another part of the citadel of course maybe maybe not because the next thing im going to do is start planting iron wedges all over the citadel except in designated magic rooms and those will be brand new ones that father dragon is going to carve out for us he soundedwell rather pleased with himself for coming up with a plan so quickly and she didnt blame him zed can pour simple wedges for us easily enough cant he she asked with no problem at all hes already pouring them the children are planting them and father dragon has the first magic room carved out ive been wanting to do this for a while anyway its one more defense against the elvenlords even if it is a nuisance for us to confine doing magic to those special rooms he sighed still itll be worth it and we can have the whole citadel protected by tomorrow caellach gwain will have no way of knowing where the safe rooms to transport to are or what they look like so to get back here he ii have to apport to somewhere he knows her anger faded as she considered that dont think hes set foot outside the caves more than a dozen times since we arrived there cant be that many places where he can apport back and i can have all of them watched by people we trust that leaves only the old citadel for him lorryn sounded absolutely smug when he said that and she didnt blame him he can go live there and rot for all i care she said maliciously maybe the great lords will decide that our fictitious wizards live there that would serve him right if they find him sitting there like an old toad in a hole well just keep alert for any sign of him love lorryn cautioned hes a twisty old beast im not sure i can think of every way he could think of to cause us harm will she promised and gave him a wordless loving farewell that she hoped remained untainted with her anger at caellach gwain well thats not good keman muttered up at her shaking the rain from his mane he had of course been listening in no its not should we tell kyrtian she was of two minds on the subject it wasnt as if kyrtian didnt already have enough on his handsand it wasnt as if his men werent perfectly capable of catching one old man who was anything but woodswise if he was spying on them unless of course he was using the transportation spell to get him away each time it looked as if he was going to get caught but she hadnt heard the distinctive noise associated with that spell i wouldnt keman replied after a moment its not his business its wizard business let lorryn take care of things at the citadel you and i will just have to be very vigilant from now on i hope an ambush beast gets him she grumbled keman shook his head i wouldnt wish that fate even on caellach gwain and you shouldnt either wellmaybe not an ambush beast but i wouldnt mind seeing him treed by an alicorn she relented nor would i foster sister keman replied maybe well have the privilege and maybe hell just get into trouble he cant get out of all on his own without our illwishing him that would be best of all i suppose it would she sighed and left it at that duskand shana looked up through the gloom and the drizzle at the mountain of rubble marking the site that keman swore hid a major cavecomplex well if it did the original cavemouth must have been bigger than anything shana had ever imagined much less seen it looked from this perspective as if half the side of the mountain had come down over the years and it wasnt a small mountain steep though very steep covered with trees and brush that clung to the slope with vegetative stubbornness and probably kept the rest of the mountain from losing its outer skin the most recent fall had been quite recent indeed and had added bulk to the pile on the lefthand side there were trees large trees crushed under all that rock with the remains of dead leaves still clinging to the branches magelights hovered over the pile as kyrtians men looked on apprehensively kemanback to humanformand kyrtian climbed the rockpile to the single opening that keman had discovered near the top of the mound is he going to be safe one of the men asked dubiously as keman offered kyrtian a handup over a tricky bit shana was deadcertain that he wasnt worried about keman kemans a dragon she reminded him they dont know rock they live rock keman feels where each pebble is rubbing and might be loose hell know if something is going to slip before the rock knows youd better be right lynder muttered darkly i climbi explore caves all the timeand i wouldnt go up there without spending weeks checking my path youre not a dragon she retorted and turned her own at tention to the base of the pile there in a place where rock had been melted and reformed to stabilize the area the indisputable mark of dragon stoneshaping was where keman had found the strange piece of metal shana examined the spot on her hands and knees with her own little magelight and in a few moments there was no doubt in her mind that what he had found was not a random bit of something that might have been dropped by a curious elvenlord long ago there was more of the stuff under that original rockfall as she brought her pinpoint light in close to the ground she saw a thin edge of something squashed along the boundary of rockpile and dirt that didnt look anything like the fractured edge of a rock what it did look like was another sheet of metal just what was under that pile of rock just what is inside this cave thats what i should be asking she looked back up again at that moment keman turned and waved back down at her they must have found the entrance a magelight left the formation and swung purposefully towards the two figures up on the pile then vanished seemingly into the rocks there was some activity up there as the two bent over something a moment later the first figure followed the light into the tumbled rocks keman remained bent over while kyrtians men fidgeted restlessly then eventually started back down the pile clearly kyrtian had gone down inside the cave by rope and keman had remained just long enough to see that he was safely down now whats kyrtian thinking the man beside shana murmured fretfully we ought to be making camp not climbing around in caves kyrtians probably seeing if we can camp in the cave one of his fellows pointed out it would be a lot drier and we wouldnt have to worry aboutthings unless of course those things have been coming out of the cave shana warned darkly the more kyrtian had explained what he hoped to find the less shed liked the idea of crawling around in there so far every sign had pointed to the conclusion that kyrtian was right and this was the site of his races entry into this world what if that great portal hadnt quite been closedor had been reopened from what lorryn had told her evelon was hellish at best there was no telling what kind of horrors lived back there the ambush beasts and the other weird things in this forest could be coming out of evelonor been sent by the elvenlords enemies the ones they had fled here to escape fire and rain if they were the losers in their fight i dont want to meet what the elvenlords we know thought was so bad they would risk running into an unknown world rather than face it or surrender to it kyrtians men didnt look very happy with her observation so she didnt share any more of her thoughts forewarned was forearmed but no point in making them too nervous keman came down the slide a great deal faster than he had gone up more surefooted than any goat since he neednt trouble himself about the stability of the surface he trod on he looked as gleeful as only a dragon could with the prospect of a new set of caves to explore the outermost cavern has a lot of things in it but they all look like personal belongings that people dropped while they were running away kyrtian wants to camp in there he told them as he leapt down from the last boulder right now we need some ropes to get down inside and just how are we going to get the horses up that mess one of the men demanded they wont go and i dont blame them oh keman clearly hadnt thought of that and obviously neither had kyrtian i could stabilize it but that would take time and then what are you going to do lower them on a rope hobie and lynder can go with my lord and the rest of us will stay out here the man replied firmly theyre the ones that go mucking about in holes not us you just put some of those magics on our camp to keep the horrors away and well be fine waiting in the open keman looked at shana who just shrugged these werent her men to command go see what lord kyrtian has to say about that was her only advice so back up the pile went keman and back down again just as quickly he says its all right but camp away from the rockfall area he called as he leapt from rock to rock so we need to scout a secure areahobie and lynder though he wants you to bring up the climbing gear he asked for what about the camping stuff lynder asked immediately how are we going to get that down keman just laughed leave that to shana and me he said so the two men kyrtian called for gathered up a pack apiece and several coils of rope and began the climb while shana and keman and the rest went to look for a good place for the others to set up they found it soon enough an indentation in the side of the hill too small to be called a valley too large for a ravine more of a pocket in the hillside that shana could fence off with magic for them to keep the horses confined and screen the camp from view that was easy enough for her to do an illusion of solid hillside and vegetation layered onto a barrier that would only let people pass she kept the magelights going while they set up camp then once they had a fire and their own lanterns going dismissed all but one of her lights then she and keman collected all of the gear they were going to need inside the cave he had taken the form of something rather grellike with a broad flat back to carry a great many packs and four strong limber legs ending in claws it was a very good thing that he had taken all the gear because shana had a hard enough time getting herself up that slope it was as much of a scramble as a climb testing each foothold only to find her feet skidding as loose scree dislodged grabbing desperately for a handhold until she could get her feet firmly planted again fortunately once they reached the top hobie and lynder were waiting with ropes set up to bring down everything a bit at a time keman himself carried shana pickaback with her arms wrapped around his neck legs wedged under the muscles where wings met shoulder he was in his own shape of course climbing down with the agility of a fly on a wall disdaining the use of rope she kept her eyes shut if anything it was a lot farther to the floor of the cave than it had been to the ground outside and the rockfall had piled up into a much nastier barrier on this side once they were down on firm soil though she opened her eyes to take her first look around magelights up near the vaulted top of the cave imparted a soft glow that was as good as daylight there was rubbish everywhere about half of it being wood leaves branches and other detritus that had blown in or washed in before the cave was so totally sealed up but the other half of the litter wasnt it looked just as kemans brief description had suggested as if a great many people had come through here laden down with personal belongings and for one reason or another had simply dropped them or left them here quite clearly the mess had been poked at dug through and nested in by all manner of animals over the course of several centuries anything of fabric or leather had long since gotten so close to the point of disintegration that all you had to do was poke it and it fell apart leaving only bits of metal and lessidentifiable substances that had been used as ornamentation or fastenings some of it was armor recognizable breastplates and greaves helms and vambraces poked up here and there among the wreckage there were boxes that fell to bits at a touch revealing a tantalizing glimpse of what their contents might have been before those too fell into piles of dust and fragmented flakes there were swords and knives and axes but also less recognizable objects and some that shana couldnt make out at all it wasnt so much the metal objects themselves that were fascinating it was the metals that they were made of living among the elvenlords as she had shana was familiar with the ways in which they made bronze brass copper silver and gold serve any number of purposesbut the objects she found werent made of any of those metals most were constructed of the dull grey stuff that keman had found very light and strong but clearly nothing familiar other objects were made of something equally light and thin and looked like ceramic or glass but whatever it had been it was brittle and shattered when flexed it couldnt always have been that brittle presumably age had rendered it friable this sad litter lay among the leaves and sticks that had blown or been carried in over the years the mounds of dirt of dust and cobwebs the bones of little animals who had lived and died here or had been brought in and eaten but there were other bones here as well that were not of animalsand when shana accidentally kicked a helmet and it rolled and disgorged a skull she decided that shed had enough of exploring and hurried back to the spot that hobie and lynder had cleared of debris and were making into a camp kyrtian had already gathered a small pile of things there and was going through them while the other two put together a fire and the makings of a hot meal there was certainly no shortage of fuel for the fire anyway its a pity nothing of the books survived kyrtian said looking up as she approached the friendly warmth of the fire theyve all gone utterly to bits that not even moth could reconstruct i dont think its a pity at all she retorted kyrtian it looks as if these people were running for their lives and something made sure that not all of them got out of here that evelon of your ancestors must have been worse than even you thought and id rather not know anything about it theyre your ancestors too lashana kyrtian pointed out with surprising gentleness many of them were arrogant and selfish creatures who as soon as they got away from those who were exploiting them turned about and oppressed othersbut some were like me like my father and like your friend valyn and they knew a very great deal that we would find useful if we could rediscover it all that great learning doesnt seem to have done them much good here lynder observed looking around the cave and shuddering do elvenlords leave ghosts behind when they die shana knew exactly how he was feeling she had spent a great deal of her life in caves and normally she felt quite comfortable in them but this one had an atmosphere that she could only describe as haunted every word they spoke whispered and echoed in a way that was quite unnerving with bits of their own conversation lingering long past the time when shana would have expected the sounds to die away and now that they were all gathered in around the fire kyrtian had thriftily canceled his magelights she was used to the way that a fire made moving shadows on cavewalls but here were shadows that moved within the shadows and places where blots of darkness were there when she looked but gone when she looked again as for the smellunder the usual damp cave scent there was a hint of something metallic and harsh it was only the first in a series of caves as keman had described for in the wall opposite the rockfall a dark maw of a further entrance gaped she guessed that this cavern had been watercarved at some point but where the water had gone was anyones guess perhaps it had sunk further into the depths of the hills and they would encounter it as they got deeper into the caves it was a halfdome now the rockfall covering what had been a vast entrance the ceiling was a good three or four stories above their heads under all the debris the floor was of sand which at least had the virtue of being dry and softer than rock but this cave was not what kyrtian had come to hunt not really the relics here were nothing more than the sign that this place was what kyrtians father had been looking for there was no sign of the elvenlord himselfunless some of those bones no he would have found something to recognize his father by i should think there was also no sign of his great portal or anything like it no sign of the complex devices kyrtian had described when hed told shana what he was looking for how long before kyrtian decreed that it was time to move deeper into the complex the only concession to making camp so far was the fire and a few rocks as seats around it kyrtian saw her glancing reluctantly towards the open entrance at the rear and caught her eye whatever is in there has waited for decades he saidsadly she thought it can wait another night we rode like fools to get here were tired and wet and cold wed be further fools to go climbing around in an unknown cave in this state people get themselves killed doing stupid things like that lynder let out his breath clearly hed been holding it the moment kyrtian began to speak dreading being told they were going to have to gather their strength and be off again once theyd eaten thank you for that my lord he said stoutly youve prevented me from having to say the same thing i was afraid if i did youd be angry and if i didnt sargeant gel would have the hide off me when we got back i would hope i would never be the kind of leader to put you in that sort of untenable position lynder kyrtian replied but a weary sparkle came back into his eyes at least for a moment food and sleep my ladsand my lady he added bowing to shana thats whats called for here and perhaps a little narrative from your friend on what it was like to eavesdrop outside my tent i am curious to hear about that keman bowed in his turn the only difference between us and your usual guards lord kyrtian was that we have much sharper hearingand one of us was a lady herself oh really kyrtian leaned forward please go on hours later the fire died down to coals keman had gone out to catch himself something of an appropriate size for a dragons dinner before he left shana and kyrtian had both taken the timecomparing notes the whileto fence in their little camp with protective magic interestingly enough neither of them had chosen to use magicshields instead they had both opted for something that would trigger an alarm if crossed clearing a circle that keman could easily see so that he wouldnt trigger the alarm by tripping it when he returned after all he could simply shapeshift into a boulder and nothing would disturb his rest he didnt need alarms to warn him of danger since danger would pass by without noticing him despite those precautions despite being weary shana was having a hard time getting to sleep if conversations had echoed uncannily around the walls the little sounds the others made as they moved or sighed or mumbled in their sleep were worse someone would cough a little or turn overmoments later the sound came back much distorted into something that sounded like a footstep or a whispered word sometimes multiple echoes came back a breath a murmur of notquiteintelligible conversation she didnt actually fall asleep until after keman finally returned he entered as a dragona thin snakelike dragon the only way he could fit himself in through that tiny opening he remained as a dragon curled up just outside the boundary his solid presence bulking large so close at hand finally made her feel safe and in that moment sleep came trianas people had pitched a secluded camp at a discreet distance from the site that was evidently kyrtians goal rain dripped steadily on the canvas of her tent as she plied the forester with questions a soft glow from a magelight suspended above them shining down on his face and highlighting roughhewn features that triana had begun to take a liking to the rugged looks of all of these men were beginning to grow on her by comparison her carefullysculpted and trained slavetoys though more defined and muscular actually seemed rather boyish and immature so five of them entered and the rest arewhere triana asked her scout gracious lady i couldnt find them he didnt shrug but she wondered what his impassive expression hid probably nervousness fear of her anger he was definitely sweating just at his hairline i stayed to watch then remained once they had been inside for some time and darkness had fallen i climbed to the entrance to make certain that lord kyrtian and the four who accompanied him intended to set up camp there they had gear down there enough to do so and such seemed to be their intentions when i went to look for the others however they could not be found i cant believe he would have sent them back she mused aloud no im sure he must have created an illusion to cloak their campit is what i would have done in his place or else they themselves are taking no chances on the creatures lurking in this forest and have hidden their camp it was quite dark by that time my lady he said diffidently and you correctly remembered your orders to keep track of kyrtian not his slaves she nodded did you make any effort to see what was within the cave itself he shook his head lord kyrtian had magelights all through the place but it is very large and a hard climb down the floor is littered with debris but i could not tell you what it was at that distance the usual trash one finds in a cave i suppose so he had come straight back here that showed a fine balance between obedience and good sense she smiled at him and thought that his nervousness ebbed a little youve done well i would rather that you came back here to tell me what happened than waste time in trying to discover the whereabouts of a lot of men who will probably do nothing until their master returns she laughed then and her man relaxed a little further as i have said before what kyrtian can do i can do i have no need of you men inside that cave i have no intention of confronting lord kyrtian i only wish to discover what he is up to i can do that being careful and using my own powers of illusion to cloak my presence once one of you has helped me climb down you meanwhile have managed to outflank aelmarkin and get us here only a little behind lord kyrtians men i believe you deserve a bit of a holiday now the slave unbent entirely thank you my lady was all he said but she saw the expression in his eyes change to one of wary gratitude rather like a somber alert coursinghound offered an unexpected treat she offered him a cup of her wine he accepted it with a profound bow and drank it off at a gulp a pity it was a good vintage but likely he wouldnt know good from bad perhaps she would educate him i will go into the cave tomorrow to follow kyrtian before i do i would like you to find a good outoftheway place to camp that is unlikely to be stumbled across by aelmarkins men ill cloak it with illusion and you all can disport yourselves as you will until i return his eyes absolutely lit and she laughed and yes this means you may help yourselves to any of the provisions the wine included i dont expect to have to spend much time in that hole and when i return our business will be to make all speed back too many provisions will only slow us down she would take the precaution of changing the wine so that it made anyone who drank it tranquil rather than rowdy she could always change it back when she returned better that they laze a little while she was gone it would ruin her plans entirely for aelmarkins people to discover hers because they were carousing and singing or fighting behind her cloak of illusion if something else came across them and they were incapacitated wellthere were other ways she could get home if they didnt take the precaution of setting a sober sentry they werent worth the money shed paid for them have another cup she said with a dazzling smile refilling his goblet then go and tell the others what i just told you ill want climbing gear ready for me first thing when i wake you can see me safely down then return here to the others to wait for my return a few hours past dawn aelmarkin stood looking up at a vast pile of tumbled rocks the trail apparently ended there according to his forester as usual the skies dripped he shook rain out of his eyes with irritation was there never a break from the wretched stuff here and kyrtian ancestors curse him had found a way out of the wretched stuff a cave aelmarkin said incredulously theres a cave up there and kyrtian crawled in there yes my lord the forester said into the ground at ael markins feet it is a very very large cave the opening is near to the top of it i could not tell how many of his men went in with him but the main trail ends here and i can clearly see where a number of people went up that slope and entered into a gap at the top without light i cannot see what is inside but if they were still immediately inside it i must suppose theyd have lights of their own so i presume theyve gone in deeper by the ancestors aelmarkin began to chuckle well its pretty clear that whatever is here its not wizards unless this is some forgotten entrance into their lair forgotten my lord or no longer in use because of the rockfall the scout said head still bent but i dropped a torch within when i could see no signs of lord kyrtian or his men down below and before it guttered out all i saw was litter it appears that if this place was ever in use as an entrance it has not been used so for a very long time thats good enough for me aelmarkin replied he considered the situation ill take you with me the rest can camp here well see if we cant discover what kyrtian thinks hes up to it will be very difficult to conceal ourselves in a cave my lord the man began aelmarkin cut him off with a gesture the water from aelmarkins sodden sleeve spattered him from head to toe and aelmarkin felt a bit of sour pleasure as the slave winced not for a mage you fool get whatever gear well needwere already hours behind him he looked around at the rest of his slaves and you put up a proper camp this time when i get back i expect to see something other than a halfpitched tent and a fire that wont start and get moving he put a sting of warning in his voice to remind them of the sting of his punishments punishments that he had inflicted frequently through their collars each time they bumbled a task it got them going although sluggishly well no matter in a few moments he was going to be inside a dry cave if they couldnt manage to put a camp together properly by the time he got back on the way home hed start crippling them and leaving them behind on the trail to attract the horrors that seemed to stalk these forests that would give his dear cousin something to have to deal with on his way back to civilization at the least kyrtian would be delayed in returning to his patron lord kyndreth and at the mostaelmarkin would no longer have anything standing between himself and everything he wanted this must be that fabled portal to evelon with all of the things that had been left behind scattered about the wizards if they existed at all certainly werent here opportunity waited and fate smiled on aelmarkin at last and depending on what he found in that cavewell by the time he returned home aelmarkin might even be able to give lord kyndreth himself a little healthy competition for ascendancy on the great council triana looked up at the dim uneven oval of grey light that marked the opening to the outer world and absently kicked something dry and crackling from beneath her feet there was no sign of her slave but she hadnt expected him to linger once she was safely down she wondered if she had surprised her forester by getting down into the cave rather handily with nothing more in the way of help than one of the ropes that kyrtians people had left behind she certainly surprised herself then again it was very interesting what sorts of things one could do with magic when one was terrified out of ones wits it had been a very long way down to the floor of the cave from that tiny entrance above fortunately kyrtians own people had left all their ropes behind ready to climb out when they returned so at least she had had the comfort of knowing her lifeline was tested and tried ah but kyrtian had never been taught the subtle art of elven female magic and if he came back hed have the benefit of her passage shed had no notion she could make a rope stronger or herself briefly stronger as well by the time her feet touched the floor of the cave she had imparted the transitory strength of one of her foresters to her arms and legsand she could have used the rope she dangled from to lower a horse and wagon without worrying about it snapping so at a guess she ought to be able to get herself back up the tumble of rock without mishap and no assistance it was admittedly easier to climb when one had magic to help it was tempting to think about blasting her way out with levinbolts though shed been practicing for years now in secret and she was getting quite proficient it would mean less exertion however there were drawbacks as wellin the glimpses shed gotten of the ceiling she wasnt altogether sure of how stable it was and it wouldnt do her a great deal of good to bring the ceiling down on herself instead of blasting her way out not subtle my dear not your style besides unless kyrtian came to grief in there she didnt intend to leave any trace of her own passing so she would probably have to get out the hard way meanwhile in the gleam of her magelight the only sign that kyrtian had been here was a dead campfire and a cleared circle among the rubbish littering the floor he must have gone off long before she even woke and had gotten a good deal ahead of her so if she was to discover what he was up to she had better get moving she paused long enough to recover her breath and her powershed been hot and sweaty as well but in the cold dank caveair shed cooled down quickly and was glad of the cloak shed brought with her tied in a bundle about her waist now for a little magic she smiled to herself as she wove power around her this was subtle and not something a mere male would ever appreciate the illusion she cast upon herself was a rather clever one it wasnt precisely invisibility since that wasnt strictly possible instead she cloaked herself in the image of what was behind her so that anyone looking at her would see only what her body ordinarily would have obscureda kind of reflection but not exactly the illusion wasnt perfect it couldnt be anyone looking closely might well see a faint outline of her body or notice her shadow on the floor that was why she wore a light cloak that covered her from head to toe for a bulky irregular outline against the rough rock of the cave was less likely to be noticed than one with arms legs and a head she had a rather clever device with her as well a cone of mirrorfinished metal with a handle at its point she brought her magelight down and coaxed it into the cone now she could direct all of the light where she chose without halfblinding herself or setting the stupid thing to hover above her head she cast the beam of light reflected out of the cone around herself and used it to pick a path across the debris to an opening at the rear of this enormous cavern she began to wish that the light wasnt showing her way quite so clearly as the light picked out this or that object amidst the sticks and leaves and trash shed have had to have been blind not to spot the bits of armorand the bones bones which were not all the bones of animals nor of human slaves even if the armor could have been mistaken for anything but elvenmade her skin crawled as the empty eyesockets of an elven skull glared at her on the edge of her circle of light she had already known that something terrible had happened here but it was one thing to know that intellectually and quite another to be confronted with the evidence of utter disaster a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature of this place settled over her and she resisted the urge to flee back up that rope into the open whatever had happened here had occurred a very long time ago even by the standards of the elvenlords and nothing not even ghosts could linger for that long but she fancied she caught a whiff of ancient death of bonedust and terror and she couldnt keep her imagination from painting scenes that were not at all comfortable nevertheless as she picked her way across the floor she avoided looking too closely at anything large enough and white enough to be bone were there whispers out there in the dark was that a movement not in the shadow but of the shadow she told herself resolutely that she wasnt afraid that only stupid slaves believed in spirits but there were sounds out there in the darkness sounds that could be echoes but could be something else as well she couldnt even imagine what could have killed so many elves so quicklyand the slaves said that the spirits of those who died violently lingered hungering after the life theyd lost and eager to avenge their deaths on anything living she found herself starting at every unexpected sound and longed for the moment when she reached the far wall and the entrance deeper into the caves she had assumed that once she got to the entrance into the next cave she would find her path clear in fact she found nothing of the kind what had been litter on the floor of the cave was a tangled blockage here someone kyrtian and his people she assumed had cleared a pathway through but if the artifacts there had not already been ready to fall apart at a touch it couldnt have been done in less than a week here the carts of the refugees had jammed at the entrance and there were many many more bones enough so that it was no longer in her imagination that they imparted their own dry hint of ancestral corruption to the air big bones these the bones of drayanimals long since forgotten for they had perished along with their masters tangled in the shafts of disintegrating carts in attitudes that suggested a tide of unreasoning panic had washed over them and sent them scattering before it and more elven bones this time ones without armor women old men a disintegrating wagon that had been laden with small slender creaturesit took her a moment to get past the disbelief to understand that this had been a wagon full of children it was hard to imagine one seldom saw elven children they were usually kept in nurseries until they were considered old enough to mingle with the rest of society she could hardly imagine so many in one place what sort of spirit would a child leave behind something wispy and melancholyor feral and vicious whatever had sent the elvenlords into flight had terrified their beasts as well triana began to feel a certain relief that the few scraps of information shed gleaned had not been more specific that legend now painted the crossing as a matter of triumph rather than the tragedy it had so clearly been she didnt want to know the details now there were already too many details writ large in the bones of those who had not survived to become her ancestors she reached out her hand to steady herself and wood went to dust at her touch enlarging the passage that kyrtians people had already made her very skin flinched away from that dust but it rose in clouds about her and dried her mouth and throat as if the dead themselves rose to make claims on her dont be such a superstitious idiot she scolded herself but without effect her pounding heart the blood rushing in her ears her very skin were rebels to her reason but she forced herself past and once out of the jamup the way suddenly cleared no more bones or at least none that flashed whitely at her in the circle of her light justthings belongings discarded unidentifiable she could cope with things especially things that went to atoms at a touch collapsing in on themselves and leaving nothing behind that called up uncomfortably familiar images in the mind the path that kyrtians underlings took was plainly scribed in that litter a trail where only bits of metal shone dully in the dust she paused a moment to listen and thought she caught the faintest of murmurs from somewhere far ahead covered her light but saw no glimmers in the distance wherever he was if that was indeed the sound of him and his people it was far ahead of her she hurried on suddenly hungry for the sight of something living even if it was an enemy a living enemy right now was preferable to the whispers in the dark this place makes my skin crawl lynder muttered to shana i dont see how he can stand it he was pale freckles she hadnt noticed before standing out clearly across his cheeks she also hadnt noticed how young he was before this all of kyrtians people were so competent and confident that shed taken them all for mature adults now she saw lynder for the beardless boy he actually was newly jumpedup from a page perhaps well fear did that to people shana didnt see how their leader could seem so unaffected by the place either kyrtian had magelights floating silently over their heads set to avoid collision with the ceiling but otherwise lighting up this series of smaller caves with pitiless clarity the tangle of carts and beasts at the mouth of this complex had been the worst of course shana had been so tempted to flee screaming away and swarm right back up the rope into the clean rain outside and the cart full of what had been children no matter what the elves had done to her to the wizards and especially to their slavesthe thought of that cartload of children dying tangled up together in the dark it had made her throat close and her eyes sting and she didnt care that it had happened hundreds of years ago they think im fearless she had told herself and that had made her clench her teeth thrust out her chin and pretend that her whole body wasnt flinching away from the wreckage the bones she squared her shoulders and tensed to keep herself from shivering these were men she had to impress they werent wizards they werent slaves she was a legend to them and if they lost faith in the legendthey would lose faith in the cause she needed them more probably than they needed her if all it took to keep their faith was to pretend to be utterly fearless it was a small price to pay for that faith but kyrtian had only directed the enlargement of a passage already there a passage showing the imprint of a single pair of narrow feet in the dust his father made it he must have kyrtian knows thai this is what hes been looking for and all he can see is those footprints leading us deeper kyrtian had spent a long moment studying those prints then he had taken the lead face immobile and expressionless as the rest had to stretch to keep up with him ive never seen him like this before lynder continued wiping sweat from his face with his sleeve leaving behind a smudge of the dust of the dead obscuring the freckles scattered across his cheeks he shuddered hes not thinking about youor about anyone keman said slowly hes completely inside his own head the three of them exchanged glances she read in lynders face that he at least would rather not be privy to what was in kyrtians head just now she rather agreed with him it was bad enough being out here the deeper into this string of caves they got the more the feeling of doomwhether lingering or impending she couldnt sayincreased shed never been claustrophobic before but she felt the walls of these little caves closing in on heror was it that they seemed to pulse and heave slowly as if they all traveled down the gullet of some impossibly huge sleeping monster if the walls clearly hadn t been rock the floor clearly the same it would have been all too easy to succumb to the illusion do you feel it keman murmured for her ears only that kind of drone in the back of your brain like theres something just barely awake out there and were touching the edge of its dreams or theres something singing a nasty dirge in its sleep she nodded she did had in fact since theyd been here it wasnt getting any stronger and if keman hadnt said anything shed have put it down to nervesbut it was there a sound so deep it could only be felt she wondered what else keman heard he had the benefit of senses that could be enhanced without any immediate limit theres nothing alive down here either keman continued and shivered not even slime nothing alive unheard of caves always had their own little community of creatures insects bats mice and the fungi that the littlest fed on before they in turn became the prey of the biggest where were they all and what drove them away she couldnt see kyrtians face from her place at the rear of the group but lynders was bleached as white as the bones theyd left back there and she fancied her own was as well life leached out of them with every step they took deeper into the maw of the mountain shana suddenly felt that they would never leave this place that they would continue to stumble along in kyrtians wake until they dropped in their tracks and died that this was what had happened to kyrtians fatherno accident but the mountain sucking the life out of him as he plodded deeper into its depths lured by its promise and threat until he stumbled and could not rise again then without warning kyrtian stopped the magelights under kyrtians control shot past them out into some vast space ahead and they kept from blundering into him only by swerving to his right or left which brought all of them to stand next to him at the edge of an abrupt dropoff staring out into a cavern that could have swallowed any cave shana had ever seen without a trace her pulse racketed in her throat how nearly she had gone over the edge at least that was her initial reaction as she teetered on the edge and her eyes adjusted it became clear that the dropoff was not nearly as far as panic had made her think she might have broken an ankle had she gone over all unwarned but no worse than thatthe illusion of a sheer precipice was just that illusion after the initial drop a steep slope slanted away from them to the floor of this new cave it was what bulked here in ordered rows off in the distance that drew the eye and confused the mind objects no constructs things of metal gears wheels things that might be arms or legs or neither big as a house some of them row upon row of them three abreast leading back to the biggest construct of all a huge arch of some dull green stuff that looked deader than the bones they passed but felt alive and full of brooding menace over everything lay not merely a film but a thick shroud of dust obscuring the shine of metal softening angles into curves thick as a blanket in some places so thick that sections had actually broken off and fallen from the sides whatarethose shana asked her voice high and strained kyrtian only shook his head i dont know there isnt anyone alive who could tell you oh i know what they are collectively theyre things the ancestors made to serve them in all the ways that slaves do now magic is what made them work but once the portal closed they wouldnt work anymore and they were abandoned as to why they wouldnt work i cant say serve them lynder said puzzlement in his voice kyrtians tone was as dry as the dust lying over everything of course you dont think our ancestors ever put hand to tool themselves do you they created these thingsto plow and dig build and tear down and make war keman asked harshly kyrtian glanced at him mouth set in a thin line but his tone was mild make war he replied softly oh yes that certainly above all other things the ancestors made war among themselves war of a sort that makes everything we did to the wizards seem the merest game shana looked away from kyrtians face back to the rank upon rank of constructions and shuddered under the dust metal gleamed with cruel efficiency were those blades was that a reaper of cornor of lives a digger of ditchesor of graves she decided not to ask a question to which she did not want to know the answer but kyrtian made a strangled little sound and abruptly jumped down from the edge of the cavemouth landing in a crouch only to sprint off to one side of the huge cavern where there were a few of the mechanisms that were not in such ordered rows with a muffled oath lynder followed then the rest of them trailing along behind aelmarkin cursed the men who lowered him down every time he collided with another rock lashing them through their collars with the punishment of pain it was not enough to satisfy him but he dared to do no more too much and they only became clumsier hed assumedfoolishly in retrospectthat they could simply lower him down comfortably to the bottom of the place instead he was having to practically walk down the tumbled slope of rocks that was the mirror of the pile outside just as difficult as being hauled up that slope but more painful since the idiots above kept dislodging rocks that fell on his head and they kept lowering him in a series of jerks each one endfcd in a collision with more rocks since each time he was caught offguard and offbalance idiots he would certainly leave some of them behind as bait for the monsters in this benighted place and at that it was better than they deserved hed suspect they were doing this on purpose except that his punishments were worse than anything he was enduring when he finally bumped down with a painful thud onto the floor of the cave he gave them all a final reminder of his power over them that made them yelp the echoes of four howls of pain reverberated long enough to give him a fleeting moment of satisfaction he picked himself up out of the dust and kicked the trash hed fallen on out of his way angrily before sending his magelight up to illuminate more of the area no point in looking up to glare at them they were gone of course scuttling back to the shelter of their tents and their fire where they would stay probably lazing about and trying to find nonexistent supplies of wine among his belongings he knew they wouldnt leave the camp they were more afraid of the forest than they were of him foresters they might be but this wasnt their forest and they were superstitiously terrified not only of the very real monsters among the trees but the spirits they swore theyd heard in the night theyd be waiting for him when he returned all right not knowing that if his hopes were fulfilled he wouldnt need them hed have power enough to blast this place open or create a gate home or fly if he chose that would be novel there were old legends of how the ancestors flew on the backs of metalbeaked birds with razortipped wings and scythes for talons how they would duel in the air until blood fell like warm rain on the faces of those below perhaps there were constructs like that waiting here well he wasnt finding them standing about and kicking trash nor was he discovering just what kyrtian was up to if it wasn t hunting relics of the ancestors or the wizards he was supposed to be pursuing he turned it was clear enough where kyrtian had gone the path through the debris was plain enough for a woman to pick out it was also clear that this cave wasnt littered with just the trash that the wind had blown in sokyrtian had found the place where the great portal had made an entrance into this world by the ancestors aelmarkin said aloud and his own voice repeated his astonishment in echoes that whispered in the cave as if a crowd mimicked his surprise a skullan elven skull by the higharched forehead and the narrow jawlay directly in his path glaring at him as if daring him to pass aelmarkin sneered at it what matter a few bones bones were nothing those of the ancestors that died here werent ancestors at all were they they hadnt gotten their bloodlines any deeper in this world than the floor of the cave what matter that aelmarkins path led over those bones that way lay his fortune and he wasnt going to let the bones of a few dead fools stop him you he told the skull contemptuously are a nothing a deadend you cant even manage to block my way he brought his booted foot down on the skull deliberately smashing it it broke with no more effort than destroying an egg his next step took him past the fragile fragments and he didnt look back the demibarricade at the tunnels mouth didnt stop him either in fact he took a great deal of grim pleasure in bullying past it kicking at the carts and the bones of the legendary draylanthans and seeing them disintegrate not as much pleasure as he might have since the wreckage pretty much fell to bits at a touch but enough some fools might find all this horrifying all he felt was more contempt for the weaklings who had been so afraid of pursuitfor of course it could only have been pursuit that they fearedthat they allowed their panic to turn what could have been an orderly procession into a rout and for what so their bones could rot on the floor of a cave before they even saw the light of their new world thats what he wondered as he penetrated further into the cavecomplex if all of the legends of harmony and cooperation were so much rot after all it was obvious from this decayed chaos that there had been panic fighting but there was no sign of whatever was the cause unless of course the ancestors had brought the cause with them what if theyd begun fighting amongst each other for ascendancy as soon as they got safely to the other side that would certainly explain the rout in fact such an explanation made more sense than the official version of the crossing suppose just suppose that not all of the ancestors had given everything they had to the creation of the great portal that was what he would have done come down to it now suppose that factionwithinafaction had then turned on the rest when they were out of magic depleted vulnerable he grinned savagely kicking a bit of debris out of the way of coursethat was what must have happened it explained all of this and explained why no one had ever come back here until the secret of just where the portal was had been lost to memory after all those clever bastards whod won wouldnt want to chance coming upon a survivor amid the wreckage or chance on someone uncovering the real version of what had happened and besides things had been hard enough on those who survived creating their strongholds waiting to see what perils lurked in this new world and trying to defend against whatever might come then of course the ancestors had discovered the humans and realized they didnt need constructs when they could have slaves instead slaves that didnt need repairs could breed their own replacements and could be controlled with a bare minimum of magic proper conservation of resources that it spoke well for the cleverness of the elvenlords who had survived to become his ancestors clever clever fellows indeed they would be proud of him now who had retraced their footsteps to rediscover the secrets of their power and take what rightfully belonged to him of course that would only be the beginning once he had taken kyrtians estates hed consider his next moves there were after all many possibilities for the future and everything would depend on just what he learned here only one thing was certain aelmarkin and not kyrtian would be the one to have the benefit of whatever lay here and what was more kyrtian wouldnt be coming out of here at all if aelmarkin had anything to say about it at least not alive lynder took off at a run after kyrtian his feet slapping on the rock floor of the cave and kicking up puffs of dust but shana and keman hesitated exchanging first a glance then a guarded thought i have a feeling that somethings about to go horribly wrong shana began not at all hesitant to look like a fool if indeed she didin front of her fosterbrother after all hed seen her do and say stupid things plenty of times in the past but keman nodded confirming her apprehensionswhich of course only made them worse so do i its not just that hum theres something down here asleep maybe and i dont want to disturb it he paused and his eyes flicked to one side fire and rain look at the magelights shana bit her lip when she followed his direction and realized that kyrtians magelights were slowly pulsing waxing and waning in strength ever so slightly and very slowly had kyrtian noticed would he i think somethings draining them a little at a time keman continued then kyrtian increases the power to them witkcut thinking about it and it all begins again and i dont think it would be a good idea to use any stronger magic in here it might wake something up wake something up so he felt it too the sense of presence was stronger now although the droning in the back of her mind was not we d better follow kyrtian then she said reluctantly they followed his tracks in the dust across the floor of the cave passing among the odd and articulated shapes of metal and glass and stranger substances they loomed these objects they bulked above shanas head exuding unsubtle menace although how that was possible without possessing eyes or faces she felt her skin flinching away from them noting a few moments later that the constructs were not arranged in quite the orderly fashion that they had first thought nor were they undamaged deep in the middle of the pack they passed two tangled together as if theyd blundered into each other then came one that had been smashed beneath a massive rock perhaps detached from the roof of the cavern then another fallen over on its side then one that lookedmelted yes all down one side the construct sagged and there were places along the leading edges where the thing looked like butter that had begun to run then hardened again a low murmur of voices from the other side of the thing gave a clue to kyrtians whereabouts but there was something harsh and desperately unhappy in that murmur that made them both slow their paces and edge with great care around the corner of it kyrtian stood facing the rock wall of the cave every muscle as rigid as the rock he faced and for a moment all that shana could understand was that the rock looked as if it had melted like butter in the sun just as the metal of the construct had then slowly her mind encompassed the shape in the rock in the rock like some obscene basrelief like a hapless insect coated in wax and preserved for all time like a fancy pastry enrobed in a thin glazed shell like most horribly of all like something caught in an icestorm preserved perfectly beneath a thin sheath of ice that replicated every detail of the nolongerliving thing there was a man an elvenlord embedded in the satinysmooth melted and resolidified rock not carvednot unless there had been a sculptor working here who was utterly mad not with the expression of utter blinding terror that she saw on the subjects visage shana could not see lord kyrtians face and for that she was profoundly glad the eloquent line of his backbone told her more than enoughtoo much truth be told desperately unhappy that was too tame this was a man who should by all rights break into a howl of despair at any moment this could only be kyrtians father bad enough to find bones and only wonder at how he had perishedthis was infinitely worse the moment of death caught and held on show for all time she didnt know kyrtian well enough to offer comfort but he clearly needed it at the moment and just as clearly would not accept it from anyone standing about him now she could hardly blame him if she had been searching for alara all these years only to find her like this all of them stood in awkward silence a silence that stretched on and on until it became unendurable shanas nerves shrieked under the strain of waiting and longed for someone anyone to break itso long as it wasnt her kyrtian could not possibly bear thisno one could but it was kyrtian himself who finally did so and with utterly unexpected words light the lanterns he said the words emerging as a strangled croak but clear enough for all that mmmy lord lynder stammered without comprehension light the lanterns im going to kill the magelights somethings feeding on them and i dont want to give it anything more he didnt finish the sentence but with that in front of them he didnt have to lynder and the other hastened to obey his order breaking out the candles the oil and the lanterns and the moment that the first wick was kindled kyrtian extinguished his magelights completely this of course left them huddling around a lantern that in no way gave a fraction of the light that the magelights had while the others hastened to light the rest of the wicks with a spill kindled on the first shana was just glad that kyrtian had had the foresight to order lanterns brought in the first place and that even in the midst of a grief she couldnt even begin to understand he hadnt lost himself to mourning madness or both she hurried forward to help the others the lamps were kept dry until needed so she filled them while the others lit them and set the transparent chimneys in place to protect them from drafts when she looked over at him kyrtian still hadnt moved except to place one hand on the breast of that terrible figure in the wall she still couldnt see his face she still didnt want to but she wished with all her soul that he would weep triana was surprised when the glow of magelights ahead of her winked out she dimmed her own light in automatic response lest it be noticed now there was barely enough light coming from her little metal cone to let her see her way without stumbling and she used one hand on the cave wall to steady herself as she crept along why had kyrtian doused his lights then as a faint yellow glow came from the opening ahead of her she understood that although he had doused his lights he wasnt in darkness the light coming from ahead was poor and weak and she wondered if some disaster had befallen kyrtian or his men to make him lose control of his magelights the feeling of unfocused horror that had stalked her from the moment that she entered this place washed over her in redoubled strength it was only by stopping long enough to take a few deep breaths and swallow a sip of water from a flask at her belt to ease her feardried mouth that she forced herself to go on whatever was out there hadnt devoured kyrtian yet or where would the light be coming from as her pulse pounded in her temples and her hands grew cold she reached the mouth of the next cave and as she extinguished her own magelight lest it betray her at last she heard voices one of them was kyrtians with a harsh grating tone to it shed never heard before but the low tone and the echoes made it impossible to understand what he and the others with him were saying still he was talking and he wouldnt be doing that if something had attacked him she wondered wildly for a moment if he was talking to something that belonged here but no that didnt make any sense there had been no signs of life here at all not even bats so what could such a thing live on and there were no tracks in the dust except kyrtians people so nothing was going into or out of this cavecomplex in the flickering and uncertain light she barely made out the bulky shapes of huge objects the size of garden sheds and larger ranged in utterly still and silent ranks in front of her great hulking shapesfrozen into immobility now but somehow not dead they crouched waiting watching and at the edge of her vision the arch of the great portalfor that was all that the soaring arc of greenishblack at the rear of the cave could bebrooding over them all moving shadows of men performed an incomprehensible pantomime against the righthand wall where lanterns must be there was a whisper of acrid scent to the air here a faint taste of metal and the flavor of lightning everything instinctive in her screamed to go back forget what she saw and go flee now this was nothing like what she had expectedthere was something horribly wrong here and if she stayed shed find out what it was all of those things out there staring without eyes waiting for just the right trigger the right action to set them free but but if she left she would leave emptyhanded only kyrtian would know the secrets that lay here and that was insupportable will triumphed over instinct and she forced herself to go on she decided at that moment to approach the place where kyrtian and his people were by taking the long way around the edge of the cavern dropping down from the ledge as silently as possible then making her way around the cavern with one hand outstretched against the rock wall to guide her she would pass by the great portal and that alone might hold some useful information and she wouldnt have to walk among thosethings the great portalit had enabled the ancestors to travel from another world perhaps it still held enough magic to take her homeafter all some of the oldest portals could be used to go anywhere that one held a key and she had the prime key to her own portal in the form of the signet ring on her right hand if that was true then she wasnt trapped here if anything went wrong she could escape in a heartbeat that thought when it occurred to her brought a sudden ease of her fear that almost made her stagger and she caught herself with one hand on the cavern wall relief suffused her making her a little lightheaded the hulking shapes of the ancestors chattels no longer seemed to stare at her with insensate menace they were justthings old dead things no matter what kyrtian had found or thought he had found these relics couldnt threaten anything or anyoneif they ever had her imagination had run away with her and she was as bad as any nurserybound child in conjuring up nightmares for herself whatever had slaughtered all those people back in the main cave couldnt have come from here anyway when the portal closed the constructs had all died everyone knew that it was in every version of the crossing that she had ever read that was why it had been so important that the ancestors find or create a source of slavelabor since they no longer had their constructs to do their work for them with renewed confidence and a purely internal laugh of scorn at her own foolishness she continued on feeling for each step as she took it since she could no longer see where she was going and all the while she strained her ears for some hint of what kyrtian was saying watching the enormous shadows cast on the opposite wall by the wavering light of his lamps moving in a gigantic puppetplay aelmarkin doused his magelight with a curse when he realized that the faint glow ahead of him must be caused by kyrtians people in the next cave hed finally caught up with them only to come perilously close to blundering into them he swore at himself for being so stupidhow could he have let something that simple catch him he only hoped that none of them were bright enough to have noticed his light behind them the rough circle of light ahead seemed awfully dimand very yellow odd that why would kyrtian go out of his way to create a yellow light when the natural bluewhite of magelights was so much better and truer then again it was kyrtian it might be firelight he might have found what he was looking for and decided to camp it might be lamplight because he wasn t as good a mage as aelmarkin had thought and he was running out of energy to keep the magelights going he was perfectly capable of doing without magelight altogether for some other peculiar reason of his own it was only when aelmarkin actually reached the mouth of the next cavern and only just saved himself from tumbling over the edge that he understood that the lights were indeed lanterns and that kyrtian had elected to use them instead of magelights and he cursed again but only in his head when that simple fact came near to undoing him it was a very near thing one moment he was easing himself along the cavern and the next his questing foot met empty air and unfortunately he had already trusted some weight to it not anticipating that there would be a dropoff aelmarkin teetered on the brink for a heartstopping moment before his flailing hand caught the edge of the wall and he was able to steady himself he burned the air with a flurry of mental curses before his heart stopped racing and he was able to really look at what lay below him but thenoh then his heart raced for an entirely different reason there below him ranked and waiting like so many placid sleeping bullocks were the ancient constructs that the ancestors had brought with them row upon row of them waiting for the proper touch to bring them alive and call them to service his touch never doubt it he could hardly wait to get down among them what need would he have of slaves or gladiators or even armies with these powerful creations at his command his mouth gone suddenly dry with anticipation he ascertained that the drop was nowhere near as long as hed thought and eased himself bellydown over the edge the rock scraped him even through the tough leather of his huntingtunic but he hardly felt it in his haste to get down among those things out of another world and time besides he needed to get under cover in case one of kyrtians slaves came snooping it would be a disaster to come this far and then be tripped up by one of kyrtians wretched slaves he felt better with the bulk of several of the things between himself and kyrtians lamps safe enough to kindle a very very dim handlight of his own one which could be hidden in his fist and used only held close to the metal sides of the constructs to see if he could decipher any of the ancient script he hoped to find instructions theresurely not everyone who was asked to control the things in the past actually learned how to do so before attempting to operate them failing that he hoped for labels or some evocative name that would tell him what the things were used for but as he moved silently from one huge bulk to the next brushing off a literal coat of dust that fell to the ground in a sheet he was disappointed though he looked as high as he could reach instructions there were none nor names either at least not on the sides that he examined he didnt dare move to the side facing kyrtians lamps bad enough that he was a moving shadow among unmoving ones the murmur of voices suggested that all of kyrtians people were still with him but was by no means a trustworthy way of telling for certain he cursed the ancestors nowhow stupid could one be to neglect to leave instructions for the uninitiated unless those instructions had been in one of the books back in the main cave books that crumbled at a touch for a moment he despaired but then came a stroke of luck so incredible he hardly dared believe it as he closed his fist around his handlight in disappointment atagainfinding nothing he caught a fugitive hint of glowing green out of the comer of his eye he turned with painful slowness to his left and for a moment felt nothing but a wash of disappointment when there didnt seem to be anything there except another construct and this one utterly without anything like writing on the side it did have a set of blades and claws that suggested warlike intentions not that knowing its purpose would do him any good unless he could get it moving which he obviously couldn t without instructions but then as he stared his eyes adjusted and he saw it a faint glow of green in the midst of the blank side of the construct exactly like the glow of an activated elfstone he sidled up to the thing staying in the shadows and quested over it with a finger only the glow and a subtle change in texture from metal to stone informed him that the thing was there at all it had been inset flush with the surface and in the dim illumination from the handlight he wouldnt have seen it except for the glow it was an elfstone or something very like one and when he opened his fist to bring his handlight up to itthe handlight dimmed and the green glow brightened he could have pummeled himself for stupidity of course why would you need instructions to manage one of these things all you needed was the elfstone both to power it and to control it and of course that was why all of the things had collapsed into inertia when the great portal closed the magic powering them that was a part of the aether of evelon ran out and the elvenlords whod built and sustained the portal had nothing left to supply them utter simplicity but of course the lesser elvenlords whod held back their own power either hadnt known how the constructs worked or had been so busy eliminating their dangerous rivals that they hadnt bothered to try to learn to use the things or perhaps they had been so afraid of pursuit that they just abandoned the brutes orwell it didnt matter the point was they had been abandoned and they were there for the taking and now aelmarkin knew how to take and use them it couldnt be any simpler and it didnt matter what this behemoth was originally intended to do either it was big it had to be brutally strong and it was certainly brutally heavy it could kill kyrtian simply by stepping on him aelmarkin smothered a howl of glee and placed the hand holding his handlight against the elfstone embedded in the constructs side it sucked in the power greedily the handlight vanished and thenaelmarkin felt it wake andlook for more and felt its fierce concentration focus on him he tried to pull his hand away in a flash of alarm but by then of course it was already too late kyrtian had finally allowed lynder and keman to lead him to a seat on a nearby outcrop of rock he felthollow and exhausted as if he had wept for a year although he was dryeyed at least mother isn t here that was all he could think of at least she cant seethis i dont think she could bear it i think she d go mad no dont try to chipit out he said with difficulty in answer to lynders question i dont ever want lady lydiell to see him not like that anyway maybe we can find a way to cover him over he shuddered a spasm of a thing that left him sweating and shaking what must have happened he must have somehow wakened one of thosethings maybe it fed off his magelights and he didn t realize what was happening he must have been so excitedtoo excited to think clearly he buried his head in his hands shuddering all over in spasms he couldnt control he wanted to howl to rail at fate and above all things to weep why couldnt he weep which one of these hulks had done the deed he wanted to know that suddenly with a fierce anger that took him and left him shaking that above all he had to find out hed find the thing and take it to bits with his bare hands and grind the bits to dust and scatter the dust over the barren desert by the ancestors he would he stood up still shaking and turned towards themjust in time to see one of them slowly rising up from among its fellows towering higher and higher with something dolllike and screaming clenched in one fearsome claw fear struck tines of ice deep into his gut but kyrtian had not spent all these years training for battle in vain before the thing had finished standing he barked an order which if his voice cracked was nonetheless loud enough and authoritative enough that everyone reacted take cover he shouted even while he himself was diving for shelter beneath the sloping front of the nearest construct even lynder and hobie though they had not actually fought with kyrtians troops against the young lords had trained long and hard with all of kyrtians men and reacted immediately to his barked order by the time the construct had gotten to its full height kyrtian lynder and hobie were all out of its field of visionor so he hopedunder a slope of metal that cast a deep black shadow and i only hope this thing doesnt decide to come alive toohe thought squeezing as far out of sight as he could though his skin shrank from contact with the chill and slightly greasy metal when they had all tucked in and gone immobile he risked a glance at the wall and the halfcircle of lanterns shana and keman were nowhere in sight but at least they were nowhere in his lineofsight he had to hope that if he couldnt see them neither could the construct if it saw that is it might use other senses now what lynder hissed into kyrtians ear he sounded as desperate as kyrtian felt im thinking he hissed back he wasnt worried about that thing hearing them the victim it had in its claw was making enough noise to cover just about anything the screaming was horrible but worse was the feeling that he knew the tortured voice the victiman elvenlord hed seen enough in that moment of horror to know it wasnt a human but who who could have followed him here and why not any of lord kyndreths people since none of them knew where he was going precisely and surely none of his own the victim blubbered between the screams incoherent in his terror it was sickening to listen to no none of them would have trailed after me simply because none of them could have they re all totally unsuited to tramping about in the wilderness thank the ancestors as frightening as the screams was the silence beneath it the construct made no sound at all the only person likely to have followed him and with the skills to do so would have been gel and it certainly wasnt gel in that monsters claw yet the voice was familiar who then he strained to make out anything in the screams and babbling to give him a clue as his mouth dried with fear and his insides seemed to turn to water an enemy then but what enemy would have followed him on what was supposed to be a fairly dangerous mission to hunt out wizards an enemy looking for something to discredit him withperhaps an enemy planning to find or plant something to kyrtians harm or even an enemy hoping to arrange an accident out here where there would be no witnesses that was something that aelmarkin ancestors he thought stunned now hearing what was familiar in those screams and wails echoing across the cavern its aelmarkin that aelmarkin hated him enough to try to discredit or murder him was no surprise but that hed actually dare the wilder ness to do so was something so outofcharacter that he couldnt berate himself for not thinking of it before his worst enemy who has managed to blunder into this fortunately he did not have the time to battle his conscience over whether or not to attempt a rescue there was a whine and a flash of light sweeping across the cave floor and the screams cut off with dreadful finality the three sheltering beneath the still thankfully lifeless construct became very quiet hardly daring to breathe as silence descended with leaden suddenness kyrtian fought down the urge to bolt for the mouth of the cave that had brought them here who knew what sort of weapons this thing had no magic kyrtian decided especially not levinbolts if this monster was what had been feeding on his magelights and draining them what sort of power would a levinbolt give it or worsewhat if another of the constructs absorbed the power and came awake he was fairly certain that this one wasnt the one that had gotten his fatherthough his father must certainly have awakened one or another of the behemoths probably by using magelights this one was now a proven killer they certainly didnt need to awaken a second so what could he use against this monster if not magic not bows and arrows not swords and we ve precious little else there was a whir a creaking of metal and suddenly something like an enormous upturned bowl attached to three metal struts slammed down onto the stone where he and his men had just been sending up a cloud of dust a second followed the first smashing one of the lanterns a moment later aelmarkins limp body dropped down beside the second disk there was no mistake now that kyrtian could see the terrortwisted features it was aelmarkin all right and there was no doubt in his mind that his cousin was quite quite dead not when his backbone bent that far or at that angle kyrtian froze almost directly above them he heard that peculiar whining again he couldnt see anything but those two metal legs but his imagination painted a picture of the construct somehow turning the top part of itself to peer down at the ground below searching for them he felt like a mouse hiding in a log in a field watching the legs of a cat only he had no idea just what arcane senses this monster was using to look for them and as if to reinforce that imaginary image twin beams of light swept over their hiding place and passed over the floor where they had all been standing if i knew what its weapons and its abilities were i might have a better chance of figuring out what to do about it a shout broke the ominous silence making all three of them start and clutch at each other in involuntary reaction hey shana called from somewhere to the right her own voice cracking the whine became a whir something clacked angrily overheadand in mere moments the thing had taken two earthshaking strides that got it out of kyrtians field of vision he heard and felt each footstep it was bipedal from the sound and it was definitely after shana shana what are you doing it wasnt quiet in the cave any longer the construct must not have been a very graceful thing it sounded as if it was stumbling into or kicking aside every obstacle in its path in its effort to get to the elvenbane lynder winced with each crash hobie just sat as frozen as a frightened sparrow then it stopped the whining noise began again and it sounded frustrated kyrtian held his breath again and so did the other two if it heard them ho it was kemans voice this time from another part of the cave the construct was away again blundering its way through the lifeless forms of its fellows it might be bipedal but it obviously wasnt unstable he hadnt heard anything that sounded like a stumble or a misstep yet what are they doing not knowing what they were up to was maddening not being able to see the monster was worse should we try and get a look lynder whispered in his ear not yet he whispered back just then the crashing and thrashing about stopped and the whining recommenced sounding more frustrated than before it couldnt find keman any more than it had been able to find shana if magic feeds it could i make it go dormant by draining magic power out of it it was worth trying the only trouble was in order to drain something he had to actually be in physical contact with it and just how am i going to do that without ending up like aelmarkin he shuddered and kept his eyes averted from the remains of his cousin hey that was shana again from yet another part of the cave it sounded as if she and keman were working together to lure the construct away from where he and lynder and hobie hid was that what they were trying to do get the thing away from the cavemouth so that the three of them could escape he couldnt deny that chance to his men and it would be throwing the blessing back in their face to have them risk so much and not take the opportunity start working your way back to the mouth of the cave he whispered under cover of the crashes and thuds but dont move unless the construct is moving too get out of the caves altogether then bring back the rest of the men and any equipment you think might help ill stay here and help shana and keman distract the thing but lynder began thats an order he hissed fiercely and to enforce it took a chance and scuttled from under their shelter into the space beneath anotherheading in the opposite direction of the cavemouth he slid under it just in time the noise stopped again and the whining began this wasnt where hed have gone by choice the thing was wheeled something like a haywain but the clearance between the cave floor and the things bottom wasnt more than half that beneath a real wagon he had barely enough room to hide and he couldnt help having nightmare visions of the thing waking up and deciding to squash him by lowering itself down on top of him he was sweating and icecold at the same time and fighting a panic that threatened to keep him from thinking at all if anything the view from under here was worse than the first shelter and it seemed to take forever before he heard kemans echoing ho the construct crashed off in pursuit and kyrtian scrambled out from under the wain to take shelter not under but behind yet another behemoth this time he wanted to see what the thing looked like what it was doing it looked like a box on two legs with a pair of blunt crablike pincers on arms attached to either side of the box it wasnt very fast and it wasnt at all graceful but it was powerful some of those crashes hadnt been because it was plowing into obstacles it was because it was picking them up with a pincer and tossing them aside if they were small enough ancestors i hope those two arent anywhere under whats being dropped two lightswere they magelightsat the front of the box projected the beams of light that he had seen sweeping the ground looking for them they swiveled looking uncannily like eyes and the resemblance made him shiver his tunic clung damply to his back and his hands ached where he clutched the sides of his hidingplace it stopped and swept the ground around it with those lightbeams sowhere were the other two and why wasnt it able to spot them he frowned thinking keman and shana must be popping up shouting and moving off again while it blundered its way towards them but the thing must not have very good vision or surely it would see them getting away that was something to keep in mind hey came the expected cryand that was when kyrtian realized that shana and keman were being even more clever than hed thought they werent popping up where the construct could see theminstead a piece of debris went flying through the air and landed on top of another construct with a clatterat some distance from where the shouter was the constructs light beams snapped across the length of the cave and focused on that and where the junk landed was where the construct headed no wonder it wasnt able to find what it so fervently hunted he dashed out of cover long enough to get a piece of debris himself laboring under the double handicap of not wanting to distract the thing from its current hunt and being careful not to go where he might inadvertently cast a shadow or move across the lanternlight maybe it didnt have good visionand maybe it did this wasnt the time to find out he kept one eye on the cavemouth i cant start bringing it back over here until lynder and hobie are safe through ho a much much bigger piece of debris went flying that was keman who must be very much stronger than shana well of coursehes a dragon kyrtian thought of the immenselystrong shape keman had taken to bring shana and the gear down into the caves it wasnt much bigger than a human but no human could have done what keman had the thing fastened its lightbeams on the junk while it was still in the air and started after it kyrtian glanced over at the mouth of the cave just in time to see twin shadows slip over the ledge and into the dark hole that was the start of their road to safety relief made his mouth dry at least they were out of this that was the good news the bad news was that the thing was moving faster and more surely every time it crossed the floor instead of running out of power it seemed as if movement was permitting it to loosen up joints long held immobile it was a good thing he had decided to join this little game it looked as if it was going to need three players the construct reached the spot where the debris had landedbut this time it stood as if it was considering something then slowly moved its lights along the path that the junk keman had thrown had taken oh ancestors the thing can think its finally figured out that the debris isn t what it wants and that someone must have thrown it he dropped down out of sight looked hastily around and picked a place to hide far enough awayand near enough to reach he hoped ha he shouted with all his might and flung his own piece of junk he was already running flatout for his hidingplace when the piece left his hand he dove and rolled beneath the construct and lay there with his mouth clamped around his sleeve to muffle his panting as the footsteps crashed nearer and nearer ha shana heard and knew immediately that it wasnt keman so kyrtian had decided to get into the game she spared a moment to feel with her mind for hobie and lynder and to her immense relief sensed them in the vicinity of the cavemouth and their presences were receding kyrtian was no fool though he might be brave to the point of foolhardiness still she was glad of his aid and gladder still hed gotten the two weakest members of the group out of danger kemanhes sent them for help or at least hes sent them away keman replied as the construct crashed its way across the floori dont know how much help the rest of his men could be even if they get here before this thing catches one of us well neither did she but right now that was second on her list of concerns the first was how to keep herself and keman and kyrtian out of the claws of the monster fear seemed to sharpen all of her senses and made her thoughts faster once this was overif she lived through itshed collapse now she was all calculation what is that thing anyway maybe the way to figuring out how to get rid of it lay in what it was supposed to do the ancestors made the wretched things as slavesto do all their work for them which was why when they found this world full of humans they hadnt needed the things that had gone dead on them and presumably hadnt bothered to retrieve them but the monster was silent again and it was her turn to distract it she had her piece of trash ready a nice light piece of something metallic that should make a lot of clatter hey she yelped and tossed it backwards over her head as she sped off in the opposite direction scooting under the platform of something that vaguely resembled a hut with a porch the ancestors made them as slaveswhat could they possibly have wanted with that thing twolegged piercing through the gloom of the cave with lights huge pincers she cringed back into her shelter as those twin beams of light swept a little too close the thing was getting faster and more nimble that was not good and this time it hadnt gone for the place where the trash had landed but for somewhere nearer the place where shed been standing when she shouted that was worse ho shouted keman and the thing whirled and lurched off what could that monster possibly be good for she ducked out of her shelter and took a quick look around just in time to see it pick up another horsesized construct and toss it aside for all the world like one of her farmers tossing aside a stone or a brick that was in the way of the plow her eyes widened involuntarily as she imagined the thing picking upsaythe load on a wagon and moving it to a barn of course thats what its for kemanthat monsterits meant to move things well its doing a good job of it keman responded acidly it almost dropped that last bit it threw away right on top of me no no im telling you what its meant to do thats the job its meant for to move things thats what the ancestors made itfor the thing stopped and started hunting for keman sweeping its lights over the increasinglychaotic and increasinglytangled ranks of constructs sowhat does a thing like that needto do its job came kemans reply ha shouted kyrtian and the monster was off again shana noticed that kyrtian hadnt bothered to toss any junk this time he must have seen that the monster wasnt fooled by it anymore a strong back strong legs strong arms its got to learn i suppose she ventured well this ones learning its figuring out it shouldnt chase after the decoys weve been tossing dont bother throwing things just yell and run he replied what else do you think kyrtians already figured out we arent fooling it anymore um it would need good balance not easy to tip over no matter how heavy the thing is it has to pick up she suggested so much for my idea of tripping it the monster was definitely getting more nimble as it moved there was less blundering into things now more picking them up and tossing them aside why was it chasing them if it was supposed to be a cargomover could the enemies of the ancestors have something to do with that or had the thing just gonewellcrazy in all the centuries of inactivity you likely wouldnt want it to cut things up so those pincers must be blunt she was trying to think of anything useful yes it didnt have to cut that elvenlord in half only crush him came the sardonic reply whoever he was and whatever his business was following kyrtian at a guess maybe the great lords didn t trust him as much as he thought they did she shook herself to get rid of the distracting speculations it was her turn she got out of her shelter picked up a flat piece of glass and chose another hiding place maybe if she threw it in a different way than just tossing it anyhow it might still distract the monster hey she screamed sent the thing spinning off like the saucers that the children played with and dashed for cover she reached it just in time and was alarmed to see that this time the construct aimed for the center of the arc not the place where the glass landed too close keman can that thing reach behind itself do you think she sensed kemans head popping up cautiously and got a brief glimpse of what he saw before he dove back down into hiding dont think it can he replied with excitement dont think it can see behind it either so that was one weakness no two ifyou took dragonform she hardly dared suggest it and keman would need time to take the formbut in dragonform keman was just as big as the monster was could he be a match for it could leap onto its back and keep it occupied keman replied firmly then you get to kyrtian and both of you get into the tunnel ill follow once youre gone ill be right on your heels but she protestedshe hadnt intended that at all you might as well since im going to do what i want to anyway and he closed his mind off to her damn him she thought with a flare of angerand shook that off too no time there was no time for anything now but action she sensed where kyrtian was and waited ha the elvenlord shouted hoarsely and made his move she did the same as soon as the monster was out of sight planning her run to end near his the monster came to a halt almost directly between them and she froze holding her breath light swept over her hidingplace once twice did it guess were dim senses waking up becoming keener as its movements grew surer instinct shrieked at her to shrink back further into hiding sense told her to keep absolutely still ho keman shouted and the thing lurched off before kyrtian had a chance to move shana did diving under the wheeled vehicle that concealed him she found herself nosetonose with the elvenlord whose white face held an expression of utter shock at seeing her we need to get it to turn as soon as its on top of keman she whispered without preamble hes going to take dragonform and jump on it from behind and do what kyrtian asked aghast how should i know she snapped hes decided thats what hes going to do so we can get out the way your two men did he says hes going to follow well i think i can drain that thing if he can get it immobilized kyrtian began and the crashing footsteps stopped before kyrtian could do anything shana rolled out from underneath the construct and stood uphey she screamed waving her arms this time hey stupid over here barking his elbows on the stone floor in his haste to get out kyrtian scrambled from under the construct just in time to see the monster turn towards them it was not an encouraging sight and it got rapidly worse shana just stood there waving her arms at it and the two bright spotsfar too much like glaring angry eyeson its square flat front panned over the space between them and pinned her in a circle of white light his mouth went dry and fear ran down his backbone like a trickle of icy water the thing emitted an angry whine and lurched forward but before it had taken more than a single step something moved in the darkness behind it a shadowy form he barely made out against the glare that wavered and surged upwards all in an instantand then lunged keman monster of flesh against monster of metal the dragon landed squarely on the constructs back claws shrieking against its sides the monsters legs buckled beneath the dragons weight as kyrtian stared in frozen fascination and that was all he had time to see as shana grabbed his wrist and wrenched him around pulling at him run she shouted showing her heels as a good example and he didnt need a second invitation the monster might be encumbered but it certainly wasnt defeated and behind them the sounds of it thrashing about and kemans claws scrabbling to take hold were proof enough of that fear gave him a new burst of energy they sprinted across the cave floor with shana slightly in the leadnot because kyrtian was playing the gentleman either the girl must have spent her childhood scrambling across rough ground like this where he stumbled she skimmed over obstacles like a frightened deer she must have a separate set of eyes in her feet behind them crashes and earthshuddering impacts testified that keman was still in the fight ancestors bless you dragon but get yourself out of it as soon as were clear she reached the ledge first and vaulted up onto it like an expert acrobat turning just in time to offer her hand to help him scramble up beside her her hand was hard and tough with surprising strength in it keman a quick glance over his shoulder showed him that the dragon still clung tenaciously to the back of the constructmonster and nothing the monster could do was shaking him off he grabbed shanas hand and hauled himself up beside her turning immediately to face the fight hoping that keman had somehow gotten clever enough to outwit the thing and his heart leapt although the monsters arms flailed desperately it couldnt reach the dragon with them and those pincers were next to its feet and weight its best weapons keman had his hind claws lodged firmly all over the things back half and his foreclaws clamped over the front edge kyrtian felt a smile as he saw what the dragon had donewisely he was not making any further offensive moves instead he was content to let the monster wreak further damage on itself as it blundered about trying to dislodge him keman had his tail curled tightly between his legs and out of harms way his wings folded tightly across his back and his legs all tucked in so that the construct couldnt scrape him off without first scraping protruding sections of itself off as well the lights on the front swiveled independently as it tried and failed to illuminate the dragon on its back it threw itself repeatedly against the walls and bucked like a green horse but couldnt get rid of him it hadnt yet thought to roll over on its backbut maybe it couldnt keman was winning just by virtue of sticking on it like a burr in fact it had taken some visible damage not only from the walls of the cave but from all of the other constructs it had blundered into the right leg had a sort of hitch in its movement now and the sides were scarred where it had bashed its skin against the rock kyrtian winced as it flung itself intq the wall of the cave crashing into another construct in the process and wondered how keman managed to stay wedged onto the thing what made the battle all the more uncanny was that aside from the crash of metal on rock and metal on metal and an underlying angry whir or hum the entire battle was taking place in silence it felt as if one or both of them ought to be giving tongue to terrible battleroars he felt shana tense up beside him then suddenly keman made a move while the monster was still offbalance he let go with his foreclaws and stabbed them down viciously at the lights he caught them with a grinding shriek as if the metal itself screamed he wrenched first one then the other off the front metal and wire snapped and tore and keman tossed the lights aside like a cruel boy pulling the legs off a beetle if the monster was ever going to display a voice it should have then the lights went out as they fell leaving only the lanterns he and his men had lit as illumination for the cave and huge shadows sprang up behind the construct and its draconic burden writhing and twisting as the thing thrashed and keman took a new position on its back now what run shana shouted again and as he turned to do so he saw keman fling himself off the monsters back at last half running half flying straight for the cavemouth where they stood thats what he didnt wait to see if the monster was going to follow or if by taking its lights keman had also blinded it he ignored his aching side and put everything he had into a flatout dash for the main cave within moments they were fleeing through the darkness with nothing more than the grey light at the end of the series of demicaves to tell them where their goal was a scrabbling noise behind him made the hair on the back of his neck stand straight up and somewhere deep inside him he found another burst of speed it was inside the tunnel it was closing the gap between them it was right on top of him something grabbed him closing around his waist and spinning him over on his side as it carried him forward air rushed past him as his captor picked up speed he flailed at it with fists and heels shto thai said a muffled and indignant voice at the back of his neck ish ee keman teeth shrank away from him even as he realized they were sticking into him and as keman ran his jaws formed themselves around kyrtians body keman made greater speed than any smaller twolegged creature possibly could from his inverted position in the darkness kyrtian couldnt see much but when he twisted his head the dim round light that represented the place where the last set of small caves met the entrance cave was getting bigger and it was doing so a lot faster than it had when he was running he couldnt tell where shana was but keman wouldnt have left her behind so she must be with them probably shed been able to catch hold of his neck on the run and vault herself into place like a trickrider behind a metallic crash that deafened him for a moment and shook small rocks loose to rain down onto their heads proved that the monster wasnt blindand was still coming for them from behind came the scrape and groan of protesting metal and more crashes as the monster forced itself into the opening keman found more speed somewhere hot metallic breath panted in and out over kyrtians body and kyrtian pulled in his arms and legs and tucked his head in to keep as much of himself inside kemans mouth as he could anks keman said shortly the noise from behind wasnt falling away either the thing was still trying to follow them or it had succeeded in getting in and was on their heels a violent impacta duststormkeman burst through what was left of the barrier of tangled carts and bones and relics and out into the main cave and suddenly tossed his head up in a slewing sideways motion letting go of kyrtian as he did so aiiiiiiiii kyrtian screamed as he flew through the air and screamed again as something snatched him out of it as easily as a child catches a ball then slammed him down on a bony scaly surface that inexplicably had a saddle on it he clutched the leather dazed and even as his eyes took in the improbable sight of a dragon neck and head stretching away in front of him strange and skeletal in the dim light the dragon lurched into a run ancestors more of them ahead of himkeman with shana clinging to his neck he must not have paused for a single stride as he tossed his burden of elvenlord to the other keman scrabbled up the rockpile at the entrance first with no regard for niceties dislodging anything that was loose in his haste to get out as they followed lurching and slipping while rocks went tumbling beneath and around them kyrtian ducked as more rocks showered down on them and the dragon he rode cupped its wings forward to deflect some of the falling debris from him his heart pounded and his fingers were clamped so tightly to the saddle that they hurt and all the while he heard the screech of protesting metal echoing behind them coming coming then they were at the top miraculously widenedthen out kyrtian gasped instead of screamed as the dragon threw itself into empty space it glided heavily down the slope wings widespread around him and skidded into an abrupt landing at the bottom kyrtian wasnt ready for that he lost his grip and tumbled awkwardly over the dragons shoulder and down to the ground the dragon spun around on its hind legs nimble as a goat and raced back up the slope to join the others three of them who were all clustered around the opening kyrtian looked for shanaand found her in the embrace of another wizard shaking like a leaf and whispering what sounded like a name the wizard who looked vaguely familiar stroked her hair comfortingly but spoke straight to kyrtian i hope you dont want to get back in there ever the dragons are sealing the entrance shana relaxed against the support of lorryns shoulder and cradled the wineskin in both hands she didnt usually drink much wine but after today if anyone deserves a drink i do she had never been so glad to see anyone in her life as lorrynin fact she hadnt realized that the other dragons were there until they were all out of the caves keman alara dora and kalamadea had sealed the entrance past anything other than another dragon getting through theyd brought down half the mountain it seemed then fused the rocks together until they were exhausted and limp their bright colors gone pale their scales dull the work had been urgent enough theyd only just brought the rocks down when something began attacking the pile from inside the mountain audible even down below that was when theyd begun fusing the rocks together and the moment that the monster contrivance encountered the fused section the blockage was obvious even to an idiotor a constructfor it began bashing somethingitself its clawsagainst the rockfall but if it intended to loosen those rocks it was going to meet with failure the dragons worked the pile from the top down creating a plug of rock that was not going to move the only way to get out now was to blow out the top of the mountain or tunnel out at another place there was no waythey hopedthat the construct was going to get at them now the sound of battering still came from within the pile but it was weaker now and slower maybehopefullyit was running out of magical energy and would relapse into its quiescent state whatever were not going to wait around here to find out she took another pull on the wineskin and closed her eyes lorryn oh thank you lorryn thank you for thinking for being here it was perhaps at that moment that she really truly realized how much she cared for him lorryn had just finished explaining the situation with caellach gwain to lord kyrtianwho at this point was stunned and battered enough to accept just about anything he just noddedat all the salient points so at least he was listening and took it all in as if the affairs of wizards were everyday things to him huh then again after the politics of the great lords our little quarrels probably seem small beans kyrtians men had bandaged their scrapes and bruises applied remedies inside and out and supplied all of them with food and drink including the dragons bless them theyd gone out and dragged back three dead deera small meal by draconic standards after all that exertion but enough to help revive them the fire theyd built was immensely comforting and for once it wasnt raining so after we made sure he couldn t come straight back to the citadel we waited when he didnt come back at all i finally decided that hed either followed you or hed finally let his arrogance take him into a situation he couldnt get out of lorryn said and good riddance to bad rubbish if you ask me keman grumbled under his breath heand the otherswere too boneweary to shift theyd curled themselves around the entrance to the camp making a formidable barrier between the camp and anything that might even consider going after what was inside it kyrtians men were still wideeyed and a little nervous about being surrounded by dragons but were handling it all remarkably well keman was flanktoflank with dora the sight of two young dragons being as affectionate as any two young lovers seemed to go a long way to reassuring kyrtians men i suppose it makes them seem more human keman has been talking with me at night dora said and the bare skin around her eyes and mouth flushed a delicate pink shana saw two of kyrtians men exchange a knowing look and hid a smile when humans whod never seen dragons before this could recognize a shy blush on the face of one things would be all right we can speak over greater distances mindtomind than you can andwe miss each other when were apart she eyed shana with guilt im sorry keman didnt mention it before butwe didnt want you to feel badly because we could talk and you and lorryn couldnt of course kyrtian said with a slow smile i can certainly understand that he passed his wineskin to one of his men and settled back against the bulk of keman as comfortably as if he used a dragon as a backrest every day dora flushed again so i knew where you were generally and of course lorryn had already been to the place where shana and keman transported to in the first place and he knew how to get there himself i should have known the lovebirds were chatting instead of sleeping she thoughtwith a little envy it would have been a lot nicer if shed been able to do that with lorryn without the aid of keman on the whole though it was a damned good thing they had been billing and cooing every night if they hadnt been she might not be here right now so when dora told me that you had found the cave and when caellach gwain didnt come back i decided it was more important to get out here and see if we could find him before he found you lorryn said with a shrug when shana tilted her head up to give him a measuring stare you supposed hed been able to follow us then she asked i couldnt take the chance that he hadnt lorryn replied i figured that bringing three dragons along would make certain he didnt try anything ifor whenwe caught him i knew they were coming of course keman put in but all they were supposed to do was to look for the old whiner they werent going to butt their snouts in on us why should they there was no reason to when we got back youd have just found out theyd caught the wretch so i didnt see any reason to bother you with it you left me in charge to deal with caellach lorryn told shana meeting her gaze frankly and she gave his hand a little squeeze without caellach there was no one to organize discontent frankly knowing where he was and keeping him from making conspiracies out of halftruths was more important than my being directly in command for a day or so she nodded and smiled how could she not agree with him when he was obviously every bit as competent as she was she left him in charge that meant to be in charge and make decisions without consulting her if there was no need to it would be pretty absurd to be angry with him for doing just that but she could tell him all that later when they were alone for now it was enough to know that she didnt have to be the elvenbane alone anymore we transported in this morning and flew here but we never ever expected you to wake up a monster and let me tell you lorryn concluded those last few moments when that thing attacked you and we were still in the air were the worst in my life they werent any joy for us i can tell you keman grumbled so that was why you went ahead and attacked the thing shana exclaimed you surely didnt think id be stupid enough to do that without being pretty sure i knew what i was doing did you keman replied indignantly i think i did all right without their help thank you we didnt even really need them to get out of the cave and i know i could have at least blocked the entrance enough by myself to hold that monster long enough for us all to transport out of here anyway ill admit i was glad to see them and it made getting that thing bottled up easier but we three were perfectly able to deal with it on our own you might have at least told me that there was help coming shana pointed outreasonably she thought but keman only snorted and for a moment she was irritated i didnt exactly have time to discuss it with you he said looking just as irritated as she was and we werent in any trouble anyway she decided not to quarrel with himbut this new attitude on his part was something she hadnt expected not from keman the gentle keman her little brother keman the notsolittleanymore shed have to take that into her calculations from now on males she thought he was so much more reasonable when he was still a dragonling it had to be all of the courting and cooing with dora she finally decided he wasnt a kid anymore and it looked as if he was going to be like every other adolescent male and start proving it now hed behave like most of the other young male dragons she knew wizard males and human males for that matter next thing hed be flying mockcombats and doing acrobatics for doras admiration lorryn must have guessed at her thoughtsor maybe she was thinking them a little too loudly no worries he said squeezing her hand hell get over it and i assure you im past it thank the ancestors she replied her humor coming back think id send you to the iron people to get it beaten out of you if you weren t all i can say is that im glad you came kyrtian said fervently with a grateful slap to kemans flank whatever is in there can remain in there forever so far as im concerned he shuddered and said nothing more but shana could only wonder if he would feel that way some time in the future after all his fatheror what was left of his fatherwas still in there well it wouldnt be her problem he was forewarned now and if he decided he had to go back he knew hed better come with plenty of help and being without a lady friend to impress he just might act in a sensible manner unlike certain young dragons she cocked her ear to listen for a moment to things outside the camp the sounds from inside the mountain were definitely weaker did you find any sign of caellach she asked belatedly recalling that this was why their rescuers had come in the first place we found where hed transported inso he did manage to learn the spelland then we found ambushbeast tracks on top of his lorryn said grimly we didnt bother to follow them back to the den there was enough blood to pretty much guarantee that caellach must have been the beasts dinner her mouth formed into a soundless o but she couldnt think of what else to say lorryn waited for a moment then continued my thought is to just let him vanish if the other old whiners mink hes gone off to the old citadel or somewhere else to live in luxury with their belongings and with luxury goods lifted from the elvenlords theyre not going to make a martyr out of him whereas if they found out his own stupidity killed him she countered wouldnt that destroy his credit with them then someone might try and make it look as if you arranged for his death lorryn replied with a grimace the fire flared up for a moment and gave them all a look of rapt concentration itd only be our word for what really happened a sufficiently clever fellow could even make him out to be a martyr if they did believe that an ambush beast killed him kyrtian said unexpectedly after all he was the last supporter of the old ways and he was trying to get information that would show the others that you and your new ways were fomenting treachery to your own kind it wasnt stupidity that killed him it was a willingness to sacrifice himself to prove the truth shana stared at him for a moment astonished where did he get that its possibleits even likelybut i wouldnt have thought of it even lorryn looked surprised im glad youre on our side lorryn managed after a moment if you can think of things like that kyrtian shrugged his eyes bleak in the firelight i didnt always think this way he pointed out i suppose i can thank my late cousin aelmarkin for my educationand my loss of innocence then he smiled and he looked more like himself again well your cousin got exactly what he deserved keman said but kyrtian shrugged much as im glad i wont have to worry about him any longer i wouldnt wish the death he got on anyone shana compressed her lips she wasnt feeling that generous especially whennow that she came to think about itit was entirely possible that it had been aelmarkin who woke that blasted construct i doubt he would have said the same of you she said brusquely kyrtian sighed and looked weary and pensive youre probably right no you are right but it would make me more like him to think that way so i wont his jaw firmed i refuse to descend to his level so ill forgive him now that he isnt here to make any more trouble for you eh keman said shrewdly his men are shivering with fear in an illmade camp out that way father dragon put in unexpectedly shall we rescue them do you think yes said kyrtian and lorryn no said shana and keman at the same moment all four exchanged glances and it was shana who broke the deadlock all right she said grudgingly i suppose we can round them up and take them back to the new citadel when youve left kyrtian zed can probably find a use for them well leave the way we came said kyrtian with a sigh having found nothing but empty caves we have a larger plan to think of indeed kalamadea rumbled and it seemed to shana that he spoke for all of them and nowrest we have a great deal of work ahead of us indeed we do she thought as lorryn helped her to her feet and led her to the tent that two of kyrtians men had vacated for them kyrtian stretched feeling every single scrape bruise and pulled muscle but just as much as he longed for home and a hot bath he dreaded facing his mother with the news he had absently to distract himself from his own gloomy thoughts he patted kemahs side i dont suppose i could talk you and your ladyfriend into turning up in a few days could i he asked id love for mother to see you for herself and it would do her good to distract her from mybad news oh of course she had been assuming all these years that his father was deadbut it was one thing to assume and another to know when you assumed there could always be that little hope lurking in the back of your heart that you couldnt quite give up he knew he was never going to actually tell her what he had found it would be enough to tell her that hed found his fathers remains and not get any more elaborate than that and tell her that yes he did find the great portal just as he d always expected but that he was killed in an accident that it looked as if he was taken completely by surprise that would leave her with the comfortable impression that hed never known what was going to happen to him keman laughed of course you could in fact i think i will ask lorryn and shana if dora and i can be the wizards liaisons with you they dont need us particularly to spy on the great lords and the advantage of having us with you rather than wizards is that we wont disguise our true nature with illusion we can pose as a lesser lord and his lady should you have any more visits fromsaylord kyndreth no matter how many illusiondispelling magics he casts well pass his test i hadnt thought of that kyrtian said in weary surprise feeling a renewed stirring of pleasure consider the invitation tendered then that would solve any number of problems dora nudged him with her snout affectionately i think that would be lovely my lord she replied i dont suppose you have any caves on your property do you kyrtian repressed the automatic shudder after what hed just been through he never ever wanted to go underground again but he looked over at lynder who grinned sheepishly and answered for him quite a few miahyour just dora the female dragon said in a kindly tone of voice ah lynder rubbed the side of his nose with his hand selfconsciously dora then yes hobie and i have found quite a few limestone caves watercarved with lots of formations lovely the female dragon said with enthusiasm lord kyrtian you wouldnt mind if we took over one would you we is it he thought holding back a chuckle at the way kemans expression changed from startlement to pleasure no wonder the young cock is starting to strut might be a very good thing for all of them to separate this young fellow from the rest of his peers so hes less tempted to actwell like a young cock with the current state of things best to get him settled the next time there was a situation involving young keman the urge to try and prove himself could have some serious consequences i would consider it an honor he said to both their satisfaction shanas so used to depending on me you know and i think it would be better for her if she got out of that habit and startedwelldepending on lorryn instead keman said in a slightly patronizing undertone with a glance at the now occupied tent i practically raised herwith mothers help of course but i did most of it that concept made his head swim for a moment ah really he asked keman chuckled i had all sorts of pets so far as the others of our lair were concerned she was just one more until she started talking and acting like a person of course it made kyrtians head swim a little more in the very near futurewhen youre settled on my estate and we have the timeyou are going to have to tell me all about that he said as firmly as he could he was not going to disabuse the young dragon of his notion that lashana depended on him he did feel a pang of jealousy though over that young wizard lorryn no he corrected himself not jealousy envy it wasnt that he wanted shanashe was a handsome young woman but not well not the type he was attracted to really except perhaps for those characteristics of mind and spirit that he admired no what he wanted was the kind of relationship that she and lorryn so clearly shared what his mother and father had once had together ancestors wont that be a surprise for mother but he didnt think hed give her free rein to go hunt him up a wife not at the moment there were a lot of difficult days ahead of them they were all going to have a great many more important things to occupy their time like how to survive for one thing he was under no illusion that with aelmarkin gone all of his troubles were about to vanish quite the contrary he was now into the morass of the politics of the great lords he had the young lords to worry about and and im technically a traitor im conspiring with the wizards to create a slave rebellion all that in addition to trying to keep his own people safe if he thought about it too long it seemed impossible and he began to doubt hed even manage that last and in some ways most important task much less all the rest but he wasnt alone in this now for once it didnt all depend on him and his paltry skills well be doing it together dragons and elvenlords wizards and humans working together at last and with that formidable combinationhe had to believe there was no problem that they could not ultimately defeat epilogue triana had never been particularly afraid before shed entered these caves shed only thought shed encountered terror before the construct came alive but the moment that the thing arose out of the rest like some terrifying metal insect with a screaming aelmarkin in its claws she knew true and paralyzing horror by then she had been beside the great portal and as the thing blundered back and forth across the cave in pursuit of kyrtian and his people she shrank into the shelter of one of its curved sides praying that it wouldnt see her wouldnt blunder into her that was all she could manage her knees scarcely held her up and she couldnt have run if she wanted to she was drenched in a cold cold sweat every time the thing came anywhere near she held her breath until she nearly passed out lest it hear her breathing she was sure she was going to die for the first time in her life she stared mortality in the face and realized that she couldnt bear it she couldnt bear it in a moment she was going to faint or scream and betray herself she trembled and sweated and clenched her fists until her long nails bit into her palms and made them bleed one moment there was the metal monster then the metal onewas attacked by a dragon it was impossible it was too much she clutched at the portal side and turned her face into it and refused to look it didnt matter which one of them wonthe survivor would find her and kill hershed die like aelmarkin screaming in terror and pain she didnt stand a chance she fought down the scream that threatened to escapetears scorched her face and her throat ached with the need to shriek and shriek but if she did shed die then and there and she wanted to live something snapped inside her her mouth opened but nothing came out she felt herself start to collapse then blackness swooped down on her like a dragon and took her senses when she woke the cave was quiet and she lay sprawled at the foot of the great portal the cave was still illuminated by the uncertain yellow light of kyrtians lanterns or what was left of them suddenly she did not want to know if kyrtian had met the same fate as aelmarkin it was one thing to see mere human slaves die it was another thing entirely to know to see the hand of death cut down another elvenlord no the caves were not entirely quiet in the far far distance out in the entrance cave perhaps something battered monotonously at the stone since the something sounded like metal it must have been the metal monster that survived so it was between her and the only way out for a moment she thought she was going to faint again but as her hands closed convulsively and her nails bit into her palm so did the band of the heavy signet ring she wore the ring the ring it was her portal keyand she lay in the biggest portal of them all shaking in every limb she got to her feet somehow and dismissed the illusion she wore if this was going to work she would need every morsel of power she faced the great portal closed her eyes and slowly carefully began to weave the lines of energy that would open a longdormant portal like this one it was going to take a lot this one had been made by the concerted effort of dozens of mages and she was only one but she also didnt have any choice if she wanted to live bit by bit sluggishly the portal began to respond the lines of power oozed into place rather than snapping crisply into their positions the patterns formed but oh so slowly and then with no warning at allthe portal snapped to full and vibrant life startled triana opened her eyes the shimmering curtain of power within the glowing green arch shivered parted and an entirely new horror stepped through like some unsanctified melding of elf and reptile the thing stood twice as tall as she it was longlimbed sexless and entirely naked covered in its own bluegreen scales it had a tail that lashed back and forth restlessly a hairless head legs that bent the wrong way at the knees a lipless mouth full of pointed teeth andmost horrible of alleyes she would have recognized on any elvenlord and it saw her the instant it walked through the portal before she could move it had cleared the distance between them in a single leap and seized her its strong scaled fingers closed around her waist in a grip unbreakable as metal cables now she screamed shrieked and fought but she might as well have been fighting the metal monster it had no expression whatsoever on the flat plate that was its face it even smelled like a snake musty and green and the smell made her even more frantic somehow triggering fears so atavistic that she tore off nails and bit like an animal trying to get free of it her entire body felt afire nothing existed for her but the overpowering need to escape all for naught the thing never even winced it was impossibly strong and utterly implacable the moment that she tired it flung her over its shoulder reduced now to mindless panic she renewed her fight but her shrieks made no impression on it and she might as well have been fighting with the stone of the cave it carried her to the portal which shimmered with activity she screamed as they approached the shivering curtain of light they touched it and passed through it and the portal closed behind them again lord kyndreth steepled his fingers together and stared at his son gildor who had just brought him news that waswell peculiar he wasnt certain what to make of it he was even less certain what to do about it he had young kyrtians report on his desk a written copy of what kyrtian had told him via the teleson and although he could find no fault in it it had left him feeling vaguely unsatisfied granted everyone knew what the forest bordering cheynars estate was dangerous full of alicorns and the ancestors only knew what sorts of worse things and there was no real reason why kyrtian should have actually found the purported den of halfbloods in there after all theyd been hiding for centuries with no one suspecting their presence so why should one young elvenlord find them now butthe report felt incomplete as if kyrtian was hiding something from him although he could not even begin to guess what that something was and nowgildor poor dullard that he was walked into the study with the astonishing news that lady triana and aelmarkin were missing that they had left their estates with camping gear and a train of slaves that included in trianas case at least slaves trained as foresters and now both were missing their estates in confused disarray their slaves left with no orders uncertain of what they should do now gildor and his friends had turned up at aelmarkins estate for a planned eventone at which lady triana was also supposed to appear to find that both were gone vanished thank you gildor kyndreth told his son with the gravity due to a major piece of intelligence thank you very much would you care to invite all of those friends of yours who were disappointed of their amusement here i will be happy to entertain them for a week if you like as hed expected gildors dull face brightened at the prospect kyndreth summoned his steward and sent his son off with the lesser lord to organize the entertainment that is lord belath would organize the entertainment and gildor would summon his friends it would be a great disruption to kyndreths work in fact he might have to retire to the huntinglodge or the old dowagerhouse while the young roisterers romped through his halls but that would be a small price to pay if gildor continued to bring him tidbits like this one was this what kyrtian was hiding that didnt fit with his reading of the young lord kyrtian was not likely to conceal the fact that his cousin had come to grief and even less likely to have murdered aelmarkin himself kyndreth could readily see why aelmarkin would follow kyrtian into the wildernessaelmarkin would be perfectly happy to engineer an accident out there but if in the course of trying to set up such an accident it was aelmarkin who perished and kyrtian found out about it why would kyrtian hide it why would he want to if aelmarkin were hoist upon his own petard of treachery kyrtian should be only too pleased to trumpet the fact to all the world and as for triana vanishing at the same timewell the only thing that lord kyndreth could imagine was that for some reason she had gone chasing after kyrtian as well although he could not imagine why kyndreth ground his teeth feeling frustration well up inside him this was an entirely new experience for himand he didnt like it always always from the time he first came to power and took his council seat he had known who was doing what and why especially why and now things were happening that he had not been told of had not anticipated and worst of all he had no real notion of the motivations that lay behind these incidents motivationswhat in the world could have brought aelmarkin out into the wilderness besides hatred for kyrtian or for that matter lady triana what could the two possibly have in common he closed his eyes for a moment emptied his mind and violently suppressed the emotions that came welling up in the wake of that frustration emotion was not useful he needed logic and reasonand above all planning and once he cleared his mind of emotion something else occurred to him at long last the one thing that triana and aelmarkin did have in common was the group that they associated with sociallythe younger sons and some few younger daughters until the young lords revolt that had includedthe rebellious young lords what if rather than trailing after kyrtian aelmarkin and triana had gonequite coincidentallyinto the same area intending to meet with the fugitives what if aelmarkin and triana had been the spies within the ranks of the old lords for the youngsters if that was the caseno wonder aelmarkin had been so intent on fostering the impression his cousin kyrtian was dotty and no wonder hed been so disgruntled when kyrtian was placed in charge of the army it was only a theorycould by no means be provedbut it wouldnt hurt to keep the theory in reserve it might be useful meanwhile he should be the one to spread the news to the rest of the council if at all possible how many other council members had offspring likely to be invited to that aborted party not manyand none were likely to have mentioned the disappearances yet good he might be swimming in a sea of uncertainties but he could make something out of this yet he straightened his back called for strong wine and began to plan what he would tell the council and as he did so he felt a faint smile cross his lips at the very least he would gain something triana had some ancient cousin or other who would swiftly claim her estate but aelmarkins nearest relation was kyrtian and kyrtian was unlikely to want aelmarkins tiny holding or his business of breeding pleasureslaves when an estate went unclaimed it traditionally went to the head of the council which was of course lord kyndreth and if there was any question of whether or not it should be confiscated well kyndreth could bring up that theory branding aelmarkin as a traitor and overturning all possible objections to confiscating the property kyndreth nodded to himself feeling firm ground beneath his feet again good enough he knew where he was now he would call the council meeting announce the disappearances and see who reacted and how that would tell him a great dealand in the meantime he would send his stewards in to take control of aelmarkins possessions he took a long breath and keyed the teleson shake the tree and see what fruit felland how far and whatever happened to make certain that it profited him well anster he began when lord ansters servant had summoned him to the telesonscreen it seems we have a mystery on our hands
