w e b griffin hunters i one danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary august when he heard the ping of the bell announcing the arrival of an elevator in the lobby of the gellert sandor tor who was the director of security for the budapester neue tages zeitung raised his eyes from a copy of the newspaperso fresh from the presses that his fingers were stained with inkto see who would be getting off he was not at all surprised to see that it was eric kocian managing director and editor in chief of the newspaper the first stop of the first tages zeitung delivery truck to leave the plant was the gellert the old man must have been looking out his window again tor thought waiting to see the truck arrive tor was a burly fiftytwoyearold with a full head of curly black hair and a full mustache he wore a dark blue singlebreasted suit carefully tailored to conceal the swiss sigarms p mm semiautomatic pistol he carried in a highride hip holster he looked like a successful businessman with a very good tailor but he paled beside eric kocian who stepped off the elevator into the gellert lobby wearing an offwhite linen suit with a white shirt a white tie held to the collar with a discreet gold pin soft white leather slipon shoes a white panama hatthe wide brim rakishly up on the right and down on the leftand carrying a sturdy knurled cane with a brass handle in the shape of a wellbosomed female kocian was accompanied by a large dog the dog was shaped like a boxer but he was at least a time and a halfperhaps twiceas large as a big boxer and his coat was grayish black and tightly curled kocian walked to a table in the center of the lobby where a stack of the tages zeitung had been placed picked up a copy carefullyso as not to soil his wellmanicured fingersand examined the front page then he folded the newspaper and extended it to the dog you hold it awhile max he said your tongue is already black then he turned and resting both hands on the cane carefully surveyed the lobby he found what he was looking forsandor torsitting in an armchair in a dark corner of the lobby kocian pointed his cane at arms length at tor not unlike a cavalry officer leading a charge and walked quickly toward him the dog newspaper in his mouth never left kocians side six feet from tor kocian stopped and without lowering the cane said sandor i distinctly remember telling you that i would not require your services anymore today and to go home a lesser man would have been cowed sandor tor did not as a young man he had done a hitch in the french foreign legion and subsequently had never been cowed by anyone or anything he pushed himself far enough out of the armchair to reach the dogs head scratched his ears and said how goes it max then he looked up at kocian and said you have been known to change your mind ur kocian this is not one of those rare occasions kocian said he let that sink in and then added but since you are already here you might as well take uson your way hometo the franz josef bridge with that kocian turned on his heel and walked quickly to the entrance max trotted to keep up with him tor got out of his chair as quickly as he could and started after him my god hes eightytwo as he walked tor took a cellular telephone from his shirt pocket pushed an autodial button and held the telephone to his ear hes on the way to the car he said without preliminary greeting he wants me to drop him at the szabadsag hid pick him up on the other side the szabadsag hid the freedom bridge across the danube river was arecreation of the original bridge that had been destroyedas had all the other bridges over the danubein the bitter fighting of world war ii it had been named after franz josef then king and emperor of the austrohungarian empire it was the first to be rebuilt as close to the original as possible and when completed in had been renamed the freedom bridge eric kocian simply refused to accept the name change if the communists were happy with that freedom name theres obviously something wrong with it he had said more than once franz josef may have been a sonofabitch but compared to the communists he was a saint there was a silver mercedesbenz s sitting just outside the door of the gellert for a moment sandor tor was afraid that the old man had grown impatient and decided to walk then there came a long blast on the horn tor quickly trotted around the front of the car and got behind the wheel kocian was in the front passengers seat max still with the newspaper in his mouth was sitting up in the backseat where the hell have you been kocian demanded i had to take a leak you should have taken care of that earlier kocian said it wasnt far at all from the door of the gellert to the bridge but if kocian had elected to walk he would have had to cross the road paralleling the danube down which traffic often flew the old man wasnt concerned for himself tor knew but for the dog one of maxs predecessorsthere had been several all the same breed bouvier des flandres all named maxhad been run over and killed on that highway it was a standard joke around the gellert and the budapester tages zeitung that the only thing the old man loved was his goddamned dog and that the only living thing that could possibly love the old man was his goddamned dog sandor tor knew better once tor had heard a pressman parrot the joke and had grabbed him by the neck forced his head close to the gears of the running press and promised the next time he heard him running his mouth hed feed him to the press turn on the flashers when you stop kocian ordered as the mercedes approached the bridge and ill open the doors for max and myself thank you very much yes ur kocian and dont hang around to see if max and i can make it across the bridge without your assistance go home yes ur kocian and in the morning be on time for once i will try ur kocian good night sandor sleep well thank you ur kocian tor watched in the right side rearview mirror as kocian and the dog started across the bridge tor already had his cellular in his hand he pressed the autodial button again across the river ervin rakosis cellular vibrated in his pocket causing the wireless speaker bud in his ear to ring he pushed one of the phones buttonsit did not matter which since he had programmed the device to answer calls whenever any part of the keypad was depressedand heard tors voice come through the earbud theyre on the bridge got him sandor hell be watching me so ill have to go up the vamhaz korut as far as pipa before i can turn i told you i have him sandor just do what i tell you to do ill pick him up when he passes sohaz any idea where hes going absolutely none it was eric kocians custom to take max for a walk before retiring which usually meant they left the gellert around half past eleven almost always they walked across the bridge and almost always they stopped in a cafe bar or restaurant for a little sustenance lately theyd been going to the kepiro a narrow restaurantbar which offered good jazz jack daniels black label bourbon and a menu pleasing to max who was fond of hard sausage but that was no guarantee theyd be going there tonight and if sandor tor had asked the old man where he was going the old man would either have told him it was none of his goddamned business or lied in fact it was sandor tors business to know where the old man was and where he was going and to keep him from harm his orders to protect eric kociancost be damned and for gods sake dont let the old man know hes being protectedhad come from generaldirektor otto gorner of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh the german holding company that owned among a good deal else half a dozen newspapers including the budapester neue tages zeitung when he came off the bridge tor saw ervin rakosis dark green chrysler grand caravan at the first intersection in a position from which rakosi could see just about all of the bridge he continued up the vamhaz korut for two blocks and then made a right turn onto pipa he circled the block on toward sohaz u pulled to the curb behind a panel truck half a block from vamhaz korut and turned off the headlights tors cellular buzzed hes almost at sohaz u rakosi reported im fifty meters from the intersection tors voice said in rakosis earbud thirty seconds later eric kocian and max appeared walking briskly up the steep incline one of these days tor thought hes going to do that and have a heart attack tor reported he just went past follow him and see where he goes thirty seconds after that the chrysler came slowly up vamhaz korut sixty seconds after that rakosi reported hes turned onto kiralyi pal it looks as if he is going to the kepiro dont follow him drive around the block and then down kepiro u tor backed away from the panel truck and then drove onto vamhaz korut and turned right when he drove past kiralyi pal he saw eric kocian turning onto kepiro a moment later rakosi reported he went in okay tor ordered you find someplace to park where you can catch him when he comes out ill park and see if i can look into the restaurant got it rakosi said tor found the darkened doorwayhe had used it beforefrom which he could see into the kepiro restaurant kocian was sitting at a small table between the bar and the door a jazz quartet was set up between his table and the bar there was a bottle of whiskey on the table and a bottle of soda water and as tor watched a waiter delivered a plate of food sausage for the both of them tor knew kielbasa for the old man and some kind of hard sausage for max kocian cut a slice of the kielbasa for himself and put it in his mouth max laid a paw on the old mans leg kocian sawed at the hard sausage until there was a thumbsized piece on his fork he extended the fork to max who delicately pulled off the treat kocian patted the dogs head a procession of peopleincluding three hookers one at a timeentering and leaving the restaurant paused by kocians chair and shook his hand or allowed him to kiss theirs the more courageous of them patted maxs head kocian always rose to his feet to accept the greetings of the hookers but as long as tor had been guarding him he had never taken one back to the gellert with him in vienna he had an old friend who was sometimes in his apartmentmost often coming out of itwhen tor went to get him in the mornings she was a buxom redhead in her late fifties kocian never talked about her and tor never asked the band took a break and the bandleader came over to kocians table patted max and had a drink of kocians jack daniels when the break was over the bandleader returned to his piano and kocian resumed cutting the sausagesa piece for him and a piece for maxas he listened to the music often tapping his fingers on the table tor knew that the old man usually stayed just over an hour and had gone into the restaurant a few minutes before one oclock so glancing at his watch and seeing that it was ten minutes to two he had just decided it was about time for the old man to leave when he saw him gesturing for the check tor took out his cellular pressed the autodial key and said hes just called for the check lets hope he goes home rakosi replied amen tor said you get in a position to watch him on the bridge ill stay here and let you know which way hes headed done rakosi said eric kocian and max came out of the kepiro five minutes later and headed down the street toward kiralyi pal strongly suggesting he was headed for home tor watched him until he turned onto kiralyi pal called rakosi to report kocians location and then trotted to where he had parked the silver mercedes he had just gotten into the car when rakosi reported that the old man was about to get on the bridge he had driven no more than four minutes toward vamhaz korut when his phone vibrated trouble rakosi reported on the way tor accelerated rapidly down the vamhaz korut and was almost at the bridge when he saw that something was going on just about in the center of the bridge max and the old man had a man down on the sidewalk and the man was beating at the animals head with a pistol rakosis chrysler grand caravan was almost on them and then a cara black or dark blue mercedes that had been coming toward sandor torstopped and a man jumped out and holding a pistol with two hands fired at the old man and the dog rakosi made a screaming uturn jumped out and started firing at the mercedes as it began to speed away ill get the old man sandor tor said into his cellular you get the bastards in the mercedes ram them if you have to rakosi didnt reply but tor saw him jump back into the chrysler tor pulled his mercedes to the curb the old man was sitting down as if he had been knocked backward tor saw blood staining the shoulder of his white suit the man on the ground was still fighting max whose massive jaws were locked on his arm tor jumped out of the mercedes taking his pistol from its holster as he moved he took aim at the man max had down then changed his mind he went to the man and swung the pistol hard against the back of his head the man went limp tor looked down the bridge and saw that both the attackers mercedes and rakosis chrysler had disappeared he punched another autodial button on his cellular a number he wasnt supposed to have inspector lazar he announced supervisor needs assistance shots fired on the szabadsag hid one citizen down require ambulance so far as tor knew there was no inspector lazar on the budapest police force but that would get an immediate response he knew before he had gone to work for the tages zeitung he had been inspector sandor tor he went to the old man the dog was whimpering there was a bloody wound on his skull christ i only hit that bastard once and he was out i saw him beating on maxs head and max never let loose that dogs not whimpering because hes in pain hes whimpering because he knows something is wrong with the old man an ambulance is on the way ur kocian tor said sandor i need a great favor anything ur kocian i should not have let this happen what you should have done is gone home when i told you do you

trouble ill meet you at the szent janos korhaz the sergeant said fine tor said ill worry about that later the old man crawled into the backseat max got in and jumped on the seat and started to lick his face sandor closed the door and then got behind the wheel take max to dr kincs first the old man ordered youre going to the hospital first ill take care of max not one goddamned word of this is to

woozy a moment later sandor looked in the backseat the old man was unconscious max was standing over him gently licking his face as if trying to wake him sandor turned and looked forward again and thought please god dont let him die he pushed another autodial button on the cellular praying it was the right one telki private hospital im bringing an injured man to the emergency room be waiting

youre going to hurt like hell for a long time every time you movefor that matter breathe i can take the bullet out now if youd like i think ill wait until i get to a hospital colonel alfredo munz said until very recently munz had been the director of side the argentine organization that combines the functions of the american fbi and cia there were three other men in the room the study of the sprawling big house of estancia shangrila one of thema some what squat completely bald very black man of fortysixwas lying in a pool of his own blood near colonel munz dead of mm bullet wounds to the mouth and forehead he had been dr jeanpaul lorimer an american who had been a united nations diplomat stationed in paris and who had taken some pains to establish a second identity for himself in uruguay as jeanpaul bertrand a lebanese national and dealer in antiquities eighteen days earlier on july thirteenth dr jeanpaul lorimer had gone missing in paris a week later his sister who was married to j winslow masterson the chief of mission of the us embassy in buenos aires argentina had been kidnapped from the parking lot of a restaurant in san isidro an upscale buenos aires suburb the president of the united states suspecting the kidnapping had something to do with international terrorism and wanting to know what was going on without that information having to be slowly filtered through state department and intelligence channels had sent to buenos aires a personal agentan army officer serving as executive assistant to the secretary of homeland security major c g castillo had arrived in buenos aires on july twentysecond the next morning el coronel alfredo munz of side informed the american ambassador that mr masterson had been found in a taxi on the riverfront drugged and sitting beside the body of her husband who had been shot before her eyes the president had been enraged he telephoned ambassador juan manuel silvio to personally tell him that he was placing major castillo in charge of both the investigation of the kidnapping and murder and of the protection of mr masterson and her children until they were safely returned to the united states when the air force globemaster iii carrying mastersons family and remainsand the remains of a marine guard sergeant who had been murdered when driving a female secret service agent away from the masterson residencetouched down at keesler air force base in mississippi on july twentyfifth air force one and the president of the united states were waiting for it the president sent for major castillo just before he got off the globemaster to go aboard air force one mr masterson told major castillo that her kidnappers wanted to know where her brother was hiding and that they would kill her children if she didnt tell them they had murdered her husband to make the point the threat was serious mr masterson told castillo that she had absolutely no idea where jeanpaul lorimer was or why the kidnappers were after him when castillo reported to the president aboard air force one the president showed him the document he and secretary of state natalie cohen had just made law top secretpresidential the white house washington dc duplication forbidden copy of secretary cohen july presidential finding it has been found that the assassination of j winslow masterson chief of mission of the united states embassy in buenos aires argentina the abduction of mr mastersons wife mr elizabeth lorimer masterson the assassination of sergeant roger markham usmc and the attempted assassination of secret service special agent elizabeth t schneider indicates beyond any reasonable doubt the existence of a continuing plot or plots by terrorists or terrorist organizations to cause serious damage to the interests of the united states its diplomatic officers and its citizens and that this situation cannot be tolerated it is further found that the efforts and actions taken and to be taken by the several branches of the united states government to detect and apprehend those individuals who committed the terrorist acts previously described and to prevent similar such acts in the future are being and will be hampered and rendered less effective by strict adherence to applicable laws and regulations it is therefore found that clandestine and covert action under the sole supervision of the president is necessary it is directed and ordered that there immediately be established a clandestine and covert organization with the mission of determining the identity of the terrorists involved in the assassinations abduction and attempted assassination previously described and to render them harmless and to perform such other covert and clandestine activities as the president may elect to assign for purposes of concealment the aforementioned clandestine and covert organization will be known as the office of organizational analysis within the department of homeland security funding will initially be from discretional funds of the office of the president the manning of the organization will be decided by the president acting on the advice of the chief office of organizational analysis major carlos g castillo special forces us army is herewith appointed chief office of organizational analysis with immediate effect signed president of the united states of america witness natalie g cohen secretary of state top secretpresidential no one anywhere had any idea why anyone was so determined to find jeanpaul lorimer and was perfectly willing to commit murder to do so but it was obvious to major castillo that the bestindeed the onlycourse of action was to find jeanpaul lorimer and the place to do that was in paris a cia agent in paris seemed to have some answers he told castillo he suspected that lorimer was involved in the iraqi oilforfood scandal which had just come to light the cia agent said he thought lorimer had been the man who distributed the money involved he also said he thought he knew where jeanpaul lorimer was cut in small pieces in the river seine castillo had gone next to otto gorner the managing director of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh in fulda germany he had a close relationship with both the holding companywhich owned among a good deal else all the tages zeitung newspapersand with gorner himself gorner told him that he agreed with the cia agent that lorimer had some connection with the oilforfood scandal which he had also been looking into he also pointed him to budapest where the editor in chief of the budapester tages zeitung eric kocian had a list of names of people he strongly suspected were involved kocian had never heard of lorimer but said there obviously had to be a bag man and it could easily be a un diplomat who could travel around europe and the near east without drawing attention to himself if lorimer was that man those deeply involved in the scandal would want him dead and would be willing to kill to see him eliminated kocian also said his information suggested that much of the oilforfood money was going to south america on condition that castillo would not reveal either his name or the names on his list to any us government agency kocian gave him a list of names of people who he thoughtor knewwere involved and who were in south america mainly in argentina and uruguay castillo had gone back to south america where he found that lorimers name had not come up to any of the us intelligence agencies operating there or to side but he had also learned that uruguay was known as the moneylaundering capital of the southern cone so he went there the fbi agents in montevideo euphemistically called legal attaches of the embassy had never heard of lorimer either but one of them special agent david w yung jr did say that he recognized a squat bald very black man in one of castillos photos as being the lebanese antiquities dealer jeanpaul bertrand who owned an estancia called shangrila and was known to be there yung was quickly informed that that in fact was a picture of jeanpaul lorimer the thing to do with lorimer castillo then had decided was to repatriate the missing diplomatby force if necessaryand he set up an operation to do that he had just identified himself to lorimer in lorimers office at the estancia when the barrel of a madsen submachine gun smashed the office window and sprayed the room killing lorimer and wounding el coronel munz they had been attacked by six men who were all killed in the next few minutes none of them carried identification of any kind the third man in jeanpaul lorimers office was dressedas sergeant kensington wasin the black coveralls and other accoutrements worn by delta force operators when engaged in clandestine and covert operations he was cradling in his arms a black boltaction snipers rifle modified from a remington model had he not pushed his balaclava mask off his face corporal lester bradley usmc who was nineteen would have looked far more like what comes to mind when the phrase delta force operator is heard with the mask off it had just occurred to the fourth man in the room he looks like a kid who has borrowed his big brothers uniform to wear to the high school halloween party he was immediately sorry for the thought the little sonofabitch can really shoot as he just proved by saving my life the fourth man was major promotable carlos g castillo special forces us army he was thirtysix a shade over six feet tall and weighed one hundred ninety pounds he had blue eyes and light brown hair he was in a welltailored dark blue suit he turned to munz who was looking a little pale from his wound your call alfredo castillo said if kensington says he can get the bullet out he can how are you going to explain the wound no offense munz replied but that looks to me like a job for a surgeon kensington has removed more bullets and other projectiles than most surgeons castillo said before he decided hed rather shoot people than treat them for social disease he was an ateam medic which meantwhats that line kensington that i was qualified to perform any medical procedure other than opening the cranial cavity kensington quoted i can numb that give you a happy pill clean it up and get the bullet out it would be better for you than waitingthe sooner you clean up a wound like that the betterand thatd keep you from answering questions at a hospital but what are you going to tell your wife lie alfredo castillo said tell her you were shot by a jealous husband what shes going to think is i was cleaning my pistol and it went off and im embarrassed munz said but id rather deal with that than answer official questions how long will i be out you wont be out long but youll be in lala land for a couple of hours munz considered that for a moment then said okay do it well lets get you to your feet and onto something flat where theres some light kensington said he looked at castillo and the two of them got munz to his feet theres a big table in the dining room that ought to work kensington said it looks like everybody got here just in time for dinner theres a plate of goodlooking roast beef on it and a bottle of wine okay on the beef castillo said nix on the wine we have to figure out what to do next and get out of here major who the fuck are these bad guys kensington asked i really dont know yung is searching the bodies to see what he can find out i dont even know what happened well theyre pros whoever they are maybe russians kranz was no amateur and they got him with a fucking garrote that means they had to a spot him and b sneak up on him a lot of people have tried that on seymour and never got away with it spetsnaz castillo said if this was anywhere in europe id say maybe even probably but here i just dont know well take the garrote and whatever else yung comes up with and see if we can learn something when they got to the dining room kensington held up munz while castillo moved to a sideboard the chateaubriand a sauce pitcher a bread tray and a bottle of uruguayan merlot then he sat him down on the table you going to need meor bradleyhere castillo asked no sir come on bradley well find something to wrap sergeant kranz in yes sir sergeant first class seymour kranz a delta force communicator who at five feet four and one hundred thirty pounds hadnt been much over the height and weight minimums for the army was lying facedown where he had died a lightskinned african american wearing black delta force coveralls sat beside him holding a car version of the m rifle between his knees despite the uniform jack britton was not a soldier but a special agent of the united states secret service anything jack castillo asked britton shook his head its like a tomb out there he said and then is that what they call an unfortunate choice of words he scrambled to his feet lets get seymour on the chopper castillo said as he squatted beside the corpse the garrote which had taken sergeant kranzs life was still around his neck castillo tried to loosen it it took some effort but finally he got it off and then examined it carefully it was very much like the nylon selflocking wireandcable binding devices enthusiastically adopted by the police as plastic handcuffs but this device was blued stainless steel and it had handles once it was looped over a victims head and then tightened around the neck there was no way the victim could get it off castillo put the garrote in his suit jacket pocket okay spread the sheets on the ground castillo ordered you have the tape right yes sir corporal bradley responded he laid the sheets stripped from jeanpaul lorimers bed on the ground castillo and britton rolled sergeant kranz onto them one of his eyes was open castillo gently closed it sorry seymour he said they rolled kranz in the sheets and then trussed the package with black duct tape then he squatted beside the body help me get him on my shoulder castillo ordered ill help you carry him britton said you and bradley get him on my shoulder castillo repeated ill carry him he was my friend yes sir castillo grunted with the exertion of rising to his feet with kranz on his shoulder and for a moment he was afraid he was losing his balance and bitterly said oh shit bradley put his hands on castillos hips and steadied him castillo nodded his thanks and then started walking heavily toward where the helicopter was hidden carrying the body of sfc seymour kranz over his shoulder three aeropuerto internacional jorge newbery buenos aires argentina july when the bell ranger helicopter called jorge newbery ground control announced that he was at twentyfive hundred feet over the unicenter shopping mall on the route panamericana on a vfr local flight from pilar and wanted permission to land as near as possible to the jetaire hangar ground control immediately cleared the pilot to make a direct approach youre number one to land there is no traffic in the area report when you are at five hundred feet over the threshold visibility unlimited winds are negligible there is not much commercial latenight activity at jorge newbery which is commonly thought of as buenos airess downtown airport the airport is separated by only a highway from the river plate and is no more thantraffic permittinga tenminute drive from downtown buenos aires very late at night the tarmac in front of the terminal is crowded with the boeing s of aerolineas argentina austral pluna and the other airlines which will starting very early in the morning take off for cities in argentina uruguay and brazil the informality of the radio exchange between the bell ranger and newbery ground control would have driven an american faa examiner to distraction but in practical terms there was nothing wrong with it ground control had not bothered to identify the runway by number there is only one about seven thousand feet long and since he had given the helicopter pilot permission to make a direct approach and the winds were negligible there wasnt much chance the pilot would misunderstand where he was supposed to go newbery ranger zeroseven at five hundred over the threshold zeroseven you are cleared to make a lowlevel transit of the field to the right repeat right of the runway for landing at the jetaire hangar mucho gracias report when you land will do as the bell ranger came down the field over the grass to the right of the runway the doors of the jetaire hangar began to slide open a sleek small glistening white jet airplanea bombardierlearjet xr with american markingssat nose out behind one of the doors it was connected to ground power and there were lights visible in both the cockpit and cabin four men pushing a trundle bed which would attach to the skids of the helicopterthe ranger does not have wheelsand permit it to be rolled into the hangar came out and waited for the helicopter to land newbery ranger zeroseven on the ground mucho gracias youre welcome have a nice time ill try the ground control operator had assumednot without reasonthat the bell ranger was owned by a wealthy estanciero who had flown into the city for a night on the town that happened three or more times every night sometimes the tarmac in front of jetaire was as crowded with private airplanes and helicopters as the terminal tarmac was with airliners as soon as the ranger had been trundled into the hangar the doors began to slide closed again three men came down the lears stair door and approached the helicopter as the pilot pushed the cockpit door open the larger of them was fernando lopez castillos cousin he was a darkskinned man in his midthirties six feet two inches tall and weighing well over two hundred pounds lopez saw something he didnt like on castillos face you okay gringo castillo nodded solez fernando lopez asked ricardo solez was a special agent of the drug enforcement administration assigned to the us embassy in buenos aires he had been drafted from the dea by castillo for the estancia shangrila operation hes driving the yukon back here castillo said hes all right i thought the kid was going to do that lopez said bradleys in

agent david w yung jr of the fbi is in the chopper oh jesus christ im going to tell him that who was here when we got here is classified top secret presidential i have no reason to believe that he

classified top secret presidential castillo said thats good yung said that saves me from having to decide what to do now that i have seen him do you mind if i interpret that to mean you wouldnt have

the door he started to walk across the hangar floor then felt a little woozy and staggered he put his good arm out like the wing of an airplane cried wheee and started trotting in curves around the hangar kennedy went quickly to him and steadied him what we are going to tell my wife is that i shot myself when i was cleaning my pistol munz confided to kennedy and you are my witness my wife says

ranger and opened the copilots door bradley load the stuffeverything in the chopper that belongs to usinto the lear and make sure theres a seat where we can put sergeant kranz yes sir corporal lester bradley said ill give you a hand with the body yung said just put him over my shoulder castillo said ill carry him five minutes later jorge newbery ground control cleared lear fiveohsevenfive to the threshold of runway thirtyone four office of the commander in chief united states central command macdill air force base tampa florida august there were several reasons that command sergeant major wesley suggins was rarely in the commander in chiefs conference room when the twelve chairs around the long table were occupied by what he privately thought of as the heavy brass or even when only three or four of them were occupied by what he privately thought of as the light brass he defined the heavy brass as general or flag officers whose personal flags carried three or more stars it also included a few heavy civilians the liaison officer between the office of the director of national intelligence and centcom was one of these he was a member of what was known as the executive civil service and held the grade therein of gs which carried with it the assimilated grade within the military establishment of lieutenant general the state department central intelligence agency and federal bureau of investigation liaison officers each carried the executive civil service grade of gs which carried with it the assimilated grade of major general the light brass was brigadier generals rear admirals lower half and gs civilians and below the primary reason command sergeant major suggins almost never took a seat at the conference table was not as most of the light and heavy brass believed because he was an enlisted man and would be out of place in their exalted senior company the primary reason was that general allan naylor the centcom commander in chief had decided that command sergeant major suggins had more important things to do than sit at the table for long periods with his mouth shut this was not to say general naylor did not want command sergeant major suggins to know what transpired at the frequent conferences quite the contrary it was general naylors habit after most conferencesthere were at least four every day including the twicedaily intelligence briefingsto motion suggins into his office and solicit both his opinions of what had been discussed and his recommendations as to how an action decided upon could best be implemented that command sergeant major suggins was not physically present in the conference room did not mean he hadnt heard what was being discussed the room was equipped with a wide array of electronic devices including a battery of microphones placed around it so that even the sound of a dropped pencil would be detected sometimes the conferences were recorded at all times what the microphones heard was relayed to a singleearphone headset suggins put on the moment the door to the conference room closed the red light above the door began to flash and the conference in progress do not enter sign lit up it was commonly believed by those seeing suggins wearing his headset that he was taking the opportunity while a conference was in progress to listen to the dixieland recordings of bob frenchs original tuxedo jazz band to which he was known to be quite addicted suggins did nothing to correct this erroneous belief about the most important thing suggins did while not sitting at the conference table with his mouth shut was field general naylors telephone calls there were usually many and almost all of them from people really importantor who believed they were really importantand who all believed they had the right to speak with general naylor immediately some of them suggins deftly diverted with white lies the general was jogging or indisposed or speaking with the president or the secretary of homeland security or the secretary of defense and he would have the general return the call the moment he was free there were some callers of course that suggins did not try to divert these included for example the president of the united states the secretaries of defense state and homeland security the director of national intelligence and mr elaine naylor when one of these luminaries called suggins would turn to a laptop computer on the credenza behind his desk and quickly type for example if the caller were the secretary of homeland security the honorable matthew hall hall the message would instantly appear on the screen of what was nearly universallyand not very fondlyknown as the generals ibb meaning infernal black box the ibb was in fact a laptop computer identical to sugginss general naylor always had it on the conference in front of him situated so that the screen would be visible to no one else the system was effective whoever had the floor in the conference room would not have to stop in midsentence as naylors telephone rang or command sergeant major suggins came through the door naylor could read the message and quickly type his reply can i call in five mins or put him through or can you take a message etcetera the regularly scheduled afternoon intelligence briefing had been in session for about five minutes when one of the telephones on command sergeant major sugginss desk rang office of the sink suggins c in c was often pronounced sink and command sergeant major suggins speaking sir wasted time jack iverson wes the caller announced ive got an interesting in flight advisory for your boss chief master sergeant jack iverson usaf was the senior noncommissioned officer of what was informally known as the air force side of macdill macdill was an air force base the united states central command was a tenant of macdill air force base shoot suggins replied as he spun in his chair to the laptop on the credenza his fingers flew on the keys as iverson relayed the in flight advisory message for cinc centcom charley urgently repeat urgently requests cinc centcom personally repeat personally meet lear fiveohsevenfive on arrival macdill eta torine col usaf got it jack hang on a minute youre not going to tell me what the hell its all about wes if i knew i would i dont suggins replied he pushed the key that would cause the message to appear on the screen of general naylors ibb the reply came in a second the translation of that was what the hell a moment later there was another reply ok jack reply that the cinc will do suggins said and the cinc authorizes the landing of the civilian airplane if thats necessary and for christs sake keep this quiet why do i think youre not telling me everything you know because im not suggins said thanks jack then suggins picked up the telephone and ordered that the cincs car be at the front door in five minutes five as the sleek white bombardierlearjet xr taxied up to the tarmac in front of base operations general allan naylor could see the pilot he knew him well he was major carlos g castillo us army naylor could also see who was sitting in the copilots seat he knew him well too he was colonel jacob torine usaf that figures general naylor thought a full goddamned air force colonel is flying copilot and charleya lousy majoris in the pilots seat naylor saw castillo rise from the pilots seat and leave the cockpit a moment later the fuselage door began to unfold and in a moment castillo appeared in the opening he was in civilian clothing good afternoon sir castillo called politely would you come aboard please sir alone now hes giving orders to a fourstar general goddamn it wait here please jack naylor said to the lieutenant colonel his aidedecamp standing beside him and then walked to the lear and climbed up the stairs thank you sir castillo said as naylor entered the cabin this had better be important charley i thought it was sir naylor looked around the cabin there were four men in it one fernando m lopez he knew well the lear belonged to one of the companies his family controlled the other three he did not know one was an asiatic another a lightskinned african american and the third looked like a high school kid who are these gentlemen charley naylor asked special agent yung of the fbi sir castillo answered special agent britton of the secret service and corporal lester bradley bradleys a marine good afternoon sir colonel torine said from behind him hello jake naylor said and shook his hand none of them look smug as if theyve just pulled off something clever they all look uncomfortable as if whatever crazy operation they launched went the wrong way im waiting charley naylor said castillo pointed to the aisle at the rear of the cabin there was something there wrapped in what looked like sheets and then naylor knew what it was another body he asked icily sir those are the remains of sergeant first class seymour kranz castillo said he was kia last night what garroted sir castillo said garroted yes sir castillo took the blue steel garrote from his pocket and extended it to naylor by who where naylor blurted and then hurriedly added as he pointed to yung and bradley are these gentlemen privy to what happened or anything else they are aware of the presidential finding sir and they participated in the operation in which kranz lost his life and what was the operation we located mr lorimer sir we staged an operation to repatriate him we were in the middle of it when we were bushwhacked by who i dont know sir mr lorimer was killed during the attack as well as sergeant kranz and the bushwhackers they were killed sir where did this happen in uruguay sir uruguay naylor asked incredulously and then verbalized what he was thinking the last thing i heard you were in europe hungary we were sir but we tracked down lorimer in uruguay and are the uruguayan authorities already looking for you or will that come a little later so far as that aspect of the operation is concerned sir we came out clean you came out with two bodies and you call that clean we left mr lorimers body in uruguay sir castillo said what i meant to say is that i dont think we left anything behind that could tie the operation to us and why did you come here why did you bring the sergeants body here it was either here or fort bragg sirwashington was obviously out of the questionand we didnt have enough fuel to make pope air force base and you were here sir naylor looked at him and thought good ol uncle allan will fix things right sir castillo added you are personally aware of my orders from the president general mcnab is not whats he doing reading my mind and dammit hes right bringing the sergeants body here was the right thing to do when do you plan to go to washington just as soon as possible sir id be grateful if you would call secretary hall and tell him were en route general naylor looked for a long moment into major castillos eyes then he walked to the door colonel he called will you come in here please his aidedecamp came quickly into the airplane colonel you are advised that from this moment what you may see or hear is classified top secret presidential yes sir under that black plastic is the body of a sergeant sergeant first class seymour kranz castillo interrupted who was killed naylor went on during the execution of a covert and clandestine operation authorized by a presidential finding the officer in charge of this covert and clandestine operation has brought the sergeants remains here for us to deal with i confess i have no idea how to proceed with that sir what is the sergeants parent unit the lieutenant colonel asked castillo just in time general naylor stopped himself from saying the lieutenant colonel did not have to call major castillo sir kranz was gray fox out of delta force castillo answered sir what about calling general mcnab at bragg i suspect he has experience with a situation like this oh i bet scotty mcnab has ill bet this sort of thing is almost routine for good ol scotty the first thing to do is cordon off this area general naylor said then get an ambulance over here have the sergeants remains taken to the hospital get a flagno have the ambulance crew bring a flag with them cover the remains with the national colors before they are moved arrange for the sergeants remains to have a suitable escort from this moment understood yes sir is that satisfactory to you major castillo yes sir thank you very much is there anything else you require no sir then i will attempt to get general mcnab on a secure line naylor said he walked to the door then turned if this needs to be said i am sure that all of you did your duty as you understood it and i dont think i have to tell you how pleased i am that there was only the one casualty he was out the door before anyone could reply ii one the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc august the president of the united states was behind his desk across the room ambassador charles w montvale the director of national intelligence was sitting next to secretary of state natalie cohen on one of two facing couches secretary of homeland security matthew hall was on the other couch major c g castillo who was in civilian clothing was nonetheless standing before the presidents desk at a position close to a tease or secretary hall thought like a kid standing in front of the headmasters desk waiting for the ax to fall for the past ten minutes castillo had been delivering his report of what had happened since he had last seen the presidentaboard air force one in biloxi mississippiwhen the president had issued the presidential finding that had sent him first to europe and ultimately to estancia shangrila and so we landed at macdill mr president castillo concluded where we turned over sergeant kranzs remains to central command and then we came here i took everyone involved to my apartment and told them nothing was to be said to anyone about anything until i had made my report and that they were to remain there until i got back to them colonel torine too the president of the united states asked and your cousin too how did they respond to your placing them in what amounts to house arrest colonel torine knows how things are done sir i didnt order himand fernando my cousin understands the situation sir and thats about it castillo the president asked except for one thing sir which is howard kennedy was at jorge newbery when i landed there from the estancia mr yung saw him the fbi agent who was there ambassador montvale asked howard kennedy castillo began who it is alleged is in the employ of aleksandr pevsner the president said drily the russian mobster montvale asked incredulously both castillo and the president nodded im missing something here montvale said the president made a fill him in gesture with his hand to castillo secretaries cohen and hall who knew the story exchanged glances and quick smiles montvale wasnt going to like this sir we have sort of reached an accommodation with mr pevsner castillo began we montvale interrupted whos we you and who else accommodation what kind of accommodation we is major castillo and your president charles let charley finish please the president said he was very helpful in locating the stolen mr ambassador castillo said an americanowned boeing had disappeared from luanda angola on may and when what the president described as our enormous and enormously expensive intelligence community was unable to determine who had stolen it or why or where it was the president had come close to losing his temper he had dispatched castillo who was then an executive assistant to the secretary of the department of homeland security to angola his orders being simply to find out what the cia and the fbi and the dia and the state departmentand all the other members of the intelligence communityhad come to know about the stolen airplane and when they had come to know it and to report back personally to him castillo had instead gone far beyond the scope of his orders he not only learned who had stolen the aircraftan obscure group of somalian terroristsand what they planned to do with itcrash it into the liberty bell in philadelphiabut he also had located the in costa rica where it was about to take off for philadelphia castillo hadwith the aid of a delta force team from fort braggstolen the aircraft back from the terrorists and with colonel jake torine in the pilots seat delivered it to macdill air force base this had endeared castillo to the president but not to the cia the fbi and the rest of the intelligence community whose annoyance with him was directly proportional to the amount of egg the various directors felt they had on their faces thats the first time i heard that montvale said what part of let charley finish didnt you understand charles i beg your pardon mr president montvale said let me take it charley the president said perhaps there will be fewer interruptions that way in a nutshell charles there is no legal action of any kind against this fellow underway in an american court he made contact with charley shortly after i gave charley the job of finding out why no one else in our intelligence community could find it he was very helpful he wanted something in return ill bet montvale said pevsner told charley he thought the agencywhich had quietly contracted for his services over the yearswas trying to arrange his arrest by one of the countries that hold warrants for his arrest so that he could be locked up and his cia contracts would not come to light he went so far as to say he thought the agency would like to terminate him with extreme prejudice now i know we dont do that anymore but the man was worried as a small gesture of my appreciation i authorized charley to tell him that i had ordered the dci and the director of the fbithis is before you became director of national intelligenceto cease all investigations they might have underway and to institute no new investigations without my specific permission what pevsner thought was happening was that the cia was looking for him abroad and the fbi inside the united states if they located him they would either arrest him here on an interpol warrant or furnish his location to one of the governments looking for him such stayoutofjail status to continue so long as pevsner does not violate any law of the united states and with the unspoken understanding that he would continue to be helpful and has this chap continued to be helpful montvale asked he got me access to the helicopter i used to fly to estancia shangrila castillo said hes in argentina i dont know where pevsner is at this moment castillo said i ran into howard kennedy in buenos aires and he arranged for the helicopter thats not an outright lie i just twisted the truth for all i know alek might be in puente del este uruguay not in argentina and kennedy is a former fbi agent who now works for pevsner the president said and what was he doing in argentina he accompanied a loaded with objets dart sent by the saudi royal family from riyadh for the king fahd islamic cultural center in buenos aires and took back to riyadh a load of polo ponies and saddles and other polo accoutrements for the royal family castillo said the airplane no doubt owned by pevsner montvale asked probably sir i didnt ask and this kennedy fellow just turned over a helicopter to you because you asked him is that what youre saying major castillo i would bet that he did so with mr pevsners permission sir but i didnt ask about that either i must say mr president that i find this whole situation amazing what is it they say charles about politics making strange bedfellows i dont understand why this kennedy fellow was concerned that the fbi agent saw him montvale said kennedy is obviously paranoid the president said he thinks the fbi is still looking for him despite my specific orders that the search be called off and that if they find him they will terminate him thats absurd oh i agree for one thing terminating him would be illegal the president said why would they want to well castillo said kennedy thinkshe was a senior agent in the ethical standards division of the fbi before he leftits because he knows where all the fbis skeletons are buried charley the president said correct me if im wrong but wouldnt the secrecy provisions of the finding extend to anything connected with what you were doing down there i mean even to who any of your people saw anywhere i made that point to mr yung sir well that should do it the president said but since the subject came up charles why dont you check with the cia and the fbi to make sure they havent forgotten my specific orders if they have id really like to hear about it i cant believe they would ignore any presidential order mr president check charles please the president said yes mr president charley i didnt hear you say whether you found anything useful at this fellows estancia sir we found an address book a coded address book agent yung said it looks to him like a fairly simple code and that it should be breakable thats underway no sir i came right here from the hotel sir and and what and frankly sir i thought it would be better to see if i still have a job before going over to fort meade to the president cut him off with a raised hand all you found at the estancia was this address book no sir we found written confirmation of what agent yung believed was the money mr lorimer had in uruguayan banks a good deal of money more than he could reasonably have socked away for a rainy day fifteenpointseven million dollars mr president what sort of evidence ambassador montvale asked bankbooks certificates of deposit what the president flashed montvale a very cold look then looked at castillo sir what mr lorimer did was in effect loan the banks the money what we took from the safei have them with me you have what with you montvale asked let me ask the questions charles please the president said and made a give me whatever you have gesture to castillo with both hands castillo some what awkwardly took a handful of colorfully printed documents from his briefcase and handed them to the president the president glanced at them then said youre the linguist charley i have no idea what these say sir theyre certificates signed by officers of the banks involved essentially stating that a payment on demand loan has been made by mr lorimer to their bank and that the bank will honorpaythese things like checks once mr lorimer has endorsed them sort of like bearer bonds mr president but not exactly and these are unsigned yes sir right now theyre as good as an unsigned check castillo said and we have no idea wherespecifically i meanlorimer got all that money do we the secretary of state asked no maam castillo said i thinkhell i knowits oilforfood proceeds but i cant prove it what i was hoping was that we could tie it somehow to one of the names in the address bookassuming we can get that decodedor to one or more of the names i got from another source what other source ambassador montvale asked id rather not say mr ambassador castillo said im the director of national intelligence montvale said icily and i think charley knows that the president said if hed rather not say im sure he has his reasons he paused which are charley sir i promised i would not reveal the identity of that source or share what he gave me without his permission thats absurd montvale snapped i was hoping to get his permission castillo said before i fucked up in uruguay you did say screwed up in uruguay didnt you the president asked i beg your pardon castillo said im very sorry madam secretary ive heard the word before charley natalie cohen said is that about it charley the president asked yes sir except to say mr president how deeply i regret the loss of sergeant kranz and how deeply i regret having failed in the mission you assigned the president did not immediately respond he looked into castillos eyes a moment as he considered that statement then said how do you figure that you have failed charley well sir the bottom line is that i am no closer to finding the people who murdered mr masterson and sergeant markham and shot agent schneider than i was before i went looking for mr lorimer mr lorimer is now dead and well never know what he might have told us if i hadnt botched his castillos voice trailed off as he tried to find the right word repatriation the president offered yes sir and now sergeant kranz is dead i failed you sir charles the president said what about the longterm damage resulting from major castillos failure just off the top of your head mr president i dont see it as a failure secretary hall spoke up the director of national intelligence has the floor mr secretary pray let him continue the president said coldly actually mr president neither do i montvale said actually when i have a moment to think about it quite the opposite you heard him the president pursued this man lorimer is dead we have no proof that natalie can take to the un that he was involved in the oilforfood scandal or anything else and castillo himself admits that hes no closer to finding out who killed masterson and the sergeant than he ever was isnt that failure mr president if i may montvale said cautiously let me point out what i think the majorand that small valiant band of men he had with himhas accomplished what would that be if we accept the premise that mr lorimer was involved in something sordid and the proof of that i submit is that he sequestered somemontvale looked to castillo for helphow many million dollars fifteenpointseven sir castillo offered some sixteen million us dollars in uruguay and that parties unknown tracked him down to uruguay and murdered him to keep him from talking after they abducted mr masterson and later murdered her husband so what charles the president demanded i dont seem to be expressing myself very well mr president montvale said let me put it this way these people whoever they are now know were onto them they have no idea what the major may have learned before he went to south america they have no idea how much lorimer may have told him before they were able to murder him if they hoped to obtain the contents of lorimers safe they failed and they dont know what it did or did not contain so they will presume the worst and that it is now in our possession or possibly worse in the possession of parties unknown they sent their assassins in to murder lorimer and what wewhat the major and his bandgave them in return were six dead assassins and an empty safe and now that we know were onto them god only knows how soon it will be before someone comes to us and rats on the rats you mean the president asked yes sir thats precisely what i mean and im not talking only about identifying the masterson murderersi think it very likely that the major has already rendered them harmlessbut the people who ordered the murders the masterminds of the oilforfood scandal those who have profited from it sir in my judgment the major has not failed he has rendered the country a great service and is to be commended you ever hear charles that great minds run in similar paths i had just about come to the same conclusion but one question charles is what should we do about the sixteen million dollars in the banks in uruguay tell the un its there and let them worry about getting it back actually sir i had an off the top of my head thought about that money according to the major all it takes is lorimers signature on those documents whatever theyre called that the major brought back from the hideaway to have that money transferred anywhere but lorimers dead the president said they have some very talented people over in langley if the president gets my meaning you mean forge a dead mans signature and steal the money for what purpose mr president i admit that when i first learned what you were asking the major to do i was something less than enthusiastic but i was wrong and i admit it a small unit like the majors can obviously be very valuable in this new world war and if sixteen million dollars were available to itsixteen million untraceable dollars i take your point charles the president said but im going to ask you to stop thinking off the top of your head sir the next thing youre likely to suggest is that charleyand thats his name charles not the majormove the office of organizational analysis into the office of the director of national intelligence and thats not going to happen charley works for me period not open for comment secretary hall had a sudden coughing spasm his face grew red ambassador montvale did not seem to suspect that secretary hall might be concealing a hearty laugh natalie do you have anything to say before i send charley out of here to take with my profound thanks a little time off after he lets everybody in his apartment go of course i was thinking about ambassador lorimer sir hes ill and it will devastate him to learn what his son has been up to ambassador philippe lorimer jeanpaul lorimers father had retired from the foreign service of the united states after a lengthy and distinguished career after suffering a series of progressively more lifethreatening heart attacks jesus i hadnt thought about that the president said charley what about it sir mr lorimer is missing in paris charley said the man who died in estancia shangrila was jeanpaul bertrand a lebanese i dont think anyone will be anxious to reveal who bertrand really was and i dont think we have to or should what about his sister natalie cohen asked should she be told i think so yes charley said i havent thought this through but i have been thinking that the one thing i could tell mr masterson that would put her mind at rest about the threats to her children is that i know her brother is dead and with his death these bastardsexcuse methese bad guys have no more interest in her or her children and if she asks how you know under what circumstances the president asked thats what i havent thought through sir you dont want to tell her what a despicable sonofabitch he was is that it i suspect she knows sir but its classified top secret presidential would anyone have objections to my authorizing charley to deal with the masterson family in any way he determines best including the divulgence of classified material splendid idea mr president ambassador montvale said do it soon charley please natalie cohen said yes maam the president stood up and came around the desk and offered castillo his hand thank you charley good job go home and get some rest and then think where you can discreetly hide sixteen million dollars until you need it two room the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc august when major c g castillo pushed open the door to his apartmentthe hotel referred to room as an executive suite it consisted of a living room a large bedroom a small dining room and a second bedroomhe found colonel jacob torine sprawled on one of the couches watching the oreilly factor on the fox news channel torines feet were on the coffee table and his right hand was wrapped around a heineken beer bottle which rested on his chest corporal lester bradley usmc sat beside him feet on the floor holding a halfempty bottle of cocacola he was puffing on a large dark brown cigar well i may not get cashiered castillo thought but if somebody sees him with that cigar ill certainly be charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor the obvious source of bradleys cigar fernando lopez sat puffing on its twin across a chessboard from special agent david w yung jr of the fbi special agent jack britton of the secret service watched them with amused interest it looked to him as if the kid was clobbering lopez major h richard miller jr in civilian clothing sat in an armchair his left leg heavily bandaged rested on the coffee table miller and castillo had been classmates and roommates at west point they had served together several times during their careers most recently with the night stalkers more formally known as the th special operations aviation regiment everybody turned to look at castillo what happened to your cast castillo asked looking at miller they took pity on me and sawed it off i am now down to two miles of rubberized gauze miller said and hows the knee time will tell miller said disgustedly then asked well how did it go with the president well i dont think well all wind up in alaska counting snowballs castillo announced you really didnt think something like that was going to happen did you charley torine asked actually i bear a message from the commander in chief castillo said quote good job thank you end quote what did you expect charley torine pursued we lost kranz and they blew lorimer away before we could talk to him castillo said how does that add up to a good job you found the sonofabitch miller said and in doing so removed the threat to the mastersons thats a good job charley in my book or anybody elses can britton and i go home now gringo fernando asked to try to salvage what we can from the ashes of our marriages is that all the president had to say torine asked montvale was there castillo said and hall and natalie cohen castillo said how effusive was the ambassador in his praise for our little undertaking torine said castillo chuckled actually he called youusthe major and his small valiant band of men no kidding torine said well i can live with that he actually tried to take usthe office of organizational analysisover oh shit torine said he didnt get away with it castillo said the president cut him off in midsentence leaving us where miller asked were still in business castillo said the president was very clear about that he looked at miller colonel torines brought you up to speed on everything right dick miller nodded david we have something with lorimers signature on it dont we castillo asked yung nodded well as soon as possible take it over to langley castillo said that means right now something with lorimers signature on it and the bearer bonds or whatever the hell theyre called why yung asked so the agencys finest forgers can put lorimers signature on the bearer bonds and we can grab the money its now our operating budget lovely idea torine said fifteenpointseven million is a nice little operating budget but what are you going to do when montvale finds out about it and he will actually it was his idea castillo said admittedly while he was still thinking he could bring us under his benevolent wing where am i supposed to put it yung said good question castillo said ive got an account in the cayman islands yung said at the liechtensteinische landesbank youve got what castillo asked incredulously a pillar of the fbi an expert in uncovering money laundering and youre hiding your own money from the irs in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the cayman islands yung was not amused it was an investigative tool major he said i opened the account both to see how that could be done and so that i could be kept abreast of any changes in their banking laws as a depositor i could ask questions that i could not ask otherwise thats even better castillo said delightedly the fbi has money in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the caymans is nothing sacred anymore what the hell is that britton asked licktenwhat liechtenstein is a little countryrun by a princeabout twenty miles long and five miles wide between switzerland and austria castillo said landesbank means state bank the liechtensteiners make their money growing cows and banking other peoples money actually the funds in the bank are mine yung said using my own money to open the account was easier than trying to get permissionand of course the money itselffrom the fbi and how much of your own money are you sequestering in your liechtensteinische landesbank account twentyfive hundred dollars how hard is it to open an account castillo asked actually its quite simple all they ask is a reference from your home banker and a cashiers check or a wire deposit they wont take cash deposits yung answered well then thats what well do but i want to get that money out of uruguay before they find out lorimer is dead bertrand yung corrected him the funds are in bertrands name okay bertrand castillo said are any questions going to be asked when your secret little account suddenly grows by fifteenpointseven million im not sure i want to do that yung said answer the question castillo said is that going to make waves no questions are ever asked and they have stricter bank secrecy laws than even switzerland but for the obvious reasons i am uncomfortable transferring bertrands funds into my account then why did you tell us about your account torine asked with a tone of impatience in his voice i was going to suggest that you look into opening an account there what castillos asking me to do is commit a felony im an fbi agent dammit jesus h christ torine said fbi rule number one always cover your ass right what im ordering you to do is carry out an order of the president of the united states castillo said i dont believe you have the legal authority to give me an order im in the fbi i dont work for you torine started to say something then changed his mind and looked at castillo castillo said i suppose thats true that you dont work for me right now i guess your status is volunteer major i thoughtstill thinkyou were doing the right thing when you staged that operation to kidnap lorimer from estancia shangrila thats why i went with you but thats not going to go over well at the j edgar hoover building when they hear about it the fbi is supposed to investigate kidnappings not participate in them and you dont want to endanger your fbi career any more than you already have torine asked sarcastically yung considered that and then nodded yung torine said evenly if youre even thinking of running over to the j edgar hoover building and repeating even one word of this conversation or one detail of the operation we have just been on into some sympathetic fbi inspectors ear i suggest you think again that would constitute the divulgence of material classified top secret presidential to persons not authorized access to such material and that is a felony castillo added and that includes telling anybody you bumped into howard kennedy in buenos aires yung looked at him coldly let me be brutal castillo said supposing you went to the fbi and confessed all and it was decided for a number of reasons not to try you for unauthorized disclosure are you really naive enough to think youd be welcomed back like the prodigal son or is it more likely that youd spend the rest of your fbi career investigating parking ticket corruption in sioux falls south dakota the look on yungs face showed that castillo had struck home right now the question seems to be that you dont think i have the authority to give you orders is that right i dont believe you have that legal authority yung said what if i got it would that change things how could you do that castillo sat down on the couch next to corporal lester bradley and picked up the telephone he punched in a number from memory this is c g castillo he announced a moment later is secretary hall still with the president can you get him for me please charley sir sorry to interrupt yung would feel more comfortable dealing with that banking business we discussed earlier if he was assigned to the office of organizational analysis and therefore under my orders is that going to be a problem the sooner the better sir by the time the banks open in the morning tonight would be even better hell be with miller here in my apartment sir yes sir there was a sixtysecond period of silence yes sir thank you very much sir no sir im going to go to philadelphia and then to biloxi maybe still tonight if theres a way to get from philadelphia to biloxi in any event as soon as i can sir yes sir ill let you and secretary cohen know how that went as soon as i can yes sir i will thank you very much sir castillo put the handset back in the cradle and looked at yung secretary hall tells me the president has put in a call to the director of the fbi when he gets him or his deputy he will order that you be placed on duty with the office of organizational analysis either the director or his deputy will call you here and tell you that that will place you under my orders any questions yung shook his head let me take this opportunity to welcome you to the office of organizational analysis mr yung castillo said mock portentously we hope your career with us will last as long as the organization itselfin other words maybe for the next two or three weeks torine laughed others chuckled a smilesmall but unmistakablecrossed yungs lips just as soon as i canwithin a day or twoi will open another account in the liechtensteinische landesbank castillo said well get the money out of your account as soon as possible yung nodded you ever been to langley yung miller asked yung shook his head ill take you over there miller said and then had a second thought better yet charley tom mcguire knows his way around there better than i do you know where to find him miller nodded ask him to do that please castillo said how hard is it going to be to get vic dallessando on the horn miller held out a cellular telephone castillo went and took it from him autodial seven miller said i dont know when ill be able to get to biloxi castillo explained but i want to see vic before i see the mastersons itll probably be in the very wee hours when we get there fernando said but if you go with me ill bet youll get there sooner than if you went commercial i want to go to philadelphia first castillo said so does jack fernando said jacks wife is with her mother in philly the planned itinerary is reagan to philly then after you see your lady friend philly to charleston where we drop the colonel off then charleston to san antone no problem to drop you off in biloxi youre going to charleston by way of philadelphia castillo asked torine you cant catch a plane from here the oldest member of this small valiant band of men torine said having just returned from a tour of the world is in no condition to pass through airport security especially in possession of an uzi and a case of untaxed brandy that i dont want to have to try to explain castillo chuckled untaxed brandy fernando told me you had bought your grandmother a case of argentine brandy at twelve bucks a bottle i figured if it was good enough for your grandmother it would be a suitable expression of my affection for my wife its really good brandy castillo said and best of all its not french its a sad world charley where boycotting the products of those who have screwed you interferes with your drinking habits but thats the way it is castillo chuckled okay lets get this show on the road while i call dallessando somebody call the doorman and have him get us a couple of cabs theres a big yukon stationed at the national geographic exit miller said and since im not going anywhere you can use that great castillo said sir what about me corporal lester bradley asked castillo looked at him a long moment before replying you better come with me bradley he said finally sir may i ask what im going to be doing you can ask but i cant tell you because i havent figured that out yet three the belle vista casino and resort us highway the magic mile biloxi mississippi august inside the resort as c g castillo and lester bradley in civilian clothing approached the main entrance of the casino a burly host came out from behind a small standup desk and not very politely asked bradley how old he was and then when told shook his head and said he couldnt go in wait right here bradley castillo ordered ill be right out yes sir castillo entered the casino and walked past rows of slot machines at which maybe a quarter of them sat gamblers most of them middleaged and elderly women beyond the slot machines was an arch with a flashing gaming sign on it castillo walked under it and found himself in a huge area filled with tables for the playing of blackjack craps and roulette perhaps a third of them were in use he saw vic dallessandos totally bald head at one of the blackjack tables deep in the room he walked toward the table and stopped six feet from it there was a sign on the table indicating the minimum bet was ten dollars there were five stacks of chips in front of dallessando he tapped them steadily with the fingers of his left hand as he watched the dealer deal even if they were all tendollar chipsand theyre obviously not since each stack is a different color which means theyre worth even morevic is into this game bigtime he watched a little longer saw that vic was playing two cards at a time and then walked up behind him dallessando sensed his presence and turned to see who was behind him he gave no sign of recognition the dealer busted and passed out chips to both of the cards dallessando was playing thatll do it dallessando said then slid a tip of two chips to the dealer and started to gather up the remainder of his chips the dealer slid a rack to him thanks dallessando said and put the chips in the rack oh goody castillo said i brought you luck dallessando snorted he arranged the chips in the rack and stood up he was a short man whose barrel chest and upper arms strained his shirt cashiers over there dallessando said indicating the direction with a nod of his head on his retirement from twentyfour years of servicetwentytwo of it in special forcescwo victor dallessando had gone to work for the special operations command as a department of the army civilian theoretically he was a technical advisor to the commanding general of the john f kennedy special warfare center at fort bragg what he actually did for the special operations command was classified at the cashiers window a peroxide blonde in her fifties counted the chips then asked if dallessando wanted his winnings as a check cash will do nicely thank you dallessando said the peroxide blonde began to lay crisp new onehundreddollar bills in stacks ten bills to a stack there were four stacks then she started a fifth stack with fifties twenties a ten and finally a five jesus christ vic castillo said you had a good night dallessando grunted again stuffed the money in the inside pocket of his lemoncolored sports coat and started for the door castillo followed him dallessando made a give it to me gesture to the host who had refused to let bradley into the casino the host unlocked a small drawer in the standup desk and tried to discreetly hand dallessando a colt general officers model acp semiautomatic pistol the discretion failed dallessando hoisted the skirt of his sports coat and slipped the pistol into a skeleton holster over his right hip pocket they wont let you carry a weapon in there dallessando said i guess losers have been known to pop the dealers castillo chuckled the host was not amused elevators over there dallessando said again nodding to show the direction i know oh yeah masterson said youd been here you get to talk to him castillo asked as they walked and bradley followed hell be here at eight for breakfast when they reached the bank of elevators dallessando took a plastic card key from his jacket pocket and swiped it through a reader the elevator door opened dallessando waved castillo into it bradley started to get on sorry my friend dallessando said this elevator is reserved for bigtime losers hes with me castillo said dallessando shrugged and stepped out of the way when the door closed castillo said bradley this is mr dallessando vic this is corporal lester bradley hes a marine youre in bad company kid dallessando said watch yourself hes a friend of mine vic even worse the elevator stopped and dallessando swiped the plastic key again the door opened welcome to penthouse c dallessando said wow bradley exclaimed they were in an elegantly furnished suite of rooms two walls of the main room were plate glass offering a view of what was now an intermittent stream of red lights going west on us white lights going east in the daylight the view would be of the sugar white sand beaches and emerald salt water of the mississippi gulf coast my sentiments exactly bradley castillo said you want a drink charley dallessando asked at four oclock in the morning it would not be your first drink at four in the morning dallessando said true castillo said what the hell why not theres wine theres a whole bin full of it behind the bar dallessando said you want something to drink bradley castillo asked im a little hungry sir bradley said som i castillo said theres roundtheclock room service right vic indeed castillo picked up the telephone and punched a button on the base what kind of steak can i have at this unholy hour he said into the phone he was told new york strip sounds fine castillo looked at bradley who smiled and nodded and then at dallessando who said why not i can think of it as breakfast get mine with eggs three new york strips medium rare with fried eggs either home fries or french fries and whatever else seems appropriate for two starving men and an old fat italian who really shouldnt be eating at all dallessando gave him the finger as he hung up the phone so tell me marine dallessando said to bradley how did this evil man worm his way into your life he saved my life vic castillo said dallessando looked at bradley not to worry he said youre a young man in time youll be forgiven castillo shook his head you going to have a drink before or after you tell me whats going on charley yes castillo said and went behind the bar in search of wine if you promise not to tell your mother marine you may also have a little taste dallessando said leave him alone vic castillo said i wasnt kidding when i said hes a friend of mine you also said he saved your life dallessando said he did and hownot to get into why in the name of all the saintsdid he do that he took out two bad guys who were shooting submachine guns at me with two headshots i have this very odd feeling that youre not pulling my chain dallessando said forgive me son if i say you do not look much like the ferocious jarhead of fame and legend says the special operations poster boy castillo said you always have had a cruel streak in you carlos dallessando lisped as he put his hand on his hip bradley chuckled i have an idea charley dallessando said take it from the top castillo held up a wineglass to bradley no thank you sir is there any beer half a dozen kinds come over here and help yourself and while youre doing that major castillo is going to take it from the top okay castillo said vic this is top secret presidential okay dallessando said now very seriously you remember i told you here that masterson had been whacked to make the point to his wife that these bastards were willing to kill to get to her brother dallessando nodded the un guy in paris castillo nodded what i didnt tell you is that there is a presidential finding in which an organization called the office of organizational analysis is founded c and c dallessando interrupted castillo nodded covert and clandestine he went on and charged with quote rendering harmless end quote those responsible for whacking masterson sergeant markham kidnapping mr masterson and wounding special agent schneider i figured there was something like that in the woodpile dallessando said whos running that i am dallessando considered that and nodded then asked and you found out who these people are huh i dont have a clue who they are youre losing me charley i figured the best way to find these people was to find lorimer first so we went looking for him we found him in uruguay uruguay uruguay castillo confirmed we also found out that mr lorimer was the bagmanthe bagmanfor the guys who got rich on the iraqi oilforfood scam he knew who got how much and what for and they wanted to silence him dallessando said but whats with uruguay uruguay and argentina are now the safe havens of choice for illgotten gains i knew argentina and paraguay but this is the first ive heard about uruguay i really dont know what im talking about here vic i always heard argentina and paraguay too but uruguay is where we found lorimer he had a new identityjeanpaul bertranda lebanese passport a uruguayan residence permit and an estancia everybody thought he was in the antiquities business clever dallessando said he also ripped off nearly sixteen million from these people you never said who these people are i dont have a fucking clue vic castillo said anyway once we found lorimer i staged an operation to repatriate him mcnab sent people down there i didnt hear anything about that whod he send he didnt send anybody i didnt have time to wait for anybody from the stockade i went with what i had which was kranz and kensington were already down there as communicators so i used them plus two secret service guys a dea agent an fbi agent and bradley dallessando pointed at bradley who was now sucking at the neck of a coors beer bottle and raised his eyebrows yeah that bradley castillo said and then went on the cia station chiefs in buenos aires helped and i had an argentineexsidewith me i thought it was do it right then or dont do it all if i could find lorimer so could the bad guys yeah so what were you going to do with lorimer when you found him get him to the states how i had the learyou saw it here you took that to south america by way of europe castillo said across the atlantic twice dallessando asked incredulously that was interesting castillo said but jake torine said we could do it and we did i borrowed a jetranger in uruguay the last time you borrowed a helicopter you nearly went to leavenworth dallessando said is interpol looking for you charley no i really borrowed this one from a friend and he will keep his mouth shut when people start asking him questions its in his interest to keep his mouth shut dallessando shrugged suggesting he hoped this would be the case but didnt think so the plan was to snatch lorimer at his estancia chopper him nap of the earth to buenos aires put him on the lear and bring him to the states the exside guy had arranged for us get the lear out of argentina without questions being asked but something went wrong right the bestlaid plans of mice and special operators etcetera we had just gotten him to open his safe when somebody stuck a madsen through the window and let loose lorimer took two hits to the head and the side guy took one in the arm and then bradley took the shooter out with a head shot from kranzs remington and then took out the shooters pal both head shots he saved my ass vic dallessando looked at bradley consider all my kind thoughts about your touching innocence withdrawn he said just doing my job sir corporal bradley said dallessandos eyebrow rose but he didnt say anything and when bradley was popping these people with seymours rifle where was seymour getting himself garroted castillo said softly no shit how the hell did that happen kranz was no amateur neither obviously were the bad guys it was a stainless steel garrote with handles well who the hell were they i dont know vic there ensued a brief exchange of smallarms fire during which three more of the bad guys met their fate kensington found the last of them number six lying on the ground near kranz seymour had gotten a knife into him before going down and kensington finished him off castillo nodded understandablethose two went way back togetherbut inexcusable he should have remembered that dead people dont talk much i mentioned that to him castillo said so you hauled your ass out of wherever you were after kensington took a mm bullet out of the exside guy and what was in the a safe an address book and withdrawal slips for the money lorimer had squirreled away in uruguayan banks you got the money what did you say sixteen million i think we should have it first thing in the morning and whats in the address book its in code itll be at fort meade at eight this morning when they do their thing ill be able to have a good look anyway we got the hell out of there and the hell out of south america seymour you didnt leave him there we left lorimer and the six bad guys thereno identification on any of themand dropped kranz off at macdill on the way to washington and then you came here why i wanted your opinion vic well thats a first mr masterson told me the bad guys wanted lorimer and that was why they executed masterson to make the point they were willing to kill to find him well hes been found the bad guys are going to hear that hes dead does that remove the threat from the masterson family unless the bad guys really want their sixteen million back we dont know that its the bad guys sixteen million or that they know we have it they may have been after lorimer just to shut him up or both dallessando said whack him and get their money back or both castillo admitted anything happen here to suggest theyre watching her not a thing we have taps on all the phones including the cellulars nothing and no tourists at the plantation either id like to tell her i think the threat is gone and id like to take my guys back to the stockade dallessando said theyre getting a little antsy i didnt tell them why theyre here and theyre starting to think of themselves as babysitters thank god the widowand mastersons fatherare such good people what had once been the military prisonthe stockadeat fort bragg now held the barracks and headquarters of delta force the elite immediateresponse special forces unit the same barbed wire that had kept prisoners in now kept people without the proper clearances out howre you doing with people from china post many former special forces soldiers marine force recon navy seals air commandos and other warriors of this ilk belong to china post in exile from shanghai of the american legion those wishing to employ this sort of people in a civilian capacity often have luck finding just what they want at china post i guess you know general mcnab called them castillo nodded he told me he was going to that helped ive got eight guys good guysi guess theyre getting a little tired of commuting to iraq and afghanistanlined up theyre going to be expensive but masterson said that wasnt a problem its not how soon can they be up and running fortyeight hours tops and theyll be on the job i want to run this whole thing past mastersonand the widowbut i dont think theyll object how about first thing in the morning getting that going this is first thing in the morning castillo looked at his watch half past four which means its half past ten in germany which brings me to this he walked to the bar picked up a telephone and punched in a long series of numbers from memory four executive offices gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh fulda hesse germany august frau gertrud schroder a stocky sixtyyearold who wore her blond hair in a bun put her head in the office door of otto gorner the managing director of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh she had on a wireless headset karlchen is favoring you with a call she announced her hand covering the microphone how kind of him gorner replied he was a welltailored sixtyyearold hessian whose bulk and red cheeks made him look like a postcard bavarian as he reached for one of the telephones on his desk he added well at least hes alive frau schroder walked to the desk and gorner waved her into a chair opposite him and how are things in south america gorner said into the handset i have no idea im in mississippi and im fine thank you for asking may i ask what youre doing in mississippi im in penthouse c of the belle vista casino in biloxi about to have steak and eggs for breakfast why do i suspect that for once youre telling me the truth but speaking of south america you might take a look at the reuters and ap wires from uruguay starting about now really i think both you and eric kocian might be interested in what might come over the wire well ill keep an eye out if you say so it might be a good idea is that why you called karl or is there something else on your mind actually there is how much trouble would it be for frau schroder to open a bank account for me in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the cayman islands why would you want to do something like that and put say ten thousand euros in it why would you want to do something like that gorner asked again ive always been frugal you know that otto a penny saved as benjamin franklin said is a penny earned gott frau schroder shook her head and smiled gorner gave her a dirty look and tell them to expect a rather large transfer of funds into the account in the next few days please castillo said i really hate to ask this question but didnt you just say youre in the penthouse of a casino in the belle vista casino and did you put the penthouse on the tages zeitungs american express card no actually im staying here free how much did you lose to get them to give you a free room a penthouse suite why do you think i lost gorner exhaled audibly when do you want this bank account opened how about today if youre telling the truthand i would be surprised if you areand youre trying to hide money from the irs youre probably going to get caught thank you for your concern just have frau schroder open the account and email me the number so i can make a deposit ill worry about getting the money out later all right karl but i wish i really knew what youre up to this time ill tell you the next time i see you and when will that be maybe soon im going from here to see my grandmother and then ill probably come over there i hope i can believe that tell frau schroder thanks otto ive got to run the line went dead gorner put the handset in the cradle and frau schroder took off her headset i wonder what thats all about he asked gambling i never knew of his gambling not with money gorner said the last i heard when he was in budapest with eric and me he was goingthey were all goingto argentina i wonder what were supposed to find on the south american wires he said uruguay wires i wonder what were supposed to find on the uruguay wires gorner shrugged is there going to be any trouble with opening that account dont we have some money in the liechtensteinische landesbank quite a bit actually she said ill send them a wire and have them open an account for him shouldnt be any trouble at all she paused the question is though in whose name do i open it i think were supposed to cleverly deduce who he is right now shall i try to get him back and ask him gorner thought that over for a moment and then said no open it for karl w gossinger thatll raise fewer questions than if we opened it for carlos castillo five penthouse c the belle vista casino and resort us highway the magic mile biloxi mississippi august vic dallessando smiling and shaking his head pointed to corporal lester bradley usmc who was sitting sound asleep in an armchair castillo smiled and then motioned for dallessando to go into the bedroom he followed him in and closed the door jesus christ hes just a kid dallessando said you going to tell me what hes doing here i didnt know what else to do with him castillo said meaning hes seen too much hes heard too much hes done too much hes either eighteen or nineteen and i wonder if he can keep his mouth shut oh dallessando said i couldnt leave him in buenos aires castillo went on hes in the marine guard detachment at the embassy i think he was the clerk the detachment is run by a gunnery sergeantgood guybut a gunnery sergeant whos going to ask the moment he sees him lester my boy where have you been and what have you been doing yeah dallessando agreed as a rule of thumb marine corporals when a gunny asks a question answer it castillo said even if some army major has told them to keep their mouth shut dallessando said and since you cant have the gunny knowing what went down you have a problem charley yeah compounded by the fact that bradley not only saved my bacon but i really like him isnt his gunny going to wonder where the hell he is i told alex darby to tell the ambassador i exfiltrated bradley with us thatll hold off the gunny for a couple of days but even if the ambassador and darby tell the gunny not to get curious he will so get him out from under the gunny get him transferred out can you do that get him transferred where welcome to camp lejeune corporal bradley where have you been what have you been doing and why have you suddenly been transferred here what do you mean you cant tell me its classified top secret presidential yeah dallessando agreed again chuckling okay stash him at bragg call mcnab and tell him the problem a marine corporal would stand out like a sore thumb at the special warfare center not necessarily dallessando said theres been some talk about taking some marinesa lot of marines two or three thousandinto special operations another of schoomakers brainstorms i think general peter j schoomaker was chief of staff of the us army schoomakers one of us vic castillo said yeah i know i knew him then too i was the armorer on his ateam good guy i wasnt saying its a bad idea just where i think it came from anyway what theyre doing right now is running some marinesmostly from their force reconthrough the q course so they can tell us what were doing wrong i guess anyway we can stash the kid with them where corporal bradley would stand out like a sore thumb among the hardy warriors of marine force recon castillo said he chuckled most of them have gone through that seal body building course on the west coast and look like arnold schwarzenegger thats my best shot charley take it or leave it ill take it ill call general mcnab ill deal with mcnab just leave the kid here with me there will be a special ops king air here around noon ill put him on it and itll take him to bragg thanks vic as they were walking out of the bedroom there was a melodious chime and vic dallessando walked to the door and pulled it open good morning mr masterson he said come on in im sorry to be late j winslow masterson said it was unavoidable he was a very tall very black sharpfeatured man wearing a crisp beautifully tailored offwhite linen suit he held a panama hat in his hand castillo smiled as what his grandfather had said about linen suitsor rather about seersucker suitspopped into his memory the reason i wear seersucker suits is they come from the tailor mussed and people expect that when i put on a linen suit its mussed in ten minutes and people come up to me sure that i know where they can find dope or whores or both youre smiling charley masterson said crossing the room with large strides to put out his hand there must be good news castillo was finally able to get off the couch actually sir when i saw that beautiful suit i thought of something my grandfather said id love to hear it masterson said charley repeated his grandfathers trenchant comment masterson laughed your grandfather had a way with words he said did you ever tell mr dallessando about lyndon johnson no sir mr castillo had a magnificent bull registered as lyndon johnson the animal from the time it was a calf had eaten heartily and therefore had droppings far above average no kidding dallessando said laughing i didnt know you knew charleys grandfather not as well as i would have liked masterson said he looked expectantly at castillo yes sir i have news whether its good or not is a tough call may i help myself to your coffee masterson asked oh hell excuse me dallessando said let me get it for you im old but i can still pour my own coffee thank you just the same as he walked to the wet bar masterson saw corporal lester bradley for the first time bradley was dozing in an armchair masterson looked curiously at castillo thats corporal bradley of the marine corps sir castillo said that woke bradley up he erupted from the armchair saw masterson and quickly came to attention dallessando smiled and shook his head at ease corporal castillo said this is mr mastersons father bradley yes sir bradley said bradley was involved in the protection of the family in buenos aires castillo said how do you do corporal masterson said advancing on bradley with his hand extended im very pleased to meet you god hes really a gentleman castillo thought youd never know from his face thats hes wondering what this boy could possibly have been doing on a protection detail what hes doing is putting him at ease thats class how do you do sir bradley said please sit down masterson said bradley looked at castillo who signaled for him to sit down castillo waited until masterson had poured the coffee sir he began the president has authorized me to tell you and mr masterson anything i think i should ill tell you what i know and you can tell me how much i should tell her whatever you say and i have to tell you sir that this is highly classified and is to go no further than yourself and mr masterson there are two ladies so identified masterson said i will trust your judgment with regard to both and as far as that goes with regard to ambassador and mr lorimer thank you jeanpaul lorimer castillo reported was shot to death by parties unknown at approximately pm local time july in tacuarembo uruguay mastersons eyebrows rose youre sure of this masterson said yes sir i was there castillo said as was corporal bradley bradley took out the men who killed mr lorimer that got mastersons attention he looked first in uncontrollable surprise at bradley and then shifted his curious look to castillo there was a question in his eyes it hung in the air but was not asked mr masterson castillo said carefully once i located mr lorimer it was my intention to repatriate himwillingly or otherwise i had just identified myself to him when he was shot i have two questions masterson said who shot him and what was he doing in uruguay i have no idea who shot him every one of themthere were six men in the group who attacked uswere killed by my people as to what he was doing in uruguay i believe he was trying to establish a new identity actually he had established one he had a lebanese passport in the name of jeanpaul bertrand he was legallyas bertranda resident in uruguay where people believed he was a successful antiquities dealer antiquities dealer can you tell mei have the feeling you knowwhy he was doing something like that apparently he was involved with the iraqi oilforfood scandal specifically i believe as the paymaster he knew who got how much money and when and what for that could have been the reason he was killed additionally i believe he skimmed some of the payoff money he had almost sixteen million dollars in several bank accounts in uruguay he may have been killed as punishment for stealing the money one is not supposed to speak ill of the dead masterson said but that explains a good deal greed would motivate jeanpaul coupled with the delusion that he was smarter than those from whom he was stealing that would give him motivation sufficient to overcome his natural timidity i cant argue with that sir but i just dont know why he did what he did how did you find him and so quickly good question charley dallessando said castillo flashed him a dirty look then said i dont mean to sound flippant but i got lucky and the money what happens to that money sixteen million you said yes sir we have it does anyoneeveryoneknow you have it no sir what are you going to do with it jesus sixteen million dallessando said earning him another dirty look from castillo mr masterson do you remember me telling you the day we came here that the president had ordered ambassador montvale and the attorney general and the secretaries of state and homeland securityeverybodyto give me whatever i needed to track down mr mastersons murderers masterson nodded that was the truth but it wasnt the whole truth in factand this carries the security classification of top secret presidential and if i somehow can id rather not make mr masterson privy to this i understand masterson interjected in fact there has been a presidential finding in which the president set up a covert and clandestine organization charged with locating and rendering harmless those people responsible for the murders of mr masterson and sergeant markham rendering harmless is that something like the terminating with extreme prejudice of the vietnam era just about dallessando said i would rather not answer that sir castillo said i understand and whoif you cant answer ill understandis running this covert and clandestine organization ambassador montvale the cia i am sir and thats something else i would rather not tell mr masterson masterson nodded and pursed his lips thoughtfully the money will be used to fund that activity sir castillo said is that what they call poetic justice masterson said a moment ago i was worried about ambassador lorimer sir jeanpauls only blood kin are his parents and betsy that means unless he left a will bequeathing his earthly possessions to some parisian tootsie which i dont think is likely they are his heirs the ambassador would know there was no way jeanpaul could have honestly accrued that much money that would have been difficult for him and god knows betsy doesnt need itand of course would not want it sir mr lorimer ownedand i dont think it was mortgageda large estanciaa farmin uruguay and he ownedi know he owneda nice apartment on rue monsieur in the vii arrondisement in paris well he lived in paris therefore he needed a place to live many people take insurance to pay off the mortgage on their apartments on their death the same argument could be presented to the ambassador visavis the farm in uruguay which jeanpaul could have acquired in anticipation of his ultimate retirement the question is how do we explain to the ambassador the circumstances of jeanpauls death thats what they call a multiplepart question castillo said let me try to explain what we have by now the local police in tacuarembo have found out what happened the question is what have they found out he let that sink in then continued we plasticcuffed and blindfolded the servants that were in the house he paused one of these was a young uruguayan girl with whom mr lorimer apparently had a close relationship he waited until he saw understanding and what could have been contempt in mastersons eyes and then went on we put herand the estancia manager and his wifeto sleep a safe narcotic administered by someone who knew what he was doing now everybody saw who did the cuffing spanishspeaking masked men wearing balaclava masks you remember when the alcohol firearms and tobacco agents rescued the cuban boy in miami their black ski masks masterson nodded his face showed his contempt for that act and everybody was wearing what are essentially black coveralls that description will be reported to the police when the police arriveand by now they almost certainly havethey will have found six men in dark blue nearly black coveralls but no masks which poses a problem six dead men in coveralls masterson said yes sir plus mr lorimer who they will have found lying on his office floor next to his safe there are no valuables in the safe the best possible scenario is that they will suspect a robbery by the same people who cuffed and needled the servants but theyre now dead masterson said shot treacherously by one or more of their number so that whatever was stolen would not have to be split in so many shares castillo said the local police wont knowor suspectthat someone elseyou and your peoplewere there well we hope not castillo said there is a history of that kind of robberyof isolated estanciasin uruguay and argentina and mr lorimerbertrand a wealthy businessman meets the profile of the sort of people robbed youleft nothing behind that can place you there the only thing we know ofwhich is not saying i didnt screw up somewhere and theyll find something elseis blood i dont understand masterson said when we were bushwhacked by these people we took casualties castillo said one was one of my men who was garroted and the other was an argentine who was helping us he lived but he bled a lot the guy the bastards got was a sergeant first class named seymour kranz dallessando said good guy no amateur which makes me really wonder who these bad guys are ill get to that later vic castillo said do i correctly infer that the sergeant did not live yes sir im really sorry to hear that what happened to his body we exfiltrated it with us castillo said now here the scenario gets very hopeful if american police were investigating a crime like this they would subject the blood to a number of tests they would match blood to bodies among other things im hoping the police in rural uruguay are not going to be so thorough that they wont come up with a blood sample or samples that dont match the bodies my god seven bodies is a massacre they wont ask for help fromwhatthe uruguayan equivalent of the fbi a police organization that will be thorough im counting on that sir thats how it will be learned that mr bertrand is really mr lorimer how will that happen mr lorimer had a photo album sir one of the photographs was of mr mastersons wedding the wedding party is standing in front of a church cathedral masterson corrected him saint louis cathedral on jackson square in new orleans jack and betsy were married there the whole familyincluding mr lorimeris in the photo sir im almost sure that a senior police officer from montevideo will recognize mr masterson maybe even one of the local cops will mr mastersons murder was big news down there its what the police call a lead i cant believe they wont follow it up and that will result in the identification of mr bertrand if they somehow get the photo to the embassy in buenos aires a man thereactually the cia station chief who was in on the operationis prepared to identify the man in the photo as mr lorimer he knew him in paris if the police are as inept as you suggestand youre probably rightwhat makes you think theyll find much less leaf through jeanpauls photo album because i left it open on mr lorimers desk sir youre very good at this sort of thing arent you masterson said no sir im not there is a vulgar saying in the army that really applies and that is castillo hesitated a moment then said im up way over my ears in the deep shit and i dont know how to swim oh horseshit charley dallessando said you and i go back a long way i know better i agree that its vulgar masterson said but i dont agree at all that it applies you seem to have been born for duties like these and mr dallessando obviously agrees with me mr masterson when i went to west point what i wanted to do with my life was be what my father was an army aviator at least twice a day i curse the fickle finger of fate that kept me from doing that dallessando said the fickle fingers name charley as you damned well know is lieutenant general bruce j mcnab masterson looked between them the first time i ever saw charley mr masterson he was a bushytailed second lieutenant fresh from west point it was during the first desert war general mcnabthat was just before he got his first star right charley castillo nodded colonel mcnab who was running special ops in that war had spotted charley recognized him as a kindred soul rescued him from what he was doingprobably flying cargo missions in a huey he wasnt old enough to be out of flight school long enough to fly anything elseand put him to work as his personal pilot if weve reached the end of memory lane vic castillo said i would like to get on with this dallessando held up both hands in a gesture of surrender well as a father masterson said im sure that your father is proud of what you do he does know no sir my father died in vietnam im sorry charley masterson said i had no way of knowing thank you sir if i may go on please once mr lorimer is identified theres a number of possibilities for one thing he was both an american citizen and a un diplomat god only knows what the un will do when they find out he was murdered in uruguay we dont know what the un knows about mr lorimers involvement with the oilforfood business but im damned sure a number of people in the un do they will obviously want to sweep this under the diplomatic rug by slightly bending the factsthey can say lorimer was on leave somehow the paperwork got lost when we were looking for him to tell him about his sister getting kidnapped and then about mr masterson being murderedthey can issue a statement of shock and regret that he was killed by robbers on his estancia yeah dallessando said thoughtfully once it is established that bertrand is in fact lorimer an american citizen our embassy in montevideo can get in the act for repatriation of the remains for one thing and to take control of his property temporarily pending the designation of someonekin or somebody elseto do that which brings me to that do you think ambassador lorimer would be willing to designate someone to do that the someone i have in mind is an fbi agent in montevideo who was in on the operation give him what would amount to power of attorney in other words id really like to really go through the estancia and see what can be found i dont think he would have any problem with that i dont think he would want toin his conditiongo there himself nor do i think his wife or physician would permit it and the same thing for the apartment in paris i think so now that i have had a chance to think it over theyd be pleased perhaps i can suggest it was offered as a courtesy to a fellow diplomat the sooner that could be done the better of course we have to wait until the scenario i described unfolds if it does itll work charley dallessando said youve got all the angles covered you never have all the angles covered vic and you know it castillo said and then turned to masterson this now brings us to the bad guys im not sure i know what you mean masterson confessed we dont even know who they are do we no sir we dont i intend to do my best to find out who they are and render them harmless masterson asked softly castillo nodded slightly but did not respond directly what they did was find mr lorimer which among other things theyve done suggests that theyre professionals and what they did was send an assault team to the estancia i think its logical to assume they wanted to make sure he didnt talk about what he knows of the oilforfood business and possibly to get back the money he skimmed by now they have certainly learned that their operation succeeded only in taking out mr lorimer and that somebody took out their assault team and they will have to presume the same people who took out their assault team have what was in the safe money or information they dont know who we arewe could be someone else trying to shut lorimer up somebody after the money or uruguayan bandits i dont think its likely that theyll think an american special operations team was involved but they might i think its likely the people who bushwhacked us are the same people who killed mr masterson but of course i cant be sure but if they areor even if its a second groupand they are professional i think the decision will be to go to ground they may be capable ofit wouldnt surprise meof keeping an eye on her bank accounts or yours to see if they suddenly get sixteen million dollars heavier but thats not going to happen what im driving at is there is no longer a reason for them to try to get to mr masterson or the children lorimer is out of the picture and she has nothing they want to give them you think we can remove mr dallessandos people is that what youre saying masterson asked well they cant stay indefinitely castillo said and vic tells me hes run the retired special operators from china post past you very impressive masterson said and very expensive castillo asked uhhuh masterson said but what i was thinking was that the childrenfor that matter betsy toowould probably be more at ease with them than they are now with all of mr dallessandos people they must have grown used to private security people in buenos aires the people i brought over here are good mr masterson dallessando said and frankly a job like this is better than commuting to iraq or afghanistan which is what theyve all been doing okay so thats what ill recommend to betsy masterson said when do you want to talk to her charley now if possible sir im on my way to texas i want to see my grandmother and i can be with her only until they call me to tell me whats happened in uruguay ill get her on the phone masterson said as he reached for it and ill get you a car to take you to the airport thats not necessary sir biloxi or new orleans masterson asked new orleans sir iii one office of the legal attache the embassy of the united states of america lauro miller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august the telephone on the desk of assistant legal attache julio artigas buzzed and one of the six buttons on it began to flash artigas a slim oliveskinned cuban american of thirty who had been a special agent of the federal bureau of investigation for eight years and assigned to the montevideo embassy for three picked up the handset artigas julio this is your cousin jose his caller said in spanish thirtysevenyearold chief inspector jose ordonez of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional was not related to julio artigas but they looked very much alike they had several times been mistaken for brothers that wasnt possible without the same surname but it could have been possible for cousins and cousins they had become they also shared a sense of humor and how goes your unrelenting campaign against evil cousin jose julio replied he had arrived in uruguay speaking cubaninflected spanish fluently and with only a little effort he had acquired a uruguayan inflection many uruguayans were surprised to learn he was not a native son i would hope a little better than yours jose said how about lunch is that an invitation or have you been giving your salary away at the blackjack tables again i will pay jose said i will put you on my expense sheet oh i hope you have or can make your afternoon free if you are paying my entire week is free you are so kind where shall we meet someplace expensive of course im at the port how about something from a parrilla great minds travel similar paths when now get out your wallet artigas hung up he opened a drawer in his desk took from it a caliber smith amp wesson detective special revolver then slipped the gun into a skeleton holster on his hip the pistol was his it was smaller and lighter than the semiautomatic pistol prescribed forand issued tofbi agents and technically he was violating at least four fbi regulations by carrying it but this was montevideo where his chances of ever needing a pistol ranged from very slight to none many of artigass peers simply went unarmed the primary mission of the fbi in uruguay was the investigation of money laundering it was a different story for the dea guys who often found themselves in hairy situations while not necessarily successful in stopping the drug flow they were very successful in costing the drug merchants lots of money and consequently were unpopular with the drug establishment they went around heavily armed artigas had chosen the middle ground while it is true that you never need a pistol until you really need one it was equally true there is no sense carrying a large and hardtoconceal cannon when a less conspicuous means of selfdefense is available artigas walked across the large open room to the open door of a glasswalled cubicle that was the office of special agent james d monahan who was because of his seniority the de facto if not the de jure sac or special agent in charge and waited for him to get off the phone something artigas monahan asked finally i have just been invited to lunch by chief inspector ordonez shit i was hoping you were going to tell me you know where the hell yung is fbi special agent david w yung jr a fellow assistant legal attache was not held in high regard by his peers he came to work lateor not at alland left early his research into uruguayan bank records produced about half the useful information that came from the next least efficient of the others and since he was still heredespite several informal complaints about his performance and backchannel suggestions that he be reassigned to the statesit was pretty clear he had friends in high places another less flattering rumor had it that yung had been sort of banished to uruguay because of his association with howard kennedy the former ethical standards division hotshot who had changed sides and was now working for some russian mafioso that rumor had some credence as it was known that yung had been assigned to the ethical standards division it is a fact of life that people without friends in high places tend to dislike those who have them and that fbi agents do not like fbi agents whose personal integrity is open to question maybe still asleep artigas asked its not quite noon i let his goddamned phone ring for five minutes that sonofabitch monahan paused ordonez say what he wanted only that he hoped i could make my afternoon free et tu artigas hes got something on his mind jim artigas said ride it out monahan said but if you happen to run into yung in a bar or a casino somewhere would you please tell him that i would be grateful for a moment of his valuable time whenever its convenient i will do that artigas went out the front entrance of the embassy found his cara blue chrysler pt cruisergot in and drove to the gate the embassy a fourstory oblong concrete edifice decorated with two huge satellite antennae on the roof sits in the center of a wellprotected compound overlooking the river plate a heavy steel gate painted light blue is controlled by pistolarmed uruguayan security guards wearing policestyle uniforms for reasons artigas never understood cars leaving the compound are subjected to just about as close scrutiny as those coming into the compound he waited patiently while security guards looked into the interior of the pt cruiser looked under it using a mirror mounted on the end of a long pole and then checked his embassy identification before throwing the switch that caused the gate to slide open sideways he drove a hundred yards toward the water and then turned right on the rambla the road that runs along the coast from the port to the suburb of carrasco where many embassy officers lived including artigas and the againmissing yung five minutes later he pulled the nose of the pt cruiser to the curb in front of what had been built sometime in the late nineteenth century to house cattle being shipped from the port it now housed a dozen or more parrilla restaurants and at least that many bars he got a very dirty look from the woman charged with collecting parking fees on that section of the street she had seen the diplomatic license plates on the car diplomats are permitted to park wherever they wish to park without paying in the interests of uruguayanamerican relations artigas handed her a fiftypeso note worth a little less than two dollars us and earned himself a warm smile he entered the building with the exception of one or two women julio could think of there was in his judgment no better smell in the world than that of beefand for that matter chicken and pork and a lot elsebeing grilled over the ashes of a wood fire as he walked to where he knew ordonez would meet himone of the smaller more expensive restaurants in the back of the old buildinghis mouth actually watered chief inspector ordonez was waiting for him and stood up when he saw artigas coming they embraced and kissed in the manner of latin males and then sat down at the small table there was a bottle of wine on the table a bottle of carbonated water four stemmed glasses a wicker basket holding a variety of bread and breadsticks a small plate of butter curls and a small dish of chicken liver pate jose poured wine for julio and they touched glasses there must be something on your mind julio said this is the good merlot how about seven males six of them dressed in black shot to death artigas thought i dont think hes kidding he took a sip of the merlot then spread liver pate on a chunk of hardcrusted bread and waited for ordonez to go on you dont seem surprised jose said im an fbi agent we try to be inscrutable a waiter appeared julio ordered a blue cheese empanada bife chorizo medium rare papas frit as and an onionandtomato salad jose held up two fingers signaling the waiter hed have the same and where are these deceased ninja warriors julio asked jose chuckled on an estanciacalled shangrilanear tacuarembo julio signaled with a quick shake of his head that he had no idea where tacuarembo was its about three hundred sixty kilometers due north jose said on highway he paused i was hoping you might go up there with me thats a long ride less long in a helicopter julio knew the use of rotarywing aircraft by uruguayan police was not common even for the movement of very senior officers am i being invited as a friend or officially julio said why dont we decide that after we have a look around estancia shangrila jose replied okay julio paused tell me cousin would i happen to knowor even have metthe owner of estancia shangrila you tell me he iswasa lebanese dealer in antiquities by the name of jeanpaul bertrand julio shook his head and asked and had you a professional interest in senorwhat was his name jeanpaul bertrand jose furnished bertrand before he was killed jose shook his head he was as clean as a whistle so far as i have been able to determine the waiter returned with their empanadas and they cut off their conversation they might have returned to it had not two strikingly beautiful young women come in the restaurant they didnt hurry their lunch but they didnt dawdle over it either twentyfive minutes after julio had taken his first sip of the merlot the bottle was empty and jose was settling the bill with the waiter when they left the former cattle shed they walked across the street to the navy base julio sawwith some surprisethat the helicopter waiting for them was not one of the some what battered policia nacionals bell hueys he expected but a glistening aerospatiale dauphin the pilot was a navy officer julio suspected it was the uruguayan presidents personal helicopter that meant obviously that someone high in the uruguayan governmentperhaps even the president himselfconsidered what had happened at estancia shangrila very important two estancia shangrila tacuarembo province republica orientale del uruguay august as the dauphin fluttered down onto a field julio saw that there were a dozen police vehicles and two ambulances parked unevenly around the main building of the estancia and that there were twentyfive or thirty peoplemany in police uniformmilling about julio had an unkind thought well so much for preserving the crime scene two portly senior police officers walked warily toward the helicopter both saluted chief inspector ordonez as he stepped down from the chopper he returned their salutes with a casual wave of his hand julio remembered seeing him in uniform only once when fidel castro a year or so before had come to montevideo and ordonez had been head of the protection detail this is senor artigas chief inspector ordonez said you will answer any questions he puts to you both of the policemen saluted julio responded with a nod and offered them his hand i ordered that nothing be touched ordonez questioned we have covered the bodies chief inspector but everything else is exactly as it was when we first came here ordonez met artigass eyes it was clear to both they were thinking exactly the same thing the curious had satisfied their curiosity the crime scene had been trampled beyond use ordonez gestured with his hand that he be shown there were two bodies on a covered veranda they were covered with heavy black plastic sheeting artigas wondered if that was the local version of a body bag or whether the sheeting had just been available and put to use a large pool of blood now dried black had escaped the plastic over the first body when at ordonezs impatient gesture the plastic sheeting was pulled aside the reason was clear this man had died of a gunshot wound to the head there is a great deal of blood in the head and not a pistol round either i dont think his head had exploded the body was dressed in dark blue almost black cotton coveralls the sort worn by mechanics what looked like the barrel of a submachine gun was visible in the pool of dried blood the dead man had fallen on his weapon artigas felt a gentle touch on his arm and looked down to see that ordonez was handing him disposable rubber gloves this has been photographed ordonez asked yes chief inspector from many angles ordonez squatted and pulled the weapon out from under the body it was a submachine gun its stock folded he held it out for artigas to see madsen right he asked yes artigas said thats the mm i think ordonez raised the barrel so that he could see the muzzle then nodded artigas looked around and saw a glint in the grass just beyond the veranda he walked to it it was a cartridge case have you got a position on this and photographs my sergeant must have missed that senor the heftier of the two local police supervisors said and angrily called for the sergeant when artigas went back on the veranda he saw that ordonez had replaced the black plastic over the body and had moved ten meters down the veranda where another police officer was pulling the plastic off another body this one too was dressed in nearly black coveralls another large pool of dried black blood from another exploded head as he squatted by the body ordonez looked at artigas and asked what did you see a cartridge casing looks like a mm i wonder where this ones weapon went to ordonez asked studying the body he pointed to a disturbance in the blood that could have been the marks left when someone had dragged a weapon from it looks like somebody took it artigas agreed yeah but who the implication was clear ordonez would not have been surprised if one of the local cops had taken it for any number of reasons having nothing to do with the investigation of a multiple homicide im not going to comment on that ordonez thought both head shots artigas said ordonez nodded and then raising his voice asked wheres the other five the second police supervisor made a vague gesture away from the house four out there chief inspector he said senor bertrands body is in the house in his office ordonez gestured for him to lead the way into the house the body lying on its back behind a large ornate desk and next to the open door of a safe was that of a some what squat very black man in his late forties there were two entrance wounds in the face one on the right side of the forehead the second on the upper lip a section of the skull had been blown outward there was brain tissue on the safe and on the wall beside it artigas sensed ordonezs eyes on him two entrance wounds that close artigas said maybe a submachine gun ordonez nodded but from a distance he said pointing to the window one of the panes was broken if he had been shot in here for example the moment he obligingly opened the safe i think there would have been powder burns on the face yeah artigas said the photo album ordonez asked on the desk chief inspector the police supervisor said while captain cavallero was leaving everything exactly as it was when he first came here ordonez said drily he happened to notice and then scan through a photo album i think you may find it interesting the moroccan leatherbound photo album on the desk was open to an eightbyteninch color photograph of a wedding party standing on the steps of a church large enough to be a cathedral everyone was in formal morning clothing senor bertrand was standing at the extreme right the bride a tall slim woman was standing beside an extraordinarily tall broadly smiling young man julio ordonez asked softly do you think the bridegroom is who captain cavallero thought it might be well artigas thought now i know why im here thats jack the stack all right no question about it he said jack the stack before he was j winslow masterson of the united states state department he was jack the stack of the boston celtics artigas said really a professional basketball player i didnt know that from the celtics to the state department he got himself run over by a beer truck as he was leaving a stadium artigas said no more pro ball and the settlementthe truck driver had been sampling his waresmade jack the stack a very wealthy man i heard sixty million dollars now that i think about it i remember hearing that story but i didnt connect it with an american diplomat in buenos aires ordonez said and then asked i wonder what senor bertrands relationship to senor masterson was thats not all im wondering about senor bertrand artigas replied three office of the ambassador the embassy of the united states of america lauro muller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august the honorable michael a mcgrory minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states to the republic of uruguay was a small wiry welltailored man of fiftyfive with a full head of curly gray hair he was held in varying degrees of contempt by many members of the embassy team the very ones who referred to himbehind his back of courseas senorpompous this was especially true of those members of the embassy team who were not members of the foreign service of the united states these included the twentyone employees of the justice department assigned to the montevideo embassy fourteen of them carried the job description of assistant legal attache although they were in fact special agents of the federal bureau of investigation the other seven were special agents of the drug enforcement administration there were othersthe cia station chief for example representatives of the federal aviation agency the department of homeland security and even employees of the department of agricultureassigned to the embassy the latter were charged with ensuring that uruguayan foodstuffs exported to the united statesprimarily meat and dairy productsmet the high standards of purity established by the us government although all of these specialists enjoyed diplomatic status they were not really diplomatsand this was often pointed out to them in varying degrees of subtlety by senorpompous all the specialists would after several years return to the states and whatever governmental agency had so to speak loaned them to the department of state the foreign service people on the other hand regarded themselves as professionals trained in the fine art of diplomacy who could look forward to other foreign assignments after uruguay and to increasingly senior positions within the department of state presuming of course that the hired hands from the justice department or the faa orespeciallythe cia didnt do something violating the rules of diplomatic behavior that would embarrass the embassy and the foreign service personnel who were supposed to keep the hired hands under control ambassador mcgrory for example had begun his foreign service career as a consular officer in nicaragua as he over the years had moved from one united states embassy to another in south america he had risensome what slowly but steadilyupward in the state department hierarchy he had been a commercial attache in peru a cultural attache in brazil and before his appointment as ambassador to uruguay he had been deputy chief of mission in asuncion paraguay with the exception of the agriculture department peoplewho did their job kept him abreast of what was going on and stayed out of troubleambassador mcgrory had trouble with just about everyone else who was not a bonafide diplomat there were several reasons for this and in ambassador mcgrorys opinion the most significant was their inability to understand that they were in fact answerable to him the regulations were clear on that as the senior official of the united states government in uruguay all employees and officers of the united states were subject to his orders manyperhaps mostof the problems caused were by the dea agents whom mcgrory privately thought of as hooligans they often went around undercover which meant that not only were they unshaven and unshorn but dressed like uruguayan drug addicts and under their shabby clothing they carried a variety of weaponry it was only a matter of time in mcgrorys professional opinion before they shot some uruguayan and he would have to deal with all the ramifications he had issued an order a year before that required that the dea agents go armed only when necessary when it became apparent that the dea agents considered it was necessary all the time he had modified the order so that they would have to have his permission before arming themselves on any specific occasion that order had been in effect fewer than seventytwo hours when the assistant secretary of state for latin america had telephoned him to politely but firmly order him to refrain from interfering with the dea agents rights to defend themselves the fbi agents were far better dressed than those of the dea but if anything less willing to keep him abreast of what they were doing and when their primary function was the detection of money laundering uruguay was known as the south american capital of money laundering mcgrory was naturally interested to know what they were doing but they rarely told him any specifics and half of them at least also went about armed to the teeth ambassador mcgrory was thus concerned when the senior of the fbi agents a man named james d monahan telephoned him as he was about to leave the embassy and requested an immediate audience will this wait until the morning monahan sir i really think you should hear this now very well the ambassador replied you may come up monahan and julio artigas arrived at mcgrorys office three minutes later the ambassador did not offer them chairs artigas has run into something i thought should be brought to your attention as quickly as possible mr ambassador legal attache james d monahan said politely really mcgrory replied and looked at assistant legal attache artigas ordonez called me just before lunch mcgrory raised his hand to stop him and asked ordonez is chief inspector of the interior division of the policia federal mr ambassador mcgrory nodded and waved his fingers as a signal for artigas to go on and asked that i meet him for lunch i did so and almost immediately he told me there had been a multiple murder multiple murder mcgrory interrupted how many did he mean by multiple seven mr ambassador seven yes sir seven and this massacre occurred here in montevideo no sir on an estancia near tacuarembo and where refresh me is tacuarembo its about three hundred sixty kilometers north of montevideo mr ambassador never heard of it the ambassador said go on artigas yes sir chief inspector ordonez asked me if i would be willing to go there with him i dont think thats a very good idea artigas the ambassador said do you monahan we dont want the embassy splattered with the water from uruguays dirty laundry do we sir i accepted ordonezs invitation i went there artigas said and who did you check with before you did so i cant believe monahan would give you the goahead to do something like that you didnt monahan did you i didnt check with anyone sir i wasnt aware that i was required to there is a difference artigas between a requirement and the exercise of prudent conduct the ambassador said perhaps you should keep that in mind yes sir go on we flew to tacuarembo in what i believe was the presidents helicopter artigas said which suggested to me that someone very senior in the uruguayan government was really interested to see that inspector ordonez got there in a hurry that there was interest at high levels in whatever had transpired at tacuarembo several things artigas the ambassador said first i thought you said chief inspector whatever it is chief inspector ordonez sir second what makes you think you went flying in the presidents helicopter it was a nearly new aerospatiale dauphin sir the police have old hueys in which you have flown yes sir many times i wasnt aware of that the ambassador said were you monahan yes sir i was we try very hard to work closely with the uruguayan authorities and working closely with the uruguayan authorities of course is a good idea but riding in their helicopters i shudder when i think of how well they are maintained or not maintained ill have to give that some thought and until i have had the chance to do just that i dont think there should be any more helicopter joyrides pass that word wont you monahan yes sir you flew to tacuarembo is that what youre saying artigas yes sir and why did chief inspector ordonez want you to do that do you think he wanted to show me a photograph of one of the dead men mr ambassador and why would he do that probably because the photograph was of one of the dead men standing in a wedding party with j winslow masterson i beg your pardon probably because the photograph was of one of the dead men standing in a wedding party with j winslow masterson now i have your attention artigas thought you pompous little asshole thats difficult to believe ambassador mcgrory said after a moment youre sure it was our mr masterson yes sir it was jack the stack all right the late mr mastersons athletic accomplishments are long past you dont think it is disrespectful of you to refer to him that way no disrespect was intended sir i was a great admirer of mr masterson still artigas mcgrory said disapprovingly he went on do we know the name of the man in the photograph with mr masterson chief inspector ordonez identified him to me as senor jeanpaul bertrand the owner of the estancia sir and he was dead you said shot twice sir in the head by whom i have no idea sir and you think your good friend chief inspector ordonez if he had suspects in the case would confide them to you yes sir i think he would but he has not done so has he what the chief inspector has done sir is to request our assistance what kind of assistance there were seven dead men in all sir senor bertrand and six others who were they who killed them we have no idea sir there was no identification of any sort on their bodies what the chief inspector has asked me to do mr ambassador is to send their fingerprints to washington to see if the fbi has them on file ambassador mcgrory thought that over for a moment i can see no problem with doing that he said finally but what makes youor chief inspector ordonezthink their fingerprints would be in the fbis files these are not americans presumably we dont know that sir is there any reason to think they might be no sir i dont think there is on the other hand there is no reason to presume they are not ambassador mcgrory considered that a moment do we know anything about the murdered man the murdered man in the photograph his name was bertrand sir jeanpaul bertrand you already told me that mcgrory said my question was do we know anything about the murdered man he was lebanese sir resident in uruguay chief inspector ordonez told me that he was an antiquities dealer and for the third time do weas opposed to your friend the chief inspectorknow anything about the murdered antiques dealer monahan said special agent yung is maintaining a file on him sir and what does the file say i dont know sir the file is not in the file cabinet well where is it i dont know sir monahan said possibly yung took it home with him he took an official file home with him i dont know that sir it is possible well get him on the phone and tell him to bring the file to my office immediately i tried to call him sir he doesnt answer the telephone at his apartment well where is he i dont know sir you dont know ambassador mcgrory parroted incredulously he didnt come in today sir possibly hes in puente del este he had the day off in other words i meant to say he may be working in puente del este sir but you dont know no sir i dont what youre going to do monahan while artigas is preparing his draft report on this matter is find special agent yung and have him bring his files here yes sir i must say monahan that until just now i thought you ran a tighter ship than is apparently the case four office of the ambassador the embassy of the united states of america lauro muller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august special agentsassistant legal attaches james d monahan and julio artigas were sitting on the chromeandleather couch outside the office of the minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the president of the united states to the republic of uruguay when the ambassador arrived they both looked worried the honorable michael a mcgrory took no pity on them without speaking he waved them some what imperiously into his office he went to his desk sat down and with another grand gesture gave them permission to seat themselves in the two chairs facing his desk well mcgrory said what more do we know about the massacre in tacuarembo than we did when last we met have you heard for example artigas from your good friend chief inspector ordonez i spoke with him last night sir to report that i had faxed the fingerprints to the bureau but he didnt pass on any other information to me i cannot help but wonder if your good friend has learnedor perhaps already knewsomething he has elected not to pass on to you i really dont think thats the case mr ambassador artigas replied and you monahan what have you to contribute mcgrory really disliked monahan the only reason he wasnt absolutely sure that monahan was the socalled wit who had installed a decalcomania of an irish leprechaun named mcgrory in a urinal in the visitors mens room was that he couldnt believe one irishman would do that to another sir monahan began uncomfortably he cleared his throat and began again sir i have been unable to locate mr yung i even went to puente del este last night and checked all the hotels where he usually stays thats probably because mr yung is no longer with us the ambassador said sir i received at the residence a telephone call at half past nine last night from the assistant director of the fbi he said that it had been necessary to recall mr yung to washington he informed me that mr yung had actually already left uruguay it apparently has something to do with mr yung being needed to testify in court the assistant director said he was reluctant to get into details on a nonsecure telephone connection i wonder what thats all about monahan mused aloud and so do i im sure the assistant director will explain the situation to me when he calls which he has promised to do as soon as he gets to a secure telephone in his office this morning that wont be before tenthirty our time monahan said theres a onehour difference between here and dc and i never knew an assistant director who came to work before ninethirty and whenever he calls i wont be here we wont be here sir when thinking this matter through last night i decided i should as soon as possible bring it to the attention of ambassador silvio in buenos aires the late mr masterson was after all the chief of mission there yes sir i decided a that i should do so personally and b that you artigas should come with me i can see no reason for you to go to buenos aires monahan can you no sir we are on the nineten austral flight mcgrory said mr howell will be going with us he has some cultural business to transact in buenos aires if you take my meaning i understand sir artigas said mr robert howell was the cultural attache of the embassy that he was also the cia station chief was just about as much of a secret as was the identity of the irish fbi agent who had put the mcgrory leprechaun decal in the urinal while we are gone monahan i want you to do two things the ambassador went on one keep yourself available to take the call from the assistant director tell him where i am and ask him to call me at the embassy in buenos aires yes sir two it will probably be a waste of your time but see if you can find out anything else from artigass friend chief inspector ordonez or anyone else yes sir five office of the ambassador the embassy of the united states of america avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina august please come in mr ambassador ambassador juan manuel silvio the american ambassador in buenos aires said to ambassador michael mcgrory its always a pleasure to see you silvio was a tall lithe fairskinned welltailored man with an erect carriage and an aristocratic manner he was younger than ambassador michael mcgrory and despite five years less service in the foreign service than mcgrory had a far more important embassy mcgrory didnt like him he was honest enough to admit to himself however that his rationale for bringing the tacuarembo whatever it was to silvio went beyond the fact that he had a photograph of the late mr masterson who had been silvios deputy he suspected that whatever it was he was liable to see egg on his face when the matter got to the state department mcgrory knew it was better that there be egg on two faces rather than his alone the two shook hands silvio then offered his hand to julio artigas and said i dont believe ive had the pleasure my name is artigas sir how do you do artigas is one of my legal attaches mcgrory said and this is my cultural attache mr howell weve met silvio said nice to see you again mr howell i know you know alex but im not sure if mr artigas does no sir artigas said and shook hands with a small plump man with a pencilthin mustache alex darby the man said and i know howell and darby know each other silvio said what is it that they say about birds of a feather mcgrory thought he might have just as well come out and said these two are cia hey bob darby said long time no see too long howell replied were really going to have to get together silvios secretary rolled in a coffee tray unless its someone important like my wife or the secretary no calls please silvio said when the door had closed silvio went on you said youd come across something that might have a bearing on what happened to jack masterson mr ambassador artigas mcgrory ordered show ambassador silvio the picture artigas opened his briefcase and took out the photograph of the wedding party he stood up walked over to silvio and handed it to him silvio looked at it then handed it to darby whered you get this darby asked do you recognize the people mcgrory said yeah i do thats jack and betsy at their wedding and her parents and jacks and her brother you know who that man is mcgrory asked yes i do darby said hes betsy mastersons brother where did you get this artigas mcgrory ordered yes sir its from an estancia called shangrila in tacuarembo i was taken there by an officer of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional why did he do that darby asked i now believe it was because a uruguayan police officer on the scene recognized mr masterson artigas said the photo was in a scrapbook at the scene youve used the word scene twice darby said is there an implication that something had happened at this estancia that it was maybe a crime scene thats something of an understatement darby mcgrory said according to artigas there were seven bodies at that estancia seven bodies darby asked seven bodies seven bodies including that of the man in the photograph mcgrory said all shot to death and who were the others darby asked artigas saw that darby was looking at howell the hair on artigass neck curled that seems to be the mystery mcgrory said you dont know who they are darby asked according to artigas none of them had any identification on them and they were all dressed in black really darby said and looked at howell againnot for long but long enough for artigas to see it that sounds like something from a james bond movie or a ninja movie howell said all dressed in black well who shot them darby asked no one seems to have any idea artigas said no one seems to have any idea darby parroted incredulously artigas suddenly had a number of thoughts one right after the other you know all about this dont you mr darby did howell call you last night after mcgrory told howell the cia sticks together jesus did howell know about this before mcgrory told him did they both know about it were they both involved youre letting your imagination run away with you julio youve seen too many spy moviesbad spy movies yeah but you always were a good interrogator able to pick up things like the looks between darby and howell what the hell is going on here according to artigas the uruguayan police have no idea either howell said what do you think it was mr mcgrory darby asked a robbery an attempted kidnapping thats mr ambassador thank you very much darby i have no idea what it was mcgrory said the question it would seem to me is what do we do about this photograph alex silvio asked i would suggest mr ambassador silvio is mr ambassador mcgrory thought and im not you sonofabitch that we get this information into the hands of mr castillo or that mr mcgrory should the photo turned up in uruguay on mr mcgrorys watch so to speak whos castillo mcgrory asked this is classified information mr ambassador silvio said when mr masterson was abducted the president told me he had appointed mr castillo to supervise the investigation and later the president charged him with the security of the masterson family and with their repatriation to the states whos he hes the presidents agent what does that mean i can only tell you what the president told me silvio said is that the same man who came to montevideo to see special agent yung yes i believe so whats his connection with yung mcgrory asked silvio shrugged artigas wondered and whats the connection between this and yung suddenly being ordered to the states what we can do if youd like mr ambassador silvio said is send the photograph to the secretary together with the information that darby positively identified this man as mr mastersons brother you are sure are you not alex yes sir im sure i met him several times when jack and i were in paris just in time mcgrory stopped himself from saying he would take care of notifying the secretary thank you just the same i am not going to be twisting alone in the wind he thought yes i think thats the way to go he said artigas thought senor pompous i think youre wondering if without having any idea why youre in the deep dodo god i hope so six hacienda san jorge near uvalde texas august major c g castillo stood by a barbecue grill constructed from a fiftyfivegallon barrel his eyes stinging from the smoke of the mesquite fire he had a long black cigar clamped in his teeth and was attired in khaki pants a tshirt printed with the legend you can always tell a texas aggie but not much battered western boots and an even more battered stetson hat its brim curled he saw estella a short massive swarthy woman who had been helping at the ranch as long as he could remember come out of the big house carrying a walkaround telephone and he had the unpleasant premonition that the call was going to be for him but then estella gave the phone to abuela and he saw her smile and say how good it is to hear your voice and he returned his attention to the steaks broiling on the grill he had just annoyed maria his cousin fernandos wife by solemnly proclaiming that only males could be trusted to properly grill a steak and challenged her to name one worldclass female chef or for that matter one worldclass female orchestra leader castillo didnt believe any of this but there was something in maria that had always made him really like to ruffle her feathers he thought of her as his sisterinlaw but technically that wasnt accurate fernando was his cousin not his brother but if there was a term to describe the wife of your cousin who was really more like your brother he didnt know it he felt a tug at his trouser leg and looked down to see jorge carlos lopez who was seven his godchild and the fourth of the five children of fernando and maria jorge was holding up a bottle of dos equis beer to him you have saved my life jorge charley said solemnly in spanish you will be rewarded in heaven he looked around saw fernando standing by the table set for lunch on the shaded veranda of the big house and gave him a thumbsup to express his appreciation for the beer he then surreptitiously reached in his trousers pocket and came out with a small computerized meat thermometer which gave an almost immediate and very accurate indication of temperature there was nothing wrong in getting scientific confirmation of what your thumb suggested when pressed into a broiling steak especially if no one saw you use the device and remained convinced you had an educated thumb he stabbed each of the steaks with the thermometerthere were eight inchandahalfthick new york stripsand saw they all had interior temperatures of just over degrees fahrenheit he put the thermometer back in his pocket then turned and faced the veranda i proclaim these done fernando applauded and several of the rugrats joined in at that point charley saw abuela advancing on him holding out the walkaround telephone its for you she said dick shit i knew it thank you he said wait until i get the steaks on the platter abuela laid the telephone on the table beside the grill then picked up the plattera wellused bloodgrooved wooden board with horseshoe handlesand held it out for him to put the steaks on it then she started for the veranda ill carry that abuela he called after her i am old tired and decrepit but i can still carry this she said charley picked up the telephone why do i think im not going to like this he asked by way of greeting dona alicia was glad to hear my voice major h richard miller jr said she told me as you well know she is too kind for her own good especially where cripples are concerned whats up i think you better get back here charley jesus i havent been here thirtysix hours and not only that i really wanted to have a closer look at that gulfstream surprising charley fernando had met him at san antonio international airport to what do i owe the honor castillo said i want to show you something and it wouldnt wait until we were at san jorge no you have any checked luggage castillo shook his head fernandos car a new twelvecylinder black mercedesbenz s was in the shortterm parking lot castillo remembered reading in a magazine that the sedan had a sticker price somewhere north of is this what you wanted to show me no nice wheels its marias fernando said you must have been a really bad boy fuck you gringo what exactly did you do wrong well for example i went to europe and south america without taking her along she didnt like that no she did not i cant understand that fernando shook his head but didnt reply he then drove them around the airport to lemes aviation a large businessaviation operation dont tell me you pranged the lear no but its in here for a hundredhour maintenance a lot sooner than i thought it would be youll get a check eventually from the secret service you know the deal they chartered it i know the deal fernando said he pulled the mercedes into a parking slot at the lemes building and they got out but instead of going in the building fernando marched purposefully toward a hangar castillo followed him expecting to see the lear on which he was sure fernando was going to show him something that had happened that was going to require expensive repair the lear wasnt in the hangar there were four beech craft turboprops and one jet a gulfstream iii what are we looking at castillo asked fernando pointed to the gulfstream jesus dont tell me you bought that i didnt i think maybe you should fernando said a smiling man wearing a leather aviators jacket and aviators sunglasses walked quickly up to them before castillo had a chance to respond how are you mr lopez he asked do you know my cousin charley castillo i have not had that privilege the man said brewster walsh mr castillo he enthusiastically pumped castillos hand shes a beauty isnt she mr walsh inquired then added and a steal at seven million nine ninetynine in other words eight million right castillo asked innocently can we have a look inside fernando asked it would be my pleasure mr walsh said castillo who was tired and wanted to get out to hacienda san jorge was just about to politely decline the offer when he remembered what fernando had said i didnt i think maybe you should he meant that he thinks i should buy this with lorimers money he wouldnt have said that unless he meant it jesus castillo allowed himself to be waved up the stair door he looked into the cockpit are you a pilot yourself mr castillo mr walsh inquired and when castillo nodded went on well then youll really appreciate that panel castillo examined the flight instruments carefully it was a nice panel mostly honeywell and collins it wasnt on a par with the panel in the lear but then the lear was nearly brandnew and this wasnt how old is this castillo asked im sure youre aware that it isnt how old an airplane is but rather how hard its been ridden which makes it how old total time just over eight thousand hours mr walsh replied just over fortyfive hundred landings which means the average flight was less than two hours andandthe engines were replaced at eight thousand hours and are practically brandnew which makes it how old by the calendar castillo pursued twentythree years mr walsh replied some what reluctantly hard to believe looking at it isnt it yeah it is jesus it doesnt look that old it looks practically brandnew and there was a complete refurbishment of the interior just six months ago mr walsh added does refurbished mean cleaned and shined everything that showed the slightest signs of wear was replaced mr walsh said castillo looked down the luxuriously fittedout passenger compartment when he breathed in he smiled at the rich smell of fine glove leather it looks new he admitted it has a maximum range of thirtyseven hundred nautical miles mr walsh offered at four hundred fifty knots that would get you across the atlantic in a hurry wouldnt it fernando asked over mr walshs shoulder i mean if a person had some reason to go to europe me if i had my way id never leave texas much less the good ol usa well if you wanted to go to europe mr walsh said this little beauty would take you and twelve of your friendsand their golf clubs and their overnight bags in case you wanted to play a quick round at st andrews for example carlos fernando said and then looked at mr walsh ol carlos is quite a golfer me too mr walsh said i just love the game anytime anyones looking for ol carlos i just tell them to check out the nearest golf club fernando said what business are you in mr castillo if you dont mind my asking investments castillo said buy low and sell high right carlos fernando asked i try word of a steal like this gets around quickly mr walsh said frankly ive got several people really interested well mr walsh if you can get somebody to give you eight million for this old airplane i suggest you take the offer on the other hand if youd be willing to shave half a million off your asking price i might be interested with several other caveats for example mr castillo my golfing buddy jake torine is a much better pilot than i am id have to have him check it out he lives in charleston wed be happy to have your friend fly here at our expense and give him a test hop hes checked out in the gulfstream i presume yes he is but so far as lowering the price is concerned what i meant was you would take the airplaneand fernandoto charleston and let my friend fly it there castillo said but if you cant lower the price i guess that doesnt matter perhapsone never knows what will happen does onesomething could be worked out if youd be willing to pay the standard hourly charter rate for the giii for example for the hours it took to fly to charleston which is how much ballpark figure about three thousand an hour since were playing whatif castillo said what if you flew this airplane to charleston gave my friend a test hop all at three thousand an hour and what if he said the old bird was worth the money and what if i said okay ill buy it youd take how many hours at three thousand per it came to off your price of seven million five right mr castillo im not at all sure i can shave the price even a little much less half a million dollars i understand castillo said you go ahead and sell to whoever is willing to pay that much money for a twentyfouryearold airplane thanks for letting me have a look its only twentythree years old mr castillo okay twentythreeyearold airplane at the risk of repeating myself mr walsh said one never knows whats going to happen how would i get in touch with you mr castillo if fernando usually knows where im swatting the ol ball around at any given time so just call him you have his number right when they were on the highway to uvalde fernando said i wonder if hell call today or wait until tomorrow i hope he waits longer than that castillo said that looks like such a good deal i can hear grandpa say anytime youre offered a really good deal youd be a fool to turn down take a cold shower every day for a week and then have another look a very close look fernando chuckled i have something serious to say gringo uhoh i really should not be playing james bond with you as much as i have been and is the rest of the sentence and i wont in the future hey gringo you need me im there you know that but i have maria and the kids and abuela to think of touche all im saying is you now have people working for you please dont call me unless you really need me done and you need an airplane maybe not that giii but an airplane a bigger one than the lear and not just because maria and abuela are not only going to smell a rat if you keep using the lear but are going to start nosing around neither of us wants that youre right so to hell with grandpas advice lets hope smiley calls you tonight instead of tomorrow i dont like the way youre agreeing with me so easily what should i do agree with you hardly youre right fernando its as simple as that i wasnt thinking youre making me feel like a shit you know that what i was just thinking was how lucky i am to have you as my brother im not your brother cuz if you wont tell i wont what i want from you gringo is your word that when you need me youll call me done no rest for the weary dick miller now said over the phone you never heard that something specific castillo asked well how about the secretary of the department of homeland security sticking his head in the door and saying i really hate to do this to him but i think you better get charley on the horn and tell him to get back here as soon as he can well thats certainly specific enough did he say why no but it may have something to do with general naylor having called him five minutes beforethey put that call on your line by mistake i wonder what he wants or it may have something to do with our new liaison officer miller said our new what ambassador montvale has been kind enough to assign a liaison officer to the office of organizational analysis he was here first thing this morning just bubbling over with enthusiasm to get right to work liaising things thats the last thing we need montvales surrogates nose in our business or it may have something to do with what mr ellsworthour new liaison officers name is truman c ellsworthbrought with him when he came over this morning to start liaising which is this isnt even classified its just a standard interoffice memorandum from the director of national intelligence to the chief of the office of organizational analysis it says that he thought you might be interested to know that he has learned from quote central intelligence agency officers in montevideo uruguay and buenos aires argentina end quote that a man named bertrand who was murdered in the course of a robbery in uruguay has been tentatively identified as really being a un diplomat named lorimer and that mr lorimer was the brotherinlaw of the late j winslow masterson thats interesting isnt it castillo said did the memo say anything about who might have robbed or murdered this man it says that quote the aforementioned officers have been directed to investigate this matter and to report their findings to the undersigned end quote castillo considered that a minute then asked what do we hear about the world of high finance theres been a very nervous chinaman asking about you every hour on the hour i think he thinks he is about to be swooped upon by the irs and carried off to leavenworth for having too much money in his offshore account castillo chuckled given all that yeah i better come back i dont know when i can catch a plane if you can fit it into your busy schedule you have a reservation on continental departing san antone at five fortyfive it will put you into dulles after only three stops and one change of planes at half past eleven oh shit just a little jerk on your chain charley relax its nonstop mr forbison got the reservation for you okay i will be sure to wake you when i come in presuming i can get a cab at dulles within three or four hours you will be met by your own personal yukon miller said she set that up too look for a heavily armed man wearing a strained smile you can call that off i can catch a cab actually tom mcguire told mr f to set it up get used to it hotshot you now really are a hotshot ill see you shortly dick thank you he broke the connection and carried the telephone to the veranda everyone there was waiting patiently sitting with a steak on a plate before him whatd dick want fernando asked enjoy your steak youre going to need your strength for the trip fernando youre not going anywhere maria announced firmly youre going to leave him here when you go home castillo asked innocently hes not going anywhere with you period maria said who said anything about him going anywhere with me question mark i was thinking of the trip between here and casa lopez period what are you talking about question mark fernando chuckled youve been zinged my dear he said jorge comma fernando m lopez jr aged ten asked his brother would you please pass the butter question mark no comma i wont exclamation point jorge lopez replied and giggled abuela who had been frowning now smiled i dont know why i even try maria said i should know better i should just sit here and let carlos make a fool of me while my husband and children laugh at me the gringo only makes fools of people he loves fernando said please dont call him that fernando junior and jorge said in unison looking at their greatgrandmother you know i dont like it immediately fernando junior added i dont like it exclamation point my father warned me i was making a mistake marrying into this family maria said but she was smiling when the car came abuela went out to it with him it was a silver jaguar xj nice wheels abuela charley said new huh fernando sent a mercedes out here she said a twelvecylinder one black i made him take it back i felt like a mafia gangster this one i can drive myself ah the truth about how maria came into her mafia mobile well it just made sense to let maria have it otherwise he would have lost a lot of money you just cant turn a new car back in and maria doesnt mind feeling like a mafia gangster im glad this didnt come up while she was here abuela said darling do you really have to tease her all the time hey i saw you smiling when the boys started to speak the punctuation they are clever arent they they remind me so much of you and fernando that should be a frightening prospect she didnt respond to that thats what you need carlos boys of your own a nice family i have a nice family i just dont have a wife and there have been no developments along that line that youd like to tell me about has fernando been running off at the mouth again how is the lady secret service agent she has her jaws wired shut if i can get her to agree to leave the wires in maybe something could be worked out i dont think thats funny carlos he looked down at his feet the wires in her jaw arent he said im sorry i said that you should be he looked abuela in the eyes im going to have to go to europe for a couple of days ill go from new york and stop off in philadelphia to see her fernando said shes very nice she is she nodded at him then leaned up and kissed him via con dios mi amor she said he got in the front seat with the driver as the car rolled away from the sprawling redtileroofed spanishstyle big house he turned in the seat and looked out the back window abuela was standing where he had left her shes right i do need boys like fernandos and a wifea family he watched abuela until the road curved and then he thought of betty schneider maybe the time has come god knows ive never felt about any other woman the way i feel about betty iv one washington dulles international airport dulles virginia august castillo smiled when he came out of the jetway and entered the terminal there waiting for him was indeed a heavily armed man wearing a strained smile he was standing behind a wheelchair on which sat one leg supported vertically in front of him major h richard miller jr he wondered for a moment how theyd got into the security area then felt a little foolish when the answer came to him wave your secret service credentials and you can go anywhere in an airport you want mr castillo the secret service agent said major miller said he didnt think you would have any checked baggage thats interesting mister castillo and major miller were both majors and this guy has to know that what did dick say on the phone get used to it hotshot you now really are a hotshot i dont castillo said smiling he put out his hand i dont think weve met have we im charley castillo the secret service agent gave him a firm but very quick handshake and said special agent dulaney sir castillo looked at miller and saw that he was smiling at him special agent dulaney spoke to his lapel microphone don juan is out no luggage were on our way ill push the cripple dulaney castillo said yes sir the yukons right outside sir what happened to the pride of the marine corps miller asked as they moved through the airport vic dallessando arranged to stash him at bragg until i figure out what to do with him how much help do you need to get into this castillo asked when they were at the yukon none but you can put the wheelchair in miller said he came nimbly off the wheelchair stood on one leg pulled the door open and then sort of dove into the rear castillo saw that the middle seat had been folded flat against the floorboard and when he looked again miller was already sitting up in the far backseat his leg stretched out in front of him on the folded down seat now is when you put the wheelchair in miller said can i help you with that sir special agent dulaney asked im all right thanks castillo said some what struggling with collapsing the wheelchair sixty seconds later miller asked youre not very good at that are you theres a lever on the side here sir that lets you fold it special agent dulaney said let me show you thank you castillo said and got in the yukon thirty seconds later the yukon pulled away from the curb special agent dulaney spoke again to his lapel microphone don juan aboard headed for the nest who is he talking to castillo asked softly i asked him that miller said he said the secret service has a communications system and then i said yeah but who are you talking to and he said the communications system well ask a dumb question castillo said grinning then he added you didnt have to ride all the way out here dick i had my reasons two of them to be precise the first was that it was a pleasant change from my usual routine which is to go from the hotel to the nebraska avenue complex then back again sometimes stopping off at the lobby bar on the way home to have a drink to recuperate from my journey and the second i thought you might have had it in your head to stop off in the lobby bar en route to the room tonight youre psychic and ill even buy and i thought i should warn you what youre liable to find in there if you do miller said paused then added the former cia regional director for southwest africa no kidding yes indeed i was having a little nip about this time night before last in the lobby bar when i sensed death rays aimed at me i looked around and there she was mr patricia davies wilson in the flesh and very nice flesh it was i have to admit spilling out of her dress so what happened nothing happened she was with a fellow i strongly suspect was not mr wilson he was even younger than you or me youre sure she made you the death rays made it clear that she did they froze my martini solid i had to chew it like ice cubes well she probably blames you for getting her fired that thought occurred to me miller said shortly followed by a possible worse scenario that she didnt get fired you think thats possible you know the agency better than i do miller said firing somebody is an admission that the agency is less than perfect can we find out maybe ask tom mcguire to ask a few discreet questions im way ahead of you charley miller said as a devout believer in know thy enemy the first thing the next morning i called langley identified myself as chief of staff to the chief of the office of organizational analysis youre not kidding are you oh no miller said and i asked did they happen to have an employee named patricia davies wilson and if so what was she doing for them and they told you has anyone told you chief that we now have a contact officer in most of the important agencies under orders to give us anything we ask for no nobody told me you should spend more time in the office chief all sorts of things are happening but your question was and they told you yes they did and what they told meyoure going to love thisis that mr wilson is a senior analyst in the south american divisions southern cone section jesus christ yeah miller said where one would presume she would have access to everything that the agency hearsmore important doesdown there well ill have to do something about that castillo said almost to himself short of rendering her harmless charley what i dont know but i dont want that womans nose in whats happened down there or what may happen her nose doesnt bother me nearly as much as her mouth did you say anything to anybody miller shook his head ill go see matt hall first thing in the morning castillo said first thing late tomorrow afternoon miller said hes in saint louis and from there hes going to chicago hes due back here at fivethirty theres a reception at the white housecommand performance for him okay first thing late tomorrow afternoon castillo said damn im on my way to europe and i wanted to see betty in philadelphia before i left now i either dont get to see her or i leave a day later does this mean youre not going to buy me a drink i will buy you two drinks castillo said maybe more in the lobby bar as i recall that encounter we were the innocent victims why should we be afraid of running into the villain in a bar come on charley you know damned well why i have the strength of ten because in my heart im pure i am not going to let that lady using the term loosely run me out of a bar miller snorted two office of organizational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august mr agnes forbison deputy chief for administration of the office of organizational analysis major h richard miller jr chief of staff to the chief of the office of organizational analysis and the chief himself major c g castillo were standing on the carpet in just about the center of the latters office major miller was supporting himself on a massive cane it was an office befitting a senior executive of the federal government there was an oversized ornately carved antique wooden desk behind which sat a red leather highbacked judges chair on the desk were two telephones one of them red it was a secure line connected to the white house switchboard there were two flags against the wall the national colors and that of the department of homeland security in front of the desk were two leatherupholstered straightbacked chairs there was a coffee table with two chairs on one side of it and a matching couch on the other there were two television sets each with a thirtytwoinchwide screen mounted on the walls and that completes the tour mr forbison said say good job agnes mr forbison a gsthe highest rank in the general service hierarchywas fortynine grayhaired and getting just a little chubby jesus christ agnes c g castillo said you like i dont know what the hell to say castillo said what am i supposed to do with all this the tour had been of the suite of offices newly assigned to the office of organizational analysis of the department of homeland security in the nebraska avenue complex which is just off ward circle in the northwest section of the district of columbia the complex had once belonged to the navy but it had been turned over in by an act of congress to the department of homeland security when that agency had been formed after you need it now she said and the way things are going i dont think it will be long before well be cramped in here until very recently mr forbison had been one of the two executive assistants to secretary of homeland security matt hall when the office of organizational analysis had been formed within the department of homeland security mr forbison had beenat her requestassigned to it she had known from the beginning that the office of organizational analysis had nothing to do with organizational analysis and very little to do with the department of homeland security secretary hall had shown her the top secret presidential finding the day after it had been issued agnes who had been around washington a long time had suspected that secretary hall was going to have to have an inhouse intelligence organizationhomeland security was the only department that didnt have oneif for no other reason than to do a better job than she and her staff were capable of doing sorting through the daily flood of intelligence received from the entire intelligence community and she had suspected when the president had gone to biloxi to meet the plane carrying the bodies of masterson and the sergeant and given his speechto those who committed the cowardly murders of these two good men i say to you that this outrage will not go unpunishedthat charley castillo was going to be involved in that punishment he not only had found the stolen when the entire intelligence community couldnt but had stolen it back from the terrorists it would have been in character for the president to send charley off as his agent to find the people who had killed masterson and the sergeant much as hed sent him off to locate the stolen but she hadnt expected the presidential finding with a stroke of his penactually the secretary of states penthe president had given castillo a blank check to do anything he thought he had to do to render harmless the people responsible for the murders and he had to answer to the president alone not even secretary hall and the finding had given him an organization to do it with when secretary hall had shown her the finding shed read it then handed it back and said wow you dont think hes up to it hall had asked i think he can handle the terrorists but im not so sure about washington she said top secret presidential or not this is going to get out and as soon as it does so do the long knives the fbi and the cia are going to have a fit when they hear about this and montvaleespecially montvalehe is not going to like this at all would you if you were the ambassador hes supposed to be in charge of all intelligence and the president makes an exceptionfor a young major answerable only to him montvale can take care of himself she said its charley im worried about you think he needs some mentor wise in the ways of washington backstabbing like you for example like you of course she said but yeah like me too then you would not consider being transferred to the office of organizational analysis as say deputy chief for administration as an indication that i was less than satisfied with your performance of your duties and since i couldnt fire you promoted you out that has a nice ring to it deputy chief for administration agnes said then since i have no authority over this new organizationor himi will suggest that to charley agnes now said to castillo what i did boss id rather be called charley castillo said id rather be called my beauty my adored one but this isnt the place for that this is where the boss gets called boss or sir your choice okay okay what i did boss was move everybody off the floor but the secretarys office and since he uses that for about twenty minutes once a month that means there will not be a stream of curious people getting off the elevator im also having the engineer put in one of those creditcardswipe gadgets in the lobby and in the garage for what will be our elevator when he gets that in hell rig the other elevators so they cant come up here youre amazing charley said and as we speak theyre putting in additional secure telephones you and dick and i will have our own of course and so will tom mcguire and there will be one in the conference room i told our new liaison officer mr ellsworth that i will get him one just as soon as i can no telling how long that will take what do you think of mr ellsworth hes smart tough and experienced which is to be expected of someone who has worked for ambassador montvale for a longtime miller snorted why am i not surprised castillo asked and he requests an audience with you boss as soon as you can fit him in can i stall him for today im going to europeparis fulda and budapest and maybe viennatomorrow maybe by the time i get back ill have thought of some clever way to send him back to montvale i can stall him she said but not indefinitely how long will you be gone just a couple of days id go right now but i have to talk to hall he sent for me but he wont be back until late this afternoon he paused the silver lining in that black cloud is that maybe i can talk to him about this mr ellsworth charley agnes said hesitantly and then went on charley youre going to have to understand that you dont work for matt hall any longer if matt hall says he wants to see me he will see me standing there at attention thats your choice but you dont have to and the black lining in that silver cloud is that it wouldnt really be fair of you to ask hall to fight your battles with montvale since he no longer has authority over you he has no responsibility for you shes right charley miller said like i said get used to being a hotshot hotshot oh jesus castillo said and youre going to have to get used to as of yesterday playing that role agnes said thats the reason for the fancy office and the secret service yukon those are dc status symbols charley middlelevel bureaucrats get a parking space with their name on it one step up from that is getting to ride around town in a government car but not back and forth to work one up from that is having a yukon but your people drive it not the secret service at the top of the heap is a secret service yukon at your beck and call thats why tom mcguire set that up he knows how the game is played and you better learn quick castillo shook his head then asked where is tom there was no time for a reply there was a tinkling sound and a red light on the red telephone began to flash that one you answer yourself agnes said castillo walked over to the huge desk and picked up the telephone castillo natalie cohen charley good morning madam secretary i just got off the phone with ambassador lorimer she said i called mr masterson first and told him that mr lorimer had been found and the circumstances and asked how a call from me would be received yes maam he told me that someone from our embassy in montevideo had called the ambassadoras next of kinand told him what had happened i didnt even think about that castillo said theres a procedure in cases like this and it kicked in when mr lorimer was identified she said and they had no way of knowing of course that he had a heart condition or indeed that he is a retired ambassador how did he take it well and he and mr masterson both expressed their appreciation for your offer to look after mr lorimers affairs in uruguay and france that was a nice thing for you to do charley the truth is i wanted a legal reason to get into his apartment in paris and the uruguay estancia to see what i could find and maybe keep quiet some questions being asked about lorimers bank accounts in uruguay she took that without breaking stride and how did that go special agent yung had an account in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the caymansin connection with what he was doing for the fbi down there getting it in there went smoothly the next step is getting it out of that account and into one that was supposed to be opened for me im going to see if i can do that this morning the reason i asked is the same standard procedures that come into play when an american dies abroad that require the notification of the next of kin also require the protection of assets even if you got it out of uruguay obviously it was after his death there will probably be some questions asked damn yeah well maybe well have a chance to talk about that tonight i beg your pardon youre not going to be at the white house no maam i know secretary hall will be there but i wont okay well i will ask some discreet questions about that problem and if i come up with anything ill let you know i would very much appreciate that talk to you later charley the secretary of state said and hung up castillo put the handset back in its cradle priority one is to get that money out of yungs account and into mine he said and to do that i have to have the numbers of my new account and somebody has to tell me how to move money around in an offshore bank who has the numbers agnes asked otto gorner at the tages zeitung more probably frau schroder would they give them to me if i called probably not now but after i call them this time they will how do i dial an international number if you know it agnes said punch it in after you give it to me transferring nearly sixteen million dollars between two accounts in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the cayman islands proved to be even more difficult and timeconsuming than charley thought it would be since no one wanted to be out of the office when yet another call involving their furnishing of just one more detail came from either fulda or the cayman islands luncheon was hamburgers from wendys special agent yung who was apparently willing to make any sacrifice required to get the money out of his account volunteered to go get them yungs relief when shortly after two pm the liechtensteinische landesbank reported that the funds were now in the account of karl w von und zu gossingerand thus out of his accountwas palpable but short lived just about as soon as castillo had hung up miller wondered aloudcastillo thought he was probably doing it on purpose he knew miller didnt like yungwhat the boys at fort meade were going to do with their intercepts of the many telephone calls they had made fort meade maryland near washington houses the national security agency the very secretive unit that intercepts telephone conversations and other electronic transmission of data or text such as emails you know how that works dont you yung miller asked i have a general idea of course yung said well in simple terms what they do is record practically everything coming out of washington miller began then they run what theyve recorded though highspeed filters looking for words or names or phrases in which there is interest with all the interest in money laundering as you of all people should know the liechtensteinische landesbank is sure to be one of those phrases and so is millions of dollars so by now theres probably at least one nsa analyst sitting over there wondering whether that transfer was simply a legitimate transfer or whether some drug lord or raghead is making financial transactions inimical to the interests of the united states i dont think the irs is on their distribution list but i know langley and the fbi are castillo restrained a smile as yungs face reflected the implications for him of what miller was saying and then suddenly castillo realized that what had started as a joke was potentially a serious problem which means were going to have to do something and right now he said before somebody starts a file on this miller misread him he thought castillo had decided to add to yungs discomfiture charley you know as well as i do that once those nsa people latch on to something theyre like dogs with a meaty bone miller said agnes castillo said i want yung on the next plane to buenos aires you mean today yung asked i mean in an hour if thats when the next plane leaves what am i going to do in buenos aires in montevideo you are going to make sure that whatever information the embassy has turned up there about recent wire transfers out of the accounts of senor jeanpaul bertrand is not reported to the state department and that they dont turn up anything more that will be reported good god you go to prison for destroying evidence yung said youre not going to destroy evidence castillo said youre going to collect that evidence and get it to mr forbison who will establish and maintain a classified file on that money from step one he leaned forward in the highbacked judges chair and pulled the red telephone to him which of these buttons is natalie cohens he asked looking at mr forbison five she said he pushed the fifth button castillo madam secretary he said can you give me a moment castillo explained the situation then listened to her thoughts thank you very much madam secretary i think this will handle the problem ill keep you advised castillo said he put the handset back in the cradle and looked at special agent yung you should have picked up on that yung castillo said but in case you didnt the secretary of state will message the ambassador in montevideo that she is dispatching an fbi agent with special knowledge of the situationyoudown there to investigate the financial affairs of mr lorimerbertrand that they are to turn over to you whatever they have developed so far and that you will make your report directly to her okay yung said you will make two reports castillo said two castillo nodded one will be a complete report of everything you know what the other fbi guys know and the details of the wire transfers of the money from his account to yours you will take that one by hand to the embassy in buenos aires and give it to alex darby who will be expecting it and who will send it to mr forbison in a diplomatic pouch that will take a day longer but we wont get involved with encryption i dont understand that charley mr forbison said why not encrypt it whenever you encrypt anything two more people the encrypt or and the decrypt or are in on the secret i never thought about that she said you dont trust cryptographers i trust them more than most people i know im just being careful when she nodded her understanding he turned back to yung the second report will include what the other fbi guys down there have found out and a sanitized version of what you know no details of how much money was in those accounts before we made the transfers just how much we left in them and of course no mention of the wire transfers this one you will give to the ambassador in montevideo requesting that he have it encrypted and transmitted to the secretary of state got it youre asking me to officially submit a report i know to be dishonest im not sure i can do that what i am ordering you to do is submit a report less certain details that are classified top secret presidential theres a difference there was no reason for the ambassador to be told about the finding and he has not been told he does not have the need to know about that money or what we have done with it i was always taught that the ambassador has the right to know what any agency of the us government is doing in his country try to understand this yung it would be a violation of the law for you to pass information to the ambassador that he is not entitled to have because he doesnt have the proper security clearance there are only two people who can give him that clearance the president and me the president has not done so and i cant see any good reason that i should he paused and then asked are you going to do this yung or not yung didnt reply for thirty seconds which seemed much longer when you put it that way he began then paused a moment you have to understand ive just never had any experience withthis sort of business are you going to do it or not yes yes of course i dont have any idea what kind of an oath you fbi people take but the oath an officer takes when he is commissioned has a phrase in it without any mental reservations whatsoever are you harboring any mental reservations yung cocked his head as he thought that over then shook his head and said no i guess im not okay well be in touch ill probably see you down there come with me agnes said to yung and well see what we can do with the travel agency then she looked at castillo i dont know what else you have planned for right now but tom mcguire and jack britton are waiting to see you castillo waved as a signal for her to send them in they came in immediately supervisory special agent thomas mcguire of the secret service was a large redhaired irishman in his forties until the reorganization following the secret service had been under the treasury department he and supervisory special agent joel isaacson had been assigned to the presidential protection detail when the secret service had been assigned to the department of homeland security mcguire and isaacson became the first members of the secretarys protection detail and when mcguire had learned of the presidential finding and the formation of the office of organizational analysis he had gone to secretary hallwho was now the de facto head of the secret serviceand asked that he be assigned to it im a cop at heart boss hed said it looks to me like charley is going to need somebody like me and you dont really need both joel and me secret service special agent jack britton a tall black man with sharp features was new to the secret service he had been a philadelphia police department detective assigned to the counterterrorism bureau castillo and miller had met him while trying to find the stolen the first time they spoke britton had come in from his undercover assignmentkeeping track of what he political correctness be damned called the aal which stood for african american lunatics he had been wearing a scraggly beard a dark blue robe sandals had his hair braided with beads and was known to his brother muslims in philadelphias aariteg mosque as ali abid arraziq impressed with britton for many things including his courage and dedication as well as his intimate knowledge of the muslim world in the united statesboth bona fide and aalisaacson had recruited him for the secret service together with another philadelphia police department officer sergeant elizabeth schneider of the intelligence and organized crime unit isaacson hadnt been thinking of the office of the secretary of homeland security and certainly neither of them working with or for c g castillo he had recruited britton and schneider for the secret service knowing of twenty places around the country that could really use brittons talents and thinking of betty schneider as a likely candidate for duty on one of the protection details that hadnt happened both had just about completed secret service training when mr elizabeth masterson had been kidnapped castillo had had britton and schneider flown to buenos aires to assist in the investigation of the kidnapping and murders parties unknown had ambushed the embassy car taking special agent schneider from the masterson home killing the marine driver and seriously wounding schneider once the presidential finding had been made it had simply been assumed that britton was assigned to the office of organizational analysis and that when special agent schneider recovered from her wounds and returned to duty she would be too its all right this time castillo greeted mcguire and britton but when you come to the throne room in the future please take off your shoes and wear white gloves miller and mcguire laughed im impressed charley mcguire said britton didnt say anything and his smile was strained i wonder whats the matter with him castillo thought i dont know jack castillo said now that i think about it you really didnt look so bad in your blue robe and the beads in your hair that got another chuckle from mcguire and miller id really like to see you in private charley britton said why dont i come back in ten minutes he wants a favor madam britton wants him to spend a little time at home maybe somebody is sick maybe somebody at the school wants a real cop for a teacher and he doesnt want that something personal jack castillo asked britton visibly thought that over before replying yeah in a way but no not really personal something to do with whats going on here britton nodded what the hell doesnt he want miller and mcguire to hear i cant have that jack let me tell you how were going to work around here castillo said or how were not going to work around here i dont want anyone to be in the dark about anything thats going on he swept his hand to indicate he meant everybody in the office then added and that includes mr forbison i cant see how we can work any other way permission to speak sir miller asked now what the hell is the matter with him if youre being clever dick now is not the time castillo said im asking if youre open to a comment or a question as kit does anyone include special agent david william yung jr miller asked then looked at mcguire and explained when charley told him he was sending him to uruguay to keep the details of lorimers bank accounts from becoming public knowledge yung had to think it over carefully oh shit mcguire said and thats not the first time hes had reservations is it say it out loud dick castillo said i think its only a matter of time before his conscience overwhelms him about the irregular things youre having him do andor he really gets homesick for the purity of the fbi and decides to come clean miller said he let that sink in then finished and the more he knows the more he will have to tell hes right charley mcguire said theres a puritan streak in the fbi they like to hire pure people they start working on them at quantico that the book is holy that they have to go by it and they keep it up afterward even before dick brought it up i wondered if yung belonged in here id say send him back to the fbi but that would remind him even more that we are ignoring the book and he already knows too much to take the risk that he would confess all so me sending him down there was a mistake castillo asked not a mistake but risky mcguire said and who else could you have sent well i guess the thing to do is bring him back and sit on him after he makes sure that what weve done with lorimers money doesnt get out castillo said the only comment i have is that i agree that yung iswhat highly moral whats wrong with that and i think he would love nothing better than to go to somebody in the fbi and tell them whats going on around here but it is that morality that keeps him from doing that run that past me again miller said you were here dick i asked him if he had any mental reservations and he saidafter thinking about itthat he didnt i think he meant that keep your fingers crossed charley miller said doubtfully but youre right we cant afford to have him in the loop castillo said well tell him as little as possible he turned to britton youre in the loop jack we all need to know what you have to say britton shrugged then said okay this is one of those damned if you do damned if you dont things i heard something in philadelphia that is probably about as far off the wall as anything ever gets that logic tells me to dismiss but which i thought i should pass on to you lets have it castillo said i went to see sy fillmore in the hospital while i was there i got it from him whos he a counterterrorism detective he was doing what i used to do he went around the bend and theyve got him in the loony bin in friends hospital on roosevelt boulevard so my source is somebody theyre keeping in a padded room what did he have to say the brothers in his mosque believe they are about to get their hands on a nuclear bomb that does sound a little incredible miller said where are they going to get it britton shrugged he didnt know what he did know was they have just bought a farm in durham north carolina mcguire asked pennsylvania britton replied bucks county upper end of the county a couple of miles off the delaware river the reason they bought the place is because of the old iron mines on it iron mines theyre going to use them as bomb shelters when the nuclear bomb takes out philadelphia theyre stocking them with food etcetera tell me about the iron mines mcguire said well theyve been there forever britton said you remember when washington crossed the delaware ive heard about it im not quite that old mcguire said he crossed the delaware in a durham boat they were called durham boats because they moved the iron ore from the iron mines in durham down the delaware they havent taken any ore out of them for christ two hundred years but the mines the tunnels are still there because they were hacked out of solid rock you believe this story jack miller asked i dont want to believe it logic tells me not to believe it but sy fillmore tells me the brothers believe it and id like to know where they got the money to buy a hundredoddacre farm thats highpriced real estate up there they didnt pay for it with stolen social security checks stolen social security checks castillo asked thatand ripping off the neighborhood crack dealerswas their primary source of income when i was in the mosque and the cops in philadelphia castillo asked chief inspector fritz kramer for example what do they say they found cy wandering around north philly babbling to himself britton said it was three days before they even found out he was a cop and hes been in friends hospital ever since with a cop sitting outside his door as much to protect sy from himself as from the aals no chief kramer doesnt believe it he didnt even pass it on to the fbi where are they going to get a nuke miller asked how are they going to move it around hide it there were supposed to be thirtyodd suitcasesized nukes here smuggled in by the russians mcguire said they wouldnt be hard to move around or hide you think theres something to this tom castillo asked no but im like jack sometimes theres things you just shouldnt ignore because they dont make sense so what do we do tell the fbi castillo asked why dont you send jack back to philly mcguire asked ill call the secret service therethe agent in charge is an old friend of mineand tell him were interested in why a bunch of american muslims from philadelphia bought that farm where they got the money to buy it and what theyre doing with it and ill tell him we cant say why were interested if and when we get those answers we can think about it some more okay do it castillo ordered has anyone else got anything for me everybody shook their heads castillo went on what i am going to do now is go to my apartment and pack then im going to the old executive office building to wait for hall i was going to ask him what to do about our new liaison officer but dick and agnes have told me thats my problem then as soon as he lets me go im going to philadelphia to see betty schneider and then somehow im going to go to paris either tonight or as soon as i can i didnt know anybody went to paris on purpose miller said what are you going to do there thank you for asking and im not being sarcastic i want everybody to know what im doing castillo said the agency guy in parisedgar delchampsis a good guy a real oldtimer im going to ask him to go with me to lorimers apartment the embassy has been informed that im going to look after lorimers property for ambassador lorimer then im going to tell him what happened at lorimers estancia and see if he has any ideas who the guys who bushwhacked us were or who they were working for then im going to fulda to make sure theres no problems with all that money in my liechtensteinische landesbank account in the caymans maybe theres a better place to have it then im going to budapest to see a journalist named eric kocian who gave me some names of people in the oilforfood business i promised him i wouldnt turn them over to anyone i want to get him to let me use the names see if we can figure out where i might have got them other than from him im also going to ask him to guess who was paying the guys who bushwhacked us then maybe a quick stop in vienna to see what i can pick up there about the guy who was murdered just before lorimer decided to go missing before i come back here im probably going to go to uruguay and argentina i want to go through lorimers estancia to see what i can come up with which reminds me of something else that i probably would have forgotten dick get on the horn to somebody at fort rucker maybe the aviation board and find out the best panel and black boxes available on the civilian market for a bell ranger get a set of it put it in a box and ask secretary cohen to send it under diplomatic sticker to ambassador silvio in buenos aires what the hell is that all about you wouldnt believe the lousy avionics in the ranger i borrowed down there the new stuff is payment for the use of the chopper and it will be nice to have if i need to borrow the ranger again no one spoke for a moment then miller said charley those avionics are going to cost a fortune well have a fortune in the liechtensteinische landesbank so far as im concerned thats what its for miller gave him a thumbsup ill be in touch castillo said and walked toward his office door he turned dick can you come with me sure as christ made little green apples ive forgotten something three room the mayflower hotel connecticut avenue nw washington dc august major h richard miller jr was sprawled on the chaise longue in the master bedroom his stiff leg on the chair his good leg resting knee bent on the floor a bottle of heineken beer was resting in his hand on his chest major c g castillo was standing by the bed putting clothing into a hardsided suitcase if i was just coming back here he said i could get by with a carryon but if i take just a carryon ill find myself in the middle of winter in argentina and if you take the suitcase it will be misdirected to nome alaska miller said lifting his bottle to take a sip of beer it is known as the rule of the fickle finger of fate castillo closed the suitcase and set it on the floor so tell me about that castillo said pointing to millers leg what do they say at walter reed i am led to believe that my chances of passing an army flight physical range from zero to zilch i have been counseled that what i should do is take retirement for disability one bum knee is apparently worth seventy percent of my basic pay for the rest of my life oh shit castillo said what really pisses me off is that i have reason to believe that all i have to do to reactivate my civilian ticket reactivate yeah it went on hold when i didnt show up for my annual physical i didnt think i could pass it wearing twenty pounds of plaster of paris on my leg so my ticket became inactive they didnt pull it which is important but declared it inactive pending the results of a flight physical ive looked into that what that means is i find some friendly chancre mechanic he sees the scars and i tell him they are from a successful knee operation and show him how i can bend my knee he will make a note of that for the examiner giving me my flight test in other words did his knee operation result in a physical limitation that makes him unsafe in a cockpit the examiner will see that i can push the pedals satisfactorily my tickets as an instrumentqualified pilot in command of piston and jet multiengine fixedand rotarywing aircraft is reactivated which means i can then fly just about anything for anybody but the army can you push the pedals satisfactorily castillo asked i think so i would hate to believe that all the fucking exercise ive been doing flexing the son of a bitch has been in vain so what ive been thinking of doing is going to tampa and see if i cant find reasonably honest work as a contractor flying wornout russian helicopters on some bullshit mission in the middle of now here the pay is good whats wrong with staying right where you are working for you is something wrong with that it would look likewould becronyism think of it as affirmative action castillo said the office of organizational analysis is offering employment to somebody who meets all the criteria youre ignorant physically crippled mentally challenged and otherwise unemployable and black dont forget that and black ill talk to mcguire maybe he can get you hired by the secret service i dont think i could pass their physical well work something out i really hate to tell you this but i need you dick if i thought you really meant that charley have i ever lied to you you really dont want me to answer that do you in this case im going to need somebodyyouto protect my back from this goddamned liaison officer montvale is shoving down my throat and thats the truth you just cant say thank you just the same but i dont need a liaison officer to ambassador charles montvale the director of national intelligence hes not used to being told no especially when all hes trying to do is be helpful whats he really after he doesnt like the whole idea of a presidential agent if he cant take me overand im sure hes working on thathe wants to put me out of business so what what are they going to do send you back to the army whats wrong with that goddamn i wish that was one of my options castillo didnt respond to that instead he asked when is all this going to happen ill have thirty days from the time im restored to limited duty which should be in the next week to ten days i then have to tell them ill accept permanent limitedduty statuswhich means i would wind up in a recruiting office or a messkitrepair battalionor take the medical retirement then we have time castillo said just forget that contractor bullshit okay miller nodded thanks charley he said jesus that beer looks tempting castillo said give in miller said i will stay there ill go get one you want another without waiting for an answer he went into the living room and to the wet bar as he was taking two bottles of beer from the refrigerator he heard the telephone ring and when he went back into the bedroom miller was holding out a handset to him your guardian angel saving you from temptation miller said castillo took the phone castillo he said matt hall charley yes sir two changes in the plan hall said what plan yes sir ill pick you up there at half past seven not eight excuse me i said ill pick you up at half past seven not eight where are we going sir to the white house i told you oh no you didnt you told me that you were going to the white house i was going to be on the metroliner on the way to philadelphia at seventhirty that message must have come through garbled sir obviously hall said there was a suggestion of annoyance in his tone and the second change is that the president wants you to wear your uniform excuse me the president said about ten minutes ago quote tell charley to please wear his uniform end quote whats that all about castillo blurted the commander in chief did not choose to share with me any explanation of his desire hall said the seventeenth street entrance seventhirty brass and shoes shined appropriately got to go charley the line went dead castillo said sonofabitch good news huh castillo didnt reply he went to the walkin closet miller heard him say thank you west point castillo came out of the closet carrying a zippered nylon bag thank you west point miller parroted yeah castillo said the first thing i learned on the holy plain was that when you fuck up the only satisfactory excuse is no excuse sir the second thing i learned was to get your uniform pressed the minute you take it off because some sonofabitch will order you to appear in it when you least expect it and it had better be pressed and in this case the sonofabitch is the honorable matthew hall why does he want you to put on your uniform worse castillo said as he unzipped the bag the president does whats that about i have no fucking idea castillo said but like the good soldier i used to be i will show up at the appointed place at the appointed hour in the prescribed uniform what is the appointed place and the appointed hour nineteenthirty at the seventeenth street entrance from which hall will convey me to the white house for reasons unknown castillo started taking off his clothing laying his suit shirt and tie neatly on the bed so that he could change back into it as soon as he could get away from whatever the hell was going on at the white house the lobby of the mayflower hotel runs through the ground floor from the connecticut avenue entrance to the seventeenth street entrance the elevator bank is closer to connecticut avenue and it is some distancethreequarters of a city blockfrom the elevators to the seventeenth street entrance nevertheless major c g castillo now attired in his dress blue uniform saw her just about the moment he got off the elevator she was wearing a pale pink summer dress and a broad floppybrimmed hat he decided she was either waiting for someone to meet her there or was waiting as he would be for someone to pick her up she didnt see castillo until he was almost at the shallow flight of stairs leading upward to the seventeenth street foyer and doors then she looked at him without expression when he came close castillo said good evening mr wilson she said softly but intensely i thought it was you you miserable sonofabitch and its nice to see you again too castillo said put his brimmed uniform cap squarely on his head and pushed through the revolving door onto seventeenth street then walked to the waiting secret service gmc yukon xl he did not look back at the lobby but as the yukon pulled away from the curb he took a quick look mr patricia davies wilson still was standing there her arms folded over her breasts glaring at the yukon he remembered what miller had said about her death rays freezing his martini solid four the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc august castillo recognized the marine lieutenant colonel standing just inside the door in the splendiferous formal uniform heavily draped with gold braid and the aiguillettes of an aidedecamp to the commander in chief he had last seen him on air force one at keesler air force base in mississippi he even remembered his name mcelroy good evening mr secretary maam lieutenant colonel mcelroy said to secretary and mr matthew hall the president asks that you come to the presidential apartments then he looked at castillo who thought he saw recognition come slowly to mcelroys eyes and youre major castillo lieutenant colonel mcelroy asked yes sir castillo said and smiling pointed to his chest to the blackandwhite name tag reading castillo the president desires that you go to the presidential apartments major lieutenant colonel mcelroy said it was evident he did not appreciate castillo having pointed to his nametag well fuck you colonel all you had to do was look yes sir castillo said the elevator is there mr secretary lieutenant colonel mcelroy said gesturing thank you hall said the first lady was in the sitting room of the presidential apartments but not the president so were three other people whose presence did not surprise castillosecretary of state natalie cohen ambassador charles w montvale the director of national intelligence and frederick k beiderman the secretary of defenseand one general allan naylor whose presence did there was a photographer standing in a corner with two nikon digital cameras hanging around his neck i wonder what is about to be recorded for posterity montvale beiderman and hall were wearing dinner jackets naylor was wearing dress blues hell be out in a minute the first lady announced and then added hello charley we havent seen much of you lately good evening maam the men nodded at him but no one spoke the president came in a moment later shrugging into his dinner jacket there was a chorus of good evening mr president the president circled the room first kissing the women then shaking hands with the men including charley okay general the president ordered as usual im running a little late lets get this show on the road naylor took a sheet of paper from his tunic attention to orders he read department of the army washington dc extract from general order dated august paragraph eleven major carlos g castillo special forces is promoted lieutenant colonel with date of rank july for the chief of staff johnson l maybree major general the adjutant general ill be a sonofabitch and as soon as the colonel comes over here so general naylor and i can put his new shoulder boards on him the president said motioning for castillo to join him i will have a few words to say the photographer came out of his corner one camera up and its flash firing castillo without thinking about it came to attention next to the president how do we get the old ones off the president asked tugging at castillos shoulder boards let me show you mr president general naylor said he handed something to the president and put his hands on castillos shoulders castillo glanced down to see what naylor had handed the president of course light birds shoulder boards but theyre not new christ theyre his castillo felt his eyes water and these slip on this way naylor said demonstrating the photographer bobbed around clicking the shutter of his nikon every second or so as the president got one shoulder board on and then naylor got the other one on and as they stood side by side and then as the president and then naylor shook charleys hand and then as the others in the room became involved charleys hand was shaken by the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense his cheek was kissed by the first lady the secretary of state and mr hall a final series of photos including everyone was taken and now i have something to say the president said as some of you may know i am the commander in chief until the promotion of colonel castillo came up i naively thought that meant i could issue any order that i wanted and it would be carried out i learned that does not apply to the promotion of officers when colonel castillo found and returned to our control the the terrorists had stolen in angolawhen the entire intelligence community was still looking for it when we learned how close the lunatics had actually come to crashing it into the liberty bell in downtown philadelphia after the entire intelligence community had poohpoohed that possibilityi thought that a promotion would be small enough reward for castillos extraordinary service to our country thenmajor castillo had already been selected matt hall told me for promotion to lieutenant colonel not only selected but selected for quick promotion because of outstanding service so i asked general naylor how soon can i promote him and general naylor said in effect that i couldnt that it doesnt work that way well i thought that might well be because general naylor and colonel castillo have a close personal relationship and he didnt want it to look like charley was getting special treatment so i went to the chief of staff of the army and said i knew of an outstanding major a west pointer and a green beret like the chief of staff who not only had been selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel on what i now knew to be the five percent list but had rendered a great service to his country and i would like to know why he couldnt be promoted immediately and the chief of staff said that it didnt work like that and as a west pointer and a green beret the major to whom i was referring would understand that the clear implication being so should the commander in chief so the commander in chief backed off except to phone general naylor and order him the moment he learned that the slowly grinding wheels of the army promotion system had finally ground out that it was time to promote major castillo to let me know immediately which he did the day before yesterday he turned to castillo shook his right hand and put his left on castillos shoulder so you colonel castillo are going to have to be satisfied with better late than never congratulations charley thank you sir there was polite laughter applause and another round of handshaking over the objections of the secretary of state who fears that after one drink i will give the country away to our guests tonight we will now toast colonel castillos new rank the president said a whitejacketed steward appeared with a tray of champagne glasses and distributed them ladies and gentlemen the president said his glass raised lieutenant colonel c g castillo the president had just put his glass to his lips when a steward motioned that he had a telephone call natalie and i have been expecting that the president said will you excuse us please he and the secretary of state left the room general naylor walked up to charley thank you for the shoulder boards sir charley said my pleasure colonel naylor said and if you have no further need for your old ones allans on the majors list id be honored to have allan wear them sir ambassador montvale joined them he laid an almost paternal hand on castillos shoulder i think you were genuinely surprised by this werent you colonel i agree with the president that its overdue an alarm bell went off in castillos mind why is this sonofabitch charming me because the president made that little speech set up this ceremony in the first place no he wants something what he doesnt want me complaining about his goddamned liaison officer thats what it is he knows that right now the president is in a mood to give me just about anything i ask for if i dont bite the bullet now about thatand doing so now would ruin this were all pals ambianceby the time i get back and god only knows when that will beill permanently be stuck with mr truman ellsworth general naylor told me a long time ago that waiting for a promotion is like watching a glacier castillo said for a long time absolutely nothingand then all of a sudden a great big splash montvale and naylor chuckled whats that line from basic tactics the best defense is a good offense mr ambassador charley said id like a few minutes of your time if that would be possible naylors surprise was evident on his face certainly montvale said sometime tomorrow afternoon sir just as soon as i can im going to be on a plane to paris you mean now if that would be possible sir actually ive been wanting to have a private word with you too montvale said thoughtfully and this would seem to be one of those fortuitous circumstances thank you sir castillo said especially since general naylor is here montvale went on excuse me naylor said we could go to the situation room and use the bubble but im afraid that the three of us going there would attract attention wouldnt you agree general someone would decide that something is going on that they should know about mr ambassador naylor said my aide is waiting outside with a car to take me to andrews just as soon as i can get away from here im going back to tampa so far as getting away from here is concerned montvale said our role in tonights events is over the president has moved on to other things on his agenda and if something unexpected comes up he knows how to find us i really dont want to waste the next couple of hours smiling at people i dont really like i was just thinking the same thing naylor confessed smiling i know montvale said the army and navy club we could talk there could i impose and suggest we go there mr ambassador i really have to get back to tampa naylor said general i just saved us from two hoursat leastof smiling at people we dont like cant you spare me thirty minutes id really like for you to be there when the colonel and i have our little chat yes of course naylor said playing the game i suggest we leave in our own vehicles montvale said as they approached the portico secretary hall brought me here castillo said may i ride with you general you can use the pool montvale said sir montvale answered by speaking to one of the secret service uniformed police guards at the door well need my car general naylors and colonel castillo will need one from the pool he ordered yes sir the guard said then he spoke to his lapel microphone send up big eyes car tampa ones car and one from the pool for don juan then he turned to montvale theyll be right here sir he said thirty seconds later a dark blue gmc yukon xl pulled up ill wait for you in the lobby montvale said to naylor all right thatll be fine as montvale got in the yukon a dark blue chevrolet suburban pulled up behind it a full colonel wearing the insignia of an aidedecamp got out of the front passengers seat as a staff sergeant came out from behind the wheel to snatch the covers from the fourstar bumper plates castillo as a reflex action saluted the colonel jack take the car to the armynavy club naylor said ill ride with majcolonel castillo yes sir the colonel said another dark blue yukon came up the drive and pulled in ahead of the chevrolet as the sergeant put the covers back over naylors fourstar plates a secret service agent got out of the front passengers seat and opened the rear door naylor climbed in and castillo followed him the secret service agent closed the door got in front and turned to look in the back where to sir the armynavy club please castillo said yes sir the secret service agent said and then spoke to his microphone don juan with tampa one aboard leaving the grounds for the armynavy club the yukon started down the drive toward pennsylvania avenue don juan with tampa one aboard naylor parroted don juan is joel isaacsons idea of humor charley said charley ive got something to say and i think i better say it before we get there yes sir what i was thinking tonightand dont misunderstand me you earned that promotionwas that i really wish i hadnt sent you to work for matt hall me too i wonder if you mean that naylor said this is pretty heady stuff charley a secret service car a secret service code name i am reminded of lieutenant colonel oliver north and that worries me castillo didnt reply i would have been much happier if your promotion meant you now would take command of some battalion naylor said i would too sir i didnt ask for this job and i asked to be relieved well thats not going to happen and thats what worries me naylor said then suddenly shifted subjects do you have any idea why montvale wants me at the club then before castillo could reply he asked another why did you want to talk to him i have no idea why he wants you there but the reason i want to talk to him is because he sent me truman ellsworth to be his liaison officerread spy truman ellsworth is a former under secretary of state naylor interrupted a liaison officer with that background yes sir i thought of that and i dont want him i want to get rid of him now before he chains himself to my desk i dont think i have to tell you that montvale is a powerful man and a dangerous one ive already figured that out castillo said in north africa naylor said almost to himself when eisenhower sent omar bradley to patton as his liaison officerread spypatton outwitted eisenhower by asking that bradley be assigned as his chief of staff that put bradley under pattons orders that kept him from communicating anything to eisenhower without patton knowing about it and not communicating anything patton didnt want communicated ive heard that story charley said i dont think you want this fellow ellsworth as your chief of staff naylor said ellsworth is not bradley he works for montvale and thats not going to change and youre not patton who had as many stars as bradley youre a lowly lieutenant colonel and ellsworth isa former under secretary of state thats what worries me castillo said the difference here is that patton worked for eisenhower you dont work for montvale but thats what hes after if he cant get that right now hell use ellsworth as your puppet master thats what it looks like to me sir charley agreed goddamn it i hate washington naylor said v one the daiquiri lounge the army and navy club seventeenth street nw washington dc august ambassador montvale was waiting for them in the lobby they all walked up the stairs to the second floor then into the daiquiri lounge taking a table in the bar where castillo knew he and general naylor could smoke cigars it immediately became apparent that before their conversation could begin they were going to have to deal with other guests in the lounge the commander in chief of central command was not only known tothat is to say a friend ofhalf a dozen officers and their wives having afterdinner drinks there but as one of the most powerful officers in the army was someone to whom it was necessary to make manners once the first old friend walked over to shake general naylors hand everyone else decided that it was not only all right for them to do so but expected of them each visithowever briefrequired that both ambassador montvale and lieutenant colonel castillo be introduced and lieutenant colonel castillo was not used toand thus made a little uncomfortable bybeing addressed by his new title finally it was over and the waiter who had hovered in the background awaiting its end came to the table gentlemen what can i get for you im a scotch drinker montvale answered looking at naylor nothing fancy no single malt something like chivas regal that okay with you fine naylor said what is he trying to do establish the pecking order by telling naylor what to drink and why did naylor go along castillo looked at the waiter yes please he said when the waiter had left montvale asked what are you going to do in paris sir im still looking for the people who murdered mr masterson castillo said thats what you wanted to talk to me about no sir maybe you should maybe theres something i could do to help castillo didnt reply well montvale continued if you didnt want my help then what is it that you wish to talk about mr ellsworth sir truman ellsworth a good man what about him im sure he is but i dont want a liaison officer oh right to the bottom line yes sir i could offer any number of reasons why a liaison officer who enjoys my trust could be very useful to you im sure you could but thank you very much just the same i dont want mr ellsworth because you think he would be spying on you for me castillo didnt reply but he thought of something that might provide an excuse for him not to do so immediately maybe ill think of something sir excuse me i have to make a call montvale looked at him impatiently naylor looked at him curiously castillo punched an autodial number on his cellular telephone dick he said a moment later i think i can make the air france flight to paris can you send my luggageand the suit and shirt and tie i left on the bed and my laptop caseto the armynavy club just tell the driver to wait outside castillo listened for a moment then said actually im having a drink with general naylor and ambassador montvale he paused yes i will thanks dick ill check in from paris he pushed the call end button and turned to general naylor major millers compliments sir he said naylor nodded whats your objection to having mr ellsworth work with you montvale asked resuming the conversation as if there had been no interruption castillo met his eyes for a moment i might as well go down fighting ive been thinking about that sir castillo said i certainly cant order you to do anything but if you elect to keep sending mr ellsworth to the nebraska complex im afraid what hes going to be doing is sitting in an office all day without very much to do at all what the hell are you talking about unless mr ellsworth has access to the presidential finding establishing the office of organizational analysis theres nothing i can tell him about what were really doing thats ridiculous and you know it montvale snapped ellsworth has had the highestlevel security clearances for years again castillo didnt reply and again montvale took his meaning youre not actually suggesting castillo that youre not going to give truman ellsworth the necessary security clearance are you sir i dont see where mr ellsworth has the need to know about the presidential finding and my mission ill clear him for the finding sir i dont believe you have that authority castillo said as i understand it only the president and i do i cant believe what im hearing just who the hell do you think you are im the director of national intelligence i decide who is cleared for what ambassador you dont have the authority to clear anyone for that presidential finding castillo said well i guess well just have to see what the president has to say about that montvale said and about your attitude yes sir i guess we will castillo said before this gets out of hand gentlemen general naylor said im going to say that neither one of you wants this disagreement to go any further nothing is going to get out of hand thank you very much general montvale said good naylor said because it would not be in the best interests of the countryor either of youif it did montvale looked icily at him frankly general i was hoping that you would help me reason with major castillo help him to understand where he fits into the system its now colonel castillo mr ambassador naylor said lieutenant colonel i believe montvale said like lieutenant colonel oliver north who was also a junior officer given more authority than he was equipped to handle you remember lieutenant colonel north dont you general i dont have the feeling mr ambassador naylor said that the president thinks he has given colonel castillo more authority than he can handle do you montvale didnt respond let me suggest a scenario mr ambassador naylor said glancing around the lounge then satisfied no one was trying to follow their conversation continued in a lower voice this dispute comes before the president that would force him to choose between you two from what i have seen of the president he doesnt like to be forced to do anything nevertheless obviously naylor went on you are of far greater importance to the government to the country than is colonel castillo colonel castillo would be relieved but he would be replaced because we know the president likes having an agenta presidential agent if you willanswerable only to him and you and i both know that his replacement would not be anyone you might suggest however well qualified he might be that would be giving you too much of a victory so it would be another military officer and i put it to you sir that no matter how well that officer might do his performance would be compared by the president against that of colonel castillo and found wanting partially because in the two successful operations colonel castillo has run as the presidents agent he wasas he is well awareincredibly lucky and partially because it wasnt all luck colonel castillo has demonstrated that he is obviously extremely well qualified for the duties the president has chosen to give him and i put it to you further mr ambassador that alwaysalwaysthe president is going to be thinking if montvale hadnt gotten on his high horse and forced me to get rid of castillo things would have turned out better you were there he did everything but beatify charley in that little postpromotion speech he gave naylor turned to castillo and you colonel are going to have to learn something that is not taught at west point an accommodation is not a surrender you are going to have to come to some arrangement an accommodation with ambassador montvale and he with you or you will both be failing the president and im sure neither of you wants that montvale was about to reply when the waiter delivered their drinks stopping the conversation after hed gone montvale stirred his for several seconds then extended the plastic stirrer to castillo take it the director of national intelligence said think of it as an olive branch make love not war castillo asked as he took the stirrer it earned him a dirty look from naylor i really dont want to get in a war with you charley montvale said charley not castillo not colonel or even major im being charmed again and thats dangerous nor i with you mr ambassador shall we lay our cards on the table i have only one card to play going to the president and telling him i cant function with mr ellsworth looking over my shoulder and reporting to you everything im doing or planning on doing i dont understand why my being kept aware of what youre doing is wrong montvale said certainly you confide in general naylor he does not naylor said flatly i frankly hoped he would but he has not montvale raised an eyebrow you both realize im sure that would put another arrow in my quiver if i have to go to the president mr president he doesnt even tell general naylor what hes doing remember ollie north naylor said to which the president might well reply thats because colonel castillo doesnt work for general naylor he works for me point well taken montvale said after a moment with a smile are you going to the president mr ambassador castillo asked probably but not right now that one card of yoursat this momentis the ace of all spades general naylor is right if the president was the pope after that session in the apartment tonight you would now be saint carlos the savior of his country both naylor and castillo chuckled so you are going to find something else for mr ellsworth to do castillo asked let me show you my cards montvale said okay castillo nodded im very impressed with you is that what they call the flattery card hear me out all it will cost you is a little time my standard tactic when im dealing with someone i know is smarter than me is to run castillo said is that your flattery card i am out of my class with you and i know it just because it may be flattering doesnt mean it isnt true castillo said then why does it have to be untrue that im impressed with you that would depend on why youre impressed like the president i think you did one hell of a job finding that airplane and then finding this lorimer fellow the major problem i have with youother than that the president thinks you should be beatifiedis that i think you should be working for me mr ambassador i dont want to work for you at the moment thats a moot question isnt it the president is very happy with his presidential private agent all i want from you sir is to be left alone to do what the president wants me to do until you said that i was beginning to think you might really be as smart as the president thinks montvale said excuse me you cant afford to be alone charley montvale said you need me my assets my authority my influence think about it they use your face as a dartboard in langley and in the j edgar hoover building the fbi is starting to hate you as much as they do your friend howard kennedy i wasnt sure you believed that story castillo said i checked on it montvale said i have some friends in the bureau to a man they would like to see kennedy dragged apart by four horses after he was disemboweled curiosity overwhelmed general naylor who is this fellow what did he do montvale smiled more than a little condescendingly as charley told meand my friends confirmedafter being made privy to the darkest secrets of the fbi mr kennedy went to workpresumably at a far more generous salaryfor a notorious russian mafioso a chap named aleksandr pevsner taking with him all the darkest secrets he paused the reason they hate our friend charley is because when they sent an inspector to tell him they expected him to notify them immediately of any contact with kennedy our friend charley told them not to hold their breath they also suspectcorrectlythat charley was behind the presidents order to them to immediately cease and desist looking for mr kennedy pevsner and kennedy have been useful to me in the past castillo said and almost certainly will be useful to me in the future charley saw the look on naylors face its a look ofsympathetic resignation hes thinking im going down ollie norths path and that i have just lost this confrontation well what the hell did i expect montvales right i am a junior officer given more authority than i am equipped to handle a very small fish in a large pond about to be eaten by a very large shark what are you suggesting mr ambassador castillo asked until such time as i can convince the presidentand thats a question of when not ifthat the office of organizational analysis should be under me i suggest that it would be in our mutual interest to cooperate cooperate how on your part primarily by keeping me informed of what youre doing i really dont like walking into the oval office to have the president greet me with charles youre not going to believe what castillo has done and have no idea what the hell hes talking about i want to be able to tell him that i knew what you would be going to try to do and that i did thus and so to help you do it im sorry he said just before he was shot down in flames but if that means you will insist on your liaison officer no deal the look on the generals face now means i have really just shot myself in the foot thats negotiable montvale said negotiable castillo blurted it was not the response he expected that means you offer me something in lieu thereof and i decide if im willing to take it that telephone call i made just now it was to my chief of staff major richard miller what about him you take mr ellsworth out of my office and i will instruct major miller to tell youpromptlyeverything he can without putting the lives of my men at risk about what im doing and why we are i presume talking about the same major miller who comes to my mind excuse me the generals son the man whose life you savedat considerable risk to your life and careerin afghanistan the man whom mr wilson accused of making improper advances to her when she was in fact at the time making the beast with two backs in your bed that major miller yes sir that major miller deal montvale said and got half out of his chair and put out his hand jesus h christ this is too easy when does the other shoe drop montvales grip was firm our new relationship will probably be a good deal less unpleasant for you than i suspect you suspect it will be montvale said smiling yes sir castillo said okay why are you going to paris montvale asked retaking his seat okay a deal is a deal ill live up to my end of it i got ambassador lorimer mr lorimers father to give me sort of power of attorney to settle his affairs in paris and uruguay i want to see what i can turn up in his apartment and at his estancia youre also going to uruguay yes sir and you think you are qualified to perform searches of that nature no sir i dont im going to enlist the cia station chiefs in both places to help me what makes you think they will because i have already dealt with them sir theyll help montvale nodded anything else i should know i have a source in budapest id rather not identify him he gave me a list of names of people involved in the oilforfood business with the caveat that i do not turn them over to the agency or anyone else im going there to see if i can get him to release me from that agreement and if he doesnt then i will have to see if i can get another list from someone else montvale nodded but did not respond directly instead asking whats happened to the money we got it out of uruguay first into an account an fbi agent there had opened in the caymans yung the one who was with you when lorimer was terminated yes sir im sending him back to uruguay to cover our tracks hell be able to do that i think so sir he would probably be useful permanently assigned to you montvale said have you thought about that yes sir i have secretary hall arranged it well fine but the next time something like that comes up i suggest you come to me with it what is he doing trying to cut matt hall out of the loop yes sir you said first into yungs account montvale pursued and then i moved it into an account i opened in the same bank the liechtensteinische landesbank that took place today in your name in the name of an identitythat of a german nationali use sometimes i thought that would be best and you can trust the people at gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh to keep their mouths shut montvale asked yes sir castillo said as the realization dawned jesus christ he knows about that too and he asked the question in absolutely fluent german montvale switched back to english goddamn he is good isnt he general montvale asked naylor didnt reply instead he asked am i permitted to ask what money you can ask of course montvale said smiling but getting an answer would depend on the colonel as he correctly pointed out he and the president are the only ones with the key to the finding it would be a felony for me to tell you whats he doing now playing with me with general naylor with both of us general castillo said lorimer had nearly sixteen million dollars in several banks in uruguay we took it over it is now the operating fund for the office of organizational analysis how did you manage to do that naylor asked he doesnt need to know that does he colonel montvale asked no i dont naylor answered for him and i dont think i want to i have access to business jets in europe and in brazil montvale said would it facilitate your travel if i made them available to you it would probably draw attention to me castillo replied theyre agency assets actually montvale said the agency owns two charter companies in europe and one in brazil sort of an aerial version of the town car limos that prowl the streets of manhattan i dont think taking a ride in one would draw undue attention to you all i would really be doingunless you needed a plane for more than carrying you from point a to point bwould be ensuring you went to the head of the line can i have a rain check when we shook hands you got your rain check montvale said good for as long as you hold up your end of our deal he took a large wallet from his jacket took a card from it and laid the card on the table then he took an electronic notebook from another pocket consulted it and wrote several numbers on the card he handed the card to castillo by the time you get to france the aerial limo services will understand that when you call you go to the head of the line the bottom number on there is mine use it if you ever need anything you think i can provide and cant get through to me through the white house switchboard thank you castillo said can you think of anything else i can do for you montvale asked mr wilson is a now a senior analyst in the agencys south american divisions southern cone section castillo said montvale pursed his lips thoughtfully i knew she managed not to get fired but i didnt know that he said we cant have that can we miller and i ran into her in the lobby of the mayflower earlier tonight castillo said she called me a miserable sonofabitch well i can see how she might feel that way montvale said ill deal with it first thing tomorrow thank you anything else no sir i cant think of anything else well in that case im afraid im going to have to be going montvale said he stood up drained his drink and offered his hand to naylor who had risen to his feet its always a pleasure general naylor he said then he turned to castillo shook his hand and patted his shoulder this turned out better than either of us thought it would didnt it he asked keep in touch colonel yes sir i will montvale walked out of the room and naylor and castillo sat down jesus christ charley said why does his being so cheerful charming and accommodating make me so uncomfortable maybe because you werent asleep when they were lecturing about never under estimating your enemy castillo chuckled im sorry i said that naylor said thoughtfully a moment later that was a hell of a session but im not so sure he doesnt mean exactly what he said the bottom line is that he got what he wanted which was if you succeed he can claim credit if you fail he can say it wouldnt have happened if you worked for him castillo grunted and he was right naylor went on you do need his influence and authority the fbi and the ciaand everybody elseare afraid of him and with good reason once it becomes known as it soon will that hes standing behind you people will think very carefully before knifing you in the back i thought i had the president standing behind me castillo said you do but the president is a decent fellow the ambassador on the other hand is well known as a follower of the kennedy philosophy sir dont get mad get even naylor said he is not a man to be crossed but on the other hand i think hes a man of his word castillo looked at his wristwatch ive got to change out of my uniform and get out to dulles he said but before i do i really would like another drink after that we both need one naylor said but theres one thing you have to do before that sir naylor took out his cellular telephone and punched an autodial number allan naylor dona alicia he said a moment later im sitting here in the armynavy club in washington with lieutenant colonel castillo and we thought wed call and say hello there was a pause yes maam thats what i said he handed the cellular to castillo your grandmother would like a word with you colonel an hour and a half later as air france flight climbed to cruising altitude somewhere over delaware herr karl gossinger the washington correspondent of the tages zeitung accepted a second glass of champagne from the firstclass cabin attendantand suddenly startled her by bitterly exclaiming oh shit it had just occurred to him that he had not only not gone to see special agent elizabeth schneider in her hospital bed but had not even called her to tell her why he couldnt two suite intercontinental paris rue de castiglione paris france august the bellman placed castillos suitcase on the nicely upholstered stand next to the dresser graciously accepted his tip and left pulling the door to the suite quietly closed behind him castillo made a beeline for the toilette voided his bladder then sat down on one of the double beds he picked up the telephone and dialed a number from memory united states embassy a womans pleasant voice answered monsieur delchamps sil vous plait the paris cia station chief answered on the second buzz delchamps my name is gossinger mr delchamps perhaps you remember we met recently in the crillon delchamps hesitated just perceptibly oh yes mr gossinger is it ive been expecting your call youre in the crillon again the continental i was wondering if you were free for lunch yes i am how does a hamburger sound youre not suggesting mcdonalds no what you get in mcdonalds is a frenchified hamburger you can still get a real hamburger in harrys new york bar its right around the corner from the continental you want to meet me in the lobby i can leave here right now a real hamburger sounds fine ill be waiting thank you your wish is my command herr gossinger delchamps said and hung up delchampsa nondescript man in his late fifties wearing a some what rumpled suitcame around the corner from the rue de rivoli ten minutes later he offered castillo his hand nice to see you again mr gossinger how may i be of service why dont we wait until we get to harrys castillo replied whatever you wish sir delchamps said castillo eyed him a moment my chain is being pulled whats he up to the continental has an interesting history mr gossinger delchamps said as they started down rue de castiglione toward the ritz and the place de lopera are you interested fascinated castillo said smiling and playing along there was once a monastery where it now stands delchamps said louis xvi and his girlfriendlet them eat cake marie antoinettewere staying there just before they were taken over to the place de la concorde and had their heads removed in the name of liberty you dont say its absolutely true thank you for sharing that with me my pleasure sir delchamps said but let me continue since you seem to find this of interest please do castillo said the conversation was momentarily interrupted by the sight of an incredibly beautiful longlegged blonde coming out of the hotel ritz she was surrounded by four muscular men who might as well have had security stamped on their large foreheads she got into the rear seat of a maybach in the process revealing a good deal of thigh one of the gorillas with her got in the front seat of the car another trotted quickly to a mercedes in front of it and the other two trotted to an identical mercedes behind it the convoy rolled majestically away toward the rue de rivoli i regret being unable to identify that young woman for you mr gossinger as i can see you are really interested delchamps said after they had passed the entrance to the ritz but im sure shes someone famous either that or a highclass hooker castillo said the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive delchamps said castillo chuckled but i was telling you about the continental wasnt i delchamps asked and then went on without waiting for a reply and it was in the continentali seem to remember in but dont hold me to thatthat what many regard as the advertising coup of all time took place ive always been interested in advertising castillo said tell me about that tourism was just beginning to blossom and become big business delchamps said the british the italians the germans and of course the french were in hot competition for the yankee tourist dollar there was hardly a building on manhattan island without a billboard urging the yankees to come to england italy germany or france there were so many of them that not one of them really caught peoples attention and the advertising was really expensive which really bothered the french the matter was given a great deal of thought and in studying the problem the french realized that the ideal advertisement would be something that incorporated novelty edison had just given us the lightbulb you will recall so the new advertisement had to include one of those yankees the french knew also liked amply bosomed females so the advertisement would have to have one of those too how about an amply breasted woman holding an electric light over her head castillo laughed aloud you sonofabitch you had me going the statue of liberty delchamps smiled and nodded and if we give it to the yankees the clever frogs realized call it a gift of friendship or something not only will the yankees never take it down butdesperate as they are to have people like themtheyll put it someplace where it cant be missed and if we give it to them theyll pay to maintain it if we play our cards right we can probably even get them to pay for partmaybe mostof it god isnt history fascinating castillo said that meeting took place right in your hotel delchamps said and here we are on rue danou site of the legendary harrys new york bar would you be interested to learn that ernest hemingway used to hang around in harrys absolutely castillo said as delchamps held open the door to the bar for him paris was known in those days as the intellectual center of the world the truth is that before we sent pershing over here to save their ass they had emptied the french treasury and wiped out a generation of their male population in a standoff with the krauts he paused to direct castillo pointing to the stairway to the basement when he had followed castillo down the narrow winding stairway and they had taken stools at the bar he picked up where he had left off and presuming you had the yankee dollar it was one of the cheapest places to live not to mention that since most of the young frogs had been killed in the trenches there was no shortage of places for you to hide your salami the bartender appeared they have other stuff but they make a really good hamburger delchamps said sounds fine castillo said delchamps orderedin fluent parisian french castillo notedthe hamburgers medium rare and two bottles of dortmunder union beer do you find it interesting herr gossinger that your tail is resting where very possibly hemingways tail once rested yes i find that interesting castillo said and would you be interested in hearing the true story of hemingways war service as an officer i would be interested he drove an ambulance in the italian army medical corps delchamps said normally as you know herr oberst ambulance drivers are privates oh every once in a while theres a pfc and maybe even a corporal after long and faithful service but usually a private i suppose thats true castillo said hemingway was a lieutenant delchamps said the italian government decided it wouldnt be good if all the starryeyed american boys who rushed to do their part in the war to end all wars wrote home to mama about how privates driving ambulances in the italian army were treated and fed so they made them all second lieutenants really true story you found it interesting i hope absolutely but you know what i would really find interesting to know and what is that please tell me if you deliver these fascinating interesting lectures on littleknown facts of history to everyone who comes to paris or if you have some interestingpossibly nefariouspurpose in relating them to me in your case herr oberst gossinger i was ordered to do so delchamps said as he took a sheet of paper from his pocket thats the second time he called me herr oberst i wonder whats that all about this came in at six this morning colonel delchamps said handing the paper to castillo making it necessary for me to get out of bed at that obscene hour and go to the fucking embassy to get it i was as you can imagine more than a little pissed for several reasons castillo unfolded the sheet of paper and read it top secret urgent duplication forbidden deliver immediately to edgar j delchamps only and report time of delivery or reasons for failure to do so from director national intelligence to edgar j delchamps cia station chief paris copies to eyes only secstate sechomelandsec dircia colonel c g castillo usa is presently en route paris on a mission for the president of the united states which he may at his sole discretion elect to clarify for you colonel castillo will be furnished whatever assistance and intelligence he requests to include but not limited to access to agencyowned aviation assets further it is directed that you furnish him with any intelligence not specifically requested but in which you feel he may be interested charles w montvale director of national intelligence top secret when montvale called the last time you came here he told me you were a major ace delchamps said accusingly im a lieutenant colonel as of yesterday castillo said then permit me to be among the very first to congratulate you i didnt have anything to do with this castillo said handing the message back but it does explain the interesting history lectures doesnt it you going to tell me about this presidential mission youre on or are we going to fuck around with each other in the dark its more than a mission theres been a presidential finding castillo said the bottom line of which is im supposed to find and render harmless whoever whacked jack the stack masterson in buenos aires and youre working for who montvale directly the president directly montvale thinks i should be working for him well that explains that little middleofthenight billetdoux doesnt it he makes me feel like a sixteenyearold virgin with some thirtyyearold guy chasing me who wont take no for an answer i take your point even if i dont think you were ever a sixteenyearold virgin delchamps said the un notified the embassy that lorimer was killed during a robbery in uruguay of all goddamned places thats obviously bullshit you have the real skinny on that he was whacked with a madsen at an estancia he owned down there your source reliable i was there i had just told lorimer he was about to be returned to the bosom of his family when somebody stuck a madsen through the window put two bullets in his head and wounded one of the guys with me you do get around dont you ace the bad guys also garroted one of my guys a delta force sergeant who wasnt easy to get to they were real professionals who all unfortunately left this vale of tears before they could tell you who they worked for castillo nodded there were six of them all dressed in black no identification sounds like spetsnaz or mossad delchamps said or maybe even frogs from ripem from where the bartender delivered their dortmunder union delchamps waited until he was out of earshot before answering le premiere regiment de parachutistes dinfanterie de marine delchamps explained ripem from the acronym are pretty good the french version of the english sas which is where they got started rumor has it that theyve got a bunch of exspetsnaz from spetsnaz to legion etrangere to ripem french castillo thought aloud why not the frogs were up to their ears in the oilforfood business and from what i hear lorimer knew which ones i never even thought of the french castillo admitted you didnt learn anything from lorimer jesus how the hell did you find him in uruguay i did find what we believe to be almost sixteen million skimmed from the bribe funds but as you put it he passed from this vale of tears before i could ask him about it sit on that and see who tries to get it weve got it castillo said good for you delchamps said and took his beer glass and in a toast clinked it against castillos delchamps took a sip then continued you were going to tell me how you found lorimer i was convincedas i told youthat he was feeding the fish in either the seine or the danube i have a source a reporter whos been running down the transfer of money from oilforfood profits from germany to south americauruguay and argentinaand i got some names from him i was showing them to an fbi agent in montevideo who was working money laundering he opened one of his files and jeanpaul lorimers picture was in it he had another identityjeanpaul bertrand lebanese passport antiquities dealerand what im guessing is that when they stopped looking for lorimer he was going to move elsewherewith the sixteen mil reporter from where a german newspaper that makes me wonder about gossinger delchamps said i was born in germany to a german mother so far as the germans are concerned that makes me a german forever and eligible for a german passport its a handy cover you going to tell me who castillo is my father was a huey pilot who got killed in vietnam before he got around to marrying my mother when i was twelve my fathers parents found out about me and off i went to the states with my fathers name on my american passport delchamps met his eyes for a moment but didnt respond directly instead he said i would say that maybe the ksk is involved but the ksk die kommando spezialkrafte ksk german special forces you didnt know his german pronunciation is perfect he sounds like hes a berliner well he told me hed done time in berlin two of the guys in black were blackskinned castillo said i never even thought they might be german which was pretty goddamned stupid of me delchamps looked as if he had been going to say something but had changed his mind say it castillo said delchamps looked at him for a moment then shrugged some of the kidshell thousands of themin situations like yours had black fathers whose family didnt take them to the states when they grew upand being a black bastard in germany couldnt have been a hell of a lot of funthey found getting jobs was hard but they were german citizens and could join the army a lot of them did and by and large most of them werent fans of anything american i should have thought of that castillo said that said i think its unlikely that ksk would be involved in anything like what happened in uruguay unlikely but not impossible they keep them on a pretty tight leash there were some german special forces people in afghanistan castillo said i didnt see any black ones so what do you want to do in paris can you get me into lorimers apartment i can but youre not going to find anything there delchamps said the deuxieme bureau and the un guys went through it as soon as he turned up missing and so did i when i learned there was interest in the bastard hes right this has been a wildgoose chase inspector clouseau fucks up again i just remembered delchamps went on that im the guy who assured you that lorimer had already been taken care of so okay well have another look you looking for anything special nothing special anything thatll point me in the direction of whoever whacked masterson and thats all you came to paris for castillo nodded where are you going from here to see the german reporter to his newspaper i want to talk to his editor wheres that fulda well i cant get you in the apartment until after dark so what i suggest is that when we finish our hamburgersif we ever get themwe go over to the embassy and have another look at what ive got maybe youll see something i dont youve got your american passport castillo nodded and while were there ill get on the horn to brussels and have eurojet taxi pick you up at charles de gaulle in the morning whats closest to fulda rhinemain castillo nodded but its no longer rhinemain we gave it back to the germans a couple of weeks ago its now all frankfurt international the old order changeth and giveth way to the new write that down castillo chuckled ed im not sure about using that eurojet whatever you said why dont i catch a train after we do the apartment worried about owing montvale castillo nodded on the other hand if he hears you used his airplaneand he willhell presume he has you in his pocket having him think that is known as disarming your enemy why do you make me feel so stupid delchamps youre not stupid ace a little short on experience maybe but not stupid i dont suppose youd be interested in reasonably honest employment in our nations capital would you delchamps met his eyes for a long moment why dont we talk about that again ace after you find out who these people are that presumes i will rephrase after you have your best shot at it the first thing a wise spook has to admit is that failure is the norm you seem to have learned that so maybe there is some hope for you in this business three the residence of the ambassador of the united states of america la rambla carrasco republica oriental del uruguay august as the honorable michael a mcgrory still in his bathrobe was sipping at a cup of coffee while looking some what glumly out his diningroom window at what looked like a drizzle that would last all day theodore j detweiller jr his chief of mission telephoned im sorry to bother you at home mr ambassador but i thought i should bring this to your attention immediately whats up ted mcgrory responded there were two ways to look at a chief of mission who would not take any action without being absolutely sure it was what the ambassador wanted on one hand ambassador mcgrory thought it was a good thing he didnt have to spend much time or effort rescinding detweillers bad decisions and repairing the collateral damage they may have caused because detweiller rarelyalmost nevermade any decisions on his own on the other having a de facto deputy ambassador who would not blow his nose until he found in the standing operating procedure when and under what circumstances doing so was specifically authorized or failing that until he had asked permission of the ambassador to do so was often a pain in the youknowwhere detweiller too often considered things that could well wait until the next dayor the next weekimportant enough to bring them to the ambassadors immediate attention even if that meant disturbing the ambassadors breakfast lunch or golf game i just now had a telephone call from deputy foreign minister alvarez mr ambassador at your home presumably yes sir at my home and what did deputy foreign minister alvarez want he asked if i was going to be in the office about nine detweiller reported and if so if i would be kind enough to offer him a cup of coffee mcgrory stopped himself just in time from saying well give him one ted and offer my best regards instead he asked he didnt say what he wanted huh no sir he didnt and i thought the call to my home at this hour a bit unusual isnt it yes sir i thought so you did tell deputy foreign minister alvarez that youd give him a cup of coffee ted didnt you yes sir i did mr ambassador may i give you my gut feeling of course i have the feeling sir that this is not a social call but that alvarez wants to keep it unofficial if you take my meaning i see and why would he want to do that i havent a clue but thats my gut feeling and i thought i should mention it and you should have and just as soon as you find out what he wanted if anything besides a cup of coffee let me know yes sir of course anything else ted no thats it again sorry to have to disturb you at home mr ambassador not at all ted ambassador mcgrory said and hung up the ambassador picked up his coffee cup took a sip and found that it was tepid goddamn it he exclaimed then returned the cup to the table with a bang and walked briskly out of the dining room and to his bedroom to get dressed since he really wanted a cup of fresh hot coffee when he got to his office mcgrory was not surprised to find that senora susanna obregon his secretary had not yet prepared any he did not remonstrate with her it would be a waste of his time she would have some excuse ranging from she liked to time the preparation of it so that it would be fresh and hot when he got to the office and today he was almost an hour early to the fact that her second cousins wife had just given birth to quadruplets he went into his office and sat at his desk there was only one sheet of paper in his inbox which meant that for a change there had not been radioed overnight at least a dozen friendly suggestions from the under secretary of state on how he could better do his job having nothing else to do until his coffee arrived he reached for the message in the inbox slumped back in his chair and began to read it secret asla aug from deputy assistant secretary of state for latin america to us embassy montevideo uruguay personal attention ambassador mcgrory confirming telecon between asstsectlatam and theodore j detweiller jr cm usemb montevideo august mr david w yung jr a special agent of the fbi on the personal staff of secstate is currently en route

ship all such materials via diplomatic pouch to state dept personal attention secstate or to make such other arrangements for their shipment to secstate as he desires barbara l quiglette deputy assistant secretary of state for latin america secret the sonofabitch interrupts my breakfast to tell me the deputy foreign minister wants to talk to him unofficially and didnt mention this goddamn him he should have called me the moment he got off the phone from talking to the under secretary last night mcgrory pushed himself out of his highbacked blueleatherupholstered chair and walked quickly to his office door still holding the radio teletype printout susanna he ordered i want to see right now in this order and separatelyin other words one at a timemr detweiller mr monahan and mr howell yes sir senora obregon replied three minutes later senora obregon reported that neither mr detweiller nor mr howell had yet come in but that mr monahan was on his way to the ambassadors office and asked if she should send him in or make him wait until hed seen the others send him in please mcgrory ordered monahan appeared at the office door moments later you wanted to see me mr ambassador mcgrory waved him into the office but not into one of the chairs in front of his desk im a little curious monahan why you did not elect to tell me yung is on the personal staff of the secretary of state mcgrory said excuse me you are the special agent in charge are you not and you were aware were you not of yungs status thats two questions mr ambassador answer them one at a time im the senior fbi agent here mr ambassador but not the sac whats the others a sac is in charge of the special agents monahan replied and then clarified it stands for special agent in charge and youre not no sir im the senior agent ive been with the bureau longest but i was never appointed the sac youre telling me youre not in charge of the other fbi agents is that what youre saying yes sir im sort of in charge because like i say im the senior agent but not really if you take my meaning if youre not really in charge monahan who is monahan seemed puzzled by the question for a moment then answered it you are mr ambassador mcgrory thought sonofabitch is he stupid or just acting that way he went on and special agent yung who does he work for when he was here he worked for you sir not the secretary of state up the chain of command maybe monahan said i never thought about that i mean he worked for you and you work for the secretary of state if you follow me in that sense you could say he worked for the secretary of state senora obregon put her head in the door mr howell is here mr ambassador mcgrory thought theres no sense going any further with this he said monahan i have to see mr howell right now please keep yourself available yes sir ask mr howell to come in please senora obregon mcgrory said interesting cultural attache robert howell said handing the message back to mcgrory i wonder what it means i was hoping you could tell me mcgrory said well all i can do is guess mr mastersons fatherinlaw is a retired ambassador we heard in buenos aires that the fatherinlaw has heart problems and perhaps secretary cohen i mean about yung being on the personal staff of the secretary mcgrory interrupted mr ambassador you never elected to tell me about that i simply presumed yung was one more fbi agent i didnt know he was on the secretarys personal staff robert mcgrory said you didnt even more interesting i wonder what he was doing down here that even you didnt know about does monahan know mcgrory didnt answer the question instead he said deputy foreign minister alvarez telephoned ted detweiller at eight this morning he wanted to know if detweiller would be in his office at nine and if so if detweiller would be kind enough to offer him a cup of coffee i wonder what thats all about howell said i intend to find out as soon as detweiller gets here im going to tell him he has the flu and is going home since he is unfortunately not able to give deputy foreign minister alvarez his cup of coffee i will and i want you to be here when i do so yes sir mr ambassador senora obregon announced from his door deputy foreign minister alvarez and another gentleman to see you mcgrory rose quickly from his desk and walked quickly to the door smiling his hand extended senor alvarez he said what an unexpected pleasure alvarez a small trim man returned the smile mr detweiller has developed a slight case of the flu mcgrory went on which is bad for him butperhaps i shouldnt say thisgood for me because it gives me the chance to offer you the cup of coffee in his stead its always a pleasure to see you mr ambassador alvarez said enthusiastically pumping mcgrorys hand i only hope i am not intruding on your busy schedule there is always time in my schedule for you senor alvarez mcgrory said may i present my friend senor ordonez of the interior ministry alvarez said a privilege to make your acquaintance senor mcgrory said offering ordonez his hand and may i introduce my cultural attache senor howell everybody shook hands i understand from senor detweiller that this is a purely social visit mcgrory asked absolutely alvarez said i knew ordonez and i were going to be in the area and since i hadnt seen my friend detweiller for some time i thought he might be kind enough to offer me a cup of coffee he was really sorry to miss you mcgrory said please pass on my best wishes for a speedy recovery alvarez said since this is as you say a purely social visit may i suggest that senor howell share our coffee with us delighted to have him alvarez said please take a seat mcgrory said waving at the chairs and the couch around his coffee table then he raised his voice senora obregon would you be good enough to bring us all some coffee and rolls howell thought whatever this isit almost certainly has to do with the blood bath at tacuaremboit is not a purely social visit and both alvarez and mcgrory know it alvarez knows that detweiller got sick because mcgrory wanted to talk to him himself which is probably fine with alvarez he really wanted to talk to him anyway but the deputy foreign minister couldnt call the american ambassador and ask for a cup of coffee thats known as protocol ordonez is not just in the interior ministry hes chief inspector of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional and mcgrory knows that and ordonez knowsand since he knows so does alvarezthat im not really the cultural attache i know just about everything that happened at tacuarembo but senor pompous doesnt even know that americansmuch less his cia station chiefwere involved because castillo decided he didnt have the need to know and ordered mewith his authority under the presidential findingnot to tell him anything at all everybody is lying toandor concealing something fromeverybody else and everybody either knows or suspects it thats known as diplomacy i wonder how long it will take before alvarez decides to talk about what he wants to talk about it took less timejust over five minutesthan howell expected it to before alvarez obliquely began to talk about what he had come to talk about while im here mr ambassador alvarez said let me express my personal appreciationan official expression will of course follow in good timefor your cooperation in the tacuarembo matter well no thanks are necessary mcgrory replied as we have learned that the poor fellow was really an american citizen we were just doing our duty alvarez smiled as if highly amused mcgrory looked at him curiously forgive me alvarez said my wife is always accusing me of smiling at the wrong time in this case i was smiling at yourinnocent im surechoice of words what words mcgrory said the poor fellow alvarez said im not sure i follow you senor alvarez mcgrory said what is that delightful american phrase out of school that is indeed one of our phrases senor alvarez it means essentially that something said was never said yes all right out of school then actually two things out of school one leading to the other theres another american phrase mcgrory put in cross my heart and hope to die boysand maybe girls toosay that to each other as they vow not to reveal something they are told in confidence cross my heart and hope to die senor alvarez howell thought my god i cant believe you actually said that how charming alvarez said well senor ordonez who is really with the policia nacionalhes actually the chief inspector of the interior police divisionwas telling me on the way over that mr lorimeror should i say senor bertrandwas a very wealthy man until just a few days ago he died virtually penniless oh really mcgrory said thats why you smiled when i called him a poor fellow alvarez nodded and i apologize again for doing so he said and went on senor ordonez found out late yesterday afternoon that senor bertrands bank accounts were emptied the day after his body was found how could that happen mcgrory asked how does a dead man empty his bank account by signing the necessary withdrawal documents over to someone several days before his death and then having that someone negotiate the documents its very much as if you paid your visa bill with a check and then god forbid were run over by a truck the check would still be paid out of school was there much money involved mcgrory asked almost sixteen million us dollars ordonez said in three different banks this was the first howell had heard anything about money when alex darby the buenos aires cia station chief who had driven howells black peugeot to tacuarembo so that it could be used to drive castillo and munz to the estancia returned the car to howell in montevideo he had reported the operation had gone bad really bad but not as bad as it could have been darbys report of what had happened at hacienda shangrila had been concise but completenot surprisingly he had been a cia agent a good one for a longtime but no mention at all of any money hadnt darby known hadnt he been told or had he been told and decided i didnt have the need to know jesus christ sixteen million dollars did castillo get it or the parties unknownparties hell with that kind of money involved it was probably a governmentwho had sent the ninjas after lorimer my god mcgrory said out of school who was the someone to whom mr lorimer wrote the checks we dont know alvarez said they were presented to the riggs national bank in washington all three of the banks here use riggs as what they call a correspondent bank let me see if i have this right mcgrory said somebody walked into the riggs national bank in washington handed over whatever these documents were and they handed him sixteen million dollars ordonez said what the riggs bank did was sendthey have a satellite linkphotocopies of the promissory notes to the banks here to verify senor bertrands signature when the banks had done that they notified the riggs bank that the signature was valid and the transaction had been processed so then they handed the man in washington sixteen million dollars no what the man in washington wanted was for the money to be wired to his account in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the cayman islands that was done it takes just a minute or two and what was this fellows name we dont know for that matter it could just as easily have been a woman the money went into a numbered account but it was lorimers signature on the promissory notes youre sure of that there was no question at any of the banksand with that kind of money involved you can imagine they were very carefulthat senor bertrand had indeed signed the promissory notes im baffled mcgrory said so are we alvarez said can we find out from the bank in the cayman islandswhat did you say it was the liechtensteinische landesbank ordonez furnished can we find out from them who owns the numbered account mcgrory pursued i dont think that will be easy ordonez said they have stricter banking secrecy laws in the cayman islands than in switzerland well perhaps i can do something mcgrory said looking at howell ill ask washington we would of course appreciate anything you can do mr ambassador officially or otherwise alvarez said i suppose if you had any idea who murdered mr lorimer you would tell me of course alvarez said who murdered mr lorimer or who was responsible for the deaths of the other men we found at estancia shangrila were working very hard on it ordonez said i think in time well be able to put it all together but it will take time and we would appreciate anything you could do to help us but so far nothing right mcgrory asked there are some things were looking into that will probably be valuable ordonez said for one thing we are now pretty sure that a helicopter was involved a helicopter howell asked a helicopter ordonez said not far from the farm we found barrels of jet fuel and beside it the marks ofwhats the term for those pipes a helicopter sits on i dont know mcgrory confessed after a moment skids howell furnished earning him a dirty look from mcgrory right ordonez said there were marks in the mud which almost certainly came from a helicopters skids strongly suggesting that the helicopter came some distance to the estancia and that the fuel was placed there before the helicopter arrived where would a helicopter come from howell asked brazil brazil or argentina ordonez said for that matter from montevideo but im leaning toward argentina why mcgrory asked because thats where the fuel drums came from ordonez said of course that doesnt mean the helicopter came from argentina just that the fuel did the helicopter could just as easily have come from brazil as you suggest you havent been able to identify any of the bodies mcgrory asked the only thing we have learned about the bodies is that a good deal of effort went into making them hard to identify none of them had any identification whatever on them or on their clothing they rented a mercedes traffik van at the airport in carrasco dont you need a credit card and a drivers license to rent a car howell asked and a passport that earned him another dirty look from mcgrory and when this is over i will get a lecture reminding me that underlings are not expected to speak unless told to by the ambassador sorry mr ambassador sir but i didnt think you were going to show any interest in that and it damned well might be useful in finding out who the ninjas were and where they came from both ordonez said the van was rented to a senor alejandro j gastor of madrid who presented his spanish passport his spanish drivers license and a prepaid mastercard debit card issued by the banco galicia of madrid the spanish ambassador has learned that no passport or drivers license has ever been issued to anyone named alejandro j gastor and that the address on the drivers license is that of a mcdonalds fastfood restaurant interesting howell said he thought ordonez is pretty good i wonder if anyone spotted my car up there or the yukon from the embassy in buenos aires that took the jet fuel there we put argentinean license plates on it is that another reason ordonez is leaning toward argentina as the place the chopper came from and so is this ordonez said and handed howell a small zippertop plastic bag there was a fired cartridge case in it this is one of the cases found at the estancia ordonez went on there were in all one hundred and two cases fortysix of them mm seventyfive and this one looks like a winchester howell said examining the round through the plastic then handed the bag to mcgrory who examined it carefully howell watched with masked amusement senor pompous doesnt have a clue about what hes looking at ordonez did not respond directly to the comment instead he said the mm cases were of israeli manufacture and the were all from the us army which means of course that there is virtually no chance of learning anything useful from either the mm or the cases or from the weapons we found on the scene which were all madsen submachine guns of danish manufacture we found five submachine guns and there were six men in the dark coveralls there were also indications that somethingmost likely a sixth madsen but possibly some other type of weapon taken because it was unusualwas removed from under one of the bodies found on the veranda i think its reasonable to assume this casing came from the rifle which killed the two men we found on the veranda they were both shot in the head we found one bullet lodged in the wall im afraid im missing something mcgrory interrupted is there something special about this bullet there you go again mcgrory the bullet is the pointy thing that comes out the hole in the barrel after the bang what youre looking at is the cartridge case mr ambassador what youre holding is the cartridge case not the bullet ordonez said and yes there is something special about it now i know i like you chief inspector ordonez youre dangerous but i like you and what is that mcgrory asked his tone indicating he did not like to be corrected if youll look at the headstamp mr ambassador ordonez said certainly mcgrory said and looked at ordonez clearly expecting him to hand him a headstamp whatever that was its on the bottom of the cartridge casing in the bag mr ambassador ordonez said thats the closed end senor pompous the one without a hole mcgrorys lips tightened and his face paled with a little bit of luck hes going to show everybody his fabled irish temper does hoping that he does make me really unpatriotic what about it mcgrory asked holding the plastic bag with his fingers so he could get a good look at the bottom of the cartridge casing the headstamp reads lc nm mr ambassador ordonez said can you see that sir oh shit i didnt see that i didnt look close at the case because i knew what it was and where it had come from the snipers rifle thats an explanation not an excuse darby said the kid fired only two shots so why didnt they pick up both cases is that one lousy cartridge case going to blow the whole thing up in our faces mcgrory nodded if im wrong ordonez said perhaps you can correct me but i think the meaning of that stamping is that the cartridge was manufactured at the us army lake city ammunition planti believe that its in utahin the nm stands for national match which means the ammunition is made with a good deal more care and precision than usual because its intended for marksmanship competition at the national matches mcgrory looked at him but didnt say anything that sort of ammunition isnt common mr ambassador ordonez went on it isnt i understand even distributed throughout the us army the only people who are issued it are competitive marksmen and snipers and as i understand it only special forces snipers you seem to know a good deal about this subject chief inspector mcgrory said only since yesterday ordonez said smiling i called our embassy in washington and t hey called your pentagon whoever they talked to at the pentagon was very obliging they said as i said a moment ago that the ammunition is not issued to anyone but competitive marksmen and special forces snipers and has never been sold as military surplus or given to anyone or any foreign government you are not suggesting are you chief inspector mcgrory asked coldly that there was a us army special forces sniper in any way involved in what happened at that estancia im simply suggesting sir that its very unusual the storm surge of righteous indignation overwhelmed the dikes of diplomacy because if you are mcgrory interrupted him his face now flushed and his eyes blazing please let me first say that i find any such suggestionany hint of such a suggestionpersonally and officially insulting im sure mr ambassador that chief inspector ordo deputy foreign minister alvarez began please let me finish senor alvarez mcgrory said cutting him off the way the diplomatic service of the united states functions is the ambassador is the senior government official in the country to which he is accredited nothing is done by any us government officerand that includes military officerswithout the knowledge and permission of the ambassador im surprised that you didnt know that senor alvarez further your going directly to the pentagon via your ambassador in washington carries with it the implication that i have or had knowledge of this incident which i was not willing to share with you thats tantamount to accusing me and thus the government of the united states of not only conducting an illegal operation but lying about it i am personally and officially insulted and intend to bring this to the immediate attention of the secretary of state mr ambassador i alvarez began good morning gentlemen mcgrory said cutting him off again this visit is terminated alvarez stood up looking as if he was going to say something else but changing his mind good morning mr ambassador he said finally and walked out of the office with ordonez on his heels howell thought well that wasnt too smart mcgrory but on the other hand i think both alvarez and ordonez walked out of here believing that you know nothing about what happened at tacuarembo the best actor in the world couldnt turn on a fit like you just threw that doesnt mean however that ordonez thinks im as pure as the driven snow i regret that of course howell mcgrory said but there are times when making your position perfectly clear without the subtleties and innuendos of diplomacy is necessary and this was one of those times yes sir howell said if this has to be said i dont want what just happened to leave this room i understand sir what is your relationship with mr darby mcgrory asked sir are you close friends if you asked him would he tell you if he knew anything about anything that went on at that estancia were acquaintances sir not friends but you both work for the cia dont you exchange information as a courtesy sir i usually send him a copy of my reports to the agencyafter you have vetted them sir and he does the same for me nevertheless i think you should ask him about this im going to catch the next plane to buenos aires to confer with ambassador silvio i want you to go with me yes sir of course i dont want to go to washington with this until i hear what ambassador silvio has to say yes sir why do i think that youre having second thoughts about throwing alvarez out of your office four office of the director the central intelligence agency langley virginia august john powell the dci a trim fiftyfiveyearold who had given up trying to conceal his receding hairline and now wore what was left of his hair closely cropped to his skull rose from behind his desk and walked across his office with his hand extended to greet his visitor its good to see you truman he said as they shook hands we havent been seeing much of each other lately the ambassador keeps me pretty busy truman ellsworth replied he was also in his midfifties but with thirty pounds and six inches on powell he also had a full head of carefully coiffured silver hair thank you for seeing me on such short notice powell gestured to indicate thanks were not necessary and your coming gave me a much nicer alternative to eating alone or with five people with an agenda not food in mind i ordered grilled trout avec beurre noir how does that sound it sounds wonderful ellsworth said and obeyed the dcis gesture to precede him into the dcis private dining room the table with room for eight had been set for two across from one another at the head of table a waiter in a stiffly starched jacket asked what they would like to drink unsweetened iced tea please ellsworth said the same the dci ordered so what can i do for you truman or the ambassador the dci asked when the trout had been served and the waiter had left the room the president has taken a personal interest in the argentine affair truman said theres a rumor that there has even been a presidential finding the dci said one wonders how such rumors get started ellsworth said and consequently the ambassador has taken a very personal interest in that unfortunate business you dont want to tell me about the finding the dci asked if there is a finding john i really dont think you would want to know the details the dci pursed his lips thoughtfully but didnt respond and as the ball bounces down from the pinnacle i now have a personal interest in the masterson affair ellsworth said well thats certainly understandable the dci said i dont suppose there have been any developments in the last couple of hours no and since i have made it known that i also have a personal interest in this matter im sure i would have heard the dci said yes im sure you would have ellsworth said thats one of the reasons im here should there be any developmentsand im sure there will bethe ambassador would like to hear of them immediately after you do i mean immediately not through the normal channels consider it done truman if the ambassador is not available have the information passed to me the dci nodded does the name castillo ring a bell john major c g castillo ellsworth nodded oh yes indeed the dci said the chap who stumbled upon the missing odd that you should mention his name that rumor i heard about a finding said that he was somehow involved in the masterson business well if there were a finding i wouldnt be surprised the ambassador was at the white house last night where castillo was promoted to lieutenant colonel by the president himself not to be repeated entre nous the ambassador told me that if the president were the pope he would have beatified colonel castillo at the ceremony how interesting the dci said i wonder why that brings to mind lieutenant colonel oliver north possibly because they are both goodlooking dashing young officers who somehow came to bask in the approval of their commander in chief ellsworth said thats probably it the ambassador is personally interested in colonel castillo ellsworth said i have the feeling he likes him and would like to help him in any way he can is that so now to help himwhich would also mean keeping him from getting into the same kind of awkward situation in which north found himselfthe more the ambassador knows about where the colonel is and what hes up to the better even rumors would be helpful i understand the problem john is that both colonel castillo and the president might misinterpret the ambassadors interest it would be best if neither knew of the ambassadorsoh what should i saypaternal interest in colonel castillo and his activities well i certainly understand it and i hear things from time to time if i hear anything ill certainly pass it on to you and ill spread the word discreetly of course of my interest not in writing john either up or down of course not have you any idea where colonel castillo might be the last i heard he was on his way to paris and hes liable to go anywhere from there germany hungary the southern cone of south america he does get around doesnt he yes he does well as i said ill keep my ear to the rumor mill and keep you posted thank you i know the ambassador will be grateful happy to be of whatever assistance i can is that about it theres one more thing john for some reason the ambassador thinks your senior analyst in the south american divisions southern cone section may not be quite the right person for the job oh really well im sorry to hear that and you can tell the ambassador ill have a personal look at the situation immediately her name is wilson mr patricia davies wilson ellsworth said you know now that i hear that name i seem to recall that it came up not so long ago in connection with castillos really i seem to recall something like that i think the ambassador would be pleased to have your assurance that youre going to put someone quite topnotch in that job and do so in such a manner that when she is replaced mr wilson will have no reason to suspect the ambassadoror even the dciwas in any way involved with her reassignment of course and i think he would be even more pleased if i could tell him you said that that would be taken care of very soon how soon is very soon truman yesterday would be even better than today the dci nodded but didnt say anything five restaurante villa hipica the jockey club of san isidro buenos aires province argentina august ambassador michael a mcgrory was not at all pleased with where ambassador juan manuel silvio had taken him for lunch mcgrory had suggested they go somewhere they could have a quiet outofschool conversation if silvio had made a similar suggestion to him in montevideo he would have taken silvio either to his residence or to a restaurant where they could have a private room instead he had brought them all the way out herea thirtyminute driveto a wideopen restaurant crowded with horse fanciers well perhaps not wide open to every tom dick and jose mcgrory thought surveying the clientele i suspect membership in the jockey club is tied in somehow with the restaurant their table by a window provided a view of the grandstands and there was a steady parade of grooms leading horsessometimes four or five at a timeright outside the window certainly a fine place to have lunch if youre a touristif they let tourists inbut not the sort of place to have a serious conversation about the business of the united states government a tall welldressed man with a full mustache approached the table with a smile and a bottle of wine your excellency i was just now informed you are honoring us with your presence he said in spanish ive told you jorge silvio replied that if i want you to call me that i will wear my ermine robes and carry my scepter he shook the mans hand and then said jorge may i present ambassador michael mcgrory who came here from uruguay to get a good meal mike this is senor jorge basto our host my little restaurant is then doubly honored basto said it is an honor to meet you your excellency im happy to be here and to make your acquaintance mcgrory replied with a smile and look what just came in this morning basto said holding out the bottle youre in luck mike silvio said this is tempus cabernet sauvignon hard to come by from a small bodega in mendoza basto said may i open it mr ambassador oh please silvio said goddamn it mcgrory thought wine not that i should be drinking at all i amwe both areon duty but these latinsand that certainly includes silviodont consider drinking wine at lunch drinking even though they know full well that there is as much alcohol in a glass of wine as there is in a bottle of beer or a shot of whiskey i would really like a john jamison with a little water but if i ordered one i would be insulting the restaurant guy and silvio would think i was some kind of alcoholic drinking whiskey at lunch a waiter appeared with glasses and a bottle opener the cork was pulled and the waiter poured a little in one of the glasses and set it before silvio who picked it up and set it before mcgrory tell me what you think mike he said with a smile mcgrory knew the routine and went through it he swirled the wine around the glass stuck his nose in the wide brim and sniffed then took a sip which he swirled around his mouth very nice indeed he decreed mcgrory had no idea what he was supposed to be sniffing for when he sniffed or what he was supposed to be tasting when he tasted so far as he was concerned there were two kinds of wine red and white further divided into sweet and sour and once he had determined this was a sour red wine he had exhausted his expertise the waiter then filled silvios glass half full and then poured more into mcgrorys glass silvio picked up his glass and held it out expectantly until mcgrory realized what he was up to and raised his own glass and touched it to silvios always a pleasure to see you mike silvio said thank you mcgrory replied likewise silvio took a large swallow of his wine and smiled happily the wines here are marvelous silvio said yes they are mcgrory agreed dont quote me mike but i like them a lot better than i like ours and not only because ours are outrageously overpriced im not much of a wine drinker mcgrory confessed use a little wine for thy stomachs sake silvio quoted and thine other infirmities thats from the bible saint timothy i think quoting christ how interesting mcgrory said the waiter handed them menus mcgrory ordered a lomo con papas frit asyou rarely got in trouble ordering a filet mignon and french friesand silvio ordered something mcgrory had never heard of when the food was served mcgrory saw that silvio got a filet mignon too but his came with a wineandmushroom sauce that probably tastes as good as it smells and those little potato balls look tastierand probably arethan my french fries will be you said you wanted to have a little chat out of school mike silvio said after he had masticated a nice chunk of his steak whats on your mind two things actually mcgrory said speaking so softly that silvio leaned across the table so that he would be able to hear mcgrory took the message about fbi special agent yung and handed it to silvio who read it isnt this the chap you sent here when mr masterson was kidnapped silvio asked one and the same you never said anything to me mike about him being on secretary cohens personal staff i didnt know about that mcgrory confessed silvio pursed his lips thoughtfully but didnt say anything something else happened visavis special agent yung mcgrory went on the same daythe night of the same daythat the bodies were found at what turned out to be lorimers estancia i received a telephone call from the assistant director of the fbi telling me that it had been necessary to recall yung to washington and that he had in fact already left uruguay he say why we were on a nonsecure line and he said he didnt want to get into details he gave me the impression yung was required as a witness in a trial of some kind he said he would call me back on a secure line but never did silvio cut another slice of his steak rubbed it around in the sauce and then forked it into his mouth when he had finished chewing and swallowing he asked did you try to call him i was going to do that this morning when that message came and then i found out the deputy foreign minister alvarez had called my chief of mission and asked if he could come by the embassy for a cup of coffee sounds like he wanted to have an unofficial chat silvio said thats what i thought so when he showed up i told him that my man had the flu and i would give him his coffee what did he want he had chief inspector ordonez of the interior police with him mcgrory said the man in charge of the investigation of what happened at that estancia after they beat around the bush for a while he as much as accused me of not only knowing that there were green berets involved in the shooting but of not telling them were there silvio asked if there were i have no knowledge of it and as the ambassador you would right thats the way its supposed to be silvio were the senior american officers in the country to which we are assigned and no government action is supposed to take place that we dont know about and have approved of thats my understanding silvio agreed so where did he get the idea that green berets were involved he had two things mcgrory said one was ai dont know what you call itwhats left what comes out of a gun after you shoot it a bullet silvio asked no the other part brass about this big he held his fingers apart to indicate the size of a cartridge case i think they call that the cartridge case silvio said thats it what was special about the cartridge case it was a special kind issued only to us army snipers and the reason he knew that was because he called the uruguayan ambassador in washington who called the pentagon who obligingly told them they didnt go through me and when a foreign government wants something from the us government theyre supposed to go through the ambassador on the basis of this one cartridge case they have concluded that our green berets were involved that doesnt make much sense does it they also found out that a helicopter was involved people heard one flying around and there were tracks from the skidsthose pipes on the bottomin a nearby field where it had apparently been refueled you dont have a helicopter do you i have an airplanethe army attache does an army king airout at campo mayo but no helicopter the king air is so expensive to fly that most of the time it just sits out there how come silvios army attache gets an airplane mcgrory thought and mine doesnt he said well according to them whoever left all the bodies had a helicopter and they think it was a green beret helicopter maybe theyre just shooting in the dark silvio said they must be getting pretty impatient seven people killed and they apparently dont know why or by whom do you have any idea what that massacre was all about silvio shook his head took a sip of wine then said what id like to know is what this lorimer fellow was doing with a false identity in uruguay do you have any idea mcgrory shook his head no ioh i forgot to mention that lorimer had a fortunesixteen million dollarsin uruguayan banks it was withdrawnactually transferred to some bank in the cayman islandsthe day after he was killed by someone using the riggs national bank in washington really where did lorimer get that kind of money most of the time when large sums of money like that are involved its drug money mcgrory confided do they know who withdrew it transferred it no they dont well if youre right mike and i suspect you are that would explain a good deal wouldnt it murder is a way of life with the drug cartels what very easily could have happened at that estancia is that a drug deal went wrong the more i think about it a fortune in drug money a false identity mcgrory thought aloud bertrand the phony name he was using was an antiques dealer god knows being an established antiques dealer would be an easy way to move a lot of cocaine who would look in some really valuable old vase or something for drugs i suppose thats true silvio agreed im thinking its entirely possible lorimer had a room full of old vases stuffed with cocaine mcgrory went on warming to his new theory he had already been paid for it that would explain all the money when his customers came to get it some other drug peoplekeeping a secret like that is hardwent out there to steal it and got themselves killed or maybe they did steal it themselves may be there were more than six guys in black overalls the ones that werent killed loaded the drugs on their helicopter and left leaving their dead behind they dont care much about human life you know theyre savages animals so ive heard ambassador mcgrory sat thoughtfully for a long moment before going on if you were me juan would you take the insult to the department silvio paused thoughtfully for a moment before answering thats a tough call mike he said if i may speak freely absolutely mcgrory said alvarezs behavior was inexcusable silvio said both in not going through you to get to the pentagon and then by coming to your office to as much as accuse you of lying yes it was incidents like that in the past have been considered more than cause enough to recall an ambassador for consultation leaving an embassy without an ambassador for an extended period yes i know insult the ambassador of the united states of america at your peril mcgrory heard himself raising his voice and immediately put his wineglass to his lips and discreetly scanned the restaurant to see if anyone had overhead his indiscretion the question is silvio said reasonably you have to make the decision whether what happened is worth in the long haul having you recalled for consultation or if there is some other way you can let them know youre justifiably angry they left my office juan let me tell you knowing that i was pretty damned angry oh yes they did i told alvarez in no uncertain terms that what they had done was tantamount to accusing me and thus the government of the united states of not only conducting an illegal operation but of lying about it and that i was personally and officially insulted and then i said good morning gentlemen this visit is terminated well that certainly let them know how you felt silvio said and theyre really going to be embarrassed when they finally realize that what happened out there was drug connected and their idea that green berets were involved was simply preposterous if thats what happened mike youre right and if i take this to washington mcgrory said by the time they actually get around to recalling me for consultation alvarez more than likely will come to me with his tail between his legs to apologize ill accept it of course but ill be one up on him thats for damned sure theres no sense bothering the secretary with this i agree silvio said and picked up the bottle of tempus and poured wine into both their glasses when they tapped glasses again mcgrory said i really appreciate your advice juan thank you six office of the ambassador the embassy of the united states of america avenida colombia palermo buenos aires argentina august thats essentially what howell told me sir alex darby said to ambassador silvio that ordonez found the cartridge casing put it together with the choppers skid marks and all those bodies and decided it was something more than a robbery ambassador mcgrory is now just about convinced it was a drug shootout silvio said i sowed the seed of that scenario and he really took it to heart between you and me alex i felt more than a little guiltyashamed of myself sir you didnt have much of an option darby said castillo was operating with the authority of a presidential finding he had the authority to do what we did and not tell mcgrory about it granting that silvio said i still felt very uncomfortable you shouldnt feel that way sir with all due respect to ambassador mcgrory can you imagine how out of control things would get if he knew or worse if castillo had gone by the book and asked his permission silvio didnt respond to that instead he asked where in the world did castillo get that helicopter i asked him but he evaded the question so did i and he wouldnt tell me either i didnt know about the money either you dont think that it will be traceable the money or the helicopter silvio chuckled and shook his head both neither the helicopter no castillo filed a local flight plan from jorge newbery to pilar closed it out over pilar and then flew over there about five feet off the water he came back the same way then got on the horn over pilar and filed a local flight plan to jorge newbery nothing suspicious about that if somebody had the helicopters numbers silvio said it wouldnt be hard to learn whose machine it is would it i thought about that sir and decided it was information i would just as soon not have silvio nodded youre right of course what about the money before this happened yung was working on finding americansand other peoplewho had decided to secretly invest money down here i dont know who he was doing that for but he wasnt just looking for dirty money being laundered he is therefore an expert on how to move large amounts of money around without anyone knowing i suspect the reason castillo sent him back down here was to make really sure there are not racks i think ambassador mcgrory is going to give him a hard time when he gets to uruguay for concealing his special status from him and i find myself thinking mcgrory has the right to be annoyed he shouldnt be annoyed at yung darby said yung was just following orders that just following orders philosophy covers a lot of sins doesnt it mr ambassador im pretty sure before you tell somebody something you consider who youre telling it to how trustworthy they are and thats how it should be ive never understood why people dont seem to understand that works both ways im not sure i follow you alex how much the guy in chargea corporal in a rifle squad a station chief in the agency an ambassadorgets told official rules be damned depends on how much the underling thinks the guy in charge can be trusted silvio considered that a moment and then said i have to ask alex how much do you tell me when i got here mr ambassador based on my previous experience with people in your line of work i was careful when i told you what time it was after a while when i got to know you i started telling you everything thank you silvio said simply mr ambassador id like to get on a secure line and let castillo know whats happened in montevideo and here he should know of course and right away but i can do it alex you dont have to why dont you let me do it sir darby replied i dont feel guilty about going behind mcgrorys back ouch ambassador silvio said he paused thoughtfully obviously what has happened alex is that my close association with you has corrupted me i just realized that i was happy that you offered to make the call thank you he pushed the secure phone toward darby vi one executive offices gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh fulda hesse germany august otto gorner managing director of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh reached for his private line telephone with his right hand without taking his eyes off the editorial on his desk it was antiamerican blasting the president of the united states of america personally and the policies of the usa generally he had known from the first couple of sentences that he would not permit it to run in any of the tages zeitung newspapers the author would then thinkand more than likely share with his peersunkind thoughts about the amizaertlich editor in chief of the tages zeitung newspapers for killing a wellthoughtout piece about what the gottverdammt amis had done wrong again by the fourth paragraph gorner had realizedwith some reliefthat he would have killed the piece anyway based on its departure from what he regarded as the entirely germanic editorial principles of the newspaper chainin essence to be fairand not solely because running it would have offended the ami who was the sole stockholder of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh gorner he growled into the telephone have you got any influence with the storm trooper guarding the parking lot a very familiar voice inquired in english he wont let me in speak of the devil gorner said is that a yes or a no put him on karlchen gorner said as he rose quickly from his desk and went to his window which overlooked the parking lot carlos guillermo castillo born karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger was standing by the redandwhitestriped barrier pole to the parking lot and extending a cellular telephone to the guard there of as the guard some what suspiciously put the cellular to his ear castillo looked up at the window saw gorner and blew him a kiss the guard followed that gesture too with interest in the future gorner said to the telephone you may admit herr von und zu gossinger to our parking lot at any time even if his car doesnt have an identification sticker jawohl herr gorner the guard said he handed the cellular back and hurried to the switch that would cause the barrier pole to rise castillo bowed toward the window and then got in his car a mercedesbenz which gorner decided he had rented at an airport gorner had mixed feelings on seeing castillo on one hand he wasand had been since castillos birthextremely fond of the boy born to the sister of his best friend he had long ago realized that there was little difference between the paternal feelings he had for karlchenlittle karland those he felt for his own children if erika von und zu gossinger would have had him either when it first became known that the seventeenyearold girl was pregnant with the child of an american helicopter pilot she had known for only four days or later until the hour of her death twelve years later he would have married her and happily given the child his name but erika would not have him as her husband although she had been perfectly willing for him to play oncle otto to the boy as he grew up and over the last three or four days gorner had been genuinely concerned about castillos safetyindeed his life karlchen had called from the states and suggested gorner might take a look at the reuters and ap wires from uruguay starting about now gorner had done so and the only interesting storyabout the only story at allfrom uruguay had been a reuters report that the lebanese owner of a farm a man named jeanpaul bertrand and six other men unidentified had been found shot to death on bertrands farm there had been no question at all in gorners mind that bertrand was jeanpaul lorimer for whom he knew karlchen had been looking confirmation of that had come yesterday with an agence francepresse wire story that dr jeanpaul lorimer chief european directorate of un interagency coordination in paris had been murdered during a robbery while vacationing in uruguay he had not been surprised to learn that lorimer was dead he had been in budapest with karlchen when billy kocian had told both of them that he thought lorimer was probably fish food in either the danube or the seine and he didnt believe the robbery spin at all lorimer had been killed because he knew too much about the oilforfood scandal but uruguay what was that all about he wondered how karlchen had learned what had happened to lorimer so quickly his thoughts were interrupted when frau gertrud schroder put her head in the door and cheerfully announced karlchens here they just called from the lobby warn my wife lock up anything valuable and pray gorner said youre as glad to see him as i am she said yes of course gorner agreed with a smile thats only half true i am glad to see him but i dont think im going to like what he tells me or giving him what he asks for castillo came to the door fortyfive seconds later he hugged frau schroder and kissed her wetly on the forehead she beamed do i call you colonel gorner said not only do you call me colonel but you pop to attention click your heels and bow castillo said as he went to gorner and hugged him he would have kissed him on the forehead too had gorner not ducked then he added how did you hear about that youre an oberst karlchen frau schroder asked oberstleutnant frau schroder castillo said gorner went behind his desk and sat down the old man was oberstleutnant hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger at stalingrad the first time i met him i was terrified of him and now his grandson is one in the american army of course but an oberstleutnant the old man would have been ecstatic im so proud of you karlchen frau schroder said thank you castillo said he looked at gorner and asked again how did you hear about that the american embassy called a man who said he was the assistant consul general said he had reason to believe lieutenant colonel castillo would be coming here and if you did would i be good enough to ask you to call we have a name and a number gorner nodded lifted the leather cover of a lined tablet on his desk and then flipped through several pages by the time frau schroder had walked to the desk he had found what he was looking for and had his finger on it she punched in numbers on one of the three telephones on gorners desk a moment later she said in almost accentless english i have colonel castillo for you mr almsbury will you hold please she handed the handset to castillo he spoke into it my name is castillo mr almsbury im returning your call my fathers name was jorge alejandro castillo whos it from the sender is classified well how do i get to see this message and if i cant come to berlin then what well then i guess i just wont get to see it yes ill take your assurance that the sender is a very important person but i still cant come to berlin and i wont be here long enough for you to come deliver the message id rather not share that with you mr almsbury what i suggest you do is send a message to the sender that you couldnt get the message to me and that if the message is important that they try to send it to me through my office yes im sure they know how to get in contact with my office yeah im sure that this is the way i wish to handle this thank you very much mr almsbury goodbye he hung up that sonofabitch he said shaking his head i dont suppose youre going to tell us what that was all about karl gorner asked castillo looked between them and then said a couple of years agomaybe longersomebody saidmaybe wrote a booksaying the medium is the message i dont understand gorner confessed for the first time i understand what that means castillo said youre talking in tongues karl mr almsbury who is more than likely the cia station chief in berlin has a message for me for a number of reasons i think that message is from ambassador charles montvale you know who he is gorner nodded frau schroder said your new chief of intelligence close castillo replied hes the new director of national intelligence you work for him can i ask that gorner said you can ask no i dont work for him he wishes that i did the president told him no i told him no but montvale doesnt like no for an answer karl gorner interrupted and then stopped castillo smiled at him i read minds you know what you were about to ask is why are you telling us this andor arent you liable to get in trouble talking so freely to us am i close gorner shook his head in disbelief and then nodded in resignation im telling you because i think you should know certain things and because both of you are on my short listhe held up his left hand with the fingers spread widely and his right hand with three fingers held upwardof people i trust absolutely and no i wont get in trouble the president gave me the authority to tell anyone anything i want to tell them gorner met his eyes for a moment and thought he means that hes telling the truth but i now understand there is a third reason karlchen has just put both onkle otto and tante gertrud in his pocket and i think he knows that my god hes so much like the old man and the final reason im going to tell you about what im doing is because im going to need your help and i want you to understand why i need that help why youre doing what im going to ask you to do gorner started to speak then stoppedgoddamn it i have to say thisthen said what was on his mind karl what we do here is publish newspapers newspapers started by your greatgreatgrandfather i cant stand idly by while you turn it into a branch of the cia the simple answer to that otto castillo said is youre right its a newspaper but lets not forget either that i own gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh he let that sink in a moment then went on a more complicated answer is that ive thought about grosspappa and the tages zeitung newspapers im not turning them into a cia asset for one thing i dont work for the cia and from all i remember about him all ive heard about him he was a very moral man i think he would be as annoyedas disgustedwith the greedy bastards behind this oilforfood scandal as eric kocian is and i think if he was still alive and ignatz glutz came to him with cia tattooed on his forehead and said he was trying to do something about those greedy murderous bastards grosspappa would have helped within certain boundaries of course anyway thats the way im going to play it carlos castillo is going to ask certain things of the tages zeitung and if karl von und zu gossinger thinks his grandfather would have given castillo what hes asking for the tages zeitung is going to give it to him it says in the bible karlchen that a man cannot serve two masters gorner said it also says in the bible that jonah was swallowed whole by a whale and lived through it castillo said arent you the man who told me to be careful about what you read not to believe something just because its in print within certain boundaries covers a lot of ground karl gorner said softly who defines those boundaries i do but it should also go without saying that if i step over the line you are free to tell me how i am over that line gorner stared at him intently for a long moment the older i get the more i believe in genetics he said finally so im going to go with my gut feeling that theres a hell of a lot more of oberst hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger running through your veins than there is texas cowboy colonel carlos castillo castillo didnt reply tell me about ambassador montvale and his message gorner said i have no idea whats in montvales message but if it was really important he would have gotten it to me i dont understand frau schroder said if i go to berlin to get the message im a cute little dachshund answering its masters whistle which is what he wants oh she said and then a moment later said but what if there is something important in the message if something important happened dick miller would know what it was and he would have gotten through to me but just to be sure as soon as we get the money straightened out im going to give dick a call is that why youre here gorner asked about that money in the liechtensteinische landesbank mostly what else i want all your notes all your reporters notes on oil for food castillo said they will go no further than me i really dont work for the cia otto or anybody but the president gorner didnt reply am i crossing the line otto castillo asked softly not with that gorner said simply i think the old man would have given your mr ignatz glutz his reporters notes ill reserve judgment about the money until i hear whatever you think you can tell me about it ill tell you everything about it castillo said we found out that lorimer had it in three banks in uruguay it seems logical to assume that he stole itthe american phrase is skimmed itfrom his payoff money we also found out that it was not on deposit but rather in the form of ondemand notes issued by the bank something like bearer bonds we got the notes and took the money its going to be spent finding who killed mr masterson and sergeant markham and for other noble purposes including finding out who sent the men to murder lorimer you certainly found out about that quickly gorner said i was there otto i was just about to tell lorimer that he was about to be returned to the bosom of his family when somebody stuck a submachine gun through the window they killed lorimer and wounded a man with me other bad guys killed one of my sergeants by garroting him karlchen frau schroder exclaimed who were they gorner asked i dont know i intend to find out the only thing i know for sure was they were not uruguayan bandits spetsnaz possibly maybe mossad maybe even french from le premiere regiment de parachutistes dinfanterie de marine known as ripem theres even been a suggestion that they might be from die kommando spezialkrafte whoever they were they were damned good and i suppose you realize damned dangerous gorner asked that thought has run through my mind let me tell what id like to do about the money then frau schroder can explain why thats not possible gorner realized that although it was the last thing he wanted to do he was smiling castillo said i havethat is lopez fruit and vegetables mexico hasan account with the banco salamander mexicano in oaxaca say that again slowly frau schroder said as she picked up gorners leathercovered legal pad and a pencil and you better spell it too i dont speak spanish you dont castillo asked as if deeply shocked i thought everybody spoke spanish gorner realized that he was smiling again at the look on frau schroders face before she realized she was being teased castillo went into his laptop case and took out a sheet of paper and handed it to her everythings on there he said including account numbers fernando tells me we run a lot of money through there thats the bahias de huatulco ranch otto asked used to be cattle now its mostly grapefruit castillo confirmed anyway a wire transfer of ten million dollars wouldnt set off alarm bells particularly if we spend most of it right away to buy an airplane excuse me gorner asked castillo went back to his briefcase and took out a photocopy of what gorner recognized after a moment as an aircraft specification sheet a twentythreeyearold gulfstream iii castillo said just the sort of airplane that would be ownedor leasedby a successful mexican farming operation trying to peddle its wares in europe and latin america and a bargain fernando tells me at seven million five as it has new engines and all the maintenance is uptodate and its new gloveleather interior is sort of the cherry on the cake why do you need an airplane like that frau schroder asked we flew fernandos planethe bombardierlearjetover here then to south america and then from buenos aires to the states two things wrong with that its not designed for long flightsovertheocean flightslike that and as a corollary attracts attention when it does and then when ambassador montvale kindly put the cias private airlines at my disposal i knew i had to have an airplane the pilot of which is not going to make hourly reports of my location to the ambassador youre going to be doing a lot of that flying across oceans gorner asked ill be going wherever i have to go and i want to do it quickly safely and as invisibly as possible can you just go out and buy an airplane like that and whos going to fly it thats a moot question until frau schroder tells me whether i can move the ten million to the account in mexico he looked expectantly at frau schroder that can be done with a telephone call she said you can count on the money being available within the hour well lets do that and then well get on the horn to dick miller castillo said the sooner we get the money into salamander the sooner i canas an officer of lopez fruit and vegetables mexicowiretransfer out of it to my account at the riggs bank in washington i already know how to do that couple of questions frau schroder said now all business you want to put the liechtensteinische landesbank money in a special account or just deposit it just deposit it castillo said fernandos going to report it as ordinary business receipts is that what they call money laundering gorner asked drily this is in a good cause castillo replied gorner shook his head frau schroder picked up the telephone three minutes later she announced ten million dollars will be available in the lopez account within twenty minutes thank you and now see if you can get dick miller on there will you please and put it on the speakerphone please i think i should point out karl gorner said that its now about half past six in the morning in washington until they take the bandages off his leg dicks sleeping in the office castillo replied hell be there frau schroder punched in numbers on one of gorners telephones and then pushed the button that activated the speaker the phone rang twice and then major h richard miller jr answered it miller good news sweetheart we wont have to sell the dogs and move in with your mother the moneys in the bank that was quick they dont call me speedy gonzales for nothing castillo said any word from jake about the new toy he and fernando and the salesman brought it in here to bwi last night jake said it would have made waves taking it into reagan jake says the birds okay and where do you want to keep it let me think about that ask jake what he recommends transfer nine really big ones from salamander to my account in riggs and then pay for it that checks not going to bounce is it nope i have frau schroders personal guarantee say danke schon frau schroder danke shon frau schroder miller said how are you dick she replied aside from having more gauze bandage on my leg than a mummy im just fine say hello to otto for me when you see him how are you dick gorner said you werent listening in were you otto if so did the colonel make you stand at attention and click my heels gorner said god hes going to be hard to live with hes always been hard to live with jesus miller suddenly said before i forget charley remember that you were here all day yesterday why castillo said because yesterday colonel colonel torine gave you a check ride in the c which you passed and which will be recorded on your faa records this morning oh thats great castillo said anything else charley have you any idea why the ambassador would send me a message to berlin no but he was fascinated to hear that we have people looking into briefcases in suburban philadelphia he cant imagine why you didnt share that with him because as far as we know thats fantasy did you tell him that i did he didnt seem very impressed what did the message say i dont know im not going to berlin to read it you want to tell me where you are going paris was a waste of time lorimers apartment had been searched by the deuxieme bureau and the un before my friend there could get in i had a look nothing useful and im just about finished here all i have left to do is go see billy kocian in budapest i dont think that will take long he stopped when he saw gorner holding up his hand hold it a second dick castillo said and gestured for gorner to speak i dont think going to see billy kocian right now is going to be profitable gorner said why not castillo asked hes in the telki hospital with a broken ankle what happened he fell down the stairs in his apartment how do you know he broke his ankle he called and told me he called and told you castillo repeated softly and then raising his voice slightly for the speakerphone asked dick wheres torine in your place he and fernando get on another line and ask him if theres any reason he cant bring the giii to budapest right away i can think of one miller replied you dont own it yet call jake and ask him if the airplane is ready to cross the atlantic ill hold castillo felt gorners eyes on him you think something happened to billy gorner said what im thinking is that its unlikely that billy would call to tell you he fell down more than likely he called you to tell you that because he didnt want you to know what really happened to him in case you heard he was in the hospital gorners eyebrows went up but he didnt say anything millers voice came over the speaker i have colonel torine on the line for you colonel castillo millers more than a little sarcastic voice announced whats up charley torines voice came over the speaker if dick gave the guy who came with the gulfstream a cashiers check for the airplane as soon as the riggs bank opens how soon could you get it to budapest you mean handle the paperwork later right if he goes along with the cashiers check it would take me maybe an hour and a half to go wheelsup at baltimore i cant make it nonstop id have to refuel someplace maybe rhinemain thats now frankfurt international hadnt you heard no more rhinemain and didnt that make you feel old torine replied figure nine hours total flight time an hour to refuel figure twelve hours from the time dick gives the owners guy the check presuming hes willing to go along if hes not give him the check anyway and dont tell him where youre going on your final test flight one more problem ill have to bring fernando along to fly the right seat hes not going to like that do you really need someone in the right seat torine hesitated before replying you know ive never landed an airplane anywhere where someone counted the pilots you have a reason you dont want fernando to come i want fernando to go home to texas and keep the home fires burning okay charley not a problem fernandos voice came over the loudspeaker ill fly the goddamned airplane to budapest gringo and then go home youre sure im sure thanks castillo said both of you ill get us rooms at the gellert see you in the wee hours tomorrow torine said and hung up anything else before i have my breakfast charley miller asked you ever get the avionics for the ranger theyre on their way to buenos aires okay great ill be in touch dick do i tell the ambassador where youre going you might as well hell know anyway run that past me again im going to use his aerial taxi to get me there castillo said hell know i dont quite understand that but what the hell i probably dont have the need to know watch your back buddy castillo switched off the telephone and went back into his computer case retrieved a business card and held it in his hand as he punched in numbers on the telephone now what otto gorner asked im calling an aerial taxi to take me to budapest you sure you can get one and is the tages zeitung going to have to pay for it im sure i can get one the cia owns the taxi service and ambassador montvale told them i go to the head of the line and no the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund will pay for it get two seats otto said castillo looked at him curiously youre right erics story was a little too detailed gorner said he said he fell over his dog going down the stairs if he had fallen over that goddamned dog he wouldnt have told me in fact if hed fallen down period he wouldnt have told me now i really want to know whats going on this is colonel castillo charley said to the telephone im in fulda germany and iand one otherhave to get to budapest as soon as possible hows the best way to do that thirty seconds later he put down the phone our taxi will be at leipzighalle in ninety minutes he said two office of the ambassador the embassy of the united states of america lauro miller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august theres something going on around here robert ambassador mcgrory said to robert howell that has the smell of rotten eggs and you and i are going to get to the bottom of it im not sure that i know what you mean mr ambassador i really would have thought robert that someone in your line of business would be curious about mr yung his being suddenly called to the states and then coming back here to handle the lorimer matter i admit i wondered about that howell said it could of course have just happened but i dont think so what do you think it is mr ambassador that i dont know that is what you and i are going to find out mcgrory said what is it you would like me to do sir so long as hes here i want you to keep a very close eye on him i want to know where he goes who he talks to etcetera i suspect he has some connection with what happened at that estancia and i want to know what that connection is is there some reason you think he hassome connectionwith what happened at estancia shangrila intuition mcgrory said when you have been in this game as long as i have you develop an intuition im sure thats true mr ambassador so i want you to watch him very closely howell nodded i think i have just become the fox placed in charge of the chicken coop yung will be here in few minutes mcgrory said i want you to be here when i talk to him yes sir mr yung just came onto the compound mr ambassador senora susanna obregon reported from ambassador mcgrorys office door when he gets up here make him wait five minutes and then show him in mcgrory replied and then added and dont give him any coffee he looked significantly at howell making special agent yung twiddle his thumbs for a while robert will make the point that his being on the personal staff of the secretary or not i am the senior officer of the united states government here i understand sir fifteen minutes later when yung had not appeared mcgrory was about to reach for his telephone to find out where the hell he was when senora obregon stepped into his office closed the door behind her and asked mr yung just came in what shall i do with him ask him to wait please ambassador mcgrory replied and held up his hand fingers and thumb extended to remind her of how many minutes he wanted yung to wait he then punched a button on his chronometer wristwatch starting the timer the ambassador will see you now mr yung mcgrorys secretary announced yung got up off the chromeandplastic couch laid on the coffee table the buenos aires herald he had been reading and walked to mcgrorys door good morning mr ambassador welcome back to uruguay yung the ambassador said waving him first into the room then into one of the chairs facing his desk you know mr howell of course yes sir good to see you mr howell may i offer you some coffee mcgrory asked thank you sir mcgrory flipped the switch on his intercom and ordered coffee long flight mcgrory inquired as they waited it didnt seem as long sir as the ride from ezeiza to jorge newbery the piqueteros had the highway blocked it took the taxi two hours to get downtown moving five meters at a time that was more information than mcgrory wanted or needed well you know the pickets he said closing highways and bridges gives them something to do yes sir i suppose thats so senora obregon served the coffee mcgrory waited until she had left the office then asked i understand yung that when you were here before you werent doing exactly what everyoneincluding mr howell and ithought you were doing yung didnt reply what exactly were you doing mcgrory said pointedly with the exception sir that i was responding to specific requests for information from the state department and answering those queries directly to the department rather than through the embassy i was looking into money laundering like every other fbi agent here why do you suppose that was necessary and that i was not informed sir i have no idea im pretty low on the totem pole thats what i was told to do and i did it who told you to do it mr quiglette yung said simply youre referring to deputy assistant secretary of state for latin america quiglette yung nodded nice lady it was mr quiglette who told you to tell me nothing of your special orders what special orders is that sir the ones to keep me in the dark about what you were actually doing down here yes sir but it wasnt a question of not telling you specifically sir i was told that no one was to know what i was doing but you were aware that was highly extraordinary no sir i didnt think anything about it ive had other assignments where no one knew what i was really doing such as sir i really cant discuss anything like that and can you discuss why you were suddenly ordered out of here no sir yung said deputy assistant secretary quiglette messaged me that you were coming back here to take over the late mr lorimers body his assets etcetera are you aware of that yes sir then presumably you are aware of the circumstances of mr lorimers death yung looked at the ambassador now heres where im going to have to start being deceptive and dishonest goddamn castillo for getting me into this i know he was murdered sir and that he was mr mastersons brotherinlaw but thats about all im curious why the state department felt it necessary to send someone down here to do what were perfectly capable of doing ourselves mcgrory asked but it was more of a statement than a question yung answered it anyway i was given the impression sir that that came from the secretary herself you didnt deal with the secretary herself no sir but i was led to believe that it was personal courtesymaybe professional courtesyprobably bothon her part to mr lorimers father who is a retired ambassador but why you yung because i was here i suppose i know uruguay and the banks and people at the embassy mcgrory appeared to think that over then nodded that may well put you in a very delicate situation yung mcgrory said sir as it does me frankly yung mcgrory said could we go off the record a moment do you think yes sir of course not that youre really keeping a record of course just as a manner of speaking yes sir nowbearing in mind that i dont know this for sure but ive been in this diplomatic game for many years now and believe me you acquire a certain insight into things im sure you have sir one of the things you learn is that people who would have you think they have a certain influence with the upper echelons of somethinglike the state department for exampledont really have much influence at all i suppose thats true yung said and ying yong mcgrory said significantly excuse me ying yong mcgrory repeated and then when he saw on yungs face that he didnt understand went on i thought as an oriental you would understand thats korean i believe im chinese mr ambassador yung said my family came to this countryto the united statesin the s i dont speak korean it means everything evens out mcgrory explained sort of like the law of physics which says every action has an immediate and exactly opposite reaction yes sir in this case yung it would mean that someone who goes to some effort to suggest he has little influenceis pretty low on the totem pole to use your phrasemay in fact have a good deal of influence what the hell is mcgrory talking about is he suggesting i have influence im not sure i follow you mr ambassador i understand of course mcgrory said mcgrory gave yung time for that to sink in then went on as i was saying we are both in a some what delicate position visavis mr lorimer how is that sir like the secretary i am concerned with ambassador lorimer i never met him but i understand he is a fine man a credit to the diplomatic service thats my understanding sir and ambassador silvio in buenos aires told me in confidence that ambassador lorimer has certain health problemshis heart so i understand yung said let me tell you yung whats happened here off the record of course yes sir as incredible as this sounds deputy foreign minister alvarez came to my office he had with him a senor ordonez who i have learned is the chief inspector of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional not an official visit he just happened to be in the neighborhood and wanted to chat over a cup of coffee yes sir and he suggested not only that what really happened at estancia shangrila was a shootout between persons unknown and united states special forces but also that i knew all about it yung looked at howell but did not reply mcgrory continued the accusation is patently absurd of course i dont have to tell you that no action of that kind could take place without my knowledge and permission as ambassador i am the senior us officer in country and mr howellwho as im sure you suspect is the cia station chiefassures me that he knows of no secret operation by the intelligence community and he would know id heard the rumors that mr howell was cia sir well thats classified information of course mcgrory said i never told you that yes sir i understand sir where do think mr alvarez got an idea like that about a special operations mission mcgrory did not reply directly instead he said the question is why would he make such an absurd accusation that was the question i asked myself the question that kept me from immediately reporting the incident to the department i did however just about throw him out of my office did he offer anything to substantiate the accusation yung asked he showed me athingamabobthe shiny part of a cartridge what comes out of a gun after its fired a cartridge case sir precisely he told me it had been found at the estancia and he told me he had gone directly to the uruguayan embassy in washington and they had gone to the pentagon and the pentagon had obligingly informed them that it was a special kind of bullet used only by us army competitive rifle shooters and special forces a national match case sir did the case have nm stamped on it if it did it almost certainly came from that marine high school cheerleaders rifle mcgrory pointed his finger at yung and nodded his head thats it he said thats not much proof that our special forces were involved yung said of course not because they were not involved if there were special forces involved mr howell and i would have known about it thats a given yes sir my temptation of course was to go right to the department and report the incident you dont just about call the american ambassador a liar in his office but as i said before yung ive been in the diplomatic game for some time ive learned to ask myself why somebody says something does something i realized that if i went to the department theyd more than likely register an official complaint possibly even recall me for consultation and i thought maybe thats what the whole thing was all about they wanted to cause a stink in other words then i asked myself why would they want to do that and that answer is simple they were creating a diversion to take attention from what sir what really happened at that ranch that estancia which is sir think about this yung mcgrory replied indirectly bertrandlorimerhad nearly sixteen million dollars in banks here did you know about that yung didnt answer directly he said sixteen million dollars mcgrory nodded thats a lot of money yes it is mcgrory agreed and the united nationsalthough their pay scales are considerably more generous than ourswasnt paying him the kind of moneyeven if he lived entirely on his expense account which i understand a lot of them dofor him to have socked away sixteen million for a rainy day so where i asked myself did he get it he looked expectantly at yung who looked thoughtful then shrugged youve been looking into money laundering mcgrory said some what impatiently where does most of that dirty money come from embezzlement or drugs usually yung said and there you have it mcgrory said triumphantly lorimer was a drug dealer you really think so sir think about it everything fits with his alter ego as an antiques dealer he was in a perfect position to ship drugs whos going to closely inspect whats stuffed into some old vasesome old very valuable vase you can get a lot of heroin into a vase and where did lorimer get his new identity and permission to live in uruguay the best face they could put on that was they were surprised that he was dealing drugs right under their noses he had probably paid off a half dozen officials that would come out too its an interesting theory mr ambassador yung said i thought you might think so yung what happened at the estancia was that a drug deal a big one a huge onewere talking sixteen million dollars herewent wrong you know probably better than i do that murder is a way of life in that business those drug people would as soon shoot you as look at you yes sir thats certainly true does he really believe this nonsense well im not going to let them get away with it ill tell you that im not going to give them the diversion they want no official complaint to the state department i understand sir im just going to bide my time leaving them to swing in the breeze as they realize im not going to be their patsy he paused then went on however i think that the appropriate people in the state department should be made aware of the situation thats more or less what i was getting into when i said you and iand even the secretary herselfare in a delicate position if it wasnt for ambassador lorimer id be perfectly happy to call a spade a spade but in view of the ambassadors physical condition i understand sir none of us wish to spoil what im sure is his cherished memory of his son much less give him a heart attack do we no sir we certainly dont on the other hand i think the secretary should know about this dont you even if the information comes quietly from someone pretty low on the to tempole i take your point sir i was sure you would mcgrory said he stood up leaned across his desk and offered yung his hand they shook then he sat back down now getting to the business youre here for is there anything i can do anyone on my staff can do to facilitate the return of mr lorimers remains to the united states and the rest of it im sure there will be something sir ill pass the word that you are to be given whatever assistance you need and if you think anyone needs a little jogging im as close as your telephone thank you sir specifically what im going to do is ask mr howell to ask mr monahan to assign mr artigas to assist you in whatever needs to be done so long as youre here mr artigas he can fill you in on what happened at estancia shangrila mcgrory explained hes been up there chief inspector jose ordonez of the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional flew him up there in a helicopter the day after it happened yung thought ive been sandbagged the last thing i need is julio artigas looking over my shoulder and taking notes so that he can report to mcgrory i appreciate the thought sir but im not sure that will be necessary nonsense mcgrory said im sure hell be very helpful to you yes sir mcgrory stood up again if you can find time while youre here why dont we have lunch yung understood the meeting was concluded id like that very much sir yung said and stood up mcgrory offered his hand again yung shook it then offered his hand to howell why dont we go see mr monahan right now yung howell asked good idea mcgrory said thank you yung said as he walked out of the ambassadors office yung had several thoughts one after the other unbelievable surreal wait till castillo hears that nonsense about lorimer being a drug dealer thank god that pompous moronno wonder they call him senor pompouswasnt told what we were up to he would have ordered all of us out of the country and told the uruguayans why but hes not as stupid as he appears hes going to have artigas watch me and howell watch both of us i have to keep that in mind just as soon as i can im going to have to go to buenos aires and get on a secure line to castillo im going to have to stop in here yung said to howell as they approached the door to a mens room howell followed him inside and stood at the adjacent urinal well howell said that was interesting wasnt it does he actually believe that drug dealer business or is he being clever he believes it he also believes hes smelling rotten eggs artigas is smart and he doesnt like me yung said and he and chief inspector ordonez are pals so what do i do make sure artigas doesnt learn anything ordonez would like to know and how do i do that be very careful yung very careful three office of the legal attache the embassy of the united states of america lauro miller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august generally speaking there is little love lost between the federal bureau of investigation and the central intelligence agency and in the united states embassy in montevideo there was little lost between james d monahan the senior fbi agent and robert howell the cultural attache rumored to be the cia station chief monahan privately thought of howell as a typical cia asshole who couldnt find his ass with both hands and howell privately thought of monahan as someone far better suited to be walking a beat in chicago eating a stolen apple while preserving law and order with his billy club than holding his present position they were of course civil to each other can we come in a moment jim howell asked absolutely whats on your mind bob hello monahan yung said i heard youd been recalled to the bureau monahan said youre back temporarily yung said they sent me back to handle the affairs of mr lorimer return of the remains conservation of assets etcetera the bureau sent you back to do that actually it was the state department that sent me oh thats right you work for the state department dont you a little something you never got around to telling me you didnt have the need to know yung said more than a little lamely jim howell said quickly the ambassador would like you to have julio artigas work with yung on this work with yung on what repatriation of mr lorimers remains for one thing safeguarding his assets and having a look at lorimers estancia the ambassador wants this monahan asked yes he does monahan picked up his telephone and punched in a number julio can you come in here a minute legal attache julio artigas was surprised to see yung in monahans office in thinking about what had happened at estancia shangrila and his gut feeling when he had gone with ambassador mcgrory to buenos aires that howell and darby the buenos aires cia station chief knew all about what had happened there he had concluded that yung was also probably involved the story that yung had been suddenly recalled to the states to testify in some court case smelled artigas had thought it even possible that yung had been at the estancia during the firefight and had been wounded and taken out of the country by whoever had been at the estancia and won the gun battle it seemed logical to presume that at least some of the americans involved had been wounded or even killedand there was little question in his mind that americans were involved getting yung out of the country even with a fishy hastily concocted story made more sense than trying to explain how and where he had been wounded artigas had kept his thoughts to himself his opinion of james d monahan was that his greatest skill was covering his own ass monahan liked being the senior fbi agent in the embassy which allowed him to order the other agents around but whenever he should have stood up and defended the other agents from one of mcgrorys stupid orders he was quick to argue that he wasnt the sac and that sort of thing wasnt his business artigas knew that if he had said anything of his suspicions to monahan there was no question that monahan would have run with it right to mcgroryor more likely to theodore j detweiller jr the chief of mission i think i should tell you ted what a wild idea artigas came to me with what can i do for you jim its what you can do for yung monahan replied or more accurately for the state department youre back huh yung artigas asked yung was sent back howell answered for him by the secretary of state to handle the return of lorimers remains and to protect his assets and to compile a report for the secretary about what happened at lorimers estancia yung added artigas looked at yung or maybe since you know goddamned well what happened to see how much we know or the uruguayans know youre a little late to protect his assets artigas said parties unknown emptied his bank accounts of sixteen million dollars he thought as you almost certainly know ive heard something about that yung replied and id like a full report on that what we know for sure ambassador mcgrory told me there is some reason to think he was into drugs but first things first where is the body in the cooler in the british hospital on avenida italia it was taken there for an autopsy chief inspector ordonez of the federal police has promised me a copy of the autopsy report sometime today id like a copy of that too of course and is there going to be any kind of a problem getting into the estancia ordonez has the estancia pretty well sealed off hed be the man to ask about that well howell suggested why dont we go to my office see if we can get him on the phone and get out of jims hair just to be sure i know whats going on here this has the blessing of the ambassador right artigas asked yes it does howell said he nodded toward the door shall we go id like a brief word with you artigas monahan said then added for howell itll take just a couple of seconds bob certainly howell said smiling and walked out of monahans office yung followed him both heard monahan say close the door jim and exchanged glances i suspect monahan just told him to report everything we do howell said does that make me paranoid four office of the cultural attache the embassy of the united states of america lauro miller montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august there was no reason for julio artigas to report the substance of his conversation with chief inspector ordonez to howell and yung howell had punched the speakerphone button on his telephone and they had heard the entire conversation howell spoke first chief inspector ordonez is certainly obliging isnt he uruguayan courtesy yung said or professional courtesy maybeprobablyboth i thought his offer of a huey to fly us to the estancia was more than generous howell said and volunteering to go with us that was rather nice of him yung said my cousin jose is a very charming man artigas said but what i think you two have to keep in mind is that hes one smart cop why do you think we should we keep that in mind julio howell asked oh come on artigas said oh come on what howell replied something is going on here i have no idea what but you two do really howell asked what do you think is going on julio what i dont think is that lorimer was a drug dealer who got himself killed when a deal went wrong and neither does jose ordonez he told you that yung asked he didnt have to i know him pretty well what does he think do you know or can you guess howell asked i know hes fascinated with several things artigas said first that he cant identify the ninjas at the estancia if they were uruguayans argentines or brazilians by now he would have second that national match cartridge case and the cleaning out of lorimers bank accounts hes trying to tie those unknowns together if he can hell know what really happened at estancia shangrila what do you know about presidential findings julio howell asked jesus yung muttered howell looked at him and shrugged as if to say what choice do we have not much artigas admitted ive heard the term welljust talking you understandwhat ive heard about presidential findings is that they are classified top secret presidential the only persons cleared to know any details of a presidential finding are those cleared by the president himself or by the officer the president has named to do whatever the presidential finding calls for youve got my attention artigas said so hypothetically speaking of course howell went on obviously choosing his words carefully if there were people privy to a presidential finding and it happened that a professional associate of theirsan fbi agent for example or an ambassador for that matter someone with all the standard security clearancesbecame interested in something touching on the details of the finding and went to one of these people and asked them about it they just couldnt tell him no matter how much they might like to not even if telling that person would facilitate their execution of their assignment that would apply to an ambassador too i mean theres the rule that nothing is supposed to happen in a foreign country that the ambassador doesnt know about and approves of thats my understanding howell said is that your understanding too of how a presidential finding works yung from what ive heard yung said and from what i understand howell went on it would be a serious breach of security for someone privy to a presidential finding to even admit his knowledge of any detail of a presidential finding he couldnt say for example im sorry mr ambassador but that touches on a presidential finding for which you are not cleared he would have to completely deny any knowledge of even knowing there was a presidential finding fascinating artigas said can i ask a question you can ask anything you want yung said but i may not get an answer is that it ask your question howell said just between us hypothetically speaking where do you suppose lorimer got sixteen million dollars the ambassador thinks it was from drugs im not about to question the ambassadors judgment howell said but hypothetically speaking of course it could have come from somewhere else embezzlement comes to mind it could even i suppose have something to do with the oilforfood scandal i heard somewhere there was really a lot of money involved in that you know that thought occurred to me too did it howell asked one more question artigas asked shoot monahan just now told me i was to tell him everywhere yung went who he talked to what he saideverything how interesting howell said the ambassador told me to do exactly that about yung im wondering whether that would mean i should tell him about this little discussion of ours what discussion was that about presidential findings i dont remember any discussion of presidential findings do you yung howell asked no i dont remember any discussion like that artigas stood up wed better be getting over to the british hospital he said we wouldnt want to keep ordonez waiting would we since hes being so helpful five camp mackall north carolina august sergeant major john k davidsons job description said he was the operations sergeant of the special forces training facility he was but he actually had two other functions both unwritten and both more or less secret it was not much of a secret that he was the judge of the noncommissioned officers going through the basic qualification coursethe q course he was the man who with the advice of others decided which trainee was going to go on to further specialized training and ultimately earn the right to wear the blaze of a fully qualified special forces soldier on his green beret and which trainee would go back to other duties in the army far more of a secret was that he was also the judge of the commissioned officers going through the q course jack davidson had not wanted the jobfor one thing mackall was in the boonies and a long drive from his quarters on the post and for another he thought of himself as an urban special operatoras opposed to an out in the boonies eating monkeys and snakes and rolling around in the mud field special operatorand running mackall meant spending most of his time in the boonies but two people for whom he had enormous respecthe had been around the block with both of them vic dallessando now retired and running the stockade and bruce j scotty mcnab whom davidson had known as a major and who was now the xviii airborne corps commander and a threestar generalhad almost shamelessly appealed to his sense of duty jack you know better than anybody else what it takes scotty mcnab had told him somebody else is likely to pass some character who cant hack it and people will get killed you want that on your conscience sergeant major davidson was not surprised when he heard the peculiar fluckatafluckata sound the rotor blades of mhh helicopters make as they came in for a landing and he was reasonably sure that it was either dallessando or the general who often dropped in unannounced once a week or so and neither had been at mackall recently but when he pushed himself out of his chair and walked outside the small woodframe operations building just as the little bird touched down he was surprised to see that the chopper held both of them that seldom happened he waited safely outside the rotor cone as first general mcnaba small muscular ruddyfaced man sporting a flowing red mustacheand then vic dallessando ducked under the blades he saluted crisply good morning general he said officially welcome to camp mackall may the sergeant major ask the general who the bald fat old guinea is i told you it was a bad idea to teach the bastard how to read dallessando said first giving davidson the finger with both hands and then wrapping his arms around him how are you jack mcnab asked cant complain sir what brings you to the boonies a bit of news thatll make you weep for the old army mcnab said guess whos now a lieutenant colonel havent the foggiest charley castillo vic dallessando said make you feel old jack yeah davidson said thoughtfully i remember charley when he was a second john and driving the generals chopper in desert one lieutenant colonel castillo ill be damned he paused thought about that then added i think hell be a good one and i want to see corporal lester bradley of the marines mcnab said you heard about that did you general davidson said heard about what the goddamned marines pulling our chain how pulling our chain im responsible davidson said what are you talking about i went to quantico and talked to the jarheads about the people theyre starting to send here the master gunnery sergeant of force recon therean irishman named macnamarawas a pretty good guy we hit it off we had a couple of tastes together and while we were talking i asked him if he had any influence on who they were sending here he said he did so i asked him as a favor if he could send us at least one who wasnt all muscles especially between the ears and could read and write he stopped when he saw the look on mcnabs face general he went on they send all their force recon guys through the seal course on the west coast they run them up and down the beach in the sand carrying telephone poles over their heads by the time they finish they all look like arnold schwarzenegger theyre more into that physical crap than even the goddamned rangers and mcnab asked so i forgot about it davidson said id pulled macnamaras chain a little and i was satisfied and then bradley appeared and mcnab pursued well not only can he read and writehe talks like a college professor never using a small word when a big one will doand not only is he not all muscle hes no muscle at all and hes eighteen nineteen years old and looks fifteen i have to hand it to master gunnery sergeant macnamara he had to look all over the marine corps to find this guy and where is this stalwart marine warrior in the office ive got him typing he didnt eveni forgot to mention thishave orders what im doing now is hoping that macnamaras going to call me and go haha got you good my doggie friend now you can send him back i think thats unlikely jack general mcnab said and walked toward the small frame building where he pushed open the door a voice inside in a loud but some what less than commanding voice cried attention on deck mr dallessando and sergeant major davidson followed general mcnab into the building corporal bradley was standing at rigid attention behind a field desk holding a notebook computer general mcnab turned and looked at sergeant major davidson never judge a book by its cover he said you might want to write that down jack then he looked at corporal bradley at ease he said softly bradley shifted from his rigid position of attention to an equally rigid position with his hands in the small of his back his legs slightly spread unless im mistaken son general mcnab said you are now standing at parade rest sir the corporal begs the generals pardon the general is correct sir bradley said let his body relax and took his hands from the small of his back so youre the sniper are you son mcnab asked sir i was a designated marksman on the march to baghdad thank you for the clarification with all respect sir my pleasure sir tell me son how would you describe your role in the assault on that wonderfully named estancia shangrila with all respect sir i am under orders not to discuss that mission with anyone can you tell me why not sir the mission is classified top secret presidential general mcnab looked at sergeant major davidson but didnt say anything vic dallessando said its okay lester the general and the sergeant major are cleared yes sir lester said well son what did you do on that mission sir major castillo who was in command assigned me to guard the helicopter for your information corporal major castillo has been promoted to lieutenant colonel mcnab said if it is appropriate for me to say so sir it is a welldeserved promotion majlieutenant colonel castillo is a fine officer under whom i am proud to have served vic dallessando was smiling widely at a thoroughly confused sergeant major davidson so you guarded the helicopter mcnab pursued yes sir until the situation got a bit out of control when i realized it had become my duty to enter the fray the fray is that something like a firefight mcnab asked yes it is sir perhaps i should have used that phrase how exactly did you enter the fray corporal mcnab asked when the situation got a bit out of control sir when it became evident that one of the villains was about to fire his madsen through a window into a room into which majlieutenant colonel castillo had taken the detainee i realized i had to take him out regrettably he managed to fire a short burst before i was able to do so how did you take him out with a head shot sir you didnt consider that it would be safer to try to hit him in the body i considered it sir but i was no more than seventyfive meters distant and knew i could make the shot is that all you did corporal no sir i took out a second villain perhaps fifteen seconds later with another headshot yes sir just to satisfy my curiosity corporal mcnab asked were you firing offhand yes sir there just wasnt time to adjust a sling and get into a kneeling or prone position sir colonel castillo has told mr dallessando that there is no question you saved his life sergeant major davidson and myself are old friends of colonel castillos and we are grateful to you arent we sergeant major yes sir we certainly are just doing my duty as i saw it sir the yare going to bury sergeant kranz at sixteen hundred today in arlington if sergeant major davidson can spare you from your duties here i thought perhaps you might wish to go there with mr dallessando and me yes sir i would like very much to pay my last respects have you a dress uniform yes sir but im afraid its not very shipshape sir well im sure sergeant major davidson will be happy to see that its pressed and that youre at pope at twelve hundred wont you jack my pleasure sir sergeant major davidson said vii one ferihegy international airport budapest hungary august hungary is not a member of the european union it was therefore necessary for otto gorner and karl w von und zu gossinger to pass through immigration and customs when the eurojet taxi deposited them before the small civilaviation building but it was just the briefest of formalities not only were their passports quickly stamped by the officer who came aboard the twinengine jet aircraft but he volunteered the information your driver is waiting ur gorner then he left without even looking at the luggage the pilot and copilot had carried down the stair door thanks for the ride and the cockpit tour castillo said in english offering his hand to the pilot my pleasure colonel the pilot replied also in englishamerican english maybe we can do it again any time youve got our number there had been no other passengers on the flight from leipzig which made castillo wonder if that was coincidence or whether the cessna citation iii had been sent to pick him up because there would be no smaller aircraft available for some time and montvale had ordered them to put him at the head of the line just after they had gone wheelsup he had made his way to the cockpit and asked in english hows chances of sitting in the right seat and having you explain the panel to me the copilot had exchanged glances with the pilot who nodded and then wordlessly got up thanks castillo said to the pilot as he sat down and strapped himself in anything special you want to see colonel the pilot had asked in english making it clear that there was no reason to pretend he was anything but an employee of the agency or that castillo was a german businessman named gossinger availing himself of eurojet taxis services how long do you think it would take to show a pilotseveral hundred hours in smaller business jetsenough to make him safe to sit in the right seat these are nice airplanes the pilot said they come in a little hot and sometimes close to max gross they take a long time to get off the ground but aside from that theyre not hard to fly how long it would take would depend on the ip and the student but not long id really be grateful to be able to sit here and watch until you get it on the ground in budapest is that possible you know how to work the radios the pilot asked and when castillo nodded the pilot motioned for him to pick up the copilots headset and when castillo had them on pointed out on the gps screen where they wereover the dresdennurnberg autobahn near chemnitz i think montvale will learn that i wanted to sit in the cockpit but i dont think hell think its anything but my boyish enthusiasm for everything connected with flying good afternoon ur gorner sandor tor greeted them inside the civilaviation building the cars right outside sandor this is herr von und zu gossinger gorner said and this ur von und zu gossinger is sandor tor who was supposed to keep kocian from falling over his goddamned dog and down the stairs ur gorner tor began painfully embarrassed and also incidentally to telephone me immediately at any time if anything at all out of the ordinary happened to ur kocian ur gorner tor began again only to be interrupted again by gorner why dont we wait until were on our way to the hospital gorner said then you can tell us everything i wish god had put me in that hospital bed instead of ur kocian tor said emotionally i think i like you sandor tor castillo thought in otto gorner had reluctantly concluded eric kocian in his eighties needed protectionprotection from himself the old man was fond of american whiskeyjack daniels black label in particularand driving fast mercedesbenz automobiles a combination of the former and his agereduced reflexes and night vision had seen him in half a dozen accidents the last two of them spectacular the final one had put him in hospital and caused the government to cancel his drivers license otto gorner had come to budapest and sought out sandor tor right after hed been to kocians hospital room were going to have to do something or hes going to kill himself gorner had announced it wont take him long to get his driving license backhe knows where all the politicians keep their mistresses we have to get this fixed before that happens you mean get him a chauffeur gorner nodded good luck ur gorner tor had said im glad im not the one whos going to have to tell him that gorner had smiled and obviously thinking about what he was going to say didnt reply for a moment then he said let me tell you what he said in the hospital just now not for the first time he was way ahead of me tor waited for gorner to go on before you say anything otto he said the moment i walked in the door let me tell you how im going to deal with this i cant wait to hear this tor said sandor tor will now drive me around gorner quoted no tor said quickly and firmly not embracing the idea at all i told him you were the director of security not a chauffeur gorner said and did you think i dont know that gorner quoted as director of security he carries a gun im getting too old to do that anymore too furthermore sandor can be trusted to keep his mouth shut about where i go and who i talk to i dont want some taxi driver privy to that or listening to my conversations and finally sandors a widower driving me around may interfere with his sex life but at least he wont go home and regale his wife with tales of what kocian did today and with whom no ur gorner tor repeated adamantly i told him you would say that gorner said to which he replied ill handle tor no sorry but absolutely not do you know sandor how far back eric kocian goes with gossinger gmbh not exactly a long time i know that he was with oberstleutnant hermann wilhelm von und zu gossinger at stalingrad gorner said they met on the iceencrusted basement floor of a building being used as a hospital both were very seriously wounded ive heard that the herr oberst had been at stalingrad eric was an eighteenyearold gefreite gorner went on he and the colonel were flown out on one of the very last flights the colonel was released from hospital first and placed on convalescent leave he went to visit a friend in the army hospital in giessen and ran into kocian there eric had apparently done something for the colonel in stalingradi have no idea what but the colonel was gratefulso the colonel arranged for him to be assigned to the pow camp he was going to command the alternative for kocian was being sent back to the eastern front they ended the war in the pow camp and became prisoners themselves kocian was released first he went home to vienna and learned that the american bombs that had reduced st stephens cathedral and the opera to rubble had done the same to his familys apartment all of his family and their friends were dead jesus tor exclaimed softly his only friend in the world was the colonel so he made his way back to germany and fulda the presses of the fulda tages zeitung were in the basement of what had been the building eric arrived there a day or so after the colonel had been given permission by the americans to resume publishing they had found his name on a list the ss had of people they were going to execute for being antinazi and defeatist and he was thus the man they were looking for to run a german newspaper the problem was the presses were at the bottom of a huge pile of rubble that had been the fulda tages zeitung building eric kocian began his journalistic career making one whole mergenthaler linotype machine from parts salvaged from the dozen under the rubble a year later when the wiener tages zeitung got permission from the americans to resume publishing eric was named editor in chief primarily because he had already been cleared by the denazification courts and also because their linotype machines had to be rescued from the rubble of the wiener tages zeitung building it was understood that eric was to be publisher and editor in chief only and that older wiser bonafide professional journalists would really run things when the colonel went to vienna for the ceremonies marking the first edition he found that eric had fired the older wiser etcetera people hired his own and was sitting at the editor in chiefs desk himself that sounds like him tor said chuckling well he kept the job and now hes the oldest employee of gossinger gmbh further i learned that when the colonel and his brother were killed it was eric who went to the colonels daughter and got her to give me the job of running the business so i think i owe him i understand i realize you dont owe him a thing tor held up his hand when my wife was dying he held my hand and later he got me off the bottle tor said okay until i can get somebody he can live with and vice versabut only until then understandill keep an eye on him somebody eric kocian could live with had never appeared and tor learned some what to his surprise that he actually had time to both serve as director of security for the tages zeitung and keep an eye on the old man the job now was more than keeping kocian from behind the wheel of his mercedes a year before kocian had begun investigating hungarian czechgerman involvement in the iraqi oilforfood scandal it personally outraged him and when those who had been engaged in it learned of kocians interest in them they were enraged there had been a number of threats by email postal mail and telephone eric kocian grandly dismissed them only a fool would kill a journalist he said the slime of the world need darkness killing a journalist would turn a spotlight into their holes and they know it sandor tor didnt believe this for a minute but he knew that arguing with the old man would be futile instead he had gone to otto gorner with his fears tor had said i think we had better have someone keeping an eye on him around the clock do it gorner had replied thats going to be expensive ur gorner im talking about at least one manprobably twoin addition to myself plus cars around the clock the cost be damned tor and for gods sake dont let the old man know hes being protected otherwise well have to find him to protect him im pleased to meet you castillo said in hungarian as he offered his hand and you should consider that ur gorner is even more fond of billy kocian than i know you are and is therefore even more upset than you or i about whats happened before god no one is more sorry than me sandor tor said i love that old man now i know i like you two room telki private hospital telki korhaz fasor budapest hungary august there was a heavyset man in his fifties sitting in a heavy wellworn captains chair in the corridor beside the closed door to room he watched as gorner and castillo walked down the corridor and then when it became clear that castillo was going to knock at the door announced no visitors thats a cop castillo thought or my name really is ignatz glutz its all right otto said were from the tages zeitung he took a business card from the breast pocket of his suit and handed it to the man the man read it he said no visitors ur gorner why dont i tell him im here gorner said and reached for the door handle hes got his dog in there the man said gorner opened the door just a crack and called eric get your goddamned dog under control its otto go away otto gorner kocian called out not a chance otto called back put that gottverdammthund on a chain im coming in the response to that was animala deep not too loud but nevertheless frightening growl got a little cough have you oncle erik castillo called goddamn the plagiarist kocian said gorner pushed open the door to room eric kocian was sitting against the raised back of a hospital bed a large long black cigar was clamped in his jaw a rollup tray was in front of him it held a laptop computer a large ashtray several newspapers a cellular telephone a pot of coffee and a heavy mug kocians some what florid face topped with a luxuriant head of naturally curling silver hair made him at first look younger than he was but his bodyhe was naked above the waistgave him away what could be seen of his arms and chesthis left arm was bandaged and in a sling and there was another bloodstained bandage on his upper right chestwas all sagging flesh there were angry old scars on his upper shoulder and on his abdomen gorner had two thoughts one after the other in the few seconds before max now growling a mouthful of teeth caught his attention my god hes nearly eightytwo god even the damned dog is bandaged gorner who usually liked dogs hated this one and was afraid of him castillo was not he squatted just inside the door smiled and said conversationally in hungarian youre an ugly old bastard arent you stop that growling not only dont you scare me but that old man in the bed is really glad to see us the dog stopped growling sat on its haunches and cocked his head come here fatso and ill scratch your ears his name is max kocian said come max castillo said max got off his haunches and head still cocked looked at castillo watch out for him karl gorner exclaimed come dammit castillo ordered max took five tentative steps toward castillo castillo held out his left hand to him max sniffed it then licked it castillo scratched maxs ears close to the bandage max sat down again pressing his massive head against castillos leg and licked his hand again max you sonofabitch kocian said youre supposed to take his hand off not lick it like a kartnerstrasse whore he knows who his friends are castillo said so who shot you eric more important who shot max he wasnt shot kocian said one of the bastards clipped him with his pistol one of your readers disgruntled with your proamerican editorials that from a shameless plagiarist kocian asked am i never to be forgiven castillo asked the reference was to castillos habitto lend authenticity to his alter ego karl w von and zu gossinger washington correspondent for the tages zeitung newspapersof paraphrasing articles from the american conservative magazine and sending them to fulda to be published under his byline in the tages zeitung newspapers kocian had caught him at it not in this life kocian said looking incredulously at castillo and max who was now on his back getting his chest scratched where did you come from max castillo asked an illicit dalliance between a boar and a really horny dachshund thats a bouvier des flandres kocian said bouvier was jacqueline kennedys maiden name castillo said i dont think so jesus christ kocian said i could be wrong castillo said one bouvier des flandres bit corporal adolf schickelgruber when he was in flanders kocian said i told you hes a marvelous judge of character castillo said what do you mean one of them bit hitler one of them bit hitler in flanders in the first world war kocian repeated ive always wondered if thats what really happened to der fuhrers missing testicle anyway adolf was really annoyed when the germans took belgium in one of the first things he did was order the breed wiped out why do i believe that castillo asked because im telling you kocian said im not a plagiarist i can be trusted particularly when youre telling me how you came to be in hospital gorner said falling over the dog and down the stairs jesus eric it was the best i could think of at the time kocian said completely unembarrassed and then returned to the subject at hand i heard the story of the bouvier taking a piece out of adolf in russia and when i had the chance i checked it out and i knew i had to have one so i went to belgium and bought one thats max vi maxes i through v never betrayed me the way that ones doing they didnt know me castillo said so aside from corrupting my dog what brings you to budapest karlchen thats herr oberstleutnant karlchen gorner said god the herr oberst must be spinning in his grave if he is its from pride gorner said sharply kocian considered that and nodded i shouldnt have said that the herr oberst would have been proud of his grandson being oberstleutnant karlchen thank you castillo said you were about to tell me what brings you to budapest kocian said ill tell you if you tell methe truthabout what happened to you okay kocian said after a moment you first i want to be released from my promise to keep the list of names you gave me to myself kocian didnt reply directly instead he asked by now i assume youve heard that they got to your man lorimer in uruguay of all places i was there when he was shot castillo said kocian pursed his lips thoughtfully then asked who done it one of the six guys in dark blue coveralls who went to lorimers estancia to do it how come they didnt get you too if you were there i couldnt ask them they were all dead not identifiable no sounds like the people who got me kocian said max and i were taking a midnight stroll on the franz josef bridge the where gorner asked they now call it the szabadsag hid freedom bridge i dont freedom has many meanings franz josef means franz josef i remain one of his admirers going off at a tangent castillo said theres a country club called mayerling outside buenos aires really kocian asked yeah really well ill have to have a look at it when i go to argentina kocian said what are you two talking about whats mayerling gorner asked what do you mean when you go to argentina mayerling was the imperial hunting lodge outside vienna castillo said where crown prince rudolph heir to the throne of austriahungary on being told he had to give up his sixteenyearold tootsie shot her and then shot himself according to my father its where franz josef had him shot on learning he had been talking to people about becoming king of hungary kocian said my aunt olga told me that version too castillo said a great lady kocian said and you remember im impressed you were only a kidseven eight maybe ninewhen she died and what do you mean when you go to argentina castillo said dont interrupt me when im telling you what happened to me kocian said max and i were coming back from taking a midnight snack across the river we were about halfway across the franz josef bridge when i sensed there were people approaching us from behind that happens often youd be surprised how many young hungarians think robbing old men out walking late at night is a lot more fun than getting a job max loves it he gets to growl a little show them his teeth and after they wet their pants drop their knives or whatever they had planned to hit me in the head with he gets to chase them off the bridge castillo chuckled this time it wasnt young men this time its two fullgrown men with a third man driving a mercedes and the guy who got pretty close before max grabbed him wasnt carrying a knife he had a hypodermic needle in his slimy little hand had had by the time i saw it max was chewing on his arm and hed dropped it my god gorner exclaimed the second thug pulled out a pistol and started beating max on the head with it i jumped on him and then the mercedes pulled up and the second guy got away from me and got in it off they drove they stopped ten meters away maybe a little more and started shooting at me through an open window and then they drove off for good the license plates it turned out theyd stolen off a ford taurus what happened to the guy with the hypo castillo asked he was beggingin germanfor me to get max off him what happened to the needle castillo asked the cops have it by any wild coincidence was it loaded with bupivacaine or something similar this one was loaded with phenothiazine kocian said i have been told they use it on lunatics whats the wild coincidence you were hoping to find when mastersons wife masterson being your murdered diplomat in buenos aires kocian interrupted castillo nodded he went on when she was kidnapped in a restaurant parking lot they jabbed her in the buttocks with a hypo full of bupivacaine very interesting kocian said but sorry no match what about the guy this adorable puppy almost ate hes in jail his story which i think he may get away with is that hes a vacationing housepainter from dresden who was walking on the bridge when i made an indecent proposal to him attempted to fondle his private parts and when he resisted and pushed me away my dog attacked him how did he explain the hypo he never saw it before therefore it probably belongs to the old pervert he paused and looked at otto thats why i told you i fell over max otto i knew youd be delighted to accept the old pervert story my god eric whats going to happen to this guy i told the copsin particular the police commissioner who is an old pal of mineto see if he can connect him with stasi theyre out of business arent they you can ask a question like that and still get promoted as an intelligence officer you have all the answers you tell me castillo said did you ever think about it karlchen the old man asked and castillo had a sudden insight from now on when he calls me karlchen it will be because he has decided i am either impossibly ignorant or have done something monumentally stupid think about what what happened to the better agents of the ministry for state security of the german democratic republic commonly known as stasi when the berlin wall came tumbling down and peace and lovingkindness descended on our beloved germany frankly i never gave it much thought maybe you should have karlchen kocian said well ill tell you this very few of them became bakers cobblers or took holy orders okay so what are they doing for whom whos paying them if you have to ask that you must believe that once democracy came to the former soviet union russia really became the friendly bear your president roosevelt always thought it was while youre here in budapest you should go over to andrassy ut broaden your professional horizons ill bite whats at andrassy ut now its a museum it used to be the headquarters of the avo and then the avh the allamvedelmi osztaly and the allamvedelmi hatosag i dont suppose you have any idea what that means i didnt know the address castillo said or that they had turned it into amuseum great museum they not only have a zis in the lobby whats a zis gorner asked formerly the limousine of the head of the avh kocian continued only to be interrupted again a russian copy of the packard super eight castillo said stalin showed up in yalta in one reserved for really big shots maybe the plagiarist isnt as ignorant as he sometimes sounds kocian said and the walls are covered with pictures of people the bastards garroted in the basement the garrote gallows is also in the basement now thats interesting castillo said id forgotten that you forgot what gorner asked the nkvds preferred method of execution was a pistol bullet in the back of the head castillo explained the peoples court found you guilty and then they marched you straight into a room in the basement and shot you in the base of the skull stasi and the hungarian state security bureauavo and avhwerent that nice they my god gorner thought hes lecturing me like a schoolboy but it would seem that my little karlchen really is knowledgeable im a journalist im supposed to know these things and i didnt more than that he sounds like acts like an intelligence officer who knows his profession took you into the basement castillo went on stood you on a stool under the garrote gallows put the rope around your neck and then kicked the stool away you mean to say they hung theirprisoners gorner asked no hanging is when they drop theexecuteethrough a trap in a gallows the rope around the neck usually has a special knot designed to break the executees neck with the force of the fall he mimed a knot forcing his head to one side that usually causes instant death as the spinal cord is cut castillo went on garrote executees dont fall far enough to break their neck the rope is just a loop around their neck so they die of strangulation it takes sometime and you find this fascinating karlchen gorner asked more than a little horrified they also had the habit when taking out people they didnt like and wanted it known that stasi or the avoavh had done it to garrote them sort of a trademark fascinating gorner said sarcastically whats fascinating is that one of the men with me at estancia shangrila who had been around the block a lot of times was garroted estancia shangrila kocian asked how picturesque lorimers farm in uruguay castillo explained they took out my guy by garroting him and they used he stopped in midsentence as the door opened a small slight man in his middle fifties wearing a white hospital tunic came into the room followed by a younger manalso a doctor castillo decidedand a nurse youre not supposed to be smoking the first doctor announced and you promised to get that dog out of here four people have tried to take max out of here kocian replied he took small nips out of each of them youre welcome to try and i have been smoking longer than youre old and i am not about to stop now say hello to my boss the doctor put out his hand to gorner no the young one kocian said switching to german karl wilhelm von und zu gossinger the fat ones another of his flunkies i never know when to believe him the doctor confessed putting out his hand to first gorner and then castillo im dr czerny im the chief of staff if youre treating him doctor you have my sympathy castillo said in hungarian youre hungarian dr czerny asked surprised i had a hungarian aunt hes mostly german and hungarian with a little mexican thrown in kocian said tell us aboutwhat was the name of that drug in argentina karlchen bupivacaine castillo furnished tell us about bupivacaine please doctor kocian said the doctor shook his head what do you want to know about bupivacaine and why im an old man indulge me what would have happened if the housepainters hypodermic had been loaded with bupivacaine and he had succeeded in sticking it into my rump dr czerny smiled youre amused kocian demanded indignantly dr czerny nodded then explained your rump would have gone numb for oh two hours or so bupivacaine is a drug commonly used by dentists to numb the gums youre sure doctor castillo asked czerny nodded if youre ever going to be a decent journalist karlchen youre going to have to start checking your facts kocian said triumphantly and of course stop plagiarizing the doctor in the german hospital in buenos aires castillo said as much to himself as to them told me it was bupivacaine thats something else you should keep in mind karlchen never trust what a doctor tells you they only tell you what they think you should know isnt that right czerny my father used to say you were the most difficult person he had ever known dr czerny said smiling how long are you going to have to put up with him doctor castillo asked well once he regains his sanity theres no reason he couldnt leave here in a day or two his general sanity or is there something specific gorner asked when i walked in here this morning i thought he was having a heart attack the doctor said but what it was he was on the telephone and air france had just told him they would not carry that animal to buenos aires aerolineas argentina will be happy to accommodate max kocian said but ill have to take the damned train to madrid they dont fly into budapest and max doesnt like trains i have no idea why he wants to go to argentina dr czerny said the implication was that it was one of the reasons he doubted kocians sanity and he wont tell me thats because its none of your damned business kocian explained what is my business eric personal and professional is that youre getting pretty long in the tooth and you have just been shottwiceand im not going to stand idly by while you go halfway around the world alone and in bandages and with that damned dog your father may his soul rest in peace fredric could call me by my christian name i dont recall giving you that privilege kocian said and dont call max that damned dog i beg your pardon dr czerny said doctor for the sake of argument supposing he could get someone to go with him to argentina castillo asked carefully and stay with him while hes there would that be all right i mean could he stand the strain in a couple of days why not dr czerny said it was clear that dr czerny had concluded that castillo had come up with a way to calm kocian down and that otto gorner had concluded that castillo had lost his mind well lets have a look at you ur kocian dr czerny said will you excuse us a moment please he started to draw a curtain around the bed max stood up showed his teeth and growled softly but deeply come on max castillo said lets go terrorize people in the corridor max looked doubtful for a moment then followed castillo out of the room as soon as he had closed the door to room otto gorner grabbed castillos arm youre not actually thinking about taking him to argentina are you karl for one thing do you think wed be able to stop him from going to argentina castillo replied and then went on without giving gorner a chance to reply the people who tried to kill himthe needle full of phenothiazine makes me think they were going to question him which means torture him to see what he knew before killing himare almost certainly going to have another try at him i can protect him a lot better in argentina than i can here and if i take him on the gulfstream there will be no record of him having bought a ticket to go anywhere thatll take them off his trail for at least a few days gorner considered that for thirty seconds then asked when will your airplane be here castillo thought out loud it was probably ten washington time by the time dick had the cashiers check from the riggs bank torine said twelve hours from then that would make it ten tonight and how far ahead of washington is budapest five hours this time of year six gorner furnished thatll put them into ferihegy at four tomorrow morning figure an hourmaybe a little moreto clear customs and get to the gellert five oclock i think wed better spend a day here both to give billy a chance to get his stuff together and for torine and fernando to get some rest gorner nodded you can protect him in argentina he asked castillo nodded but im a little worried about here that one cop doesnt look like much protection can you do something about that gorner took his cellular telephone from his pocket and punched an autodial button thirty seconds later he said as soon as someone wakes up long enough to answer the goddamned telephone at the budapester tages zeitung there will be people from the security service here within fifteen minutes can they be trusted eric trusts them gorner said and then turned his attention to his cellular telephone hier ist generaldirektor gorner three room telki private hospital telki korhaz fasor budapest hungary august doctor fredric czerny put his head into the corridor and shaking his head in what was obviously resignation signaled for castillo and gorner to come into eric kocians room ur kocian and i are negotiating his release from the hospital he said he wishes you to participate max trotted after them sat on his haunches by the bed and offered kocian his paw traitor kocian said but took the paw and then caressed maxs massive head what are the points in dispute castillo asked i told him i would release him probably tomorrow afternoon as i think he needs another day of bed rest czerny explained and i said if i have to spend another day in bed i would prefer to do so in my own bed instead of on this indian bed of nails kocian said starting right now my counteroffer was to release him after breakfast tomorrow with the caveat he will actually go to his bed and stay there for twentyfour hours he said that whether he stays in bed depends on when you plan to leave for argentina very early in the morning the day after tomorrow castillo said why then kocian asked because thats when the plane leaves castillo said you understand max is going i understand max is going castillo said i couldnt leave him were pals kocian snorted then said you see fredric we have reached agreement i will leave your charnel house in the morning before breakfast as the food you serve in here would poison an oxen you will leave after breakfast and after i have another look at you in the morning and then only if ur gossinger will guarantee that you will go directly from here to your apartment and get in bed and stay there will i be paroled karlchen to have a bath and attend to necessary bodily functions as long as youre quick about it and the bath is in your bathroom castillo said doctor ill see that he stays in bed if i have to chain him to it you may well find yourself doing just that dr czerny said quickly shook castillos and gorners hands and walked out of the room there will be security people from the tages zeitung here in a couple of minutes otto gorner announced and i will arrange with them to take you from here to your apartment in the morning do you ever think before you act otto kocian asked somethings wrong gorner said max dislikes security people kocian explained they apparently have a special smell max tends to bite people he dislikes and the security people know it they may go on strike castillo said i want you alive so you can talk to me these people will keep you alive until i can get you on the airplane he paused what about the cop at the door max has no problem with him there is an exception to every rule kocian said and i suspect the cophis name is kadarhas been feeding max leberwurst max likes leberwurst so we will get the security people a supply of leberwurst castillo said kocian considered this a moment no hanging around my bed of pain is no fun for max he said finally and the cop at the door has already been there too long so when my security people arrive i will send him away and you will take max to my apartment you may stay with him providing you take him for a latenight walk two questions castillo said where is your apartment and will they let me into it on the top floor of the hotel gellert kocian replied the expression on his face making it obvious he thought castillo should have known where he lived and if youre with max of course they will you will find dog food in the kitchen and there will be some beef bones in the refrigerator he gets one large or two small only after he eats his dog food yes sir and what does he like for dessert there is a dish of chocolates beside my chair he gets two only okay for reasons i cant imagine chocolate is supposed to be bad for dogs in maxs case too much chocolate causes flatulenceand he can clear a room with itso be wise and strong when he begs for more hes a very appealing beggar ill remember theres a leash hanging from the door handle kocian said youd better put him on it unless i am there max tends to go pretty much where he wants to two minutes later there was a knock at the door and two burly menobviously armed under their suitscame into the room saw max and stayed close to the door max growled softly but deeply and showed a thin but impressive row of teeth what did i tell you kocian asked how many of you are there castillo asked they looked at him but didnt answer looking instead at gorner you can tell him kocian said thats herr karl von und zu gossinger there are three of us herr gossinger one of the men said in german you heard what happened to mr kocian castillo asked in hungarian both nodded the same man said mr kocian was assaulted on the szabadsag hid it was not a robbery it was far more serious and it may well happen again castillo said they both nodded again i want two men outside this door at all times castillo ordered and i want at least two more close by i can have another manas many men as you would like sirhere in fifteen minutes get two castillo ordered do you know how to use your pistols theyre all retired policemen ur gossinger kocian answered for them everyone has cellular telephones castillo asked they nodded if anything at all suspicious happens you notify first the police and then me that means you will have to give me one of your telephones i will be in ur kocians apartment the man who had spoken gestured for the other to give castillo his cellular telephone thank you castillo said examining it and how do i call you with this the man showed him in the morning we are going to move ur kocian from here to his apartment we dont want anyone to know were doing that which means we dont want anyone to see him leaving the hospital or entering the hotel he will be in a wheelchair suggestions please i will not be in a wheelchair kocian announced ur kocian will be in a wheelchair castillo repeated we could get a van from the tages zeitung sir back it up to the loading dock in the basement of the hospital and then do the same thing at the gellert i want one of you to drive the van castillo ordered and when you are prepared to leave i want you to call me you will say ur kocian is having his breakfast and waiting for the doctor the man nodded and smiled did i say something amusing castillo asked youre smiling excuse me sir i was just thinking you sound more like a policeman than a newspaper publisher think what you like about me but dont repeat what youre thinking no offense intended sir none taken castillo said sir the man said we will take good care of ur kocian and get him safely and discreetly to the gellert in the morning good castillo said he meant that obviously he really likes eric why should that surprise me there is one thing sir which is the dog sir sometimes he can be difficult what it is kocian said is that you smell like leberwurst im taking max with me castillo said the mans face registered both surprise and relief i think that would be best sir sandor tor was waiting with the silver mercedesbenz s when gorner and castillo walked out of the hospital door max lunged toward it towing castillo after him i called the office and had them send other security people over gorner said i saw them tor said he ran off the people i had placed in the corridor he paused then asked how is he hes all right gorner said the hospital will never be the same but ur kocian is fine he also ran me off tor said he said i made him nervous having you around would be like admitting he needed your protection castillo said after you drop us at the gellert you can come back here and go see him your excuse will be that ur gossingerhe nodded at castillosuggested you drive the van in the morning the van in the morning were going to move him very quietly to the gellert in the morning castillo said tell him i just put you in charge of the movement thank you very much ur gossinger tor opened a rear door of the mercedes max nearly knocking castillo off his feet jumped in and sat up on the seat jesus castillo said letting go of the leash and tossing it into the car go ahead otto ill get in front gorner started to get in the back max announced he didnt think that was the way things should be by showing a thin row of teeth and growling damn that dog gorner said and got in the front passengers seat castillo got in the back max showed he thought that was a very good idea by leaning over and lapping castillos face the gellert right ur gorner tor asked when he was behind the wheel no castillo said take us to the american embassy please gorner looked at him in surprise but didnt say anything four the embassy of the united states of america szabadsag ter budapest hungary august there was a marine sergeant on guard behind a bulletproofglass window in the lobby of the sevenstory centuryold mansion housing the united states embassy sir you cant bring a dog in here the sergeant said think of him as a friend of man like a seeing eye dog castillo replied the sergeant smiled but said sir thats the rules otto gorner watched as c g castillo slid his secret service credentials through the slot under the glass the sergeant examined them carefully then returned them why dont we get the ambassador on the horn and see if he wont make an exception for my puppy castillo asked sir the ambassadors not in the embassy well then get the duty officer down here castillo said and im going to have to speak to the ambassador so why dont you one call the duty officer and two get the ambassador on that phone for me he pointed to a telephone on the counter the marine guard picked up the change of tenor in castillos voicefrom were joking with each other to thats a command one moment sir he said and picked up his telephone the ambassador came on the line very quickly and how are you mr castillo he asked actually ive been expecting you a little bird named montvale told you i was coming and that he wants to speak to you i need a secure line sir to do just that castillo said not a problem tell the marine guard to pick up and i need a waiver sir of your nocaninesontheproperty rule youve got a dog with you yes sir a sweet puppy who whines piteously when i tie him to a fence or something and leave him the ambassador laughed okay the marine can handle that too and i need to see the man who gets his pay from langley thats not a problem at all hes probably with my duty officer waiting for you to show up so he can tell you personally that ambassador montvale wishes to speak with you two men came into the lobby through the metaldetector arch they were both in their forties and both were wearing dark gray summerweight suits that castillo suspected had come from brooks brothers i think they have both just walked into the lobby mr ambassador hand the phone to one of them the ambassador said thank you very much sir happy to be of service the ambassador said castillo handed the phone to the nearest of the two americans the ambassador he said the second man said sir the embassy has a rule about dogs max growled the second man looked very uncomfortable i have just been granted a waiver castillo said the man holding the telephone said yes sir into it a half dozen or so times then handed the phone to castillo the ambassador wishes to speak with you mr castillo yes sir castillo said into the handset if theres anything else you need mr castillo just call me thank you very much sir get the marine guard on the line please if i tell him youre to have the keys to the kingdom itll be easier thanks again sir castillo said and motioned for the guard to pick up his telephone why dont we go inside the man who had been talking to the ambassador asked gesturing to the metaldetector arch otto gorner asked with his eyes what he was supposed to do castillo making no effort to hide the gesture motioned for him to go through the metal detector and this gentleman is mr castillo the man who had talked with the ambassador asked looking at gorner this is mr smith hes with me i really have to have a name mr castillo youd really like to have a name so that you can tell ambassador montvale who i had with me thats not quite the same thing and this gentleman is mr castillo the man repeated okay so youre the resident spook i sort of thought you might be sergeant will you get the ambassador on the horn again castillo said raising his voice the two locked eyes for a moment then the man said that wont be necessary sergeant if youll follow me gentlemen please they passed through the metaldetector arch as the man castillo had decided was the cia station chief went through it the device buzzed and a red light began to flash why does that make me think youre carrying a gun so thank you metal detector for bringing that to mind an elevator took them all to the basement where the second man walked ahead of them to a heavy steel door and opened it with a key inside was a bare room with four unmarked doors leading off it mr castillo the cia man announced i have been instructed to tell you that ambassador montvale wants to talk with you as soon as possible and behind one of these doors is a secure phone castillo asked the cia man nodded okay castillo said and while im talking to montvale please get me a weapon black preferably an uzi with a spare magazine gorners eyes widened for an instant im not sure that i can do that mr castillo the cia man said you dont have a uzi provide you with a weapon you can either check that out with the ambassador or wait until i have ambassador montvale on the line and he will tell you that you can may i ask why you need a weapon no castillo said simply the two locked eyes again for a moment then the cia man took a ring of keys from his pocket and unlocked one of the steel doors it opened on a small room furnished with a table and a secretarys chair on the table were two telephonesone of them with a very heavy corda legal tablet a water glass holding half a dozen pencils and an ashtray hanging from a nail driven into a leg of the table were a dozen or more plastic bags of the sort used by grocery stores burn was printed all over them in large red letters the cia man waved castillo into the room and when castillo had sat down picked up the telephone with the heavy cord this is franklin he said i am about to hand the phone to mr castillo who has been cleared to call anywhere he handed the telephone to castillo thank you castillo said please close the door certainly and dont let the doorknob hit you in the ass if i were this guy i would now go into the commo room which is certainly behind one of those other doors put on a set of earphones turn on a recorder and listen to what this castillo character is going to talk to montvale about fuck him let him listen the only thing hes going to learn from this conversation is that i dont work for ambassador charles w montvale castillo waited fifteen seconds and then put the handset to his ear you on there franklin he asked conversationally there was no reply castillo hadnt expected one but he was doing more than giving franklin a hard time if franklin was listening and recording the conversationand the more he thought about it the more convinced he was that franklin would behe was almost certainly using one of the recorders in the commo room castillo was familiar with most of the recorders used they shared one characteristic the recordings were date and timestamped down to onetenth of a second that data could not be changed or deleted franklin therefore could not pretend if he played the recording for someoneor more likely sent it to langley or even more likely to montvale himselfthat he had not been asked if he was listening the embassy was us soil therefore the laws of the united states applied without a wiretap authorization issued by a federal judge it is a felonious violation of the united states code to record a conversation unless one of the parties to the conversation is aware that the conversation is being recorded he could of course make a written transcript of the conversation leaving out the you on there franklin that not only would look odd but he would be asked what happened to the recording itself if you are on there franklin castillo said still conversationally you should not be you are advised that this communication is classified top secret presidential and you do not have that clearance sir a male voice came on the line castillo knew it had to be whoever was in charge of the communications room my name is c g castillo get me the white house switchboard on a secure line please one moment sir white house this is the us embassy budapest the male voice said please confirm we are on a secure line confirm line is secure go ahead mr castillo the communications room man said c g castillo can you patch me through to ambassador montvale please colonel secretary hall wishes to speak with you colonel boy that news got around quick didnt it secretary hall first please on a secure line please one moment sir secretary halls secure line isaacson hey joel charley is the boss around oh he is indeed colonel isaacson said hold on charley faintly heard charley for you boss then halls reply also faint finally and then the honorable matthew hall secretary of the department of homeland security came clearly on the line hello charley where are you budapest sir you didnt go to berlin i gather he knows about that no sir why not oh i dont want to answer that how the hell can i say because i didnt want montvale ordering me around without sounding as if i am very impressed with myself hall sensing castillos hesitation added i understand you had a couple of sips at the armynavy club to celebrate your promotion obviously naylor told hall about that thank god yes sir i did hes been on the phone several times he who naylor or montvale the first time to tell me the two of you had come to an understanding okay he means montvale and that you were going to keep him in your loop the last several calls he wondered where you were since you told somebody you wouldnt be going to berlin i think by now he knows where i am sir youve spoken to him i used an air taxi with which he has a connection there was a pause after a moment hall said okay i get it and the last several times hes been very interested in explosive briefcases asked me if i had heard about them i told him i hadnt theres nothing to tell sir later joel told me tom mcguire had told him about it i understand but our mutual friend seemed very surprised that you hadnt passed this information on to him or me dick miller told him about the briefcases i told him to tell him why are we talking in verbal code on a secure line because hall thinks its entirely possible that our mutual friend has told the friendly nsa folks at fort meade that it might be a good idea to scan halls calls for names like montvale and he could easily do that the national security agency works for him no problem either with decrypting a white house secure line nsa provides the encryption code to the white house dick told me just consider that a headsup charley yes sir i will what are you doing in budapest im trying to get a source to relieve me from a promise that i wouldnt pass a list of names he gave me to anyone else castillo said im going to tell our mutual friend that when i talk to him which i will do as soon as were finished and where do you go from budapest sir do you really want to know hall perceptibly thought that over before replying no i dont you dont work for me anymore theres no reason you should tell me but charley i suspect our mutual friend is going to ask you the same question i dont work for our mutual friend either sir there was another pause before hall responded charley can you handle your arrangement with our mutual friend i really hope so sir another of our mutual friends an old friend of yours that has to be general naylor doesnt think so the way he put it was he always thought david got awful lucky with that slingshot what the hell does that mean oh david as in david and goliath sir im not going to try to bring goliath down all i want him to do is leave me alone that was jefferson daviss philosophy in the civil war he didnt want to defeat the north all he wanted was for the north to leave the south alone you know how that turned out yes sir theres one more option charley hall said prayer hall chuckled then said ill have a word with the president get him to get him off your back when castillo didnt immediately reply hall added thats my idea charley not our friends after a long moment castillo said why dont we wait and see how it goes hall didnt respond directly instead he said his tactic is going to be damning you by faint praise hes already started youre a fine young man but inexperienced you need a wise guiding hand on your shoulder to keep you from doing something impulsive and unwise hes going to keep repeating thator something like ituntil one day youre going to do something impulsive and unwise and then the president will tell you something like before you do something like that again youd better check that with monour friend and that will put you in our friends pocket when i worked for you i had one castillo replied a wise hand on my shoulder thats not true but thank you i guess im going to have to be careful not to act unwisely on an impulse thats an open offer charley nonexpiring in other words thank you castillo said very seriously and then chuckled speaking of the civil war sir you remember what lee said at appomattox court house i would rather face a thousand deaths but now i must go to treat with general grant i would rather face a thousand deaths but now i have to get our friend on the horn that made hall chuckle and then he said theres a big difference charley youre not going there with the intention of handing him your sword are you no but on the other hand i was never very good with a slingshot either hall laughed keep in touch charley i will thank you castillo tapped the telephone switch several times white house will you get me ambassador montvale please and verify that the line is secure please one moment please director montvales secure line truman ellsworth speaking colonel castillo on a secure line for director montvale the white house operator said ill take it like hell you will castillo thought he said mr ellsworth how are you colonel weve been expecting to hear from you would you take a message to ambassador montvale for me certainly please tell him that ill be in the us embassy in budapest for the next fifteen minutes if he wants to talk to me im not sure the ambassador will be available within that time frame colonel thats all the time frame i have available you understand i hope colonel that anything youd like to say to the ambassador you can say to me im calling because i understand the ambassador has a message for me youre talking about the message sent to berlin i know there was a message sent to berlin for me but i havent seen it the man who called me was unwilling to tell me what the message said only that there was a message i could have only if i went to berlin i didnt have time to do that can you give it to me i see well colonel the idea was that you would go to berlin and once youd received the ambassadors message get on a secure line at the embassy there okay well thats moot when i walked in the embassy here mr franklin gave me a similar message which is the reason i placed the call ill be available here if the ambassador becomes available in the nexthe paused and checked his watchfourteen minutes thank you very much mr ellsworth castillo tapped the switch of the telephone several times said break it down please and hung up castillo exhaled audibly then took a cigar from his briefcase and very carefully unwrapped it carefully nipped one end with a cutter and carefully lit the other end he tried to blow a smoke ring but failed thats funny this room is sealed and if the air conditioner is working i cant feel it i should have been able to blow a nice ring possibly colonel that is because youre just a little nervous david obviously managed to hit goliath junior just now probably right between the eyes but the projectile didnt blow him awayit just bounced off making goliath junior mad and when goliath junior reports what just happened to goliath senior goliath senior is going to be even angrier which is probably happening at this very moment goliath senior like everyone else on the white house secure circuit is never supposed to be more than ninety seconds from picking up the phoneand fifteen seconds is preferred it is of course possible that goliath senior was taking a leak it is far more likely that he was in his office all the time he has ellsworth answer his phone to make the point that he is too important to answer his own phone even when the president might be calling and he especially wanted to make that point to me he was going to make me wait and if i hadnt hung up when i did its more than likely that ellsworthwhen signaled to do so of coursewould have cheerfully announced well the ambassador just walked in and goliath senior would have come on the line castillo took several puffs on his cigar held the last one for a moment then very carefully tried to blow a smoke ring this time it worked he watched it until it bounced off the wall and disintegrated fuck it one of two things is going to happen goliath senior is going to call back or he isnt if he does call back let him wait for me he stood up put the cigar in his mouth opened the door and left the room why dont we go have a look at your arsenal mr franklin castillo said franklin obviously didnt like the suggestion very much but he nodded and said its one floor down are you through here i dont know colonel smoking is forbidden in the embassy the second man said colonel how did you know that what did they do put my conversation on speakers while they were eavesdropping is it castillo replied and took another puff he looked at franklin who hesitated a moment and then said this way mr castillo why dont you wait here with this gentleman castillo said to otto gorner in english ill come back and fetch you gorner nodded the weapons locker was a gray metal twodoor cabinet in a small narrow room that also held rows of gray filing cabinets each of them securely locked with steel bars and padlocks castillo idly wondered how much of the obviously classified material they held would be of real intelligence value franklin took the padlock from the door and swung the double doors open for castillo there wasnt much in it and most of what was there were ordinary american weapons ranging from m rifles to an assortment of handguns both revolvers and semiautomatics there were some odd pistols including two russian makarovs and four german walther pps castillo was familiar with both of the makarov semiautomatics and liked neither the russians had basically copied the walther when they had replaced their tokarev pistol the basic difference was a larger trigger guard on the makarov to accommodate a heavily gloved trigger finger the walthers fired a mm kurz cartridge virtually unchanged since colt had introduced it as the acp cartridge for their sort of scaleddown version of the colt acp the cartridge had never been successful in the united states but had enjoyed wide popularity in europe the reason it had not been very successful was the reason castillo disliked it it didnt have anywhere near the knockdown power of the acp there were a half dozen cardboard cartons on the floor of the locker one long rather thin one and two larger thick ones castillo picked up the long thin one and one of the thick ones and laid them atop one of the filing cabinets he opened the long thin one first it held what looked like a target pistol and indeed thats what it had been before special forces armorers had worked their magic on it years before their version of the target pistol chambered for the long rifle round was now known as the ruger mk ii suppressed just what the doctor ordered he said franklin did not seem to share castillos enthusiasm there really is no such thing as a silenced weapon for a number of reasons heavy among them the fact that almost all bullets exit the barrel at greater than the speed of sound and it is impossible to silence the noise they make when they do there are suppressed weapons the best of which make no more sound than a bb gun of these castillo thought the ruger mk ii to be among the very best the one before him looked brandnew and it looked as if it was a manufactured weapon rather than one modified by the weapons wizards at bragg castillo examined the weapon carefully and liked what he found ill take this he announced colonel there goes colonel again the sonofabitch did listen im going to have to get authority to let you take that franklin said as soon as we see what else you have well get on the horn to the ambassador castillo replied and then opened the larger box i got lucky again the box held a micro uzi submachine gun the smallest and as far as castillo was concerned the most desirable of the three variants of the uzi seeing the uzi triggered a series of connects in his brain the uzi is named after its designer lieutenant colonel uziel gal of the israeli armyconnectmy god now im a lieutenant colonelconnectgal retired and lived in philadelphia until he died a couple of years agoconnectchief inspector dutch kramer of the philly pd counterterrorism bureau told me thatconnectbetty schneider used to work for kramerconnectno she worked for captain frank obrien in intelligence and organized crimeconnectand i didnt call her before i came over here or since what the hells the matter with me well its not as if ive been sprawled in a chair watching tv and sucking on a beer ill call her the first chance i get and explain as soon as i get to the hotel shell understand he turned his attention to the micro uzi and took it from its box it looked almost brandnew castillo had had a lot of experience with the uzi in the three common variantsstandard mini and microwhich all fired the mm luger parabellum cartridge which was a much better cartridge than the mm kurz acp the standard uzi with a full magazine weighed about eight pounds just about what the standard m rifle weighed the mini uzi weighed just under six pounds about half a pound more than the car version of the m the micro weighed about three and a half pounds there was no equivalent version of the m which was one of the reasons why the micro was a favored weapon of special operators another was that it had a much higher rate of fire rounds per minute double that of the standard and rpm more than the micro in castillos mind using the micro was like having a shotgun in your hand with nowhere near the bulk weight or recoil of a gauge shotgun at the risk of repeating myself castillo said just what the doctor ordered franklin looked at him uncomfortably but didnt say anything lets go get you off hook and get the ambassador on the horn castillo said why dont we franklin said and added let me carry those for you mr castillo does he think im going to grab them and run out of the embassy thank you castillo said and ill need ammunition a couple of boxes of mm parabellum and a box of long rifle please franklin nodded went into a cabinet inside the locker and came out with the ammunition a fat man in a white shirt limp with sweat was coming heavily down the stairwell as they went up theres a call from the white house switchboard for colonel castillo mr franklin he announced in awe come into the phone room with me please mr franklin castillo said if thats who i think it is maybe we wont have to bother the ambassador we have colonel castillo on a secure line for you director montvale the white house operator announced director montvale is ready for the colonel montvale said good afternoon sir castillo said im glad i caught you colonel we seem to be having communications problems it seems that way sir sir before we get into this i have mr franklin with me who hes the cia station chief sir whats that about i need a weaponweaponssir and he seems uncomfortable giving them to me why do you need a weapon castillo didnt reply after ten seconds which seemed much longer ambassador montvale said a touch of resignation in his voice put him on the line is there a speakerphone on this castillo asked franklin theres a switch on the wall franklin said then went to it and pushed a button nathaniel franklin sir he announced do you know who i am montvale asked yes sir weve spoken before youre ambassador montvale the director yes sir would have been sufficient montvale interrupted him now theres two ways we can deal with colonel castillos request you can give him whatever he asks for or i will call the dci and in a couple of minutes he will call you and tell you to give the colonel whatever he asks for what would you like to do your permission is all i need mr ambassador franklin said thank you mr franklin nice to talk to you castillo looked at franklin and then waited until franklin had left the small room and closed the door before going on elvis has left the theater mr ambassador he said he had just enough time to decide that was a dumb thing to say when he heard montvale laugh i told you charley i can be useful he said if i had had to call john powell then the dci would want to know why you wanted his weapons i told you i was going to budapest to see if i can get my source to release me from my promise not to pass along to anyone what he gave me when i got here i learned that an attempt to kidnap him had been made i want to keep him alive i cant do that without a weapon you can protect him yourself you think ive already started getting help local help how long is this going to take getting your source to release youor refuse to release youfrom your promise several days probably you want me to tell mr franklin to help you protect this chap i think that would draw attention id rather not have to my source but thank you if you change your mind let me know yes sir i will thank you tell me about explosive suitcases in pennsylvania i told major miller to tell you about that didnt he he didnt seem to think that a possible nuclear device in a briefcase was very important sir he didnt think it was credible neither did the chief of counterterrorism of the philadelphia police department thats not the same thing as saying they dont think the threat of a small nuclear device is important you sent people up there to look into it montvale challenged the reason i sent them up there was to see where the aals got the money to buy a farm the what aals thats what the philly cops call the muslim brothers of the aariteg mosque it stands for african american lunatics not only is that politically incorrect but as i recall those lunatics were involved in the theft of the yes sir they were and thats why the philly cops and the secret servicethe secret service at my requestare keeping an eye on them id like to find out what their connection with the people who stole the wasis and you think you can investigate this matter better than the fbi i think the secret service agent i sent up therehe was an undercover cop in the mosque for several yearscan yes sir i think that all fbi involvement would do is tip them off that were watching them i hope you dont feel compelled to bring the fbi in you realize what a spot that puts me in castillo if it turns out theres something to this and i heard there was and didnt tell the fbi what id heard this is what i was afraid of when we struck our deal sir if we hadnt then i wouldnt have told you and the problem wouldnt have come up there was a perceptible pause before montvale replied on the other hand charley if we hadnt come to an accommodation youd have had to take the train to budapest not gotten to fly that airplane and you wouldnt have the weapons whatshisname is about to give you right yes sir i cant argue with that okay let me think about it i wont get the fbi involved thank you all they would do right now is get in the way at this time if i do decide they have to know ill tell you before i tell them yes sir thank you and i want to talk to the cop who was undercover in the mosque as soon as that can be arranged is that going to be a problem no sir just as soon as he gets back to washington ill have miller set up a meeting good enough good luck with your source keep me posted charley said yes sir but suspected that montvale had hung up before he had spoken the two words white house are you through see if you can get major miller at homeland securat my office please on a secure line colonel castillos secure line miller said a moment later is it smart to say colonel castillo greeted him i dont know about smart but frankly i find it a little humiliating anyway its hardly a secret all kinds of people have called obviously hoping to hear you getting promoted was just a ridiculous rumor shit what can i do for you colonel i just told montvale that i would have you set up a meeting with jack britton the minute he got back to washington therefore get in touch with jack and tell him he is to stay away from washington until i get back got it and when will that be the day after tomorrowpresuming jake arrives tomorrow morning with the gulfstreamim going to buenos aires get on the horn to alex darby at the embassy and tell him i will need a safe housethe one we used would be fine but anything will doto house an important witness a safe house and people to keep it that way ill also need a black car actually a couple of them this important witness have a name let me sit on that awhile and tell darby to find yung and have him at the safe house yung tried to call you here what did he want to tell you the ambassador in montevideo thinks lorimer was a drug dealer isnt that interesting yeah and not only that the ambassador in uruguay wants yung to pass this on to the secretary of state in confidence what do i tell him about that tell him it will hold until i see him there got it anything else as soon as i get things organized in buenos airesmaybe two days topsill come home thats it cant think of anything hows the leg improved it only hurts now ninety percent of

grave site sergeant kranzs internment did not follow the standard protocol as the immaculately turnedout officer in charge reached for the door handle at the rear of the hearse an immaculately turnedout special forces sergeant major stepped up and spoke to him with your permission sir well take it from here sergeant major john k davidson said excuse me the oic a first lieutenant said it was the first time anyone had ever interrupted his procedure the sergeant major said well take it from here another voice said do you have a problem with that lieutenant the lieutenant turned and found himself facing another green beret this one with three silver stars glistening on each of his epaulets sir the lieutenant began to protest good i didnt think there would be a problem lieutenant general bruce j mcnab said carry on sergeant major yes sir sergeant major davidson said then raised his voice slightly casket detail tenhut execute seven green berets of varying ranksincluding one

marched at funeral pace toward the open grave as the last of them passed the hearse a special forces major in a wheelchair pushed by a special forces sergeant joined the detail then several men in civilian clothing followed the wheelchair the rear was brought up after a moments indecision by the arlington national cemeterys official casket team as the column made its way through the sea of crosses and stars of david to the open grave another detail of special forces soldiers eight enlisted men under a captain relieved the eightman cemetery firing party of their weapons and ordered them to form a single rank behind the new firing party when the casket team reached the grave the casket was lowered onto the green nylon tapes of the lowering device all but two of them came to attention sergeant major davidson then handed the national colors to lieutenant general bruce j mcnab usa and corporal lester bradley usmc who placed them on the casket making sure they were stretched out level and centered over the casket then they assumed the position of attention and when sergeant major davidson gave the order the entire casket team took two steps back from the grave the green beret chaplain then led the graveside ritual prescribed for members of the lutheran faith then he stepped back from the casket and grave the captain in charge of the new firing party barked in rapid order present harms ready aim fire ready aim fire ready aim fire and then a moment later orduh harms bugler sound taps sergeant major davidson barked when the bugler was done sergeant major davidson and corporal bradley began folding the colors when they had finished the flag now folded into a crisp triangle of blue with white stars was given to lieutenant general mcnab who waited until the casket team had marched away from the grave and then presented it to sergeant kranzs sister general mcnab spoke briefly with sergeant kranzs sister then saluted her and respectfully backed away a middleaged grayhaired womanan arlington lady one of the wives of retired general officers who voluntarily appear at every funeralthen presented a card of condolence from the chief of staff of the united states army to sergeant kranzs sister offered her personal condolences and kissed her on the cheek as this was going on the special forces firing detail returned the rifles of the arlington firing detail to them then marched to the waiting line of cars on the road lined up with the escort detail they were joined by the casket detail but without general mcnab and corporal bradley who was standing beside the general bradley then followed the general and sergeant kranzs sister as the general walked with her past the linedup green berets to her limousine when he had seen sergeant kranzs sister into the limousine general mcnab stepped back and corporal lester bradley stepped up maam he said i shall treasure for the remainder of my life my privilege of having been with sergeant kranz when he fell please accept again my profound condolences on your loss when she looked at corporal bradleys youngboyishface and saw the tears in his eyes sergeant kranzs sister lost control for the first time thank you she said barely audibly then turned her face away general mcnab gently pushed corporal bradley out of the way and closed the limousine door the car then slowly pulled away at the grave the officer in charge of the burial detailwho had waited to oversee the one soldier the virgil whose job it was to remain at the grave until it was closedsaw that the green berets had decided to participate in that too a green beret sergeant first class was standing at parade rest at the head of the casket the officer in charge looked at the arlington lady whom he had seen at many another funeral and the two of them wordlessly agreed to walk together back to the waiting cars halfway there the lieutenant said well that was interesting wasnt it different lieutenant the arlington lady said my husband and i spent thirtythree years on active duty one of the few things i know for sure about the army is that special forces soldiers are indeed interesting and different two office of organizational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august major h richard miller jr his tunic unbuttoned and necktie pulled down sat at the desk of the chief of the office of organizational analysis with his leg resting on an open drawer of the ornate desk there was a glass dark with whiskey on the desk and a capped plastic vial of medicine issued by the pharmacy of the walter reed army medical center he knew what the label on the medicine vial warned about taking alcohol after taking one or two tablets as necessary for pain but he picked up the vial and read it again anyway when it doubt do both he said aloud he pried the lid open shook out two white tablets and put them in his mouth then he picked up the whiskey glass raised it and said mud in your eye seymour you little shit vaya con dios buddy then he drank half of it and set the glass on the desk he looked at the whiskey glass for a moment then picked it up again and drained it the instant he set the glass very carefully on the green blotter of the desk pad a light flashed on one of the telephones on the desk he looked at it wondered if he could ignore it then reached for it miller he said major there are two gentlemen to see you mr agnes forbison said this is a really bad time is this important i think youd better see them give me ninety seconds miller said he put the telephone back in its cradle then wincing with the pain lifted his leg off the open drawer and carefully lowered it onto the floor he then put the whiskey glass and the bottle of famous grouse into the drawer then closed it again wincing with the pain it caused he shifted his body so that he could get the vial of painkillers into his trousers pocket finally he pulled up his necktie and buttoned his uniform tunic almost immediately there was a discreet knock at the office door come sergeant major john k davidson and corporal lester bradley usmc marched into the office stopped twelve inches from the desk and saluted good evening sir davidson barked millerin perhaps a pavlovian reflexreturned the salute jack its been a bad day and im not drunk enough to be amused whats on your mind sir the sergeant major has come to enlist what sir i have a permission to enlist note from my daddy davidson said he took a half step forward laid a small sheet of paper on the desk then stepped back and resumed the position of attention miller picked up the piece of paper saw it was general officers notepaper and read it august chief office of organizational analysis washington i will defer to your judgment as to where sgtmaj davidson will be of the greatest value to the service mcnab miller looked up at davidson and saw that he and bradley were still standing at attention i told you jack miller said i am not in a mood to be amused davidson didnt move stand at ease goddamn it miller said davidson relaxed you want to enlist in what miller asked oh come on i know whats going on here dick whats going on here is classified top secret presidential miller said so vic dallessando said and the pride of the jarheads here has he also been running off at the mouth only after vic told him to fill me in on the details before that lester was like a clam how did you get this out of general mcnab miller asked waving the sheet of notepaper i reminded him that charcolonel castillowas going to need a replacement for kranz and that we were going to have to find a better place to hide lester mackall wasnt hacking that the jarheads going through the q course were already getting curious thats all and that id been around the block with charley a couple of times and knew when he had to have someone sit on him thats all miller asked again miller happened to be glancing at bradley and saw on his face that there was indeed something else well i told mcnab that i was getting so tired of camp mackall that i was giving serious thought to taking my retirement davidson admitted you had the balls to threaten mcnab that was more like a statement of fact dick davidson said miller saw on bradleys face that he was shocked to hear sergeant major davidson address a major by his first name what do you think charleys going to say davidson asked inasmuch as colonel castillo is unable to accept that there are times when he should indeed be restrained from an impulsive act and that he knows you are one of the very few people who have proved themselves willing and able to restrain him the colonels reaction to being informed that you want to join his merry little band is almost certainly going to be not only no but hell no davidson exhaled audibly i could be useful dick and you know it could you talk to him i could but that would be what is known as pissing into the wind miller said and then articulated what he had been thinking what were going to do is present him with the fait accompli when he gets to buenos aires hes going to find you there we are going to suggest implyanything but outright boldfaced liethat this is another brainstorm of lieutenant general bruce j mcnab thanks dick davidson said simply hell accept that it wont be the first time the general has sent me to try to keep a tight rein on him how do you think we should handle corporal big mouth miller asked looking at bradley hide him in plain sight davidson said at the embassy in buenos aires one of the reasons castillo brought him here was because he knew the gunnery sergeant of the guard detachment there was going to want to know what hes been up to and wasnt going to back off until bradley told him i know a master gunnery sergeant named macnamara at eighth and eyemarine corps headquarters i know where it is miller said hes a heavy hitter in force recon lester said if he got on the horn to the gunnery sergeant in argentina and told him to ask no questions he would ask no questions what are you going to tell your friend about why you want him to make that call ill tell him i cant tell him hell go along and if he doesnt lets not cross that bridge until we get there see if you can get him on the horn now if you can tell him to come here well dazzle him with charleys office and my class a uniform and see what happens davidson nodded you pack a suitcase miller asked davidson nodded again okay if your master gunnery sergeant will go along well get you both on a flight out of miami tomorrow night three danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary august lieutenant colonel castillohalf asleepbecame aware that something wet and cold was pressing against his face the first thing he thought was that he had drooled on his pillow then rolled over onto the wet spot this happened to him every once in a while and he hated it telling himself that he couldnt be held responsible for drooling while he was asleep didnt help any more than applying the same logic to what was euphemistically known as nocturnal emissions it was embarrassing annoying and even shameful age seemed to have dealt with the nocturnal emission problem but drooling remained a real pain in the ass he put his hand out to push himself away from the wet spotand suddenly was wide awake his heart jumping there was something warm firm and hairy in bed with him in the same split instant he became aware of a deep growl max you sonofabitch how did you get in bed max growled againbut not at castillo he had left max in billy kocians bedroom presuming max would prefer sleeping in thereon a huge fluffy dog bed on the floor next to kocians enormous antique canopied bedinstead of here in another bedroom castillo had felt like an intruder a voyeur in kocians apartment especially the bedroom but curiosity had overwhelmed those feelings and he and otto gorner had spent a half hour in the huge highceilinged rooms examining the photos on the walls and furniture there were all sorts of photographs some of which were obviously of kocians family and many of what obviously had become kocians second family the von und zu gossingers there were several of castillos grandfather and kocian together in uniform and more of the former herr oberst in shabby civilian clothing apparently taken right after the second world war there were others as castillo remembered him elegantly tailored in kocians bedroom there had been a photograph on the bedside table of a young girl in braids and a nearadolescent boy holding kocians handcastillos mother and his uncle willi there had been others of kocian and otto gorner the walls and furniture had held framed photographs at various places of karl wilhelm von und zu gossingeraged three five seven tenholding his mothers hand there had been several of carlos guillermo castillo as a skinny boy scout as a teenager on a horse at hacienda san jorge wearing a fartoolarge cowboy hat as cadet sergeant c g castillo of the corps of cadets of the united states military academy and as second lieutenant castillo with justawarded distinguished flying cross bronze star and purple heart medals dangling from the breast of his tunic and more than a dozen photographs of women ranging from in their twenties to middle age they had been obviously important to kocian if not important enough for him to have married them castillo had left kocians bedroom feeling sad almost to the point of tears the old man had to be lonely no wonder that he was bananas about max max gave him the only love he had in his life castillo patted max and was surprised at how tenseactually he was quiveringthe dogs body was and he realized the dog was still growling softly deep in his throat hey pal whats the matter max who had been lying next to castillo suddenly got half to his feet and slinked off the bed castillos heart jumped again he sat up there was just enough light for castillo to be able to see max stalking across the floor toward the door leading to the sitting room hes like a lion a panther stalking its prey castillo rolled on his side far enough so that he could slide open the drawer of the bedside table his fingers found the suppressed ruger pistol he quickly chambered a round then sat up pushing back on the bed until his back was resting against the headboard its probably otto looking for a glass of water or another dog maybe somebody cleaning the corridor outside the apartment calm down for christs sake max was now crouched but no longer growling there was a squeak what the hell is that the door swung open quickly and two men jumped into the room in crouching positions both held madsen submachine guns at the ready max leaped at the first one locking his massive jaws on the mans arm the man yelped in surprise and pain the second pointed his madsen at max without thinking what he was doing castillo raised the rugerin both hands and fired instinctivelytwice as are flex actionat the second man the suppressed muzzle made a soft tuttut sound then without waiting to see if he had hit the second man castillo fired at the first tuttut and then he looked back at the second man he was now sliding limply down the doorframe tuttut castillos eyes and the ruger went back to the first man who was now sitting down it looked as if max was about to drag him somewhere tuttut the rugers magazine had held ten long rifle cartridges castillo had subconsciously counted as he had fired he had two rounds left he leaped out of the bed and ran to the dresser where he had left the micro uzi its magazine was fully charged and he could get it much quicker than he could charge the rugers magazine the extra cartridges for which he had put in the same drawer as the uzi he grabbed the uzi and dropped to the floor pulling the action lever back and then rolling over twice before sitting up with the uzi pointed at the door there was no burst of gunfire max trotted over and licked castillos face castillo felt tear swelling you big sonofabitch he said i love you too he got to his feet and went to the men in the door the one max had grabbed was on his back openmouthed staring at the ceiling with unseeing eyes castillo could see no entrance wounds the second man was sitting in the doorway there were two small holes in his forehead and a third next to his nose castillos heart jumped again and he felt a chill jesus christ otto he ran across the living room to the second guest room put his hand on the doorknob then pushed it open quickly and jumped inside holding the micro uzi in both hands there was just enough light to make out the bed he fumbled on the wall inside the door until he found the light switch and tripped it for a moment the body on the bed didnt moveoh shit not another garroting not ottoand then otto sat up what the hell gorner grumbled what are you doing with that gun you better get up otto castillo said theres a problem a problem what kind of a problem youd better get up otto castillo repeated then went quickly through the living room to the door to the corridor there was a man downone of the security people from the tages zeitungsprawled on his back by the door to the stairway his pistol was lying on the carpet castillo ran to him saw his bulged eyes and blue skin then the bluedsteel garrote around his neck he ran back into the apartment found his swiss army knife in his suitcase and ran back into the corridor he managed with great difficulty to trip the lever locking the garrote but when it was free he decided that it had been an exercise in futility this guy is dead he looked down at the mans face there was no sign of life what the hell he pressed with all his weight on the mans abdomen and felt the expulsion of air from the mans lungs but there was no sign of breathing castillo inhaled deeply then bent over the man pinched his nostrils closed and exhaled into his mouth there was no reaction castillo pressed on the mans abdomen again and sensed again an expulsion of air and then there was a sucking sensation a small short suck then another a little greater and then all at once a large intake of air and a gasping groan i have absolutely no idea what to do now the man thrashed around clawing at his throat just breathe thats all just lie there and breathe castillo ordered it sounded as if the man was trying to say something castillo sensed someone behind him and quickly reached for the micro uzi ill call for the police and an ambulance otto gorner said softly no police no ambulance castillo said get sandor tor over here gorner looked as if he was going to argue but then said my cellulars next to my bed and went back into the apartment the security man tried to sit up castillo pushed him back down stay there he said help is on the way four danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary august what did you shoot them with sandor tor asked he was squatting beside the second intruder who was sitting against the doorframe castillo said a pistol you are either a fool or have a lot of faith in your marksmanship tor said where is it on the dresser in my bedroom castillo said and pointed tor walked to the bedroom castillo followed him tor picked up the pistol okay he said a silenced pistol suppressed castillo corrected him without thinking very few newspaper publishers know the difference much less how to use one of thesecertainly not as well as you did if youre waiting for me to respond to that dont hold your breath castillo said another burly middleaged hungarian came into the bedroom he carried a tenliter red plastic gas can castillo saw that he was wearing rubber gloves theres two more of these in the stairwell the burly hungarian announced tor nodded does that suggest anything to you ur gossinger tor asked plan c castillo said if they couldnt snatch ur kocianplan aor something went wrong and they had to kill himplan bthen they were going to torch the place in the hope that it would destroy ur kocians files you think they thought ur kocian was here otherwise they would have gone to the telki private hospital i think they were watching this place and saw the lights in the apartment and decided he was here maybe they saw max on the balcony when he didnt take his usual midnight stroll they decided to come after him certainly they knew he was in the telki private hospital tor argued why would they think he was here but they didnt know how badly he was hurt it made more sense for them to come here in case he was here than to try a snatch at the hospital where he might not be tor looked at castillo carefully for a long moment then turned to the man holding the gas can rakosi leave us alone for a minute please he said see if you can find anything in their pockets see if we can tie them to a car anywhere around here i saw an uzi in the sitting room rakosi questioned tor looked at castillo who after a moments hesitation nodded tor waved his hand at rakosi ordering him out of the room then he walked to the door and closed it ur gossinger we are both very concerned about ur kocians safety i can do my job better if i am not in the dark he paused and waited until he understood castillo was not going to reply then went on forgive an old policeman for not believing you are who you say you are ur gossinger well he had to be told sooner or later im an american intelligence officer the nod tor made automatically told castillo he wasnt surprised cia castillo shook his head no sandor tor visibly didnt believe that and what is your interest in ur kocian right now to keep him alive castillo said and then gesturing for tor to follow him added come with me please castillo led him into kocians bedroom and pointed to the photograph of eric kocian holding his mothers and his uncle willis hands thats my mother as a girl and he went on pointing to the pictures of him holding his mothers hand thats her as a young woman and me as a boy tor looked at the photographs then at castillo and pointed to the photo of castillo with the newly awarded medals on his tunic and you were a soldier so was i i am a soldier lieutenant colonel i suppose that would explain the marksmanship tor said but this raises more questions than it answers when there is time i will try to answer those questions but for now my government is interested in what ur kocian has learned about the oilforfood scandal enough obviously for those involved to send these scumbags to kill him first to find out how much he knows and then to kill him he told me that the night they tried to kidnap him on the bridge tor said he tell you anything else he said he had files here in the apartment did he say where tor shook his head he said he didnt want me to know well he can tell us in the morning and how are we going to protect him after that in my business there are times when you have to trust your gut feeling about somebody castillo said and tell him things that just might come around and bite you on the ass i know tor said simply and what is your gut feeling about me in a couple of hours an airplane will land at ferihegy airport after we get ur kocian out of the hospital here and he has his files im going to take him to argentina in it argentina is halfway around the world tor said it must be quite an airplane a gulfstream iii castillo furnished tor nodded his recognition of the airplane why not to the united states two reasons one that ur kocian doesnt want to go to the states and two i think were going to find what were looking for in southern south america and maybe three i think i can protect him better there than i could in the states that doesnt seem reasonable i think i may be able to get word to whoever is trying to get to ur kocian that it no longer makes sense to try to get his information or kill him because the information is now in my hands i will ensure that ur kocian gets safely from the hospital to here and then to the airport castillo said what would it take to get you to come to argentina with us tor met castillos eyes you would not have to ask permission to do something like that tor said castillo shook his head will you come with us of course what are we going to do about the police castillo said nothing if my people can find their carand i think they will be able towe will put the bodies in it take it into the woods and burn the car with them in it and thatll be the end of it we will hope so five danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary august why does finding you awake and dressed at ohdarkhundred and with an uzi on the coffee table make me uncomfortable charley colonel jake torine asked as he and fernando lopez walked into the living room and then as max trotted in showing his teeth he exclaimed jesus christ theyre good guys max castillo said in hungarian down max walked to where castillo was sitting and lay down at his feet what is that a hungarian great dane torine asked where did he come from hes billy kocians what happened to his head we have problems jake we have to go wheelsup as soon as possible charley we just flew here from baltimore with only a piss stop at frankfurt what kind of problems gringo fernando lopez asked the bad guys tried to kidnap billy kocian max grabbed the arm of one of them and the bad guy clobbered him with his pistol whereupon another bad guy shot billy twice luckily not bad were getting him out of the hospital right about now as soon as he shows me where his files are were going back to the airport why the hurry getting him out of here is the best way i can think of to keep him alive he wouldnt be safe here fernando asked at least for eight hours so we can get some sleep christ there were half a dozen of what i presume are hungarian rentacops in the lobby and four more when we got off the elevator you can sleep as long as you want to and then catch a plane home castillo said jake and i have to get billy out of budapest you really think theyll try something again torine asked they already did castillo said two of them came in here at half past one and fernando asked max woke me up i took them out you took them out torine repeated castillo nodded jesus christ torine said i didnt have any choice jake and are there going to be complications from that the local cops for example i dont think so are you all right gringo fernando asked im fine castillo said and turned to torine if you get the gulfstream in the air jake i can steer while you take a nap torines face showed he was less than enthusiastic about that idea i wouldnt ask you to do this unless i thought it was really necessary castillo said torine shrugged i penciled in a flight plan to buenos aires on the way over he said budapest dakar and across the drink to recife brazil then down to buenos aires its about six hours from here to dakar figuring two fuel stops at an hour each and fifteen hours in the air give or take if we leave here at say eight we should be in buenos airestheres a fourtimezone differencewe should be in ba before midnight thatll work fernando said we can take turns sleeping one of us on one of the couches the other in the right seat youre not going castillo said youre going home commercial ill go home commercial from buenos aires fernando said not open for discussion who alls going torine asked besides kocian billy me a guy named sandor tor and max and sandor tor is torine asked billys bodyguard and a good one he knows whats going on castillo nodded the dog is going fernando asked absolutely castillo said ill call for the weather torine said somebody order up some breakfast andcan we do this charleysome in flight rations six danubius hotel gellert szent gellert ter budapest hungary august eric kocian visibly in a foul mood was rolled into his apartment in a wheelchair by sandor tor he was accompanied by three security guards and dr czerny czerny the reason for kocians foul mood had made his personal approval of where kocian would be resting in bed a condition to discharge the old man from the hospital castillo wondered if czernys concern was based on friendship for the old man or was a manifestation of his professional concern for kocians health and when the doctor came out of kocians bedroom castillo took him aside and told him that he planned to leave budapest immediately if kocians physical condition would make that possible ordinarily id say no czerny replied but i knowtor told menot only what happened on the bridge but what happened here earlier this morning so with my priority being keeping my patient alive i prescribe getting him as far away from budapest as possible as quickly as possible thats what im thinking castillo said i think itll be a day or two before these people realize hes gone and there will be no recordno airline tickets no rail tickets etceterato give them an idea where he might be im hoping they think vienna or fulda dr czerny nodded his agreement czerny said i just wish those bedlike seats on airplanes were really beds what he should be doing is lying down there are real bedsactually coucheson the airplane where he could lie down and be strapped in that is if i can get him to lie down much less get him to allow me to strap him down dr czerny reached in his pocket and came out with a plastic vial give him one of these airsickness pills in ten minutes hell get drowsy and if he wont take one break open the capsule and mix the powder with anything hell drink three minutes after dr czerny had checked kocian a final timeto make sure he was in bed in his pajamasand had given castillo a package of bandages and medicines and then left the apartment and as castillo was wondering how soon he could get kocian to dress kocian appeared in the sitting room awkwardly trying to button the sleeves of his shirt castillo went to help him what times the plane kocian demanded casually just as soon as we can get your files and to the airport have you thought about argentine regulations about taking a dog into their country kocian asked and when he saw the look on castillos face added i didnt think you would have karlchen i have looked into the matter what we have to do is go to dr kincsmaxs veterinarianand get a certificate of health and a copy of his inoculations record can we send tor ill call and find out kocian said five minutes later tor was on his way to the veterinarians office what about your files eric castillo asked after tor had left oh yes those kocian replied and walked over to a bookcase he took a book from the shelf and handed it to castillo castillo had read the book titleot pervovo litsa first persona collection of interviews with russian president vladimir putin that putin authorized to be published as a sortof autobiography castillo looked quesioningly at kocian you cant judge a book by its cover karlchen castillo opened the book it had been carefully hollowed out enough to hold a black leatherandchrome object a half inch thick three inches wide and nine inches long castillo knew what it was a stateoftheart external hard drive for a computer eighty gigabytes kocian said those japanese are really clever arent they karlchen the japanese are good at making things but this technology came out of las vegas nevada castillo said not japan and how do you know that because aloysius francis casey of the afc corporation who came up with the technology sent me a prototype ive got it in my briefcase one hundred twenty gigs would you like to see it that wont be necessary everythings in here just about i have a few tidbits between my ears is it encrypted kocian nodded microsoft encryption kocian nodded again well see if you can remember the key while i go get my hard drive you want to see this now kocian asked surprised i want to copy it to my hard drive and then encrypt it with another little gift from mr casey there are a lot of people many of them unfriendly who know how to get around mr gatess encryption technology so far as i know nobodys ever been able to crack the afc encryption logarithm youre serious arent you karl castillo picked up on that im not karlchen right now the old man is impressed absolutely castillo said have you got another hard drive a spare you mean castillo nodded why because what i really would like to do just as soon as i get this data off your drive and properly reencrypted is put it on another drive and send that in the diplomatic pouch to the united states in case something happens to our copies kocian considered that and nodded theres a store across the river which sells them he said theyre expensive can we send somebody to buy one kocian nodded again shall i have it put on my tages zeitung american express card or are you going to pay for it better yet well have the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund pay for it castillo said will this store take dollars probably at a very bad rate of exchange get one of the security guys in here you tell him what store and ill tell him to get a receipt castillo said and took a wad of currency from his pocket you going to tell me what that fundthe lorimer charitable and whatever fundis all about on the way to buenos aires theres no time now castillo carefully pried the portable hard drive from the pages of ot pervovo litsa then connected it to his laptop computer okay eric its hooked up let me have the password you trust that machine i wont erase your data until im sure its in here castillo said but yeah i trust it i put a lot of time and effort into whats in there kocian said id hate to lose it not as much as i would castillo said and therefore i am going to be very careful lets have the password kocian gave it to him then added never in my worst nightmares did i see myself as a lackey of the cia castillo entered the password decrypted the data on kocians hard drive then transfered it to his when he saw that was working he said i dont work for the cia eric so you say but if you did you wouldnt say you did would you probably not castillo said kocian elected to change the subject i really hate to destroy any book he said but i had seen all the spy movies on the tv and hiding the hard drive in a book seemed like a good idea and ot pervovo litsa was a garbage book he paused then added full of bullshit like the dispatches from washington you send all the time is he trying to piss me off or do my paraphrases from the american conservative really offend his sense of journalistic integrity castillo said you dont think mr putin told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to those reporters you read it castillo nodded in russian or the translation in russian then you will recall he told one journalist that practically right out of university he went in the kgb and learned his craft by suppressing dissident activities in leningrad that i believe i also believe that his father was a cook first to the czarswhere he cooked for rasputinand then to the bolsheviks most significantly lenin himself and then in one of stalins dachas outside moscow as he told other russian journalists he also said that his father served with the red army during the great patriotic war he was a little vague about what his poppa did in uniform castillo nodded he dropped his eyes to his laptop and saw that the transfer of files procedure was just about finished he held up his hand to signal kocian that he needed a moment and then typed in the encryption code kocian waited until castillo raised his eyes to him and then went on do you think that putins father spent that time boiling beets for the red army in some field mess or is it more likely that putins fatherwhom the regime trusted enough to let him cook for stalinserved as a political officer making sure no officer strayed from the path of righteousness good point whatever he did it made poppa an important apparatchik important enough to get his son into law school at leningrad state university and then into the kgb where he promptly began to suppress the local dissidents then he told another socalled journalist he was next assigned to east germany to a minor administrative position i wondered about that castillo said do you think having learned how to suppress russian dissidents that the kgb might have had him doing the same thing in east germany which of course he would like to keep quiet castillo said in the interests of friendship between the russian president and a nowreunited germany think about it karl after serving in a minor administrative position in the kgb in east germany he went back to leningrad state university if we are to believe what he told these reporters where he worked in the international affairs section of the university reporting to the vice rector do you suppose he got that job because he was such a good student the first time he was there or becausehaving been all the way to east germanyhe was an expert in international affairs or maybe because the kgb wanted somebody with experience in suppressing dissidence suppressing dissidence at the university where are you going with this eric castillo asked softly kocian held up a hand signaling him to wait and then went on after a year of thatin if memory serves and it usually doesputin was put in charge of the international committee of the leningrad kommandaturaexcuse me lenin no longer being an official saint of russia leningrad was saint petersburg once again that made it the international committee of saint petersburg kommandatura where he handled international relations and foreign investments to show that he had put all the evil of the soviets behind him mr putin resigned from the kgb two months after getting that job correct me if you think im wrong but if he resigned from the kgb in wouldnt that suggest he was in the kgb until i mean how can you resign from something you dont belong to castillo chuckled but didnt reply would you be cynical enough to think karl that the man in charge of foreign investments in saint petersburg would be in a position to skim a little off the top and spread it around among what in the former regime had been deserving apparatchiks that evil thought might occur to me castillo said okay what else well he did such a good job building foreign goodwill and attracting foreign investment that putin suddenly found himself first deputy chairman of the whole city of saint petersburg and soon after that he was summoned to moscow where he served in what he told the reporters who interviewed him were various positions under boris yeltsin what they were was not mentioned a cynical man might suspect this was because he might have been involved again with the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti otherwise known as the kgb castillo said and laughed or the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti fsb castillo said still chuckling the federal security service of the russian federation kocian finished nodding which replaced the evil kgb and of which putin became head and remained head until he assumed his present role as an international statesman you think he was personally involved in the oilforfood scam eric up to his skinny little ass kocian said bitterly both as a source of money for the fsb and personally can you prove it kocian shook his head but im working on it i think i may be getting close to getting something i can print you think he knows that we have more spies per square meter in budapest than vienna and berlin did in their heyday of course he knows and the people who tried to whack you they were spetsnaz sent by the fsb whack meaning kidnap or assassinate assassinate kidnap is grab or simply kidnap kocian nodded maybe but i dont think so they werent russian they were german which makes me think they were sent by the ksb the ksb is too smart to send spetsnaz they might be identified and putin wouldnt like that more than likely as we were discussing yesterday former east german stasi what about the people whowhat was that word you used whacked i like itwhacked mr lorimer they were professionals castillo said no identification on them they had swedish madsen submachine guns the cia guys in montevideo and buenos aires are trying to identify them i dont think were going to get lucky they could be stasi or not if youre really not cia karl how do you know what the cia is doing or for that matter that theyd tell you the truth about what theyre doing or have found out castillo didnt immediately reply then he said i work for the president eric directly castillo nodded and hes ordered the agencyand everybody else in the intelligence communityto tell me anything i want to know and give me whatever i ask for kocian met his eyes for a moment then nodded then pointed at castillos laptop either your encryption process is awfully slow or your machine is not working its a little slow but very good he looked at the screen ninetyone percent encrypted well while were waiting ill get packed its winter in argentina now right yeah but dont put on long underwear we have to go to equatorial africa before we go to south america it was a little after twelve before all the errands had been run and they made their way to ferihegy international airport castillo didnt think it would be likely that anyone would be looking for billy kocian at the airport or keeping the gulfstream under observation but he decided nevertheless that the smart way to get the old man on the airplane was to take him there in an unmarked van from the tages zeitung with a little bit of luck he and sandor tor could rush kocian up the steps and get him and max aboard unnoticed while the luggage and in flight rations were being loaded just before they went to the airport castillo had kocians mercedes brought to the loading dock in the basement of the gellert with one of the tages zeitung security men at the wheel and another behind the darkened windows in the backseat the car took off for vienna there was no way of telling of course if the bastards who had tried to whack kocian were surveilling the gellert but if they were they just might follow the mercedes they might also try something with the car once it was on the highway castillo almost hoped they would he had given the security men the madsens the stasior whoever the hell the bastards werehad brought to the hotel to use on kocian and he hadnt had to show them how to use them as the mercedes pulled away from the loading dock they had shaken hands with otto gorner who was going to stay in budapest for at least a day before returning to fulda and then gotten in the van billy kocian surprising castillo had not objected to traveling in the van and surprised him again once they were aboard the gulfstream by taking without question the airsick pill dr czerny had provided deceiving the old man had made castillo feel a little ashamed jake torine and fernando lopez who had ridden to the airport in a taxi came up the stair door two minutes after the van had driven off everything okay charley torine asked if youve filed the flight plan and remembered to get the weather it is there is one small problem fernando said which is i know american express boasts that theres no spending limit fernando said but what happens if they err on the side of caution and call the office and ask if i really filled the tanks on this thing in baltimore frankfurt and then here theyre used to charges for fueling the lear not a gulfstream and not in europe and not nearly as much fuel theyre liable to suspect that somebodys using my amex numbers shit castillo said good point well the damage is done from here on well use my card and then when we get to buenos aires ill call dick and have him write a check on the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund to your account at american express i think we ought to do something fernando said agreed castillo said jake do you want me to sit in the right seat now and take over once were wheelsup i want you to sit in the left seat now torine said preliminary flight instruction will begin immediately ferihegy departure control clears gulfstream threesevenniner for takeoff climb to flight level thirtyone thousand on a course of twothreefive degrees contact zagreb area control on twothreethreepointfive when passing through twenty thousand threesevenniner understands number one to go torine replied climb to thirtyone thousand on twothreefive report to zagreb area control on twothreethreepointfive when passing through twenty thousand affirmative castillo pushed the throttles forward threesevenniner rolling torine reported thank you then he switched to intercom presuming you can steer it down the runway torines voice came over castillos earphones ill tell you when to rotate and then when to get the gear up seven yoff international airport dakar senegal august max stood beside castillo as he opened the stair door and the moment it had extended pushed castillo aside and bounded down the stairs startling more than a little the senegalese airport authorities who had come to meet the gulfstream max took a quick look around then headed for the nose gear where he raised his leg and voided his bladder it was an impressive performance in terms of both volume and duration then he looked around again saw where the setting sun had cast a shadow to one side of the aircraft trotted to it and vacated his bowels in another impressive performance then he returned to the stair door and looked up at it his posture suggesting well im finished what are you waiting for billy kocian came down the stairs both regally and carefully he was wearing his widebrimmed panama hat and a white linen suit the jacket was draped rakishly over his shoulder and the arm he carried in a sling his free hand held his cane like a swagger stick he looked at the airport authorities nodded and said in hungarian good god its hot how long do we have to stand here in the sun in whatever obscure developing country we find ourselves castillo thought well theres now no question in the minds of the customs guys who owns this airplane were in dakar senegal castillo replied in hungarian unless im mistaken that bus will take us to the transient lounge he pointed to a peugeot van do you suppose it has airconditioning or is that too much to expect kocian asked and walked to the bus sandor tor came down the stairs and followed kocian max trotted after them jake torine came down the stairs carrying the aircrafts documents and then fernando lopez exited i hate to tell you this gringo lopez said but that landing was a greaser a greaser for my very first touchdown it was magnificent you and i will fly across the drink fernando torine said there is nothing more dangerous in the sky than a pilot who thinks he really knows how to fly eight carrasco international airport montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august legal attache david w yung jr was in a strange goodalmost euphoricmood as the policia federal helicopter carrying him cultural attache robert howell assistant legal attache julio artigas and chief inspector jose ordonez came in for a landing at the military side of the airport it was an almost complete turnaround of feelings from when hed gotten on the same ancient and battered huey at eight that morning for the flight to estancia shangrila in tacuarembo province then he had been very worried he had just about convinced himself that the whole thing was going to blow up in his face and god only knew what that would mean either to the mission ordered by the presidential finding or to david w yung jr personally and he hadnt been the only one worrying that he was about to fuck up spectacularly he could tell that howell and artigas were watching him almost as closely as was ordonez that hadnt happened he hadnt done anything stupid even though on the flight to the estancia he had wallowed in the discomfiting thought that while he had conducted a great many interrogations himself this was the first time he had been onand all day would continue to be onthe receiving end of an interrogation conducted by an interrogator as skilledperhaps better skilledin that art as he was and since he was lying through his teethand had very little experience doing thatthe odds were that he had already said something had revealed something that he shouldnt have and if he hadnt that would happen before the day was over that hadnt happened either there had been three police vehiclestwo cars and a small vanparked in front of the estancia and as the helicopter approached a half dozen policemen came out from under the shielded veranda of the house to watch the helo land and there was another man a burly middleaged uruguayan wearing a suit jacket and tie and gaucho pants stuffed into red rubber boots he knew that had to be ricardo montez the manager of the estancia early in the assault montez had been tied blindfolded and tranquilized by one of castillos green berets but there was still a very good chance that he would somehow recognize yung or at least eye him suspiciously which of course would immediately be picked up by ordonez that hadnt happened when ordonez introduced them to montez and the police as representatives of the us embassy and said they had come to have a look at the crime site and to begin the process of protecting the late senor lorimers property there had been not even a glimmer of recognition ordonez gave them a guided tour of the crime scene beginning by showing the americans the chalk body outlines indicating where two of what everyone was now calling the ninja had fallen on the veranda next ordonez showed them the chalk body outline of the ninja who had fallen just inside the front door yung had been more than a little surprised at his reaction to that onevirtually nonealthough hed killed that ninja himself taking him down with two quick shots as he had been trained to do at the fbi school at quantico it was the first time since hed been in the fbi that hed ever taken his pistol from its holster with any prospect at all of having to use it what the hell is wrong with me am i a coldblooded killer remembering suddenly that he was still carrying his pistol had caused another moment of anxiety i havent even cleaned it not smart yung christ if ordonez gets his hands on my pistol they can match it to the slugs in the ninja i took down proof that not only was i involved in this but that i killed that man the anxiety hadnt lasted long calm down you have diplomatic immunity ordonez cant even ask for the pistol next came the chalk body outline in lorimers office showing where lorimer had fallen that produced virtually no reaction either although it did trigger a sharp and very unpleasant memory of lorimers body in the morgue refrigerator in the british hospital in montevideo the previous afternoon a uruguayan pathologist who spoke english like the queen had pulled lorimers naked body from its shelf in the cooler and unceremoniously pulled the sheet from it just going through the motions you know the pathologist had said conversationally either of the bullets in the poor chaps brain would have killed him instantly but the chief inspector said he wanted a full autopsy so i did one he had gestured at the corpse a full autopsy had apparently required that a large incisionsort of a flapbe made in the body from the upper chest to the groin it had been sewn shut some what crudely so had the incisions made in lorimers face and skull the bullets in his head had made large exit wounds and the skull was deformed ordonez next showed them where the other three ninja had fallen outside the house two of them ordonez said to bursts of mm rifle fire probably from an m firing on full automatic close up one of the bodies had five wounds the other three the third had died of a mm bullet to the forehead that body ordonez said also had stab wounds suggesting there had been handtohand combat before he was killed by a bullet yung who had searched all the bodies and then photographed and fingerprinted them right after the firefight could only hope he was making the right facial expressions and asking the right kind of questions as he learned this for the first time by the time ordonezwatching all of them closely to see their reactionshad finished his guided tour of the main house and the grounds immediately outside and the field where hed found the skid marks of the bell ranger yung felt a good deal less nervous he felt that hed handled himself well a fourhour search of the house had turned up nothing useful which was not surprising since immediately after the firefight castillo had quickly gathered up everything he thought might be usefulincluding the entire contents of the safeand loaded it on the ranger that material including an encrypted address book was now being evaluated in washington and of course ordonezs men had conducted their own search of the house if they had found anything interesting ordonez wasnt saying most of the search was spent going through lorimers rather large library one book at a time to see if he had hidden something in the books or in the bookcase and going through his closets and bureaus all that turned up was proof that lorimer had spent a lot of money on luxury clothing onan impulse thinking of the crudely sewn corpse in the british hospital yung took a louis vuitton suitcase from a shelf and put in it a nearly black custommade italian suit handmade hungarian shoes and a shirt socks and underwear all silk and all bearing labels sulka rue de castiglione paris what the hell are you doing howell asked softly taking this stuff to the undertakers in montevideo why the last time i saw lorimerwe saw himhe was naked so what theres not going to be an opencasket viewing wholl know i will yung youre something howell said he said it with admiration yung had thought of the admiration in howells voice on the flight back to montevideo and of other things artigas no longer thinks of me as a jerk either i told myself i didnt give a damn what the other fbi guys thought of me before all this happened i was doing my job and doing it well even if i couldnt let them know but i guess the truth is i did mind and now after im gone instead of remembering me as the little chink who was a flaming pain in the ass theyll wonder artigas wont tell them what he suspects happened at the estancia but they will all conclude that i was somehow involved in something important that they dont know about and castillo too he didnt make much of a secret that he thought i was some sort of fbi goodygoody the only reason he sent me back down here is that i was the only one who could hide the tracks of that sixteen million he made off with but he was right about that too i can never go back to the fbi they gave me sort of a pass on being close to howard kennedy before he changed sides sending me to uruguay for the state department but they wont give me another pass after this theyre going to want to know everything i know about castillo and since i wontcouldnt even if i wanted totell them anything about a presidential finding mission thatll be it i really would like castillo said wind up investigating parking meter fraud in kansas for the rest of my career working for castillothe office of organizational analysisnow that i think about it wont be as bad as i originally thought it would seem really that i have a talent for that sort of thing i would have given odds that i would have broken out in a cold sweat when i saw where i dropped that ninja i didnt the sonofabitch had a submachine gun he would have used on me if i hadnt blown him away why should i feel guilty about taking him down castillo may not be thrilled about having me okay but hes stuck with me all ill have to do is play my cards right and eventually hell accept me i can do a lot for ooa they need somebody like me and they know when something goes down i can hold my own i proved it fuck the fbi you want to get a drink somewhere artigas asked as they walked from the helicopter to their cars all of their cars were parked nose up against the policia federal hangar howell had picked up artigas that morning and driven him to the airport both lived in apartments not far from the embassy on the rambla ordonez had met them at the airport yung had driven to the airport in his own car from his apartment in carrasco my ass is dragging yung replied im going to get in a shower and then go to bed ill see you at the embassy about nine okay your call goodnight dave artigas said touched yungs shoulder and opened the passengers door of howells car thanks for everything ordonez yung said i really appreciate all youve done di nada mi amigo ordonez said ill probably see you tomorrow absolutely and you wont learn anything more tomorrow than you did today yung put the louis vuitton suitcase in the backseat of his chevy blazer and got behind the wheel it was a tenminute drive from the airport to yungs apartment he lived in a threestory building two apartments to a floor on avenida bernardo barran all the apartments had balconies overlooking the beach he thought histhe righthand apartment on the third floorhad the best view and he thought that he would probably miss the apartment when he was back living in dc where the rents were astronomical and he couldnt afford anything this nice well fuck it maybe working for castillo i wont be spending all that much time in washington the garage was in the basement of the building there was a clickeractivated solenoid that opened the steelmesh door most of the time when you pushed the button after you pulled off the street and into the steeply slanted driveway if the clicker didnt work you had to get out of the car and open the door with a key the clicker didnt work shit he turned the ignition off took the keys from the ignition and opened the blazers door as he squeezed past the front fender he noticed two things first the floodlight that went on when you pushed the clickereven if the goddamned door didnt openhadnt come on what the hell and then he noticed that a bag a clothsomethingwas covering the clicker receiver what the hell and then in the same split second he saw that a man was coming quickly down the driveway and that a car was entering the drive backward what the hell he pushed his jacket aside and took out his pistol there was a sudden burst of light from a large handheld floodlight policia a voice shouted the carhe saw now that it was a small fiat vanstarted up the driveway its tires squealing the man coming down the driveway shielded his eyes from the floodlight then he put his other hand to his eyes that hand held a pistol dont shoot him yung screamed in spanish there came three shotsbooms rather than cracks telling yung they were from a shotgun and not a pistoland the man who had been shielding his eyes looked as if something had shoved him hard against the concrete driveway wall he slid down it yung dropped his pistol and raised his hands over his head he started screaming policia policia policia something warm dripped onto his face in a moment he realized that he was bleeding a uruguayan policeman a sergeant with his pistol drawn came down the driveway are you all right senor yung how the hell did he know my name may i put my hands down of course senor the sergeant said then added youve been hit senor yung yung looked at his left hand it looked as if someone had gouged a twoinchlong quarterinchdeep channel across it it was starting to bleed profusely yung thought there are usually twelve pellets with a total weight of ounces in a buckshot cartridge each pellet has roughly the knockdown power of a acp bullet wyatt earp fired three times that translated to thirtysix pellets each with roughly the knockdown power of a acp slug bouncing around in the ok corral here i guess im lucky i got only one of them he leaned against the wall and took out his handkerchief when he applied the handkerchief as a pressure bandage to his hand he saw there were at least a half dozen holes in the glass and metal of the blazer ix one aeropuerto internacional jorge newbery buenos aires argentina august castillo had flown in the right seat on the last leg from recife brazil with torine in the left seat but as they had approached jorge newbery torine had said if you have your ego under control first officer you may land the aircraft and then when they had shut down the gulfstream on the tarmac in front of the jetaire hangar torine had two more comments you came in a little long charley i know the less the gross weight the harder these are to get on the ground ill remember torine handed him the plastic envelope holding the aircraft documents dealing with the local authorities is beneath the dignity of the captain torine said yes sir castillo said when he came down the stair door castillo saw that in addition to the argentine customs and immigration authorities a mercedes traffik van also was there to meet the gulfstream the driver was leaning against the van castillo recognized him he was a cia agent named paul sieno he had met him the morning they had found j winslow mastersons body and when he looked closer at the van he saw another man he recognized ricardo solez of the drug enforcement administration jesus i hope fernando doesnt take one look at him get carried away and pick ricardo up in a bear hug sieno walked over and in heavily accented english said we are from the estancia senor when you have finished with these officers thank you castillo said and turned to the argentine officials where would you like us to put our luggage for exam max came bounding downmore accurately overthe steps in the stair door and headed for the nose gear where he raised his leg the argentine customs officer smiled that wont be necessary sir if we can go aboard well deal with the passports you are very kind castillo said he went quickly back into the fuselage passports please everybody he called and then please board the van which will take us to the estancia eric kocians bushy white eyebrow rose at that but he said nothing he handed the immigration officer his passport as if it identified him as the personal representative of if not god then at least the pope welcome to argentina senor the immigration officer said five minutes later everyone was in the van and had left the airport wheres this estancia were going castillo asked sieno when it seemed to him the van was not headed for any of the highways leading to the countryside in belgrano sieno replied chuckling fifteensixtyeight arribenos belgrano was one of buenos airess upscale neighborhoods whats there my apartment major sieno said sixteenth floor your apartment the cuban embassy is on the next corner we use the apartment to take pictures of people going into the embassy and to grab their radio transmissions not exactly a safe house but theres a steel door and tv monitors and alex darby figured it will do until you decide what you really need hes a colonel now solez called from the backseat and added for castillo dona alicia sent me an email you and dona alicia have big mouths castillo said and then asked sieno where is alex darby im hoping hell be at the apartment when we get there and tony santini your major miller called darby majcoloneland asked him to have somebody meet the seven twentyfive american airlines flight from miami tony said hed do it i overheard enough of the conversation to think that the corporalfrom the marine guard detachment at the embassyyou took to the states and some other military type a replacement for the guy you lost will be on it i wonder what the hell thats all about castillo thought and then said it whats that about i dont have any idea but alex should be at the apartment when we get there and hell know paul can you get out of the habit of calling me colonel my name is charley sure and you ricardo get in the habit of keeping your mouth shut you going to tell abuela that colonel gringo fernando asked coming to ricardos aid castillo ignored him and asked wheres sergeant kensington all aloneexcept for his radio of coursein that luxury suite of yours in the four seasons solez said darby decided keeping him there and the radio linkup was more important than worrying about what thats costing sieno said at least until he heard from you i am often known as the last of the big spenders castillo said he had a sudden flash of memory betty schneider in his arms in the enormous bed in the master bedroom of the el presidente de la rua suite at the four seasons hotel and then these bastards shot her and i didntas promisedgo to see her before i started this round of the grand tour of europe and south america im either a dedicated professional who allows nothing to get in the way of carrying out the mission or a fourstar worldclass prick and if betty believes the latter who can blame her well ill get on my knees apologize and beg for forgiveness when i see her two the apartment building at avenida arribenos was on the corner of avenida jose hernandez a block off avenida libertador the lobby behind walls of plate glass was brightly lit and castillo wondered if the cubanstit for tatmight be keeping it under surveillance rule always give the bad guys more credit for smarts than they probably deserve if darby is working on their embassy they almost certainly know it they may not be able to do anything to stop the snooping but they certainly can take pictures of everybody going into the apartment building and pass them around he felt a sense of relief when the traffik turned off avenida arribenos crossed the sidewalk and almost immediately disappeared from sight down a steep ramp into a basement garage castillo spotted surveillance cameras in the garage and another in the elevator and still another when the elevator opened onto a foyer on the sixteenth floor he had just decided that the cameras in the basement and elevator were connected with the apartment buildings security system but that the one in the foyer might not be when he spotted a third lens hidden in the tack of a prancingstallion wall decoration that one goes to a monitor inside the apartment the door from the foyer was steel sieno unlocked it by punching in a series of numbers on a small numerical keyboard when sieno pulled the door open castillo was surprised to see another steel door behind it and even more surprised when that door opened inward revealing a trim pale freckled redhead in a white blouse and blue jeans who smiled and said welcome everyone filed inside gentlemen this is my wife susanna sieno said and then pointing susanna this is mr smith mr smith mr smith mr smith mr smith and of course you know ricardo im very pleased to meet you all she said how are you ricardo sieno smiled and said i was hoping the boss would be here before we got here so he could make the introductions im a little surprised that your wife is here castillo said not very pleasantly well she both lives here and works here sieno said another reason i was hoping the boss would get here before we did so he could explain that why dont i get us all some coffee while were waiting mr sieno said paul why would i not be surprised to learn your charming wife has a security clearanceclearancesnot normally given to diplomats wives castillo said actually she has several some with names issued here or in virginia as a matter of fact mr sieno said ive heard of husbandandwife teams castillo said but this is the first one ive ever actually met were doubledippers susanna sieno said the rule is that both can get paid only if both were field officers before they marched down the aisle castillo smiled at her and then said okay let me make if official anything that you hear here or see here mr sieno is classified top secret presidential i understand castillo thought only a langley chairwarmer whos never been in the field would be naive enough to think that sieno hasnt told hershes not only his wife but a working spookeverything thats happened from the moment mr masterson was grabbed including that a hotshot named castillo showed up down here and started giving everybody including the station chief orders thats why she told me she was a doubledipper a spook herself not just married to one that being understood between us im charley castillo this is colonel jake torine my cousin fernando lopez sandor tor and eric kocian and that is max billy kocian said in english as he walked to her andsome what startling hertook and kissed the hand she extended to him it is my great pleasure madam there was the sound of door chimes playing a melody as if one chime didnt work thats probably the boss susanna sieno said the chimes go off when somebody pushes the clicker for the garage door she turned and opened what looked like a closet door behind the door was a bank of monitors one showed a jeep cherokee waiting for the door to the basement garage to open others showed the garage the elevator the foyer outside the lobby the sidewalks outside and several antennae on the roof eric kocians eyebrows rose but he said nothing one of the monitors showed the jeep cherokee pulling into a slot in the garage alex darby got out a monitor showed him unloading a large duffel bag that looked like it contained heavy metal objectslike gunsand walking toward the elevator mr sieno opened the door to the foyer before the elevator got there darby walked into the apartment set the heavy bag down and put out his hand to castillo castillo took it and said good to see you alex darby had just put out his hand to torine when the chimes with one missing note sounded again everyone looked at the monitors there was now a volkswagen passat station wagon waiting for the door to completely open other monitors showed the passat parking and tony santini a secret service agent getting out and going to the back of the vehicle and raising the rear hatch sergeant major jack davidson usa and corporal lester bradley usmc both in civilian clothing got out and joined santini at the back of the station wagon castillo grinned slightly davidson i dont know how you got down here jack but am i glad to see you when the monitor showed them inside the elevator it also showed davidson looking around forand then spottingthe monitor camera lens castillo looked at torine and saw in his raised eyebrow that he had recognized davidson too torine saw that castillo was watching him and raised his eyebrow even higher but didnt say anything susanna sieno opened the door for them davidson smiling put his suitcase down and saluted castillo good morning colonel he said may the sergeant major offer his congratulations on your promotion the sergeant major may but the colonel is surprised that the sergeant major doesnt know youre not supposed to salute when not in uniform castillo said the sergeant major begs the colonels pardon for his breach of military custom they looked at each other then chuckled castillo said i dont know what youre doing here jack butand i know i shouldnt tell you thisim damned glad you are oh goody davidson said and spread his arms wide as he approached castillo then wrapped him in a bear hug crying its good to see you charley when he freed himself castillo turned to bradley im not so sure about you lester he said i thought you were safely on ice at mackall that was not one of your brightest ideas davidson said deadeye dick stood out in mackall like a whor davidson saw susanna sieno like a lady of dubious virtue in a place of worship she furnished smiling yes maam mr sieno sergeant major jack davidson castillo said you can call me susanna she said good to see you jack jake torine said to davidson they shook hands the other introductions were made alex darby said before this goes any further i need a private word with you and tony charley castillo nodded okay if we go in there susanna darby asked gesturing toward a door of course she replied three darby led them into a large marblewalled bathroom the bathtub and the separate shower were stacked high with electronic equipment and there was more on a long twinbasin washstand the water closet was still functional but there were racks of electronics rising almost to the ceiling on either side of it were watching the cubans darby explained not so much them as the people who go in and out of their embassy and of course their communications sometimes thats very interesting sieno told me darby turned to face him youve got me on a spot again charley he said ambassador montvale called me and said i was to call him immediatelyhim personally not through the agencyif you showed up here castillo nodded and then asked if i showed up here or when if darby said so what ive doneor didnt dowas not call him to let him know you had called from recife but now that youre hereyou tell me what you want me to do call him and tell him im here better yet call him and tell him i called you to tell you to call him and tell him im here and will call him as soon as i have a chance darby considered that a moment then he turned and picked up a heavily corded telephone sitting on top of the water reservoir of the toilet then looked at castillo its half past six in the morning in washington he said making it a question the ambassador said immediately didnt he darby shrugged and put the telephone to his ear this is darby get me a secure line to the langley switchboard he ordered oh the miracle of modern communications castillo said how did the ambassador react to having his sleep disturbed santini asked he asked what else charley had had to say and when you told him i had had nothing else to say castillo asked and when i told him that he said when you called to tell you to call him immediately okay give me until noon and then call him and tell him you have relayed his message to me darby nodded again whats the problem with you and montvale charley santini asked he has a tendency to try to tell me what to do castillo said as in tell castillo to call me immediately well he is the director of national intelligence santini said maybe he feels that entitles him to order a lowly lieutenant colonel around you heard about that huh you got promoted charley darby asked castillo nodded from both the director of national intelligence and corporal bradley santini said congratulations charley thank you after what happened in afghanistan i was beginning to think id never get promoted based on my personal knowledge of what happened in afghanistan darby said that was a reasonable conclusion to draw the bottom line castillo said is that i made a deal with montvale in theory i tell him what im doing and plan to do and he leaves me alone and helps me helps you how for example getting to use the agencys air taxi services then why are you dodging him i told you because hes still trying to tell me what to do tit for tat i dont tell him any more about what im going to do than i have to darby shook his head which leaves tony and me between a rock and a hard place darby said okay so whos the old guy his name is eric kocian he runs the budapest tages zeitung hes been looking into the oilforfood scandal that could be dangerous how much has he found out enough so there have been two attempts to kidnap him to see how much the other hungarianhis name is sandor toris an excop who before that did a hitch in the french foreign legion he kept the first attempt to kidnap whack kocian from coming off one of those guysthere were three two got awaytold the cops he was a vacationing housepainter from dresden and had the papers to prove it you dont think he was santini asked and then when castillo shook his head asked so who were they im guessing exstasi but i dont know that and i have no idea who theyre working for the second time they tried to kidnap andor whack kocian there were two guys they had madsens and no identification like the people at the estancia whats their story santini asked i had to take them down so i dont know more than i told you you had to take them down darby asked and then after castillo nodded he shook his head and asked and how many waves did that make i hope none sandor took them away in their car darby shook his head again you cant keeping walking through the raindrops forever charley that thought has occurred to me i didnt have any choice alex if theyre exstasi who are they working for now santini asked castillo shrugged thats what im hoping to find out kocian gave me everything he had so did ed delchamps in paris eds a good man darby said so you put him on the spot with montvale too i suppose its very unprofessional of delchamps getting emotionally involved but i have the feeling hes as pissed off at these people as i am or maybe with the agency for doing nothing with what hes been sending them i guess that makes me unprofessional too jack masterson was a friend of mine darby said id really like to nail these bastards what does that make counting me santini asked four amateurs and i think yung may have something in his filesand may not know it castillo said speaking of him where is he odd that you should ask darby said i was just about to say speaking of coincidences what are you talking about guess who got shot in montevideo last night by parties unknown yung castillo asked incredulously they were waiting for him at his apartment when he came back from the estancia they probably would have got himby which i mean grabbed himif the uruguayan cops hadnt been sitting on him how bad is he hurt the uruguayan cops got one of the guys going after him with three shots of doubleaught buckshot the others probably two got away yung took one pellet in his left hand just gouged it no bone damage just a canal yungs like you charley he walks through raindrops he was standing right next to the bad guy when the cops took him out and the guy the cops shot no identification but he did have a hypo full of ketaminea strong tranquilizerthat i think he wanted to stick in yung jesus christ castillo exclaimed you got the word that ambassador mcgrory thinks lorimer was a drug dealer castillo nodded well hes been told that the people who shot yung were carjackers the uruguayan cops went along with that darby nodded for reasons of their own they suggested that story to yung i cant imagine why neither can i well if mcgrory believes lorimer was a drug dealer hell probably conclude that the uruguayan cops know yung was shot by another drug dealer and dont want to admit i sure hope so if mcgrory finds out what really happened at that estancia the shit will really hit the fan and some of it will splatter on ambassador silvio and i dont like that can you contact yung is he in the hospital he wouldnt stay hes in his apartment bob howell is sitting on him howell and another fbi agent who was at the estancia andbad newsaccording to howell has figured out what really happened at the estancia well lets get him over here i dont want him grabbed in montevideo how soon can you get him here two hours from the time i call him darby said nodding at the telephone that raises the question of a safe house castillo said i dont think this place is going to work too many people for one thing can we use the place we used before mayerling no and maybe yes come on alex the place we used before is not available darby said but theres a place for rent out there that would really be better rent it castillo said how quickly can you do that the problem there is the rent four thousand a month first and last month due on signing plus another two months up front for a security deposit thats sixteen thousand i have just about that much in my black account if i ask for more langleys going to want to know what for moneys not a problem castillo said we now have the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund to draw on the what lorimer had almost sixteen million in three banks in montevideo most of it is now in the liechtensteinische landesbank in the cayman islands in your account darby asked castillo nodded howd you manage that you dont want to know castillo said i spent seven million five of it to buy an airplane a gulfstream you bought a gulfstream with lorimers money santini asked incredulously castillo smiling nodded a giii its really nice tony to be able to avoid all that frisking and baggage searching and standing in line at airports you really ought to get one for yourself jesus christ charley youre insane darby said whats montvale going to do when he hears you stole lorimers money and then bought a gulfstream with it actually taking the money was montvales idea i think he saw it as a source of unaccountable funds for him which of course it would be if i didnt control it and i havent gotten around to telling him about the airplane yet and when he finds out all he can do is go to the president and tell himas he predictedthat i have acted impulsively and unwisely and the airplane is the proof on the other hand he may decide its a good idea if he can get the office of organizational analysis under himwhich is his announced intentionthe airplane would come with it and whats the president going to do when he finds out about the money santini asked he knows about the money castillo said which brings us back to that how do i get the rent money to you alex darby thought that over a moment before replying the black account is in the banco galicia the agency wires money into it from a swiss account i suppose you could do the same thing how long would it take to wire it from the riggs bank before you could get at the money i dont know twentyfour hours id guess you give me the numbers and the routing and ill call dick miller and have him wire a hundred thousand down here theres going to be other expenses and im going to have to give davidson some walkingaround money too is davidson who i think he is darby asked that would depend on who you think he is if im not mistaken the last time i saw him was in kabul you were both wearing robes and beards that was when you were in charge of babysitting the eager young men langley sent over there to win that war in two weeks yeah that was jack and he never lost one of those starryeyed young men either i was really glad to see him get out of your car you didnt know he was coming santini asked castillo shook his head then asked while were waiting for the money to get here can you rent this house right awaytoday maybewith the money you have i can darby said you sure you dont want to stash the old man here his name is eric kocian castillo said hes both a very old friend and a good guy i would love to stash him here but i dont think hed stay a house in mayerling might be just what hes looking for he thinksbecause of the namethat there might be a connection with austrians or hungarians involved in the oilforfood business i dont understand darby confessed you dont know the story shame on you alex what story santini asked mayerling was the imperial hunting lodge of franz josef it was in mayerling that crown prince rudolph after his father told him he had to get rid of some sixteenyearold baroness he was banging that he whacked the baroness and then shot himself thats one version the one i got from my hungarian auntthe version kocian believesis that franz josef had the crown prince whacked after he learned the kid was talking to the hungarians about becoming king of hungary kocian thinks maybe mayerling the country club was built with oilforfood money and named mayerling to be clever that sounds pretty farfetched charley santini said so does six guys dressed like ninja characters in a comic strip going to estancia shangrila to whack lorimer im not saying i believe kocian but on the other hand hes one hell of a journalist whoevers trying to whack him thinks he knows more than he should anyway if i can get him out there and keep him alive for a couple of days maybe i can get the bad guys to back off how are you going to do that darby asked you dont want to know alex darby shrugged what i need now castillo said is the boxes i sent to the embassy under diplomatic seal and a black car ambassador silvio turned them over to me and didnt even ask what was in them hes a good guy charley i really dont want him to get burned in this ill do my best to see that doesnt happen castillo said where are the boxes now in the backseat of the cherokee darby said and added which is registered to a guy in mar del plata he tossed castillo a set of keys registrations in the glove compartment thanks castillo said now let me get on the horn to dick miller and get some money down here darby nodded do youeither of youhave to rush back to the embassy castillo asked or would you have time to look at some of kocians files and see if anything rings a bell at least until i get back back from where where im going alex castillo said smiling curiosity underwhelms me ill make time darby said smiling back me too santini said as he picked up the heavily corded telephone darby asked white house right right darby again darby said into the telephone get me a secure line to the white house switchboard four pilar buenos aires province argentina august castillo was glad when he saw the sign indicating the exit from route to the pilar sheraton hotel he hadnt been certain that he was on the right road to the buena vista country club or for that matter even on the right road to pilar he hadnt been able to ask directions from santini or darby that would have given them more than a hint of where he was going he had had trouble getting on the panamericana the toll highway that led to pilar but hed finallyafter ten minutesfound it and then he had trouble with the tollbooth he had sat there for christ only knew how long holding a tenpeso note out the window with angry horns bleating behind him until the horns finally woke him up to the fact that not only was there no attendant in the booth but that the barrier pole was up as he pulled away he saw an electronic gadget mounted inside the windshield under the rearview mirror the gadget had triggered the barrierraising mechanism as he approached he hadnt noticed it from the tollbooth to the sign pointing to the sheraton hotel exit he had wondered about a number of things including how he was going to get past the gate of the buena vista country club once he got thereif he got there and what he was going to do if aleksandr pevsner wasnt there or was there and didnt want to see him and how he was going to protect eric kocian if he couldnt get through to pevsner presuming he could get past the buena vista country club gate to get in to see him he knew that he wasnt functioning well and the reason for it in the past fortyeight hoursgive or take having crossed through so many time zones he didnt know how long it had been in real timehe had flown across the north atlantic then at the controls of an airplane hed never flown before across the mediterranean and then while jake and fernando were flying across the south atlantic instead of crashing on one of the gulfstreams comfortable couches hed consumed at least a gallon of coffee so he could stay awake while trying to make some sense of eric kocians notes much of which had been written in abbreviations known only to kocian and then hed made his second takeoff and landing in the gulfstream coming down from recife and while he had been making a whirlwind tour of paris fulda and budapest there had been an attempt on his life which had forced him to kill two people killing people always bothered him even when it was necessary he knew that he was exhausted and that what he should be doingespecially if he was going to have to deal with aleksandr pevsner where he would really need all his faculties presuming he was going to be able to see aleksandr pevsnerwas to crash for at least twentyfour hours the problem there was he didnt think he had twentyfour hours he approached the pilar exit from route if memory servesand please god let it servei get off here make a sharp left onto the highway overpass drive past the jumbo supermarket on the left and the mercedes showroom on the right take the next right and then the next left and then drive past the hospital and four clicks later maybe a little less turn right into the buena vista country club where i probably wont be able to get in or pevsner wont be there there was a red traffic light when he reached the intersection where he was to turn right for the first time he looked at the instrument panel a warning light was flashing the fuel gauge needle was resting on empty oh fuck youve done it again inspector clouseau there was a shell gas station to his immediate left but there also was a steady line of oncoming traffic that kept him from turning into it and when the light turned green he realized that his first ideawaiting for a chance to make the turnwas impractical there was a symphony of automobile horns blasting angrily behind him he made the right turn and then the left and there was an esso station right in front of him he pulled in thank god two attendants appeared fill it up castillo ordered he took his wallet from his pocket to get his creditcard he dropped it it bounced under the car and he and one of the attendants got on their hands and knees to retrieve it he stood up a tall darkhaired welldressed man who appeared to be in his late thirties was walking purposefully toward the service stations restroom jesus christ im hallucinating that guy looks just like pevsner he looked around the pumps there was a black mercedesbenz s at the next row of pumps a burly man was speaking to the attendant another burly man walked to the hood of the car and leaned against the fender and watched the door to the mens room castillo walked to the mens room pushed the door open and walked to the urinal next to the man who didnt turn to look at him i just love these service station pissoirs castillo announced in russian you never know who youll bump into in one of them aleksandr pevsners head snapped to look at him the hairs on the back of castillos neck rose his eyes are like ice and then pevsner smiled the door of the mens room opened and the burly man who had been leaning on the mercedes came in he had his hand inside his suit jacket if he takes out a gun alek ill have to kill him castillo said its all right janos pevsner said in hungarian the gentleman and i are old friends then he switched to english how nice to see you charley and quite a surprise i somehow had the idea you were in the united states well i get around a lot and what brings you to this service station pissoir aside from having to take a leak you mean uhhuh pevsner said chuckling actually bearing a small gift i was on my way to see you what is it they say a small world or is it truth is stranger than fiction some people say both castillo said pevsner turned from the urinal and walked to the washbasins castillo heard water running then the sound of the hotair blower of the hand dryer i hate these things pevsner announced castillo finished and turned around the burly hungarian was gone castillo washed his hands put them under the dryer and said me too then he offered his hand to pevsner who took it and then wrapped his arm around castillos shoulder and hugged him then he turned him loose put his hands on castillos arms and looked into his eyes you are a man of many surprises charley i guess i should have called and told you i was coming that would have been a good idea am i supposed to believe you just walked in here and were surprised to see me no i knew you were in here castillo said i had just told the attendant to fill my tanki was running on fumes when i pulled inwhen i saw you headed for the mens room pevsner smiled at him but didnt say anything if you doubt me alek check the pump to see how much theyve pumped into it oh i trust you charley why would you lie to me thank you i would never lie to you unless it was necessary pevsner smiled well lets go out to the house and have what the viennese call a kleines fruhstuck thank you pevsner waved him ahead of him out of the mens room when they were outside he walked directly to the pump beside the cherokee and examined the dial you were really out of petrol werent you you have a suspicious soul alek in my line of business i have to pevsner said why dont we have janos drive your cherokee if you wouldnt mind that would get us past the guards at the gate to buena vista easier the keys are in it castillo said just let me pay the bill janos pevsner ordered in hungarian settle my friends bill then drive his car to the house you are too generous alek as the mercedes approached the redbrick redtileroofed guardhouse at the entrance to the buena vista country club the yellowandblackstriped barrier pole across the road went up they rolled past the two uniformed guards standing outside the guardhouse castillo saw two more inside standing before a rack of what looked like ithaca pump riot shotguns the mercedes rolled slowlyneat signs proclaimed a kph speed limit and speed bumps reinforced itdown a curving road past long rows of upscale houses set on wellmanicured halfhectare lots they passed several polo fields lined with large houses then the clubhouse of a wellmaintained golf course there were thirty or so cars in the parking lot they came next to an area of larger houses on much larger lots most of them ringed with shrubbery tall enough so that only the upper floors of the houses were visible castillo saw that the shrubbery also concealed fences this is really a very nice place alek castillo said and it never snows pevsner said the car slowed then turned right through a stillopening sliding steel door the same shade of green as the double rows of closely planted pines cropped at about twelve feet there was a fence of the same height between the rows inside castillo saw pevsners bell ranger helicopter parked its rotors tied down on what looked like a putting green a man in white coveralls was polishing the plexiglas then the house an englishlooking near mansion of red brick with casement windows came into view another burly man in a suit was standing outside waiting for them come on in pevsner said opening the door before the burly man could reach it im looking forward to my kleines fruhstuck all i had before i took aleksandr and sergei into buenos aires was a cup of tea he waited until castillo had slid across the seat and gotten out and then went on they were lateagaingetting to saint agness which meant they missed the bus to buenos aires which meant that i had to take them what are they going to do in buenos aires tour the colon opera house you know backstage did you know charley the colon is larger than the vienna opera house and pariss too castillo said the design criteria was make it larger than both that of course was when argentina had money you know something about everything dont you pevsner said as he led castillo up a shallow flight of stairs and into the house a middleaged maid was waiting in the foyer her hands folded on her small crisply starched white apron pevsner said in russian be so good as to ask madam if she is free to join mr he hesitated and looked at castillo castillo charley furnished castillo and i in the breakfast room when the maid bobbed her head pevsner switched to hungarian and added i hope that since herr gossinger is not here that means senor castillo is not working youre out of luck castillo said and actually alek i know everything about everything like you a glasstopped table in the frenchwindowed breakfast room was set with linen and silver for two pevsner waved charley into one of the chairs and a moment later a maida different one this one young and castillo suspected argentinecame in pulled a third chair to the table and set a third place bring tea for me please pevsner ordered and coffee for senor castillo she had just finished when janos appeared in the door dangling the keys to the cherokee delicately in sausagelike fingers castillo put his hand out for them then said i would ask janos to bring in your present but its not for the house and hed only have to carry it out again where should it go who maintains the avionics in your ranger castillo asked when he saw the confusion on pevsners face he added what ive done is get you some decent avionics for your helicopter whats wrong with the avionics in it on a scale of one to ten theyre maybe onepointfive i was assured they were the best available write this down alek never trust someone selling used cars or aircraft youre saying i was cheated his eyes are cold again of course not castillo said chuckling everyone knows you cant cheat an honest man all im saying is that you dont have the best available and as a small token of my gratitude for past courtesies now you do pevsner looked at him and smiled what is it they say down here beware of americans bearing gifts a tall trim woman with her hair done up in a long pigtail came into the room what a pleasant surprise charley she exclaimed in russian castillo stood and kissed her cheek its nice to see you anna he said alek saw me on the street saw that i was starving and offered me breakfast actually he accosted me in the mens room of the esso service station just past the hospital pevsner said she looked at her husband then at castillo i never know when hes teasing she said neither do i castillo said regardless of where you met im glad youre here she said and so far as breakfast is concerned how about american pancakes with tree syrup maple syrup maybe maple syrup she confirmed they bleed trees to make it indeed they do theres an american boyactually theres severalin aleksandrs class at saint agness they sometimes spend the night together at the boys house or here they served aleksandr pancakes with maple syrup for breakfast he couldnt get enough so thats what they gave him for his birthday present a bag of the flourshe demonstrated the size of a fivepound bag with her handsand a liter can of the syrup how nice for aleksandr and of course aleks curiosity got the best of him and tell me about bleeding the tree pevsner said actually they tap it maple trees in the winter when its cold they drive a sort of funnel into the tree the sap drips out into a cup below the funnel they collect it and boil it until its thick thats all there is to it extraordinary pevsner said we americans are an extraordinary people alek i thought you knew that the older maid appeared with the tea and coffee and anna ordered pancakes with sausage the maid looking uncomfortable reported she wasnt sure there was enough flour left to make pancakes for everybody then just forget it castillo said i dont want to steal alek juniors breakfast nonsense pevsner announced make what you have and ill see about getting more of the flour im sure they sell it in the embassy store castillo said ill get you some before i go go where to the states and when will that be tomorrow maybe more likely the day after tomorrow oh charley anna pevsner said laying her hand on his could you really ive tried every store in buenos aires and they just look at me as if im crazy consider it done and if that store in the embassy doesnt have any the chief of the office of organizational analysis will make sure theres fivetenpounds of the best pancake flour available in the next diplomatic pouch pleasing madam pevsner and alek junior is sure to please alek senior probably more than the fifty thousandmaybe moredollars worth of avionics in the cherokee how would you get it out here pevsner asked the translation of that is without anybody learning a pevsner prominent russian mafioso and international arms dealer resides in the buena vista country club if i cant bring it myself maybe you could have janos meet me someplace you just say when and where charley pevsner said and janos will be there alek is really crazy for pancakes both of them are anna said or maybe howard kennedy can meet me castillo said hes in the four seasons right where im staying howards not here right now pevsner said well then maybe colonel munz didnt he tell you charley anna said tell me what youre not going to believe this she said and i know i shouldnt be smiling but he isor wasa policeman for all those years before he came to work for alek what he did charley was shoot himself in the shoulder while he was cleaning his pistol is he all right castillo asked looking at pevsner hes fine pevsner said and terribly embarrassed anna said well give him my best regards castillo said dont mention that you told me what happened i can understandsympathize withhis embarrassment five if youll excuse us darling pevsner said over their second cups of tea and coffee charley and i are going to have a look at the helicopter and then ill have to be getting back to buenos aires castillo said so thank you for the breakfast you saved my life he stood up and anna gave him her cheek to kiss pevsner stood up opened one of the french doors and signaled for charley to go ahead of him when they were halfway across the lawn toward where the helicopter was parked pevsner said when do you want to talk about what youre really out here for before you show me how that bastard cheated me on the avionics when i bought that helicopter or after after charley said and then after considering it added alek i didnt say he cheated you i just said you dont have the best equipment available theres a difference no theres not i told him i wanted the best and i didnt get it thats cheating cheating would be if he charged you for better avionics than you got if he charged you fairly for what he sold you thats not cheating pevsner didnt argue but his face showed he had not accepted charleys argument christ is he thinking of whacking the salesman alek an aircraft salesman with a beauty mark in the center of his forehead would make people ask questions you want as few questions raised as possible pevsner nodded not happily but the nod was enough to make castillo think that argument may have gotten home so thats it alek castillo said after pointing out to pevsner where the new avionics would goon the instrument panel and in the avionics compartment installation is no big deal the new stuff will fit right in where theyll take the old stuff out just make surejust make sure your pilot watches the calibration ill be sure to do that pevsner said thank you very much charley like i said a small token of my appreciation for your courtesy in anticipation of asking for another favor not right now anyway looking the gift horse in the mouth how much is that equipment worth do you really care i care about who paid for it pevsner said if youre really asking is there some kind of locator deviceor something else clever in therethe answer is no if your avionics guy is any good at all he can check that for you so whos paying for it lets just say that your friend charley recently came into a considerable sum of money and wanted to share his good fortune so i understand excuse me i heard you came into a lot of money nearly sixteen million dollars you do keep your ear to the ground dont you castillo asked and then went on before pevsner had a chance to reply so we are now in part two of our little chat is that it you tell me charley lets talk about budapest castillo said youre a hungarian right or at least have a hungarian passport pevsner didnt reply well as someone who knows budapest and keeps his ear to the ground i guess you know who eric kocian is ive heard the name hes a fine old gentleman castillo said more important hes almost kin meaning well he was a friend of my grandfather and my mother oh yes the gossinger connection pevsner said i forgot that and uncle billy bounced me on his knee so to speak when i was a little boy he paused so you will understand how upset i was when some unpleasant people tried to kidnap him on the szabadsag hid and when that failed tried to kill him charley sometimes people who put their noses in places they shouldnt be and how upset i was just the other day when the same peoplei admit they were probably looking for my uncle billycame into my room in the gellert and pointed madsens at me that so upset me that i actually lost control of myself im really surprised to hear that pevsner said i didnt think castillo said i just took them down which of course means i couldnt ask who sent them you dont know who sent them no but i strongly suspect the people who made me lose my temper were either stasi or allamvedelmi hatosag but there is no stasi anymore or allamvedelmi hatosag in the united states the marines say once a marine always a marine and who else do you know who uses the garrote to take people out i dont know anyone who uses the garrote pevsner said and i cant imagine why youre telling me this im about to tell you alek youre right my uncle billy does have the unfortunate habit of putting his nose in places other people dont think he should like under rocks to see what slime the rock conceals so i have this theory that whoever tried to kidnap my uncle billy did so to see how many names he could assign to the maggots and other slimy creatures hes found under the rocks sound reasonable to you it could well be something like that i suppose the sad thing about all this is these people were trying to close the barn door long after the cow got away im not sure i know what you mean pevsner said i mean that i know everything that kocian learned and by now his files are in washington these people cant put the cow back in the barn in a manner of speaking the only thing that any further kidnappings or murders are going to accomplish is to draw even more attention to them and i dont think they want that and if any further attempt is made to kill kocian or kidnap him i will take that personally as i said i cant imagine why youre telling me this because i want you to get to these people and tell them what i just told you what makes you think i even know who they are or if i did that i would go to them oh you know who they are alek theyre the people who told you about the sixteen million and has it occurred to you that munz may have told me he couldnt have alek he didnt know about it castillo said and on the way down here i read kocians files long lists of names some of them had data after their names some names like respin vasily for example and pevsner aleksandr had question marks after their names which meant they had come to kocians attention and when he got around to it he was going to see what he could come up with pevsner his eyes again icy met castillos eyes but he said nothing your namenameswere also on a list that i got from the cia station chief in paris castillo said i didnt have a chance to ask the cia in budapest what they have on you but i wouldnt be at all surprised if they have a file on you would you i wouldnt be surprised if they did but they dont have anything tying me to the oilforfood business because i wasnt involved in that so you keep telling me castillo said right now alek you dont have to worry about what the cia has or doesnt have on you right now were friends and the president has called off the cia and fbi investigations of you what you have to worry about is your other friends going after kocian again if that happens the deal is off not only will i give kocians files to every american intelligence agency ill spread them around to anyone and everyone who might be the slightest bit interested i thought you said kocians files were already in washington castillo nodded they are but i havent shared them with anybody yet pevsner looked into his eyes again and again said nothing castillo stared him down and then asked did i mention alek that if there is another attempt to get at kocian i will take that personally you did but i wonder if you really understand who these people are dont take offense charley but youre only a major could it be that your understandable affection for this man kocian has clouded your judgment to the point where you think youre more important than you really are can do things you really cant do actually im a lieutenant colonel now castillo said all right a lieutenant colonel pevsner said impatiently you take my point dont underestimate lieutenant colonels thats all that mr putin was in the kgb putins name incidentally is in kocians files too and there are no question marks after it youre not actually thinking of going after putin are you im just a simple soldier alek who will do his best to follow his orders wherever that leads me simple soldier pevsner parroted and chuckled and what exactly are your orders colonel castillo to locate and render harmless the people responsible for the murder of masterson render harmless the way the exstasi or exallamvedelmi hatosag in budapest whichever they were were rendered harmless youre not suggesting are you that if these people lose interest in your uncle billy youll lose interest in them absolutely not i just want you to tell them theres no longer a reason to kill eric kocian from all youve been telling me about these people they are not very nice people charley they may well decide that rendering harmless someone who has been too interested in what theyve been doing might discourage others from looking under other rocks in your own interests alek id try very hard to convince them that would not be wise and they may well come after you they already have castillo said and nothing would give me greater pleasure than if they tried it again the next time ill take prisoners i know some people who are very good in teaching people how to sing and of course this is all hypothetical i have no idea who youre talking about castillo laughed alek youre one of a kind he said you said that with an absolutely straight face there arent very many people my friend charley who would be so brave or stupid to mock me pevsner said and tried to stare castillo down again and failed again i wasnt mocking you alek i said that with admiration you would be one hell of a poker player pevsner smiled actually im a rather good poker player we must find the time to play sometime id like that castillo said well charley pevsner said this has been an interesting conversation and its always a pleasure to see you but i have a golf date thank you for the kleines fruhstuck castillo said on the way back to buenos aires castillowho looked carefullycouldnt find anyone following him nevertheless he twice left the autopista and drove around crowded neighborhood streets before getting back on the autopista if anybody can trail me though all that hes a genius which is not the same as saying no one has six the restaurant kansas avenida libertador san isidro buenos aires province argentina august when he pulled into the parking lot castillo saw that despite the some what chilly weather there were a few people sitting under umbrellas in the patio outside the bar and he went there and took a table a strikingly goodlooking waitress almost immediately appeared and he ordered a warsteiner beer and a club sandwich although after the pancakes hed had at pevsners house he wasnt very hungry he took a cellular phone from his briefcase and tried to turn it on the panel didnt light up dammit the batterys dead what did you expect inspector clouseau that you could just throw the phonewith a probably mostly exhausted batteryinto your briefcase and then expect it to work when you want to use it a week later and whats going to happen if i find someplace that has a charger that will fit when the battery is completely dead does that wipe out the memory i have no damned idea at all where i can get munzs cellular numberor for that matter darbys or santinis or anyone elsesif i cant get them off this cellular there was a pleasant chirp from the cellular the cellulars panel lit up a smiling cartoon face appeared as did the greetinghola it works castillo said aloud hola hola hola and then punched an autodial number el coronel alfredo munz answered on the second ring munz hows your arm castillo asked in german there was a justperceptible hesitation before munz asked same cellular number yes ill call you munz said and the connection was broken castillo took the phone from his ear and pushed the call end button something was really bothering munz it showed in his voice and what he said if he was unwilling to speak on his cellular that meant he suspected someone was listening to his calls well ill find out what it is he pushed another autodial button and darby answered on the second ring hola do they sell pancake flour in that embassy store castillo asked there was a moments hesitation and then darby replied yeah i know they do send ricardo solez to get me five pounds of it castillo ordered and have him get me a charger for my cellular its a motorola model number i know what it is it belongs to me ill explain later castillo said is there another black car available yes there is maybe he could pick that up at the same time youre not going to tell me whats going on when i see you im expecting another call alex have to break this off the cellular buzzed just as the beer and club sandwich were delivered hola where are you munz asked kansas in san isidro are you alone driving im alone ive got a cherokee registered in mar del plata do you know where unicenter is on the panamericana unicenter is the largest shopping mall in south america yeah you approach it from the panamericana and its on your left and when you turn in there are two garages one for jumbo the other for unicenter go into the jumbo garage and park nose out close to the exit make sure your doors arent locked fifteen minutes the cellular went dead what the hell is going on castillo got up from the table found the goodlooking waitress and handed her money that was my wife he said with a smile i was supposed to pick her up fifteen minutes ago there was a good deal of traffic and castillo had a little trouble finding unicenter it was twenty minutes before he pulled into the huge jumbo supermercados parking lot he drove slowly through it looking for munz when he couldnt find him he backed the cherokee into a slot as close to the exit as he could find then turned off the ignition and checked to see the doors were unlocked not quite a minute later he heard the rear door opening dont turn around munz said just get out of here turn left when you do if there is no traffic at the next left take that and get back onto the panamericana if there is traffic dont make the left check to see if anyones following there was a long line of cars and trucks inching along the street to the left so castillo continued straight he looked into the outside mirrors to get a make on the cars immediately behind him and then adjusted the interior rearview mirror to see the backseat he couldnt see munz which means hes lying on the floor theres a green peugeot a volkswagen bug and fiat uno behind us try to lose them munz ordered castillo made an abrupt right turn and accelerated fifty yards later he hit a speed bump he heard munz groan jesus he must be lying on his wounded shoulder that must have really hurt sorry alfredo castillo called anybody behind you no then slow down a little and keep weaving through the streets you might as well head for libertador whos following us i wish to hell i knew munz said when you get to libertador turn toward the city look for a coto supermarket on the left pull into the parking lot behind it as castillo parked the cherokee he saw that the only people in the parking lot were women loading plastic bags of groceries into their cars nobody followed us castillo said and theres nobody close in the parking lot you want to come up front castillo heard munz sigh then the sound of the rear door opening a moment later he slipped into the front seat so how are you alfredo castillo asked in german until you got that speed bump karl i was feeling all right im sorry about that munz made a deprecating gesture who are we running from castillo asked and why people are watching me munz said seriously and then when he heard himself chuckled and added they probably want to beam me up to their spaceship and extract my sperm said the paranoid castillo chuckled who i dont know what i do know is the morning after you went to the statesi slept all of the day you left and right through the night thanks to those little yellow pills sergeant kensington gave mewhen i went onto my balcony there was a car a citroen with two men in it parked across the street there was a pair of binoculars on the dashboard and there have been other cars other people ever since but you dont know who no and i wasntstill am notin any condition to ask people questions did you tell pevsner munz shook his head why not castillo sensed that munz was making up his mind whether to reply at all now that im no longer the head of side im not as much use to senor pevsner as i was he said finally perhaps hes decided im now a liability if i wasnt around there are all sorts of questions that i would not be able to answer about him castillo considered his own reply carefully before making it unfortunately alfredo thats a real possibility munz nodded i didnt ask about your shoulder castillo said and i didnt ask what youre doing back here in argentina why didnt you because i wasnt at all sure you would tell me the truth that is so why bother write this down alfredo im one of the good guys you very well may be munz said but i dont know that do i tell me about your shoulder two days agomy wife insistedi went to dr rommines apartment you remember him from the german hospital munz nodded hes a friend he owes me a couple of favors he didnt believe me when i told him id had an accident cleaning my pistol why not he said well whatever physician removed the bullet did a firstclass job he must be a foreigner or you werent in argentina when you shot yourself those degradable sutures arent available here you didnt tell him what happened munz shook his head he knows better than to ask he really doesnt want to know im sorry you took that bullet alfredo i was hoping by now you would have learned who those bastards were munz said and would be willing to tell me ive got some suspicions but i just dont know if i have to say this i can take care of myself its my family im worried about and thats a bona fide worry after what these bastards did with mr masterson how much can you tell me about the money munz asked what money howard kennedy said there was a lot of money in lorimers safe munz said he asked you about the money castillo asked incredulously munz nodded i realize karl that there are things you cant tell me munz said did kennedy say how much money no but i had the feeling there was a lot what did you do find it after i was hit when castillo didnt immediately reply munz said i just finished saying i understand there are things you cant tell me but im desperate karl this now involves my family ill tell you what i can do alfredo i can take you and your family to the states where youll all be safe until i find out who these bastards are and deal with them thats a nice thought but i dont have the money for airplane tickets much less to support my family in the states the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund will take care of that castillo said the what there was a lot of moneyin sortof cashiers checksin lorimers safe alfredo almost sixteen million dollars id like to know how kennedy knew about it anyway we took it its out of the country i control it i call it the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund you and your family will have all the money you need in the states for as long as you need it can you do that why would you you took a bullet for us we owe you i knew what i was doing when i went with you we owe you castillo said flatly youve got your passports munz nodded but not visas could you arrange visas not a problem ill get you visas if i have to go to the president im not going munz said dont be a fool alfredo i accept with profound gratitude karl your offer for my wife and daughters but im not going to let these bastards chase me out of argentina castillo looked at him but said nothing maybe i can be of some small use to you karl munz said in finding these people you can be of a lot of use to me if youre willing and understand what youre getting into whatever you ask of me munz said castillo reached for the ignition key and started the engine where are we going munz asked to an apartment in belgrano castillo said in the us army mi coronel this is known as getting the fucking circus off its ass and onto the road before he left the parking lot when he was still waiting for a break in the traffic on avenida libertador castillo had second thoughts jesus what am i going to do with munz at that apartment theres already too many people there and more are coming youre not thinking clearly carlos that your ass is dragging for understandable reasons is an explanation not an excuse he looked out the back window of the cherokee then shifted into reverse and quickly backed the truck into an open space was ist los karl munz asked concerned i need to think a minute alfredo castillo said believe it or not there are people who think i dont do nearly enough of that he shut off the ignition took out a cigar carefully lit it and for the next three minutes appeared to be doing nothing more than puffing on the cigar and staring in rapt fascination at the glowing tip then he exhaled audibly took out his cellular phone and punched an autodial button alex darby answered on the second ring have you been keeping santini up to speed darby didnt seem surprised or off ended at the lack of opening courtesy i thought that was the thing to do he said i want to meet with your boss castillo said as soon as possible i think thats a good idea you want me there thats why i asked about santini id rather you did the real estate okay could you take sergeant kensington and his radio out there with you id like to get that set up as soon as possible not a problem wheres yung howell just called yung should be at jorge newbery in thirty minutes can you have somebodysolez maybe or sienomeet him and sit on him anywhere but where you are for a couple of hours we are a little crowded here arent we darby replied solez i think id rather have sieno here okay you want me to call our friend and tell him youre coming hell i dont even know if hes there i dont want to go to his office any reason i dont want the argentine rentacops to recognize who i have with me let me call him and see what he suggests ill call you back tell tor and davidson that kocian is not to leave the apartment or make any telephone calls under any circumstances okay ill get right back to you one way or the other hola how long will it take you to make it to our friends house on libertador darby asked give me thirty minutes hell be waiting for you on the sidewalk drive past his office on the way you mention the rentacops to him he understands ill be in touch castillo said broke the connection and turned to look at munz ill get in the back again munz said when we get close pull onto a side road you understood about the rentacops munz nodded so they do work for side some of them do munz said i didnt know you brought yung back with you i sent him back here castillo said and last night he was shot by a uruguayan cop who killed the guyno identification on the bodywho was trying to stick a needle full of ketamine in him they wanted to question him about the money what else happened at the estancia hes not badly injured alfredo just a flesh wound to the hand thank you for asking if he was badly hurt you would have said something munz said reasonably castillo shook his head started the engine and drove to libertador this time there was a break in the traffic and he headed for buenos aires x one residence of the united states ambassador avenida libertador y calle john f kennedy palermo buenos aires argentina august the ambassadors residence is a stately centuryold mansion two blocks across a park from the rather ugly modern building of the embassy by following darbys orders to drive past his office on the waywhich meant approaching the ambassadors office in the embassy from the place ditaliacastillo with munz again on the back floor of the cherokee came up to the residence on calle john f kennedy a quiet street instead of avenida libertador which is eight lanes wide and heavy with traffic there was more reason too to darbys orders castillo saw ambassador juan manuel silvio standing on the sidewalk smoking a cigar and apparently having a pleasant chat with members of both the policia federal and the embassyhired argentine rentacops when the cherokees turn signals indicated castillos intention to enter the driveway of the residence two of the rentacops quickly moved to see who he was hola carlos ambassador silvio cried cheerfully he moved quickly to the cherokee gesturing for castillo to put the window down then he called for one of the policia federal to open the gate ive been waiting for you carlos silvio said through the window opened barely more than a crack as soon as they get the gate open drive right in and around the corner of the building no rentacop was going to push the ambassador himself aside to inspect the interior of a vehicle the gate opened and castillo drove into the drive past the ornate front door and around the corner of the building as he did a service door of some kind opened and a man castillo recognized as ken lowery the embassys security officer appeared and came up to the car wheres your passenger colonel he asked in the backseat castillo said then raised his voice you going to need some help to get out alfredo just open the door munz said lowery opened it then stood to the side blocking the view of anyone who might have come around the corner of the building munz his head ducked went quickly into the building castillo followed him inside lowery then came in closing the door after him castillo saw that they were in a corridor outside of what looked like an unused kitchen good to see you again colonel munz lowery said in spanish and put out his hand when munz winced as he shook it lowery asked whats wrong hurt your shoulder i dont think you want to know ken castillo said quickly obviously silvio hasnt told him much if anything how much am i going to tell him sorry lowery said and held up both hands palms out ambassador silvio appeared i think we better use the service elevator he said without further preliminaries and signaled them into the kitchen the elevator was small and some what battered in the grand old days this was used to carry food to the apartment silvio volunteered about the only use it gets now is when theres a reception but you cant see who gets on it by peering in the front door tony santinis on the way castillo asked he should be here any minute silvio said as he pulled open the elevator door and gestured for the others to get off thank you for seeing me on such short notice sir castillo said i was really hoping you would come to see mecolonel that news got around quick didnt it from a very high source silvio said she also said that the president was very pleased with the way youve been handling things he paused smiled wryly and added in diplomacy thats known as imparting information circuitously castillo smiled at him congratulations colonel silvio said in my judgment its well deserved i can only hope sir that you will feel the same way when weve had our conversation castillo said silvio led them into the living room of his apartment and waved them into a couch and armchairs sir id like a moment alone with you please castillo said why dont we step into my kitchen the ambassador said nodding toward a swinging door ken castillo said turning to look at lowery years ago when i was an aidedecamp to a general officer known for his piquant speech he told me that telling someonea good guythat he did not have the need to know of certain information was like telling him that his male member had been measured and judged not to be large enough for the task at hand lowery smiled but his face showed that he anticipated what he was sure was coming next silvio smiled and shook his head in your case castillo went on im going to tell you that i am operating under the authority of a presidential finding and anything you might learn here today is classified top secret presidential and im going to evade my responsibility in this matter by dumping it on the ambassador he turned to look at silvio you sir are authorized to tell mr lowery anything you think he should know i understand the ambassador said simply and i still need a moment alone with you sir silvio waved toward the swinging door thank you for that charley silvio said when they were in the far corner of the kitchen lowery is a good man he smiled and added he would be hurt to be told his male member had been measured and found wanting im not sure it was the right thing to do castillo said but im not thinking too clearly you look exhausted silvio said i am and thats dangerous thats why im grateful you could see me secretary cohen made it clearif obliquelythat you are calling all the shots because i need your advice anything i can do to help charley i want to say this before we get started i dont want to drag you down with me if this whole thing blows up in my face silvio made a deprecating gesture which seems more likely every minute castillo finished so i give you my word that i will swear on a stack of bibles that i told you littlevirtually nothingabout whats happened and what im doing or trying to do i very much appreciate that but why dont we cross that bridge when we get to it and why do you think its going to blow up in your face everyone else including me seems to have a good deal of confidence in you ive got too many balls in the air and im not that good a juggler castillo said so what im going to dowith my word that i will deny having ever told youis tell you what they are and ask for your suggestions before we get into that may i ask about mr masterson and the children where are they how are they theyre fine theyre with mr mastersons family on their plantation in mississippi until now theyve had some delta force shooters protecting them today or maybe tomorrow the shooters will be replaced by some retired special forces types who are pretty good i thinkand god i hope im rightthat the threat to them has been drastically reduced by lorimers death they no longer need mr masterson to point them to lorimer that makes sense silvio said and special agent schneider how is she shes in a hospital in philadelphia with her jaws wired shut almost certainly wondering why i havent been to see her as promised silvio shook his head sympathetically im sure shell understand he said i hope youre right sir castillo said after a long moment silvio said tell me what you think i should know charley please castillo took a moment to organize his thoughts and then began just before i came down here the first time to see what i could find out about mr mastersons kidnapping i called otto gorner the general director of the tages zeitung newspapers in germany to tell him i was coming down here he saw the question on silvios face stopped then explained i have an alter ego as karl gossinger the washington correspondent of the tages zeitung newspapers i decided the best way to come down here as the presidents fly on the wall was to come as karl gossinger castillo stopped again when he saw more unspoken questions on silvios face the tages zeitung newspapers are owned by gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh my mothers maiden name was gossinger silvios eyebrows rose but he didnt respond directly instead he asked and this man knows what you really do for a living then he suspected now he knows castillo said anyway i asked himprimarily so i would have an excuse for being here as gossingerif there was anything i should look into for him while i was here he told me a rich man from hamburg is planning to raise the graf spee from montevideo harbor silvios eyebrows rose again and he said thats the first ive heard of that and then reluctantly he told me that the newspapers were working on a story that some germans were sending iraqi oilforfood money down here to hide it the way the nazis did in world war two then he said he was sorry that hed brought the subject up that people looking into it had been killed and that i was to leave it alone and then i came down here and things started happening and i forgot what gorner had said about oilforfood money while i was getting the mastersons out of argentina and then the president issued the finding i had absolutely no idea where to start looking for the people who murdered masterson except that there very probably was a connection between masterson and his brotherinlaw the missing un diplomat so i started there silvio nodded his understanding so i went to paris a source told me that lorimer was the bagman for the oilforfood a source silvio interrupted howard kennedy a former fbi hotshot who changed sides and now works for alek pevsner i know that name silvio said why would pevsner tell you i presume kennedy wouldnt have done that without pevsners permission or more likely at pevsners orders wouldnt you prefer to know as little about pevsner andor kennedy as possible i presume your offer to deny telling me anything is still open it is it will stay open castillo said okay pevsner has struck a deal with the president he makes himself usefuli found the missing with his help and i dont think i could have otherwiseand the president orders the fbi so long as pevsner doesnt violate any us laws to stop looking for himand for kennedyand orders the cia to stop trying to arrange pevsners arrest by any other government thats very interesting silvio said who else knows about that secretary hall secretary cohen and ambassador montvale know about the deal the director of the fbi and the dci know theyve been ordered to lay off pevsner i dont know how much if anything they know about the deal silvio nodded thoughtfully castillo went on what kennedy told me about lorimer was confirmed by the cia station chief in paris who told me he was sure that lorimer was now in little pieces in the seine or the danube from paris i went to fuldato gorner at the tages zeitungand told him that i needed to have all the information he had about the oilforfood payoffs he gave me what he had on condition i not make it available to the cia or the fbi or anyone else and told me that eric kocian the publisher of the budapester tages zeitung had more information so i went to budapest and kocian reluctantly and with the same caveat that i couldnt share anything with the fbi or the cia gave me what he had kocian also believed that lorimer had already been eliminated then i came back hereactually to montevideoto see what yung might have in his files about any of it he had a file on jeanpaul bertrand a lebanese national and a dealer in antiquitieswho was of course lorimer and who was alive on his estancia so i set up the operation to grab lorimerbertrand and repatriate him and you know what happened at the estancia we were bushwhacked lorimer and one of my men were killed and colonel munz wounded doesnt bushwhacked imply you walked into a trap silvio asked ive thought about that its possible but i think it was more likely just a coincidence the people lorimer was running fromand theyre goodfound him and they got to the estancia right after we did theres no one who could have told them about your operation where did you get the helicopter i got the chopper from pevsner pevsners here silvio asked surprised in argentina if i dont answer that question you can swear both that you dont know where pevsner is and that i refused to tell you where he is silvio nodded consider the question withdrawn i had to threaten pevsner with the withdrawal of his presidential protection to get the chopper he doesnt want to lose that the cia really would like some otherany othergovernment to catch him and either bury him in a prison for the rest of his life or take him out why silvio asked the cia used him to move things around bought weapons from him theyd like that buried no alek pevsner didnt set us up it would not be in his best interests and he never puts anything above his best interests castillo started to say something then stopped and took out his cigar case he offered it to silvio who nodded his thanks and they both carefully lit up it was obvious that both were thinking we took the contents of lorimers safe with us castillo said finally among them were sort of cashiers checks for nearly sixteen million dollars that he had in three uruguayan banks can i say something silvio asked please ambassador mcgrory knows about that money its the basis of his theory that lorimer was a drug dealer youre saying you have it castillo nodded he puffed his cigar exhaled then said i will deny telling you this ambassador montvale suggested and the president went along with him that we should take the money and use it to fund the office of organizational analysis most of it is in a bank in the cayman islands i call it the lorimer charitable and benevolent fund silvio smiled and shook his head thats why i sent yung back down here to cover our tracks castillo said youve heard hes been shot castillo nodded first i flew to paris for a look at lorimers apartment castillo said it had been previously searched by the deuxieme bureau the un and our cia guy nothing there then i went to fulda and cleared things up with otto gorner i told him what i was doingand on whose authorityand that i wanted to be released from my promise not to share his files with the fbi and the cia he agreed and gave me all his files then i went to budapest to get eric kocian to release me from my promise he was perfectly willing to do so primarily because parties unknown had tried to stick a needle in him on the franz josef bridge and when that failed shot him twice my god at one oclock the next morning castillos voice trailed off then he exclaimed my god that was yesterday morning you were in budapest yesterday morning silvio asked in surprise if not disbelief castillo nodded and at one oclock yesterday morning these peoplethis time two bad guysmade another attempt to murder kocian and to burn his apartment and whatever files he might have there you said attempt silvio questioned eric was still in the hospital castillo explained i was sleeping in the guest bedroom in his apartment erics dog woke me up instead of kocian they got me and a suppressed that i had the foresight to get from the cia armory at our embassy neither body had any identification on it but the garrote they used on one of kocians security men was a twin of the garrote used on sergeant kranz at the estancia so it seems pretty evident were dealing with the same people who are im beginning to think theyre either exeast german stasi or exhungarian allamvedelmi hatosagavhbut im not sure of that and have no idea who theyre working for so mr kocian and his files are all right in your possession one copy of the files sent in the diplomatic pouch from budapest should be in washington by now ive got another copy here eric kocian is in the apartment on avenida arribenos you brought him with you how did you get here so quickly him and his dog and his bodyguard an exhungarian cop who did a tour in the french foreign legion castillo chuckled i guess i didnt get around to telling you that the lorimer trust was burning a hole in my pocket so i bought a gulfstream iii with seven and a half million of it colonel torine and my cousin fernando flew it from washington spent about six hours in budapest and then we flew here which may explain why i do feel a tinge of fatigue im surprised youre able to walk around silvio said but not surprised im not making much sense youre doing fine charley so what are your plans here alex darby is right now renting a house for us at mayerling in pilar the lorimer trust will reimburse him kocian thinks theres a connection with mayerling and germanor more likely austrian and hungarianoilforfood money i dont know but eric is right more often than hes wrong the idea was that i would put kocian in the house and have yung and him compare notes they sent me a replacement for sergeant kranza friend of mine sergeant major jack davidsonwho has a lot of experience protecting people we served in afghanistan together he brought with him corporal lester bradley and i dont know what the hell to do with him just put him out there with davidson i suppose darby will move sergeant kensington and his radio out to mayerling as soon as he can somebody will have to sit on that around the clock lester can help with that and colonel munz silvio said hell work with yung and mr kocian now that hes been shot i dont think yung will want to be out there and that brings up colonel munz he paused you beginning to understand why this inept juggler is worried about all the balls he has in the air so far so good charley you havent dropped any yet stick around it wont be long castillo said they call that the law of inevitability tell me about colonel munz silvio said smiling well he thinks people are following him around he doesnt know who they are but hes worried about his familya wife and two daughtersand i dont think hes paranoid he suspectsbut doesnt knowthat the people following him or at least some of them may work for pevsner and he knows enough about pevsner to know that pevsners policy for people who know too much about him is to give them a beauty mark in the forehead it took a moment for silvio to understand then he grimaced since munz took a bullet for us castillo said i told him i would take him and his family to the states until we find out who these people are and stop them theyll need visas not a problem silvio said the bureaucrats in foggy bottom keep whittling away at an ambassadors authority but im still the man with the last word on who gets a visa thatll have to be done today and i havent quite figured out how to do it it can be done munz doesnt want to go he wants to stay here and help find out who these bastards are how badly is he hurt his shoulder i dont know if he can use a weapon or not why does it have to be today silvio asked because a i have still more balls to juggle in the states and b i need to talk to ambassador montvale as soon as i can he said the same about you theres a secure line here if you want to use it thank you a little later castillo said and then asked do you think santinis out there by now id be surprised if hes not thank you very much sir for what this is probably one more manifestation of exhaustion but i really feel a hell of a lot better than when we walked in here almost euphoric im glad silvio said but i strongly recommend that as soon as were finished with lowery and santini you get some rest a lot of rest i just dont have the time right now maybe i can get some sleep in the gulfstream on the way to the states silvio looked at him thoughtfully for a moment then said you said you wanted my advice still want it yes sir youve been talking about juggling balls and being an inept juggler castillo nodded i think youre a very good juggler charley if you start dropping balls it will be because youre exhausted not because youre inept stop pushing yourself you have limits even if you dont like to admit it i readily admit it physical limits mental limits and half a dozen other kinds once everyone is set up in the safe house in mayerling and you get colonel munzs family to the states i can see no reason why you cant take fortyeight hours off can you i have to go see ambassador montvale as soon as i get to the states and i dont think i can put that off for fortyeight hours theres my proof that youre exhausted and need rest even i can think of a way to get around that how dont let him know youre going to the states tomorrow tell him youre going the day after tomorrow better yet the day after that you mean stay here another fortyeight hours i cant do that i want to get munzs family out of here as quickly as possible i didnt suggest that you stay here for another fortyeight hours silvio said castillo met his eyes you are a friend arent you castillo said after a moment my advice is to go to philadelphia and see special agent schneider from what ive seen of you two shes the only person in the world who can get your mind off this and thats what you really have to do get your mind off everything about this for fortyeight hours so that when you go back to work youll be running on all eight cylinders it would be very nice to be running on all eight cylinders when i go to see montvale and almost suicidal not to be he paused then met silvios eyes again thank you very much silvio nodded and waved at the swinging door leading to his living room two tony santini was standing by the large picture window of the simply but richly appointed living room of the ambassadors residence when castillo and silvio entered before we get into this charley santini said evenly where do you want solez to sit on yung you were a little vague about that where are they now he called two minutes ago theyre riding around in the park near the waterworks santini said gesturing toward the river plate the buenos aires potablewater plant was near the river not far from the jorge newbery airfield five minutes or so from the ambassadors residence when castillo didnt immediately reply santini added yungs anxious to see you and hes got another fbi agent with him whats that about castillo wondered aloud then went on immediately is he in a black car santini shook his head an embassy bmw we dont have much of a fleet of black cars charley mr ambassador can i bring them here castillo asked silvio nodded and picked up a telephone from a side table and punched a button this is ambassador silvio he said into the handset mr solez and two others will be at the gate in a few minutes please see they are sent to my apartment castillo wondered aloud i hope his having somebody with him doesnt mean that hes hurt worse than weve heard no one replied santini was already on his cellular ricardo come to the residence youre expected he said without any preliminaries then broke the connection yung solez and legal attache julio artigas came into silvios living room ten minutes later they made their manners to ambassador silvio santini and lowery then yung walked to castillo artigas was surprised at seeing castillo jesus christ hes not any older than i am and hes calling all the shots you all right dave castillo asked im in much better shape than my blazer major yung said it has at least a half dozen doubleaught buckshot holes in it castillo picked up on yungs attitude hes not sullen i was afraid he would be he didnt want to come down here and when he did he got shot i thought i would really be on his shit list but hes almost cheerful is he a little high on painkillers and this is castillo asked indicating artigas julio artigas major artigas answered im a legal attache in montevideo castillo took the offered hand and what brings you to buenos aires mr artigas their eyes met causing artigas to conclude this is one tough intelligent character i asked him to come major yung said castillo looked questioningly at him artigas has pretty well figured out whats going on major yung said figured out what thats going on castillo asked colonel ambassador silvio began castillo saw that yung had picked up on the rank mr artigas was taken to the estancia by the uruguayan national police silvio continued hesbeen aroundthis situation practically from the beginning and he was with chief inspector ordonez when ordonez took lowery and me to the estancia yung said and how much did youandor lowerytell him nothing he hadnt already pretty well figured out for himself majdid the ambassador call you colonel yes i did silvio said well congratulations yung said well deserved he is high castillo thought theres no other explanation for that he seems genuinely pleased thank you castillo said as yung enthusiastically pumped his hand what did they give you for the pain dave castillo asked nothing i took a couple of aspirin ill be damned artigas youre a problem i didnt expect castillo said mr ambassador may i use your secure line of course silvio said its in a small closet euphemistically referred to as my office three sir castillo told silvio if youll get a secure line to the white house switchboard no one in the embassy will know im here ill have to go through the state department switchboard theyll switch you over silvio picked up the heavily corded handset this is silvio would you get me a secure line to the department switchboard please that took about twenty seconds and then the ambassador said this is ambassador silvio please get me a secure connection to the white house switchboard he handed off the handset to castillo and said ill leave you alone please stay castillo said silvio nodded white house colonel castillo i need ambassador montvale on a secure line ambassador montvales secure line a familiar voice said this is colonel castillo mr ellsworth put the ambassador on please ten seconds passed before montvale came on the telephone hello charley he said cordially ive been hoping to hear from you hows things going a lot has happened mr ambassador can i give you a quick rundown then fill you in completely when im in washington when do you think that will be charley castillo met silvios eyes i hope to get out of here late in the afternoon the day after tomorrow it may be twentyfour hours after that you must be very busy ive been pretty busy castillo said an attempt to kidnap my source in budapest was made when the kidnapping didnt go off they tried to kill him they wounded him twice the next morning they tried again this time to assassinate him in his apartment then burn the apartment and whatever information he might have had in it that attempt also failed hes all right i hope hes all right and his files are either en route to washington or already there and when am i going to get to see them as soon as they get there if you like but im afraid in the form theyre in that im going to have to translate them and i cant do that obviously until im in washington and that will not be for several days right just as soon as i can get there mr ambassador is your source safe in budapest i brought him to argentina with me personal jets are really nice things to have arent they oh you heard about that did you i hear things charley as you know that one i heard from major miller i had to remind him you had given me your word that i would be in the loop he did not however tell me where you had gone from budapest i had to learn that myself learn it or make a guess i made a guess and then sought confirmation have you by any chance been in touch with ambassador silvio or mr darby im calling from the residence sir ambassador silvio is with me mr darby is just outside and how is mr yung was he able to accomplish what you sent him down there to do before that horrifying carjacking incident you heard about that did you secretary cohen was good enough to call and tell me what ambassador mcgrory had called to tell her crime seems almost out of control down there doesnt it yungs here with me too he wasnt badly hurt i presume he did what i sent him to do or otherwise he would have said something im probably going to bring him to the states with me to do what to see what sense he can make of all the files we now have to work with are you also going to bring your source what im going to do is put my source in a safe house here that the lorimer charitable fund has rented and he will work with his files yungs files and whatever else i can get him the lorimer charitable fund i rather like that montvale said i dont want to appear to be looking for praise charley but you do remember my contribution to setting up the fund dont you and i shall be forever grateful to you sir is there anything else i can do for you charley now that you mention it theres an fbi agent a legal attache in the montevideo embassy one julio artigas who i think would be of far more use to ambassador silvio than he is to ambassador mcgrory could you arrange his transfer whats that all about hes come upon his ownwith answers to questions ambassador mcgrory may ask him is anyone else liable to do that i hope not i dont think so ill have a word with director schmidt the first chance i have today would be nice sir as soon as we get off the phone would be even better that important eh consider it done will you spell that name for me please castillo did so got it montvale said thats all i have sir until i can get to washington and brief you fully the sooner you can do that the better yes sir i understand we still have the matter of exploding briefcases to deal with you know i find that quite worrisome yes sir so do i and ill get on that as soon as i can good to hear from you charley always a pleasure to talk to you sir castillo said and clicked the phone when the operator came on he told her break it down then hung up he looked at ambassador silvio ambassador montvale gave me everything i asked for castillo said and no static why does that make me very nervous ambassador silvio smiled but didnt reply directly theyre waiting for us in the living room he said four artigas solez munz santini and yung talking quietly among themselves while cooling their heels on two of the couches got to their feet as castillo and ambassador silva came into the room the look on artigass face reminded castillo of what hed said about him being an unexpected problem just before getting on the secure line to montvale he knows i was talking to someone about him but the look on his face is concern not fear he is concerned about what the great and allpowerful colonel castillo has had to say about himbut not afraid he knows hes done nothing wrong so why should he be afraid i think i like this guy lets see how smart he is okay artigas castillo said why dont you tell me what you think you have figured out about what may have happened down here artigas was visibly unhappy about being ordered to do that its all right mr artigas ambassador silvio said what you say will get no further than this room and its important to colonel castillo and myself to know how much highly classified information may have been deduced or intuited by you yes sir artigas said and proceeded to clearly outline his suspicions and the conclusions he had drawn from them and why castillo was very impressed with how much artigas had deduced or intuited this guy is very smart hes figured out just about everything that went downexcept of course who the ninjas were or where they came from and nobody knows that the downside of that of course is that if hes figured this out some of the other fbi agents have probably done the same thing how much of this have you discussed with anyone else castillo asked with other fbi agents or anyone else no one sir youre sure castillo pursued yes sir artigas youre being transferred from the montevideo embassy to the embassy here castillo said what jesus christ artigas thought then asked whens that going to happen castillo thought not i am or why or dont i have anything to say about that or even says who just when its happening now castillo said ambassador mcgrory will be told only that youre being transferred if anyone asks you you will say you have no idea why thats happening thats easy artigas said because i dont have any idea why thats happening did yung or howell mention anything about a presidential finding castillo asked yeah artigas said and smiled and shook his head but only hypothetically colonel and then they said they would deny ever discussing even a hypothetical presidential finding with me castillo chuckled ambassador silviosmiled everyone take your seat castillo said get comfortable when they had castillo went on okay this is not hypothetical artigas from now on anything ior anybody connected in any way with this operationtells you is classified top secret presidential yes sir there has been a presidential finding it established the office of organizational analysis a covert and clandestine unit within the department of homeland security i am the chief the mission is to ten minutes later castillo ended his uninterrupted lecture until you hear otherwise from meme not from anyone elseyou are on detached duty with ooa he smiled and added this is the point where the lecturer invariably says are there any questions im not going to do that ive got several hundred questions artigas thought then said not even one question one castillo said what am i going to do good question the answer is until i figure that out you are going to contribute whatever you can from your vast fund of professional knowledge to the solving of a number of little problems ooa faces like what artigas said smiling you got one question you spent it castillo said meeting artigass eyes castillo then looked at the others and went on the priority problem is how to get colonel munzs family out of here as safely as quickly and as secretly as possible he paused mr ambassador may i respectfully suggest that this would be a splendid time for you to find something else to do i think not colonel silvio said i really decided a while back that this is one of those in for a penny in for a pound situations maybe i can be helpful youre sure sir silvio nodded castillo shrugged tony did alfredo tell you about the people surveilling him castillo asked uhhuh okay then lets do this the military way by seniority i think youre senior tony so tell us how were going to do that i need all the facts charley and i dont think i have them santini said what are you missing that friend of yours who speaks russian santini said whats his role in this and a half dozen other languages castillo offered alek pevsner the russian arms dealer mafioso ken lowery asked jesus i saw a new interpol warrant for himsmuggling i thinkjust a couple of days ago hes involved in this i saw that interpol warrant too artigas thought and a dozen others on him that guys a real badass and hes castillos friend castillo nodded the question is how is he involved hes here in argentina yung asked i am going to say as little about pevsner as i can castillo said as a matter of fact from this moment on he is codenamed putin and all references to him will be by his code name clear there were nods and yes sirs what about putins friend colonel yung asked my exfriend do we need a code name for him i think we do castillo said how does schmidt strike you artigass eyebrows rose at hearing the name of the director of the federal bureau of investigation now that ive burned my bureau bridges yung said thats fine with me artigas wondered now what the hell does that mean okay kennedy is now schmidt castillo said theres an fbi backchannel locatereportbutdonotdetain out on a former agent named howard kennedy artigas thought then said so aloud adding did you know that i suspected it castillo said same guy castillo nodded you used to work with him right yung artigas asked yung nodded uncomfortably dave when did you decide your bureau bridges were burned castillo asked couple of days ago yung said im still not sure if i burned them or you burned them for me but when i looked they were gloriously aflame how do you feel about that the question is how do you feel about it im glad to have you if thats what youre asking then i feel fine about it colonel yung said if hes not high on painkillers or anything else what the hell happened to make him change his mind castillo gave him a double thumbsup gesture okay santini said alfredo thinks its likely that some of the people after him are putins guys i think we have to accept that i think we have to presume that the ninjas are on him too and he thinks side may also be on him lets talk about that castillo said why do you think side is surveilling you alfredo what the argentine government wants to do is forgethave everyone forgetwhat happened to mr masterson munz replied and theyve heard what happened in uruguay and dont want to be surprised by any developments in the matter they dont know what my relationship with aleputin really was or is officially i was keeping an eye on putin for side they know hes here colonel ambassador silvio said i found him munz said simply then why didnt they act on one or more of the interpol warrants out on him do you know munz answered that with the gesture of rubbing the thumb and index finger of his right hand together all i was told was to keep him under surveillance he said and that a decision about what to do with him would come later is there a chance he will be arrested silvio asked munz shook his head and said if he has been as generous as i suspect he has if the decision to act on one or more of the interpol warrants is made hell be given sufficient warning before the order to go arrest him is given he paused and looked at castillo but to answer your question karl theyre watching me so they wont be surprised by anything that might happen okay makes sense castillo said thought a long moment then asked if somebody tried to grab you or whack youor your familyand side was watching what would happen thats what worries me karl munz said id like to think that side was told to protect meusand that i left enough friends behind in side many of whom know my family so they would protect us orders or not but that may not be the case thats why im so grateful for your offer to get them out of here with thatand sidein mind charley santini said side runs a computer scan of people passing through immigration how hard would it be to smuggle them into uruguay castillo asked if thats possible we could pick them up at carrasco with the gulfstream i dont think side is scanning uruguayan immigration are they alfredo artigas thought gulfstream jesus christ has he got his own airplane we haveexcuse me side has munz corrected himself as he no longer was chief of side an arrangement where uruguayan immigration checks a list of names side gives them against people coming in or out and lets side know if anybody shows up i dont think my name is on that list i dont know if its smuggling or not colonel artigas said but they wouldnt have to go through immigration to get to uruguay all they need is their national identity card to get on an airplane or the buquebus ferry they dont take names hes right charley santini said the buquebus would be better munz said okay well do that castillo said first we get their passports stamped very quietly with a fiveyear multivisit visa ambassador silvio furnished you get me the passports colonel munz and ill take care of that thank you munz said first we get them visas and then on the buquebus castillo said then what ive got to go back to uruguay yung said and so come to think of it does artigas so he can look very surprised when mcgrory tells him hes been transferred over here one or both of us could go on the buquebus with them why do you have to go back to uruguay castillo asked ive got to get lorimer and his casket from the undertakers and out to the airport jesus i forgot all about him castillo said then heard what he had said and smiled and shook his head mr ambassador theres another example that im playing with far fewer than fiftytwo cards in my deck silvio said thats only proof colonel that you forgot the details of the repatriation of mr lorimers remains castillo raised an eyebrow then turned to yung tell me about those dave he said the casket will go on american airlines flight at five after nine tomorrow night it could have gone tonight but the body wasnt ready the body wasnt ready castillo parroted i was afraid the bastards father might insist on opening the casket when i saw the body in the english hospital it looked awful so i took some clothes from the estancia and told the undertaker to dress him and to do a better job of sewing him up than the hospital did after the autopsy that was a very nice thing for you to do mr yung ambassador silvio said and it would have been even nicer if you hadnt called the deceased the bastard castillo said yung looked at him ignored the comment and continued the airplane stops at ezeiza then goes to miami then the casketll be transferred to an american airlines flightive got the number somewhere if that details importantto new orleans and you have to go with it castillo said i wanted to talk to you about that yung said id much rather stay here jesus christ castillo thought hes really done a oneeighty if youre not on that airplane with the body castillo said ambassador mcgroryand othersare going to suspect you didnt come down here to repatriate the remains so you will be on it yes sir hes really disappointed and you will stay through the funeral theres no telling who might show up for that he paused then looked at santini tony could we get the secret service to make the plates of the cars at that funeral maybe the people themselves not a problem who are we looking for santini said names and addressesand photographs if that can be done discreetlyto feed to our database castillo said anything right now all we have is the database ill get on the horn santini said after that dave castillo said if you still want to come back here well see what can be worked out he saw that yung was pleased with that congratulations second lieutenant castillo you remembered that from leadership if at all possible do not discourage enthusiasm okay so where does that leave us santini said the passports and what else the pancake flour and maple syrup castillo said artigas thought the what i got it santini said whats that all about where is it right now castillo asked in the trunk of the embassy bmw solez said its for putin castillo said i promised it to him artigas thought incredulously he promised pancake flour and maple syrup to aleksandr pevsner international thug id love to know what thats all about charley santini said alfredo castillo said is there any way you can communicate with your wife without using your home phone munz nodded i can call her and give her a message something innocuous that tells her to go to the phone in the kiosk around the corner from the house how is she about taking orders without question ordinarily not good at all munz said smiling but under these circumstances he paused she knows i didnt shoot myself cleaning my pistol and shes seen the cars what about your daughters theyll do what their mother tells them to do how do you think this would work castillo began you get her on the kiosk phone and tell her to pick up your daughters and their passportsand nothing else thats importantand take a taxi to unicenter is there a place you could meet her there in the food court munz said or for that matter the garage the food court would probably be better castillo said ill drive you back there and well sneak you in the way we sneaked you out you will meet them in the food court ill follow you up there and so will ricardo yung and artigas you will point us all out to them so they understand were the good guys you get the passports munz held up his hand and castillo stopped munz thought for a long moment then said okay so far karl go on you tell them to go shopping castillo continued underwear maybe dresses whatever else theyll need for two three days no luggage shopping bags only they wont be going back to the apartment munz asked no theyll take a cab to the buquebus terminal arriving no more than ten minutes before they have to theres a ferry leaving at ninethirty munz said it gets to montevideo about one in the morning which means they would have to be there at ninefifteen considering the traffic theyd have to leave unicenter no later than eightthirty he looked at his watch its now ten to six itll be tight but that much can be done whats the rest artigas will have taken a cab to buquebus right after you point out him and yung to your family thats a so he can buy the tickets and b in case yung who will stay in unicenter with your familyand follow them in another taxi to buquebussomehow gets separated from them in other words artigasll be at the terminal with their tickets and passports when your family gets there that should reassure them a little and theyll stay with them as long as theyre in uruguay im not going to drive them ricardo solez asked youre going to take the passports bring them here have them stamped and then take them to artigas at the buquebus terminal got it castillo went on alfredo is going to get in his carhe left it in the unicenter parking lotand take putin the pancake flour and maple syrup artigas decided pancake flour and maple syrup have to be code names for somethingsomething they dont want me to know about but what and hes going to tell putin that i called him had him meet me at unicenter and gave him the flour and syrup then asked him to take it to him he will also cleverly drop into their conversation that i told him i was going to the states either tonight or tomorrow munz nodded im going to follow him out thereand i think i better have a weapontony i just happen to have a spare glock in my briefcase santini said im going to wait for alfredo in the supermarket parking lot near where putins holed up you know where i mean alfredo munz nodded when munz comes back from delivering the flour and syrup to putin he will drive to his apartment with me following him there he will put his car in the garage go to his apartment and turn on the lights then turn them off again and go out of the apartment and to the kiosk around the corner somehow during this time he will get into the backseat of the cherokee without being noticed and ill take him to the apartment on arribenos whats that munz asked its where youll spend tonight castillo said tomorrow presuming nothing went wrong with renting it youand eric kocian max and kocians bodyguardwill as quietly as possible be moved to a safe house in the mayerling country club in pilar who are those people munz asked one is a man named eric kocian hes a journalist hes got a lot of material i want you to go through to see if we can make a connection i dont like journalists much myself munz said but he needs a bodyguard castillo nodded they tried to kill him twice in the last week they also tried to stick a needle full of phenothiazine in him youll like the bodyguard he used to be an inspector in the budapest police department and before that a hitch in the french foreign legion they speak spanish german and hungarian and the third one max something you said max bouvier castillo said he doesnt talk much another bodyguard karl oh yes castillo said jesus christ charley santini said shaking his head alfredo hes pulling your leg max is a dog an enormous dog munz looked at castillo true castillo said which just made me think of something i was planning to move kocian to the master bedroom in the suite in the four seasons hes in his eighties has two mm holes in him and just flew from budapest but i cant do that obviously with max hes going to have to stay in that apartment and wont like it leave the dog in the apartment solez said not an option where kocian goes so does max he even had him in his hospital room in budapest which just made me think of something santini said what do we do with familia munz in montevideo until you can pick them up with the gulfstream alfredo took me to a firstrate hotel in carrasco castillo began i sent you there ambassador silvio said the belmont house ill call over and get them a suite no castillo said that would involve you personally i dont want that ill call well have to get them to hold the room anyway if that boat doesnt get over there until one oclock in the morning and where is familia munz going in the states santini asked washington jesus i didnt even think about that castillo thought he then said not at first at first we need something in the boonies carlos solez said the ranch my first thought just now was to take them to the plantationtheres people already there sitting on the masterson familybut obviously that wasnt one of my brighter ideas when dona alicia sent me the email about you getting promoted she said she had just been up to the ranch and it was so hot she wasnt going back until november castillo chuckled it does get a bit warm in midland in august doesnt it okay ill give abuela a call and ask her to stay away until further notice tony can we get some secret service people to go to midland until i can make better arrangements for alfredos family you can charley santini said and pointed in the general direction of the secure telephone artigas thought the ranch the plantation dona alicia abuela for christs sake abuela is spanish for grandmother does everything these people do come with a code name and how i am supposed to figure out what they mean okay castillo said ill do that ill call dona alicia and miller right now and while im doing that make sure everybody has everybody elses number on their cellulars and when you use them remember to use the code names which reminds me well need one for familia munz how about mother thats easy to remember santini said drily give me your cellular charley and ill make sure you have all the numbers castillo handed it to him then looked at ambassador silvio wordlessly asking permission to use the secure telephone silvio nodded and said of course that was a hell of a lot easier than i thought it would be castillo announced when he came back into the room several minutes later he looked at santini and went on joel was there he said no problem and gave me a number to call when we know when well be at the ranch and theyll be waiting for us he said to tell you hello santini nodded castillo turned to solez dona alicia sends you a kiss she made me promise to get a little rest while im having our meeting at the ranch solez nodded castillo turned to munz the ranch is outside midland texas alfredo its been in my family for a very long time its pretty large even by argentine standards the reason for that is here you wonder how many head you can graze on one hectare out there we wonder how many hectares it will take to feed one steer enough so that we can move him to a feeding pen theres a nice house your family will be comfortable most important itll be absolutely safe theres an airstrip which cant be seen from the nearest road no one will know whos there and you heard what i said to joel about the secret service munz nodded thank you karl is that about it are we ready to move have we forgotten anything you can bet on that santini said but yeah we better get moving five unicenter panamericana highway buenos aires argentina august david w yung jr was more than a little embarrassed at the emotions he was feeling as he sat drinking a cup of hot chocolate with julio artigas at a small table in the food court a collection of fastfood vendors on the top floor of the vast multilevel shopping center he was sad and angry emotions he knew were inappropriate for a special agent of the fbi and especially for one who had just been assigned to the ooa and really wanted to stay there which meant that he was going to have to prove he had the ability to be really calm and professional under pressurenot sad and really pissedoff he had just watched colonel alfredo munz casually get up from another small round table forty feet awayone with a woman and two teenage girls sitting at itand walk to the mens room except going to take a leak and wash his hands wasnt what munz was really doing what munz was doing was carrying his familys passports to solez who was waiting for him in the mens room what that in effect meant was that munz was saying goodbye to his family for god only knew how long turning them over to the protection of peopleincluding a chinese man with a bandaged handwhom they had never seen before this showed on the girls faces they were young and pretty yung thought one was about sixteen years old the other a little olderon the cusp of young womanhoodand they were clearly frightened they should not be involved in something like this goddamn these bastards the younger girl glanced at their table yung caught her eye and smiled at her hoping it helped in some way tell her its going to be okay she looked startled for a moment then looked away i shouldnt have done that someone may have seen it but dammit i wanted to give her some sign of encouragement as choreographed solez came out of the mens room fumbled through his pockets and just perceptibly nodded at yung and artigas he took a package of cigarettes from his pocket and taking his time about it lit one with a zippo lighter munz also as planned came out a moment later took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket put one to his lips then looked unsuccessfully for a lighter or match he looked at solez then asked for a light solez produced his zippo and lit munzs cigarette munz looked very quickly at his wife and daughters then headed for the escalator solez walked in the other direction toward the elevator this too was according to plan castillo now appeared from the direction of the escalator he feigned pleasant surprise when he noticed yung and artigas and walked to their table they shook hands patted backs and made kissing gestures in the argentine manner now senora munz and the girls had seen all the players castillo walked toward the elevator artigas murmured see you at the terminal and got up and walked toward the escalator senora munz waited until munz had disappeared into the crowd that was waiting to get on the escalator then collected her purse and stood motioning for the girls to get up too yung fished a bill from his pocket and laid it on the table as a tip for the busboy he stood up and felt the weight of his semiautomatic pistol as it shifted slightly jesus christ he suddenly remembered i dont have a round in the chamber itll take forever to work the action with this goddamned bandaged hand he walked quickly into the mens room into a stall locked it took out the pistol and worked the action by pressing the slide against the toilet paper holder then he put the pistol back in his shoulder holster unlocked the stall door and hurried out of the mens room there was a moments panic when he couldnt immediately locate familia munz then he saw them in the knot of people waiting to get on the escalator the younger girl saw him walking toward them looked a little relieved and smiled he smiled at her again then made his way to the escalator xi one piso avenida arribenos belgrano buenos aires argentina august when paul sieno opened the steel apartment door for castillo and el coronel alfredo munz side retired castillo saw that the living room of the apartment was crowded eric kocian was sitting in a dark brown leather armchair his elegantly shod feet resting crossed on a leather ottoman he had a wineglass in one hand and a cigar in the other holding court castillo thought smiling a table holding platters of cheese and cold cuts bottles of wine and ginger ale and glasses was between two matching couches sandor tor sat beside susanna sieno on one of them sergeant major jack davidson and colonel jake torine sat on the other with corporal lester bradley squeezed in between them fernando lopez sat in an armchair obviously dragged from someplace else everyone looked at castillo and munz castillo thought davidsons wondering who the hell munz is and what hes doing here mr sieno very probably knows who he is so shes really curious about what hes doing here and everybodyincluding jack mr sieno even eric kocianis looking at me because they have the mistaken notion that james bond just walked in with the answers to all their questions the truth is once i get everybody settled in the safe house in mayerling and munzs family safely through uruguay and onto the gulfstream i dont have any idea what im going to do since i dont know who the bad guys are or even who theyre working for how the hell can i find the bastards im an army officer not sherlock holmes looks like were going to need some more chairs doesnt it paul sieno observed and went in search of them max who had been lying beside kocians chair got to his feet and with his stub of a tail rotating like a helo rotor walked quickly to castillo obviously delighted to see him castillo squatted and rubbed maxs ears until he started to behave like that to colonel castillo kocian announced i thought max to be an excellent judge of character the remark earned the chuckles and laughs kocian expected it to eric castillo said in hungarian say hello politely to oberst munz kocian replied in german since i dont speak a word of spanish how am i going to do that mr sieno smiled she was obviously taken with the old man try german castillo said guten abend herr oberst kocian said guten abend herr kocian munz replied youre a hessian kocian said still in german it was an accusation im an argentine munz said switching to english my parents were hessian karl why didnt you tell me the herr oberst speaks english kocian demanded you didnt ask castillo said then switching to english went on jack this is colonel alfredo munz kensington took a bullet out of his shoulder after the estancia operation davenport nodded alfredo jack and i have been many places together castillo felt a tug on his trouser leg he looked down to see that max had it in his mouth max let loose then sat and offered castillo his paw i think your friend is telling you that nature calls charley torine said cheerfully what obviously hes been waiting for you torine said he made ituhtoothfully clear that he wasnt going walking with any of us i would have been happy to take him karl kocian said but you made that impossible what had i known i was going to be held prisoner karlchen kocian said i would never have left budapest forgive me for trying to keep you alive eric castillo replied some what unpleasantly in german max was now at the door looking back at castillo castillo looked at sandor tor and asked in hungarian you have a leash tor reached into a wellworn leather briefcase by the side of his chair and took out a chain leash why do i suspect that briefcase also holds an uzi okay max castillo said as he took the leash im coming you want some company colonel davidson asked i can handle walking a dog jack castillo snapped after an awkward moments silence sieno offered when you leave the building turn right colonel theres a park a block away thanks paul castillo said and sorry i snapped at you jack my ass is dragging he heard what he had just said and added pardon the language mr sieno same excuse dont be silly she said and ive asked you to please call me susanna ill be right back castillo said max willing of course kocian said max dragged castillo through the lobby and out onto the street and headed for the first tree which was to the left away from the park sieno had spoken of your call max castillo muttered as if i have a choice it became quickly obvious that max did indeed have a massive need to meet the urinary call of nature can we go to the park now castillo asked in hungarian when he had finally finished max looked at castillo considered the question then dragged castillo farther away from the park the apartment building next to arribenos was brightly lit but beyond it the street quickly became dark as there were no brightly lit buildings and the streetlights were not functioning max sniffed every tree came to an intersection dragged castillo across it then across arribenos where he began nasally inspecting the trees there when he had stopped at the third tree there was a click and the sidewalk was brilliantly illuminated by floodlights mounted on an old mansion they were turned on by motion sensors well why not thats cheaper than burning floodlights all night then he noticed the bronze sign mounted on the wall of the old building it read embassy of the democratic republic of cuba oh shit i am not really conversant with the security practices of the cuban diplomatic service but it seems reasonable to assume that if they have gone to the trouble of installing motionactivated floodlights so they can see who is loitering in front of their embassy said motion sensors more than likely also activate one or more surveillance cameras he looked at max who apparently had taken castillos exclamation as a command and now was evacuating his bowels max isnt going to go anywhere until he finishes our likenesses are now recorded and filed under item on the suspicious activity log of the embassy security officer congratulations inspector clouseau youve just done it again aw fuck it lieutenant colonel c g castillo usa turned to face the cuban embassy put his right hand on his abdomen bowed deeply and said up yours fidel two have a nice long walk did you eric kocian asked as castillo and max came back into the sieno living room max trotted over to kocian gave him his paw allowed his head to be patted then lay down by the footstool the cubans now have a floodlighted recording of max making an enormous deposit on their sidewalk while i cheered him on what kocian asked thats why colonel sieno said masterfully keeping a straight face i suggested you go to the park max had other ideas castillo said then asked can they make me sieno thought it over before replying anybody follow you here i dont think so i came back by he stopped from the embassy i went down the hill turned left and came back that way i didnt see anybody following me then i dont see how lets hope they think you were a winefilled argentine yeah castillo said lets hope he looked around the room anything happen while we were talking our walk ambassador silvio called torine said he said to tell you that ambassador mcgrory called him to tell him that artigas has been transferred to buenos aires whos artigas an fbi agentone of those in montevideo looking for laundered money hes clever he pretty much figured out what happened at lorimers estancia so i figured the best way to make sure he kept his mouth shut was to have him assigned to ooa torine nodded we havent heard from alex darby castillo asked or anyone else alex darby three or four times sieno said the last bulletin was half an hour ago he expected then to finally have the owner the escribiano and the lawyer all in one place in the next few minutes explain that please castillo said one of the interesting requirements of argentine law is that when you sign a contractlike a lease on a house in mayerlingall parties have to be present at a meeting at which the escribiano who is sort of a super notary public reads the whole thing line by line aloud the lawyers function is to explain any questions about the contract they do about the same thing in mexico gringo fernando lopez said mr darby said that kensington has the radio set up and it shouldnt take more than an hour or so to finish signing the leasepresuming all parties did in fact show upand wants you to call him and tell him whether you want to move in out there tonight are there sheets and blankets etcetera castillo asked food i dont know about the sheets and blankets sieno said but i dont think there will be food and the argentines have another interesting custom when they move out of someplace they take the lightbulbs with them great castillo said theres a jumbo supermarket in pilar that would have everything we need susanna sieno said if you were to go out there and shop who would watch the cuban embassy most of thats automated she said and paul will be here wont he he will can i ask you to do that certainly lester will go with you castillo said go to pilar please and buy what you need in the jumbo but dont go to mayerling until we hear from darby that its a done deal and the owner and the others have left you want me to use our car she asked theres cd plates on it we have one of each she said take the one with regular plates castillo said she nodded can we get lester a weapon castillo asked the faces of both sieno and his wife showed their surprise at the request davidson chuckled there are those who refer to corporal bradley as deadeye dick he said hes one hell of a shot corporal bradley who had stood up and was standing almost at attention blushed mr darby sieno began pointing to the large duffel bag that castillo had seen him take out of the cherokee when hed first come to the apartment he didnt know what you would want so i brought two ms a riot gun a couple of glocks and a couple of as your call corporal bradley castillo said considering the circumstances as i understand them sir bradley said and the superior ballistics of the acp round over the mm if i may id like one of the ms and a a so ordered castillo said sieno smiled youre one of those are you corporal who doesnt think much of the mm yes sir actually its been proven conclusively that its inferior to the acp bradley proclaimed professionally and as a result of that determination the formerly obsolescent model a has been declared optional standard by the marine corps and if im not mistaken by special operations so it has deadeye davidson said smiling at sieno any other weapons questions for the corporal paul i think id better wrap the m in a blanket or something susanna said not completely able to restrain a smile and walked out of the living room there was a clatter of metal castillo saw that bradley was now sitting on the floor by the duffel bag that held the weapons he had already begun fieldstripping one of the a pistols had dropped a partand was already snatching it from the floor christ that was fast i have twenty bucks that says deadeye can fieldstrip that weapon faster than anyone in this room jack davidson said admiringly including with all respect colonel sir the senior special operator among us no bet castillo said corporal lester bradley made no move or sound to show that he had heard any of that exchange but the usually pink skin of his neck and cheeks now a dark rose color suggested that he had davidson pointed at him and shook his head admiringly ninety seconds after mr susanna sieno and corporal lester bradley had left the apartment castillos cellular vibrated and i still havent charged this thing hola carlos si our friends ricardo and antonio have just left here for the bus terminal with those papers alfredo was interested in castillo recognized the voice of ambassador silvio it took him a moment to understand antonio was tony santini if they miss the bus antonio said hed call both of us well lets hope they dont miss it thanks for the call well be in touch castillo broke the connection and looked at munz that was ambassador silvio the passports with visas are now on their way from the residence to the buquebus terminal charge the cellular munz nodded but said nothing the passports with visas are now on their way from the residence to the buquebus terminal charge the cellular jake torine parroted am i cleared for an explanation of that absolutely the battery in this is almost dead castillo said i didnt want to forget to charge it before i delivered the briefing so i said it out loud torine smiled and shook his head theres a charger in the bathroom sieno said thats one of mr darbys phones right castillo nodded and said thanks i was wondering gringo when you were going to get around to telling us whats going on fernando said but i was too polite to ask good castillo said fernando gave him the finger sieno returned with a cellular charger and after some shifting of chairs managed to get it plugged in and the cellular plugged into it okay castillo said whats going on now is that colonel munzs familyhis wife and two teenage daughtersare going to the states he is concerned with good cause for their safety ambassador silvio has given them the necessary visas he called to tell me that solez has just picked up their passports at the embassy and is taking them to artigas who is waiting for them at the terminal they are now at unicenter where yung is sitting on them they will go to the terminal just before the ferry sails for montevideo artigas will have their tickets and they will leave the country using their national identity cards not their passports yung and artigas will sit on them during the boat ride get them into the belmont house hotel in carrasco not far from the airport and sit on them there as soon as were set up in the safe house in mayerling tomorrow well take the gulfstream to montevideo while colonel torine is getting the weather and filing the flight plan yung and artigas will bring them to the airport give them their passports theyll pass through uruguayan customs and well head for the states where in the states torine asked first san antonio castillo said to drop off fernando we cant make that nonstop torine said its fortyfive fortysix hundred miles from here or montevideo where do you want to refuel how about quito ecuador castillo replied thatll work its about twentyfive hundred miles from here to quito and another twentyone hundred from quito to san antone once were gone artigas will come here and go out to the safe house yung will accompany lorimers body on an american airlines flight to miamininesomething tomorrow nightand then on to new orleans where are you headed finally in the states fernando asked washington i mean you could drop me in miami you dont have to make a special stop at san antonio for me castillo looked at his cousin well i knew this was coming san antonios on our way castillo explained colonel munzs family will be staying at the ranch in midland castillo saw the look of surprise on fernandos face was quickly replaced with one of anger or maybe contempt i presume carlos that you factored abuela into your reasoning contempt no question about it he only calls me carlos when hes really angry or disgusted with me i spoke with her an hour or so ago i told her i had to hold a meeting there and asked her to stay away fernando didnt reply you cant see the runway from the highway castillo said no one will know anyone unusuals there and there will be secret service agents waiting for us fernando glowered at him but said nothing and one of the things youre going to do in san antonio is make sure no one goes to the ranch for how long fernando asked icily for as long as it takes castillo said fernando we dont know who these people are but we have to presume they have access to credit card databases hotel registries all of that sort of thing christ howard kennedy even knew where i was when i used my cell phone the minute munzs family used a credit card checked into a hotel these bastards would know it at the ranch they wont use credit cards and when they talk to colonel munz theyll do it over the secret service communications system or a delta force radio no ones going to locate them because theyll be invisible if you can think of a better place i can put them tell me fernando shaking his head threw up both hands in a gesture of resignation i dont like it carlos castillo looked at his wristwatch its now eleven minutes after eight he said if all goes the way we hope the following things are going to happen in the next couple of minutes well hear from solez reporting that he met artigas at the buquebus terminal nextim guessing about eightthirtywell hear from yung that senora munz and the girls are in a taxi at unicenter and headed for the terminal fortyfive minutes or so after thatat we should hear from artigas that they arrived all right and are in the process of getting on the boat fifteen minutes after that we should hear that the boat has sailed and three and a half hoursgive or takeafter that we should hear from yung and artigas that theyre in montevideo and on their way to the belmont house hotel in carrasco when that happens we can go to bed where charley torine asked you me and fernando in the four seasons theres no way we can get max in there billy which means you and sandor will stay here theres only one guest room sieno said but it has two double beds max has been in the best hotels in europe kocian said it was a challenge and i bet a lot of people talked about that didnt they castillo said evenly the subject is not open for debate and what am i to be fed kocian asked i was just thinking about that castillo said obviously we cant go to a restaurant what about takeout whats the name of that steak place by the embassy the rio alba sieno furnished what about calling them after santini checks in and get them to make half a dozen large lomos and a salad to match plus papas provencal and then have santini and solez pick it up on their way here its almost on their way good idea torine said lomo kocian asked dubiously then in hungarian added some native dish presumably and what in gods name are papas whatever you said and ask for some bones for max castillo said ignoring him and a couple of bottles of wine is the wine drinkable in this country kocian asked i think you will find it entirely satisfactory ur kocian sieno said in hungarian and the beef is the best in the world a lomo is filet mignon the ones from rio alba weigh half a kilo papas provencal are pommes frites with parsley etcetera why didnt you tell me you speak hungarian kocian demanded i thought everybody did sieno said straightfaced i know the colonel does kocian saw the smile on sandor tors face you find this amusing do you sandor kocian demanded i think everybody does ur kocian torreplied castillos cellular vibrated hola i just gave those papers to artigas tony santini announced without preliminaries want us to stick around until the bus leaves i dont think so tony castillo replied after a moment im afraid you might be recognized and when yung gets there hes obviously not an argentine solez and artigas can pass so tell solez to stick around and then take a cab here i was thinking of giving artigas my car santini said thatd give them wheels when they get there and its an embassy car with a radio and cd plates so no trouble getting it good idea anything else you want me to do take a cab to rio alba and pick up our supper castillo said pauls about to order it thats one of your better ideas charley according to napoleon an army moves on its stomach im surprised you didnt know that santini chuckled tell paul to order me a large bife chorizo santini said and broke the connection sieno got the rio alba on the telephone and placed the order so now all we have to do is wait right torine asked when he saw sieno hang up so that nobody falls asleep while were waiting castillo said i thought wed talk about briefcasesized nuclear bombs torine looked at him with a puzzled look on his face why do i have this odd feeling that youre serious he asked i am castillo said whats that about jack britton heard from an undercover counterterrorism cop that the same people who were involved in stealing the have bought a hundredoddacre farm outside philadelphia on the farm are some old iron mines they are stocking them with food and intend to use them as shelters when someone sets off a briefcasesized nuke in philadelphia how reliable is brittons source torine asked incredulously that sounds awfully farfetched charley i know but it cant be ignored britton believes this fernando asked britton thinks it cant be ignored castillo said hes up there now with some secret service guys and some state cops he knows looking around im going there from midland on my way to washington so lets talk about nukes you went to nuke school right jake in my youth i flew bs torine said i dont know how many nuke schools ive been to but no nuke i ever heard about would fit in a briefcase briefcase no sieno said matteroffactly suitcase yes there are some people in the agency who believe an agent named sunev who castillo asked sunev sieno repeated a russian defector i forget his first name if i ever knew it kgb colonel pyotr sunev by chance kocian asked politely yeah thats him sieno said you know about this guy billy castillo asked his name came up several times hes a friend of your good friend mr pevsner ill want to hear about that billy but first i want to know what the agency believes about what this guy said sunev testified before a congressional committeei saw the tapes a half dozen times he wore a black bag over his head so he couldnt be recognizedfive six years ago he said that during the cold war hed been assignedhe was a spook at the soviet mission to the unto find drops across the country for weapons including sadms and the communications equipment necessary to make them go off he was a little vague about whether hed actually set up the drops or where they were and the agency believes this guy torine said whats a sadm fernando lopez interrupted nuclear suitcase sieno said the russians call them special atomic demolition munitions okay lets go to basics castillo said what does a sadm look like the pu looks like a suitcase sieno said its about two feet wide sixteen inches high and eight inches deep a small suitcase but larger than a briefcase he demonstrated with his hands then went on theres another onei forget the nomenclaturethat comes in two pieces each about the size of a footlocker it produces a tento twentykiloton explosion the little one probably has a threeto fivekiloton bang and the agency believes this guy hid these weapons in the states torine asked he didnt say he hid them colonel sieno said hes a slippery bastard he said hed quote been assigned to find drops for them unquote some people in the agency believe that does anybody at the agency believe that nukes are hidden in the states castillo asked some do sieno said where is this guy now castillo asked i think id like to talk to him probably in moscow sieno said the agency went through the whole business of getting him a new identityhe became a latvian teaching eastern european history at grinnellthen one bright early spring day in he and his family disappeared disappeared castillo asked werent they sitting on him not tight enough apparently sieno said perhaps kocian said on hearing that his dear friend vladimir was about to become president of russia he was overcome with nostalgia for mother russia and simply had to go home he knew putin castillo asked kocian nodded they were stationed in dresden in the kgb together and putin was sworn in on may what else do you know about this guy billy castillo asked know i dont know enough to print anything but i do know that colonel sunevnot under that name of coursewas in paris vienna budapest and baghdad and some other places starting right after mr sieno tells us he disappeared and as recently as six months ago and that he knew mr lorimer of the un which i find fascinating and is a good friendi told youof pevsner what was he doing in the states testifying before a congressional committee im only a simple journalist not an intelligence officer kocian said but i think they call that disinformation to what end billy castillo asked you will recall karlchen that at that time there was a great deal of concern about soviet nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands that they would be stolen from depots because there was no more money to pay the guards i remember that torine said it scared me nothing personal of course colonel but if it wasnt so dangerous i would be amused by american naivete kocian said watch it billy castillo snapped kocian shook his head and went on this loss of exsoviet now russian federation nuclear weapons could be prevented if the united states came up with the moneythis is a simplification of courseto bring the guards back on the payroll i think you actually gave them several billions of dollars to do just that to convince your congress of the danger russian defectorssunev was one of maybe two dozenescaped to the united states and told all russia was no longer the enemy russia was now a friend the muslims were the enemy they were liable to detonate nuclear weapons stolen or bought with drug money sieno said sarcastically right kocian said what castillo asked sieno said there were storieswidely circulatedthat the russian mafia bought a bunch of nukes from former kgb guys in chechnya or at least bought kgb connivance depending on which story you were listening to so the mafia could steal them themselves and then sold them to bin laden for thirty million us cash and two tons of highgrade heroin from his laboratories in afghanistanworth seven hundred million on the street did you believe this story mr sieno kocian asked i had a lot of trouble with it sieno said carefully after a moment why kocian asked sieno almost visibly formed his thoughts before he replied you know that george tenet said that the purge of the kgb when the soviet union came apart was quote pure window dressing unquote i didnt know that kocian said well i suppose the former head of your cia had to be right about something castillo glared at him sieno ignored him all they did was change the name from komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti to federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti sieno said bitterly castillo thought his russian pronunciation of that was perfect and put mr putin in charge kocian asked innocently so things could go on as before in russian castillo asked how good is your russian paul not quite as good as yours colonel but not bad sieno replied in russian and what is a nice italian boy like you who speaks russian like a muscovite doing eavesdropping on the cubans in argentina counting the days until i get my pension sieno said you were a bad boy in moscow castillo asked sieno hesitated for a moment before he answered not exactly a bad boy he said but i was one of the major reasons tenet said what he did and there were a lot of people between me and the dci who didnt want him to hear any more of that from me so they brought me back to langley from moscow and told mei should say implied with credible deniabilitythat i had two choices option one i could go to buenos aires as deputy station chief and they would arrange for susanna to be here and we could doubledip and as long as i kept my mouth shut i could look forward to saving a lot of money for my retirement or option two i could stay in washington and leak what i knew and they would guarantee that id be fired for cause and of course lose my pension and my reputation jesus torine said and being the moral coward that i am i took option one sieno said so why are you telling us this now you wont like the answer sieno said try me castillo said you shamed me colonel sieno said he pointed at munz and so did you mi coronel what do you mean shamed castillo asked when this whole thing startedthe night masterson got away from munz and me youre losing me paul torine said masterson got away from you when these bastards snatched mr masterson alex darby assigned me to sit on him and the kids at their house so alfredo and i did just that we sat in a car outside his house and masterson went over the fence in the backyard walked to the train station took a train downtown to meet the bad guys and they blew him away hes dead because i fucked up in other words i dont believe that paul and neither does the ambassador or alex darby castillo said let me finish please colonel sieno said bottom line is if id done my job right masterson would not have climbed the fence and gotten on that train i took this personally i was going to find out who did it and get back at them then you showed up colonel and you were in charge and i didnt like that at all at one time id been a pretty good clandestine service field officer and alex darby knew that and here is some army major with friends in high places about to call all the shots it wouldnt have been the first time id seen that happen so i went to darbywho is one of the really good guysand asked him what the hell was going on he told me that you were the best special operator hed ever known that hed seen you operate in iraq and afghanistan and knew what you had done about getting that stolen back and that since my ego was involved and this was very important he was going to keep me out of whatever you were going to do he didnt want me getting in your way he took a breath then went on i wouldnt have taken that from anybody but alex darby but ive seen him operate so i went along and sure enough he was right you found that bastard lorimer when nobody else could you set up and pulled off that snatch operation in uruguay in less time than i could believe and that was not a complete success castillo said lorimer and one of my guys died alfredo took a bullet and you took out a spetsnaz assault team to the last man that doesnt happen often theyre good youre sure they were spetsnaz castillo asked either spetsnaz or stasi or somebody else maybe even cubans trained bymore important controlled and financed bythe federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti who else but the fsb colonel its time you started calling a spade a spade you cant talk about missing or stolen russian nukes and leave them out of the discussion you said i shamed you that alfredo and i shamed you whats that all about colonel you did what you thought was the right thing to doand so did you alfredowithout thinking of the consequences to yourself i used to be that way before the bastards at langley finally ground me down that was shaming so i decided to get off the sidelines well kocian said that makes it two of us in this room who know the ksb is behind all of this its nice not to be alone anymore three of us ur kocian sandor tor said when castillo looked at tor he went on i suspected after the incident on the szabadsag hid that your assailants were exstasi what incident on the szabadsag hid sieno asked youve been to budapest too paul castillo asked you do get around dont you these bastards tried to snatch billy on the freedom bridge franz josef byucke karlchen kocian interrupted and when sandor interrupted that they shot billy castillo finished he then said please go on sandor i suspected exstasi made the attack on ur kocian the one max bit and allowed us to catch said that he was from dresden that attack was professional the proof came with the attack on you what proof we took fingerprints from the bodies of the men you shot tor said they did not match the fingerprints of former members of the avh or avo and both of the men you had to deal with had garrotes only three services used the garrotethe hungarian allamvedelmi osztaly and allamvedelmi hatosag and the ministry for state security of the german democratic republic since they werent exavo or exavh only exstasi is left and who is running all three the ksb castillo started to say something but stopped when the door chimes went off sieno got up and walked to a wallmounted telephone by the door he said si por favor hung the phone up and turned to the others in the room theres another nice italian boy in the lobby he says he has our supper i told the doorman to send him up three everyone was seated around the table in the sieno dining room ready for their meal from rio alba when jack davidsonwho was slicing individual portions from the enormous bife lomo with what looked like a huge daggersensed sienos eyes on him he looked up and said nice knife paul its a gaucho knife sieno said i bought it to hang on the wall of my vinecovered retirement cottage by the side of the road then i started to use it you jewish davidson santini asked davidson looked at him curiously yeah why then you will be fascinated to learn that there are forty thousand jewish cowboys gauchos here he stopped slicing youre kidding absolutely not mostly east europeans when they got off the boat in the s what argentina needed was cowboys so off to the pampas they got shipped they wear the boots and the baggy pants and stick knives like that under their belts in the back but when they take off their cowboy hats theres the yarmulke i have to see that keep slicing jack castillo ordered some of us are hungry davidson made a mock bow i humbly beg the colonels pardon sir castillos cellular vibrated hola congratulations alex darby announced you are now the proud lessee of a tenroom villa in mayerling they finally left just now susanna sieno and bradley are in the shopping center in pilar buying sheets blankets and food and lightbulbs sieno said dont forget the lightbulbs and lightbulbs castillo said i told my maid to bring lightbulbs and food i didnt think about sheets and blankets youre bringing your maid out there and her daughter darby said this place will not run itself castillo remembering who darby was stopped himself just in time from asking if that was smart instead he asked can you call her cellular and tell her she can bring the stuff to the house yeah ill do it and ill call the gate and tell the guards to let them in it might be a good idea if she spent the night here charley to get things organized or would you rather that i stayed no i want you here to pick your brain if you hurry there just may be a little steak from rio alba leftover remind paul that a hungry boss is a difficult superior darby said and the connection went dead before he could lay the cellular down by the charger again it vibrated hola theyre on their way to the bus terminal yung reported im sure they didnt meet anyone they knew here good theyre expected let me know when you get there got it yung said and broke the connection castillo reported the exchange to munz who nodded but didnt say anything paul susanna will spend the night out there castillo said sieno nodded i was going to recommend that he said davidson handed castillo a plate it held thick pinkinthemiddle slices of filet mignon slices of vineripened tomato and a stack of papas provencal this isnt the haute cuisine we got used to in afghanistan charley but maybe you can wash it down with enough wine to make it edible as a monitor showed alex darby parking his car in the basement garage yung called to report that everyone was safely at the terminal had their tickets and would soon be able to get on the bus let me know when that happens castillo ordered and when the bus leaves the parking lot got it yung said and the connection went dead alex castillo said as darby helped himself to slices of steak what were going to do now is im going to recap what weve been talking about and then youre going to tell us what you think shoot darby replied castillo had not quite finished when his cellular vibrated hola christopher columbus confucius and the pilgrims have sailed for the new world yung reported give me a call when you get to plymouth rock he put the cellular in his pocket and gave alfredo munz a thumbsup munz nodded and silently mouthed mucho gracias two things charley alex darby began one its a reasonable scenario my gut feeling is that if youre not right on the money youre not far off two if number one is on the money then youre in trouble for one thing youre going up against the conventional wisdom at the agency and you know how popular you are in langley and for another alex darby gently shook castillos shoulder charley why dont you go to the four seasons and get some sleep jesus what did i do fall asleep you were asleep with your eyes open for the last five minutes and then a minute ago you closed them youre right all im doing here is spinning my wheels he tried to stifle a yawn can we pick up where i dropped off in the morning in mayerling ill pick you up at nine fine how do jake fernando and i get to the hotel the cubans may be watching this building if they are they know our cars so instead if you walked down the hill to libertador and caught a cab all they would learneven if they followed itwas that three people left the building including the one whose dog took a dump on their sidewalk castillo interrupted and went to the four seasons darby finished lets do it castillo said and pushed himself away from the table four the buquebus terminal montevideo uruguay august the juan patricio one of the buquebus ferries that ply the river plate between downtown buenos aires and downtown montevideo is an enormous australianbuilt aluminum catamaran with space on the lower deck for about one hundred automobiles and light trucks the main deck can seat in comfortable airlinertype seating about two hundred fifty passengers there also is a dutyfree shop and a snack bar the firstclass deck up an interior stairway from the tourist deck offers larger seats and its own snack bar there are bulkheadmounted television sets in both classes that play motion picture dvds but on the latenight voyages few people watch them preferring to doze in their seats and wake up on arrival the only communication between the munz family and either yung or artigas on the juan patricios voyage to montevideoaside from yungs halfdozen smiles that he hoped would be reassuringhad been a fifteensecond encounter between artigas and senora munz when the lights of montevideo appeared standing at the snack bar artigas had caught senora munzs eye and nodded toward the port leading to the ladies restrooms she had joined him there a moment later when people start going to their cars take the girls and go down the stairs to the car deck senor yung will be waiting for you there to take you to our car its a dark blue bmw with diplomatic license plates senora munz had nodded her understanding then gone into the ladies room artigas saw yung get out of his chair and walk to the stairwell then artigas returned to his seat as yung had discreetly followed the munz family as they walked onto the ferry artigas had driven the embassy bmw onto the ferrys car deck but then artigas had forgotten to tell yung where he had parked it luckily yung had had only a little trouble finding it halfway back on the starboard side to explain his early presence on the car deck once he had found the bmw and unlocked it yung popped the hood and looked intently at the engine as if expecting some sign of some impending mechanical difficulty only when he had been standing there for ninety seconds did it occur to him that it was possibleif unlikelysomeone had been watching them all along and as soon as artigas had left the car deck that someone had hooked up a primer and a couple pounds of plastic explosive to the bmws ignition unlikely but not impossible the bastards are capable of anythingincluding using c the first few drivers who came down to the car deck to claim their vehicles looked wonderingly at the nicely dressed chinese man flat on his back studying the undercarriage of the bmw that had corps diplomatique license plates yung finished in time to be standing at the foot of the stairway when the munz family came down he had ushered them into the car and was in the front seat by the time artigas walked up by then the ferry was nudging into the pier cars began driving off the ferry a minute or two later immigration formalities had been accomplished in buenos aires at one counter in the terminal there argentine officials had run passports and national identity cards through a computer reader then handed them to uruguayan immigration officers sitting at the next counter the passports and national identity cards were then run through a uruguayan computer reader then handed back to the travelers who even though physically in buenos aires were now legally inside the borders of the republica oriental del uruguay uruguayan customs officials however were waiting for the cars streaming off the ferry artigas rolled down the window and extended his diplomats carnet a plastic card not unlike a drivers license the customs officer looked at it a moment peered into the car and said welcome back to uruguay senor artigas thank you artigas said diplomaticos norteamericanos the customs officer called to uniformed officers a few feet away they saluted as the bmw rolled past welcome to uruguay senora y senoritas yung said gracias senora munz said emotionally artigas turned right on leaving the port gate and headed for carrasco on the rambla yung took out his cellular and punched castillos autodial number after the first ring yung heard hola the pilgrims just stepped off plymouth rock yung announced what a voice asked in english who is this yung demanded yung the voice said yes torine whats up wheres the boss crashed he fell asleep right after dinner everything go all right or do i have to wake him as smooth as glass were on our way to the airport to pick up artigass car then to the belmont house well take turns sitting on the nest hows the battery in your cellular ill make sure its chargedhe corrected himselftheyre charged well be in touch torine said and broke the connection artigas stopped the bmw outside the parking lot at the carrasco airfield and got out yung stepped out of the passengers door walked around the bmw and slid in behind the steering wheel when artigas now at the wheel of his chrysler pt cruiser came out of the parking lot two minutes later he waited until yung had backed the bmw away from the parking lot then followed him at a discreet distance into carrasco five the belmont house hotel avenida rivera carrasco montevideo uruguay august yungs apartment on avenida bernardo barran in carrasco was two blocks away from the small fivestar luxury hotel and their route took them past it that naturally triggered in yungs mind the memory of the sound of the cops riot shotgun going off and of the doubleaught buckshot pellets that riddled yungs chevy blazer when i go to the states with lorimers casket what happens to the blazer i wont be coming back here certainly not permanently which means ill have to get rid of the blazer how the hell can i sell it with a dozen holes in it how am i going to get it fixed from long distance jesus whats the matter with me im supposed to be concentrating on the munzes not worrying about my damned blazer at the belmont house hotel after yung drove the bmw into the circular drive in front of the hotel artigas pulled to the curb and shut off his headlights a doorman and a bellman immediately appeared at the bmw senora munz and her daughters all appearing very sleepy got of the car and walked into the hotel yung checked to see where artigas was if the cops see him parked there theyll be curious but with the cd plates on the car they cant ask him what hes doing what theyll probably decide is that hes waiting for a pal who is inside the hotel and not yet ready to leave the arms of love yung walked into the hotel as senora munz was registering the desk clerk obviously knew her thats convenient their appearance this late after midnight will not raise questions if theres nothing else i can do for you ladies ill leave you and see you in the morning you know how to reach me thank you very much senora munz said you are very gracious yung smiled at the girls again then walked out of the hotel he got in the bmw and drove to his apartment i dont have the clicker to open the goddamned garage door ill have to leave the car on the street he pulled to the curb and started to get out of the car but changed his mind as he took the keys from the ignition instead he took out his cellular jake torine answered on the second ring theyre in the nest and julio is sitting outside yung announced dont forget to make sure your phones work torine replied we dont want to have to send out a search party for you tomorrowi mean later today i told you id do it yung said some what snappishly and broke the connection he immediately realized dammit hes right thats an important little detail and the truth is i didnt think about a dead cellular battery therere two chargers in the apartment one that fits into a cigarette lighter ill get it and walk down the street and give it to artigas then ill charge mine he opened the door of the bmw some what awkwardly with his left hand got out then started to lock the car buenos noches senor yung a voice said behind him i guess its really buenos dias isnt it yung felt a chill jesus the hair on my neck actually curled i thought that was just a figure of speech you scared hell out of me ordonez yung said sorry chief inspector jose ordonez said his smile revealed he was more amused than regretful yung glared at him youre not going to ask me what im doing walking the streets of carrasco at this hour ordonez said i really dont give a damn yung said we have to talk senor yung some other time perhaps ive had a busy day and want to go to bed i really think its necessary ordonez insisted am i going to have to hide behind the shield of diplomatic immunity to get some sleep thats one of the reasons i think we really have to talk if at all possible id like to keep our little problem from getting involved with the often sticky business of diplomatic immunity oh shit now what let me rephrase my request ordonez said i would really like to talk to you unofficially on my word all you have to do is listen you dont have to say anything unless of course you wantto yung looked at him but didnt reply what have you got to lose senor yung ordonez pursued a few minutes of your time and perhaps a small glass of whiskey okay yung said come on in my apartment with the understanding that the next time i suggest you go home so i can get my sleep you accept it you are muy amiable senor yung charming apartment ordonez said as yung snapped on the lights in his living room thank you what kind of small glass of whiskey would you like scotch if that would be convenient ordonez said but before we get into that may i help you with your bandage yung looked at his bandaged hand blood had soaked the gauze and the gauze was dirty what the hell it looked all right the last time i looked at it i must have fucked it up crawling under the bmw on the ferry if youll forgive my saying so it appears to need attention ordonez said ive got some stuff in the bathroom yung said and belatedly added thank you ordonez skillfully and tenderly removed the bandage then examined the cracked crusted blood over the gouge you were lucky he said another few millimeters and there would have been serious damage ill send a box of chocolates to your guy with the shotgun yung said ordonez chuckled ive already had a word with him and if i may say so his intentions were noble he was trying to save your life ordonez was now swabbing the wound with antiseptic and yung was trying not to grimace at the burning sensation yung said you dont happen to know a good body shop do you my blazer looks like it was in a war why the hell did i say that well it was wasnt it ordonez said and as a matter of fact i do ill leave you the address and ill also call him and tell him youre a friend of mine thank you that should do it ordonez said three minutes later as he let loose of yungs freshly bandaged hand and can we now have the whiskey you have so kindly offered thank you chief inspector ordonez it was my pleasure to be of assistance and please call me jose yung smiled and gestured for him to precede him out of the bathroom what would you like yung asked indicating the bottles on his bar the famous grouse please when yung handed him a glass and wordlessly asked if he would like ice ordonez nodded said please then went on i used to drink johnnie walker black but then the johnnie walker people took the distributorship away from a friend of mineit had been in his family for four generationsand i stopped drinking johnnie walker and started drinking famous grouse which my friend now distributes how interesting yung said he handed the glass of famous grouse to ordonez then poured one for himself we latinsyou must have been here long enough to know thisare like that ordonez said we reward our friends punish our enemies and hold grudges for a longtime is that so yung said are the chinese like that senor yung may i call you david we chinese are inscrutable yung said like fbi agents like some fbi agents there are some fbi agents i must admit who talk too much i dont happen to be one of them i tell you that as a friend and yes you may call me david ordonez chuckled thank you he said then went on speaking of friends do you happen to know an argentine by the name of alfredo munz oh shit when it was obvious that yung wasnt going to reply ordonez continued until recently he was head of side you know what that is i know what side is yung said el coronel munz was recently retired ordonez said the word went around that he was retired because of his inability to quickly apprehend whoever it was who first kidnapped mr masterson and then murdered her husband before her eyes yung said nothing he took a sip of his scotch the argentines unfortunately are like that ordonez said they always like to divert blame from themselves whats the english phrase find a scapegoat something like that the argentine government can now say why should we be embarrassed that a us diplomats wife was kidnapped and the diplomat himself murdered on our soil we have sent the man who should have prevented that from happening into disgraceful retirement for incompetence that wasnt very nice of them was it yung said no but thats the way it is and when the word got around that el coronel munz had shot himself while cleaning his pistol many people thought that he had somehow missed while attempting to take his own life because of the shame his incompetence had brought down on his head shot himself cleaning his pistol did he youre sure you dont know at least who im talking about yung didnt respond how do i translate your silence and the inscrutable look on your face david that you do know alfredo munzor at least who he isor that you dont try thats one of the questions yung doesnt have to answer unless he wants to yung said ordonez made a thin smile well david i was not one of those who believed that munz was either incompetent or had shot himself while attempting suicide or cleaning his pistol you didnt not for a second you see david alfredo munz is a close friend of mineone might even say a dear friend is that so we met because we were so to speak counterparts he ran side on his side of the river plate and i ran run the interior police division of the uruguayan policia nacional on this side despite the innocuous name my unit does for uruguay what side does for argentina i didnt know that of course yung said of course you didnt ordonez said after all you were just one of a dozen or so fbi agents in your embassy involved in nothing more than the investigating of money laundering right if you say so well shortly after alfredo and i started to work together we learnedim sure to our mutual surprisethat we were both honest cops unfortunately there arent that many of us in either argentina or uruguay im sorry to hear that well over the years as alfredo and i worked together on projects of mutual interestfor example dignitary protection dignitary protection that involves the protection of our own officials diplomats and visiting dignitaries such as heads of foreign states fidel castro for example did you know that when fidel castro visits uruguay he and the more important members of his entourage always stay at the belmont house hotel right down the street from here i think i heard that yung said well for example when castro visited argentina where he was under munzs protection and then came here where i was responsible for his protection alfredo and i naturally worked together i can understand why that would happen well when i heard that my friend alfredo had hadhow do i put this some difficulty involving a firearm the first thing i wanted to do was help i couldnt rush across the river to buenos aires of course because i was deeply involved in the investigation of the massacre at estancia shangrila and when i tried to telephone him using a very private line to his very private line in his apartment there was never an answer there were several possible reasons for this the most likely being that he saw on caller identification that i was calling and didnt think it wisefor his sake or minethat we talk ordonez raised his glass may i impose on your hospitality for another of these my friend david he smiled this glass seems to have a hole in it of course while yung put ice then famous grouse into ordonezs glass he thought i really should not have another of these im out of my depth with ordonez and i have no idea where this is leadingbut then poured another two inches of scotch into his own glass here you go jose yung said handing him the drink thank you now where was i oh yes as i said it was impossible for mebecause of the massacre investigationto personally go to buenos aires to see what i could do to help alfredo or even to get him on the phone so i did the only thing i could think of to help i put a watch on the immigration computers excuse me i instructed our immigration service to notify me personally and immediately should the munz name appear i already had issued such a watch for two us diplomats julio artigas and david w yung jr how interesting arent you at all curious why i am curious about the movements out of and into uruguay of you and my cousin julio i figure if you want me to know youll tell me actually there have been two interesting developments in the shangrila massacre that i wanted to ask you both about ordonez said we knowor at least are reasonably surewhere the helicopter out there came from and we have positively identified one of the men who died out there from a mm rifle bullet in his head oh shit i dont think thats a bluff you going to tell me about that in due time ordonez said well tonight shortly after the parties for whom id issued a watch passed through immigration at the buquebus terminal in buenos aires immigration called me at my home to tell me that not only were the two american diplomats on the ferry but so were senora munz and her two daughters shit and here i owe both you david and my cousin julio an apology i have to confess that i suspected an unpleasant connection between you two and the family of my dear friend alfredo i should have known better and im more than a little ashamed what the hell is this so what i did was call my man on the buquebusas you can imagine its handy to have your men on the ferry in civilian clothing of course we normally have two one with a charming labrador that has a fantastic nose he smiled took a healthy swallow of scotch then continued anyway i called him and told him to take the munz family under their protection and to be especially watchful of the two american diplomats he called back in half an hour to report that all parties were on the firstclass deck sitting separated from each other he also said that the chinese american diplomat had smiled at one of the munz girls as he watched and that rather than being frightenedor even offendedshe smiled back that of course confused me as did the next call from the ferry shortly before it docked the chinese american diplomat was on his back on the car deck as if looking for drugsor less likely an explosive devicehidden under the car thats probably where you soiled your bandage david yung did not reply the final call from the ferry ordonez went on reported that the munz family had willingly gotten into the bmw bearing diplomatic plates with the two american diplomats and were about to drive off the ferry you didnt see me in the port but i saw you and i saw how senora munz and the girls smiled at you in the belmont house so here i am david looking for an explanation of what who are you protecting the munz family from and why and what are they doing here and whats your connection with el coronel munz whom you say you dont know i didnt say i didnt know him i said that was a question i didnt choose to answer are you going to tell me now are you going to tell me about the interesting developments about the shangrila massacre ordonez took a long moment before he replied do the names vasily respin and aleksandr pevsner ring a bell with you david its one man yung said im not sure which is his real name and there are other aliases theres a dozen maybe more interpol warrants out for him for all sorts of things hes in argentina using the name pevsner ordonez said how do you know that alfredo munz told me why hasnt he been arrested ordonez shrugged obviously it is not in the best interests of the argentine government to arrest him hes paid somebody off ordonez shrugged that could be he has all kinds of money enough for example to own a bell ranger helicopter jesus christ is that where castillo got the ranger from an international mafioso its not like fingerprints of course but the skids of helicopters make skidmarks in mudlike the mud near estancia shangrilathat are identifiable i mean its not too hard to determine what type of helicopter made the marks in the mud the helicopter at estancia shangrila was a bell ranger you think it was pevsners i dont know i do know there arent very many of them around buenos aires i do know that after being at jorge newbery airport early on the night of the shangrila massacre pevsners bell ranger took off visual flight rules for pilar it closed out its flight plan over pilar since there is no airport in pilar there is no record of it landing there very early in the morning on the day of the massacre pevsners helicopter returned to jorge newbery again flying under visual flight rules from pilar and again since it had not landed at an airport there is no record of it having taken off from one it stayed there until late in the day when it again returned to pilar under visual flight rules there is enough time between pevsners bell ranger closing out its flight plan over pilar the night of the massacre and its return to jorge newbery early the next morning for it to have been flown to tacuarembo province and back by flying very low it would not have appeared on radar either here or in argentina you think pevsner was involved in the business at the estancia i dont know david but pevsner is not one of those people i dismiss from suspicion because of his lilywhite reputation now i will tell you what else i have learned with the caveat that when i finish you will tell me what you know about any of this if that was the offer of a deal it wasnt accepted thats an admission you realize that you know something no it isnt i had no idea for example until just now that this russian mafioso was in south america or that he owns a helicopter i said no deal because after you tell me what else you know and ask me what i know and i tell you nothing you cant say im breaking our deal ordonez looked at yung intensely for a moment but did not respond directly instead he said you remember me telling you that among other things we did together we worked on the protection of foreign dignitaries such as fidel castro yung nodded and that one of the things that really puzzled me about the massacre was that two of the ninjas were shot with a special rifle bullet issued only to your competitive marksmen and special forces soldiers i remember an additional puzzling factor here was the reaction of ambassador mcgrory when deputy foreign minister alvarez very circuitously asked him if there was any possibility that your special forces were in any way involved i was watching his face his surprise was genuine as was his anger at the question if your special forces were involved ambassador mcgrory didnt know about it that leaves two possibilitiesthat they were not involved or that they were on a mission of such secrecy that the american ambassador was not told christ hes got us jose theres a very strict rule that nothing surreptitiousespecially using special forcescan take place in a country without the ambassadors knowledge and approval yes i know ordonez said but let me go on all of these questions were in my mind when i went to the english hospital during the autopsy procedures on mr lorimer and the ninjas and then looking at the ninja who had been shot in the head i had the strangest feeling that i had seen him before had you it took me thirtysix hours to remember when and where ordonez said and then i took out my photo albumand there it was a photograph of fidel castro standing in front of the belmont house hotel with three familiar faces in the background el coronel alfredo munz me and major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia jesus h christ yung blurted are you sure ordonez nodded slowly we generally make a practice of getting fingerprints of people like that who visit our country we have yours for example i checked the prints major vincenzo of the cuban dgi who came here as castros security chief was one of the ninjas who died at estancia shangrila of a special forces bullet in his brain they were cubans we could not match the prints of any of the others but there is no question about vincenzo ordonez stood up if i may friend david i will have another famous grouse while you decide what help you can offer me what the hell was a cuban doing at the estancia yung blurted ordonez laughed you will forgive me if i say that your reaction is as transparent as was ambassador mcgrorys you were genuinely surprised to hear that werent you senor inscrutable yeah i was yung said may i start asking questions ill tell you what i can yung said he thought now i really wish i was castillo im in way over my head here lets start with the most important thing to me ordonez said from the bar why are you protecting the munz family and from whom munz is concerned for their safety what concern of that is yours we owe him why i cant answer that you will forgive me if i suspect it has something to do with his wound ordonez said which poses more questions including the original one from whom we dont know the people who murdered masterson probably they would be the same people who sent the ninjas to the estancia do you think that sounds reasonable but we dont know and from the russian mafioso pevsner possibly maybe even probably let me be honest with you david i am very relieved to find that munz trusts you with the lives of his family that means you can be counted among the good guys i think we really are the good guys yung said what are your plans to protect senora munz and the girls perhaps i can help theyre going to the states yung said tomorrow alfredo will join them there no he wouldnt go if i didnt believe you were the good guys i might suspect that his family were hostages to his good behavior thats absolutely untrue yung snapped hes staying here to help us find out who these bastards are well as step one i will ensure that the munz family is safe until they get on the plane with you and lorimers casket oh shit and i have to tell him theyre not going with me yung said a private plane will come here sometime tomorrow theyll go on that a learjet hell find out anyway no a gulfstream i thought senoror is it majorcastillo had a learjet lieutenant colonel castillo has many airplanes and you work for lieutenant colonel castillo do you david why deny that its selfevident i do now and my cousin julio yung nodded as of yesterday and who does lieutenant colonel castillo work for the cia no he doesnt work for the cia then whom thats another question i cant answer when you worked here as an fbi agent were you really working for the cia no what waswhat isyour interest in senor lorimer money laundering thats all i thought he was a lebanese named bertrand and i was trying to find out where he got all those american dollars nearly sixteen million of them ordonez said and did you find out yung nodded are you going to tell me its money from that iraqi oilforfood scheme lorimer was involved in that you know i never even thought about that that answers some questions doesnt it and poses at least as many more ill have to give this a good deal of thought im sure you will and do you know where that money is now next question ordonez smiled you did a very good job of concealing tracks at the banks when you came back down here david but not a perfect one i have learned that the receiptsor whatever theyre calledfor the money in lorimers accounts here were negotiated through the riggs bank in washington that makes me think they were in lorimers safe at the estancia and somehow taken to washington i would have been prone to think senor pevsner had something to do with that but if that were so why did you try to conceal the tracks that was a rhetorical question right you didnt expect an answer right boy scouts honor jose i have never knowingly done anything that would in any way help aleksandr pevsner from everything i know about the sonofabitch he deserves to be behind bars or dead i dont knowcant provethat hes after the munzes but i believe it so do i the question is why can you put me in touch with alfredo when i get to the statesthatll be tomorrowill get word to munz that you want to talk to him and that you helped us get his family to the states i would appreciate that that leaves only two things for me to do and what are they ill make sure that no one gets close to the belmont house tonight who shouldnt be there and then you and i will walk down there and say hello to my cousin julio and you will tell him that you and i are agreed that we are the good guys okay ive got to give him a charger for his cellular anyway and one more thing ordonez said he wrote something in a small notebook tore out the page and handed it to yung whats this the address of a good autobody repairman i told you id give it to you thank you yung said and one last thing david i really wish you wouldnt get on the phone and tell colonel castillo about our conversation im going to have to tell him jose oh i know but if you call him tonight your phones are tappedcellular and regularand i would rather not have a record of our conversation floating around we both said and are doing things that we really shouldnt be doing lets keep that between us after a moment yung nodded ordonez went on youll have a few minutes to speak with colonel castilloor someone close to himat the airport tomorrow maybe if he knows what ive told you he will tell me something he knows that may help me sort all this out yung didnt reply can castillo get the munzes into the united states if their passports do not have exit stamps from uruguay castillo could get them into the states if they arrived without passports im sure he can then we will have to get them on the gulfstream tomorrow without them going through the normal immigration procedures we have to presume thati like your description david these bastards may have access to our immigration computers if there is no record of the munzes leaving the country perhaps they will waste a little time looking for them here xii one el presidente de la rua suite the four seasons hotel cerrito buenos aires argentina august colonel jacob torine usaf went into the master bedroom and gently shook the shoulder of lieutenant colonel c g castillo usa who was asleep lying spreadeagle in his underwear on the enormous bed when that didnt work torine grabbed castillos left foot raised it three feet off the bed then let it go that worked castillo sat up abruptly his eyes wideopen at first then glaring at torine i just ordered breakfast charley its quarter after eight torine said thanks castillo said without much enthusiasm fell back on the bed and then grunting with the effort sat up again and swung his feet out of the bed he took fresh underwear from his bag and walked stiffleggedly into the huge marble bath he turned on the coldwater faucet in the glasswalled shower took off his underwear and stepped under the flowing water he stood under the cold water for a full minute before shivering with cold deciding that he now was sufficiently awake and could adjust the temperature five minutes later shaved and in trousers and shirt castillo went into the sitting room two waiters were arranging plates topped with chrome domes on a table castillo nodded at torine and fernando lopez then walked to the enormous windows overlooking the tracks of the retiro railroad station the docks beyond that and the river plate nice view he thought aloud im glad my wife doesnt know about this torine said she doesnt mind me freezing my ass on some snowcovered runway in the middle of alaska but this would make her jealous castillo turned and smiled at him i guess yung called he said yeah he said he was on his way to the carrasco airport to pick up artigass car then would take the munzes to the belmont house theyll take turns guarding them i didnt want to wake you you were really wiped out gringo fernando lopez said understatement of the day castillo said as he stretched his neck he then added ive been thinking thats always dangerous lopez said castillo walked to the table sat down and lifted one of the chromedomed plate covers the plate held an enormous pile of scrambled eggs he spooned some eggs onto his plate then found ham steaks under another dome and put one of them next to his eggs meanwhile thinking what i really have been thinking about is the time i spent in that bedroom with betty schneider i thought about her just before i passed out and i thought of her this morning just as soon as i stopped being pissed at jake for that legdropping wakeup call but thats personal this is business when we came in here last night they called me gossinger castillo said and i remembered that i rented this place as gossinger of the tages zeitung and theyre getting the bill and that otto gorner sent the german embassy here a wiremaybe an email maybe he even calledasking that i be given every courtesy so hiding billy kocian is going to be as easy as hiding a giraffe on the white house lawn true torine said the old guy is spectacular i love his hat he mimed kocians up on one side and down on the other hat brim youre going to move him in here lopez asked after all that business about renting the safe house right now no but im going to keep this apartment and tell the hotel that mr eric kocian of the tages zeitung newspapers will be staying here when he is not staying in a pilar country house that the newspaper has rented for him and to continue to send the bills to the newspaper and when i get out to the safe house and can get a secure line to the white house switchboard im going to call otto and tell him to call the german ambassador to tell him who eric is and that hes hereand whyand to why is he here torine asked hes working on three stories castillo said one some character from hamburg is going to try to raise the graf spee from its watery grave off montevideo two hes going to do a piece on the german sailors from the graf spee who stayed here and three hes naturally interested in the story of the murdered american diplomat which is of great interest in germany what are you trying to do gringo make him a really visible target lopez asked exactly one so visible that side will decide its in the national interests of argentina to see that nothing happens to him the argentine government doesnt want any more headlines about foreigners being murdered here and a foreign journalist if anything happened to billy it would be on front pages all over the world youre devious colonel castillo torine said i like to think so castillo said thank you sir they whacked the sergeant and almost whacked your girlfriend when they were riding around in an embassy car lopez said not to mention masterson they werent expecting trouble castillo said billy will have at least jack davidson and sandor tor with him all the time and they know what theyre doing and there will be others too whats eric kocian going to think of this brainstorm of yours lopez asked i wont know that until i ask him castillo said so this is whats going to happen darbys going to pick me up here at nine ill get billy kocian settled in mayerling and make the phone calls you go to jorge newbery and get the plane ready i think it would be better to have three flight plans torine said one from here to carrasco a second from carrasco to quito and a third from quito to san antonio rather than one with legs fine castillo said its only about thirty minutes from jorge newbery to carrasco torine went on we wont have to take on fuel but it would be better if we did its almost six hours to quito from montevideo lets err on the side of caution lopez said agreed castillo said its another five and a half hours from quito to san antonio torine said figure an hour on the ground at quito that makes twelve and a half call it thirteen from wheelsup in montevideo until touchdown in san antonio castillo nodded and said well need food and something to drink torine nodded it would be better if we got that in montevideo ill call when im leaving mayerling then you call yung and tell him to pack a picnic lunch but not have the hotel do it he looked down at his plate and saw that he had eaten everything hed put there i better get dressed gringo im still not happy about taking the munzes to midland lopez said right now i dont see another option but when i get on the radio ill call abuela and make sure she stays in san antonio castillo went into the master bedroom to finish dressing he had just finished tying his necktie when the doorman called to say his car was waiting for him two mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august the entrance to the mayerling country club was very much like the entrance to the buena vista country club four miles or so away on the other side of route where aleksandr pevsner lived there was a guardhouse with armed guards controlling a barrier pole and like buena vista there was a shrubberyshrouded twelvefoothigh chainlink fence topped with razor wire behind which the roofs of only a few houses were visible from the road there was immediate proof that the security was good when the guards refused to pass alex darbys bmw until they called the house and got permission from someonethey later learned it was mr sienoto pass would they have passed us if you had cd plates on this castillo asked as they drove slowly along the curving country club road at the prescribed thirtykilometerperhour speed limit announced every one hundred meters by neatly lettered signs and reinforced by speed bumps every two hundred meters no and i didnt put my name on the frequent visitor list either darby said the image i want to give is that the house is rented by the sienos a nice young argentine couple of means from mendoza is hertheirspanish good enough to make that credible yeah she did almost a year clandestine in havana shes good charley theyre both good they had bright futures until he caught a bad case of career suicidus of what an uncontrollable urge to tell langley things langley doesnt want to hear i had a pretty bad case of it myself you mean youre here for the same reason darby nodded you never said anything alex you didnt ask colonel its sort of a twosided coin life is a lot nicer here than other places you and i have been to and the people who work for me are really firstclass i wonder sometimes however how much useful information comes out of the good boys and girls in the unpleasant places who tell langley what it wants to hear tell me about edgar delchamps castillo said howd you get along with ol ed charley very well i think hes one of the good guys i thought you two probably would get along how did he avoid getting a dose of career suicidus he had it i would say he had a nearly fatal case of it then whats he doing in paris dont tell me thats the agencys version of siberia maybe not siberia but its one of those places where the good boys and girls dont want to go because you cant help but learn all sorts of things the francophiles in virginia dont want to read about while theyre humming april in paris and ed knows where a lot of the bodies are buried when they yanked him out of germany he said thats where he wanted to go and they backed down they have sort of an understanding he writes what he wants to and they dont read it castillo grinned but shook his head in disgust he said how much do you think delchamps would know about colonel pyotr sunev of the kgb probably a lot more than langley wishes he does darby said they got more than a little egg on their face when the defector they marched before congress turned out to be quite the opposite one of the reasons theyre annoyed with ed is that he warned them the guy was bad news nobody likes i told you so that means he knows something about russian suitcase nukes as much as anybody charley darby said then pointed out the window chez nous mon colonel he went on and a bargain at four grand a month especially since monsieur jeanpaul lorimerbertrand is paying for it castillo saw a sprawling brick house with a red tile roof sitting fifty feet off the road on a manicured lawn surrounded by nice shrubbery concealing more razor wire and motion detectors darby added it has a pool a croquet field and a very nice quincho in which sergeant kensington has set up shop the house also had a threecar garage as darbys bmw entered the cobblestone drive the door to one of the garages opened and he drove inside susanna sieno was waiting for them at an interior door which led from the garage into the house when they were in a spacious nicely furnished living room with plateglass walls offering a view of the garden she pointed the grand duke seems to be satisfied with our humble offering she said eric kocian elegant in an entirely white outfit from hat to shoes was sitting in a whiteleatherupholstered stainless steel recliner beside the swimming pool he was drinking a cup of coffee and smoking a cigar a matching table held an ashtray a coffee service and a copy of the buenos aires herald to the right of the swimming pool was a small cottage built in the style of the main house obviously the quincho that darby had mentioned there was a directv satellite dish antenna mounted on the roof castillo looked but could not see the antenna that he knew kensington had put up for the afc delta force radio kensington knows what hes doing the radio is set up somewhere and there are two of them ive never heard that any of them ever went down but redundancy is always nice ive got to talk to billy and right now castillo said privately darby asked no i want both of you in on it castillo said you took your time coming karlchen the old man greeted him poolside and as you can see max has found a new friend he probably wont even notice youre here he gestured to the other side of the swimming pool where max was chasing after a soccer ball that corporal lester bradley had kicked into the distance castillo saw the grip of a model a colt pistol sticking out of bradleys waistband under his jacket i cant let billy get away with that crack castillo decided he whistled shrilly max who had just picked up the soccer ball in his mouth with no more difficulty than a lesser canine would have had with a tennis ball stopped looked then came happily running over to him castillo looked at kocian smiled smugly then looked back at max and said i cant believe he got that in his mouth it no longer holds air kocian said max was annoyed the first time he bit into it and it hissed at him so he gave it a good bite to make it behave max dropped the limp soccer ball at castillos feet castillo rubbed his ears then kicked the ball as hard as he could so that it would sail over the swimming pool he failed the ball landed in the pool max ran up to the fourfoottall fence that surrounded the pool looked at the barrier then with no apparent effort jumped over it he then leaped into the pool grabbed the ball paddled around a moment until he figured the best way to get out of the pool was via the steps on the shallow end swam there got out jumped back over the fence and trotted over to them that was a mistake karlchen kocian said what he will do now is drop the ball at our feet and shake himself max did precisely that max you sonofabitch castillo said laughing you would find that amusing kocian said look at my trousers that isnt the only mistake ive made does that surprise you not at all frankly kocian said but we all make them the last time for me was in january or was it december i misspelled a word are you going to tell me what yours was colonel alfredo munz walked up am i intruding he said of course not castillo said your family is in the belmont house hotel everything went perfectly am i going to get a chance to talk to them can you wait until we get to quito ecuador of course the herr oberstleutenant herr oberst kocian said is about to tell us all of a mistake he made im breathless with anticipation my mistake was in thinking we could hide herr kocian here castillo said but now i realize that would be about as difficult as concealing a giraffe on the white house lawn munz susanna sieno and darby could not resist smiling at the image kocian glared at them so what do you suggest kocian asked rather icily the opposite castillo replied hes an important journalist publisher of the budapester tages zeitung vice chairman of the board of directors of gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh castillo saw the sour look on the old mans face and had a hard time restraining a smile you didnt mind me mentioning that did you uncle billy and i dont think the argentine government would be happy if anything happened to him i see where youre going munz said i dont kocian said they would want side to keep an eye on you herr kocian munz said they would not want anything to happen to an important man such as yourself you think its a good idea alfredo kocian said i think its a very good idea munz said all i am is a simple journalist plying his trade kocian said we know that but the argentine government doesnt castillo said well get otto to exaggerate when he calls the german ambassador here kocian glared at him okay so thats what well do castillo said ill get on the horn right now when they walked to the quincho corporal lester bradley came to attention as they approached him lester try not to do that castillo said youre in civilian clothing yes sir bradley said and lost perhaps ten percent of his rigid posture sergeant kensington was inside the quincho on a twin of kocians recliner reading the herald there was a car leaning against the recliner kensington lowered the newspaper but did not get up how soon can you get the radio up bob castillo asked were up and all green sir kensington said i just talked to major miller wheres the antenna on the roof sir it says directv on it oh you are a clever fellow robert my mother always told me that sir heres what i want to do bob you tell me if i can do it and if so how yes sir i want a secure line wherever possible i have to make calls to ambassador montvale to a civilian number in germany to a civilian number in san antonio and another one to a local number here in argentinaeither cellular or a regular phoneand i really dont want that party to know where its coming from yes sir the ambassadors no problem at all we get miller at the nebraska complex on the horn thatll be encrypted with ourafcslogarithms miller can decrypt and patch you into the white house switchboard and youll have a secure line instantaneous yes sir kensington said then reached to the floor beside him and extended a telephone handset to castillo just like a telephone and the others how do i do that a couple of problems there kensington said youll be secure as far as the white house switchboard for germany and san antonio but not beyond and as far as here goes the white house can get you secure as far as the embassy here but i dont know if they can patch you into the local phone company no problem susanna said but unless we block it if the person youre calling has caller id theyll know where its coming from and if theyre any good at all they could trace it to the embassy override the block i mean thats no problem castillo said let him think im calling from the embassy i mean well put the caller id block in but theres no real harm if they get around it kensington finally rose from the recliner he walked to what looked like a kitchen cabinet opened the door squatted to examine the afc radio then turned and said all green sir you want the nebraska complex now please put it on speakerphone youre up and how else may i be of assistance to you sergeant kensington major h richard millers voicehaving been encrypted in washington dc then sent twentyseven thousand miles into space to a satellite then bounced back another twentyseven thousand miles to earth and decrypted in the dining room of a quincho thirtyodd miles outside buenos airesinquired cheerfully and with such clarity that amazement was on everybodys face except that of sergeant kensington you can first get your bum leg off my desk castillo said and then well talk oh good morning colonel ive been wondering when we were going to hear from you ambassador montvale is in his words quite anxious to chat with you oddly enough thats why i called patch me into the white house switchboard and eavesdrop please you got it charley twenty seconds later a pleasant voice announced white house this line is secure colonel castillo sir ambassador montvale has been trying to reach you will you get him for me please hold one please ambassador montvales secure line the now very familiar voice of truman ellsworth announced the sonofabitch really wont answer his own phone lieutenant colonel castillo for the ambassador please castillo said hello charley ambassador montvale said cheerily a moment later and how are you wherever you are im in buenos aires sir in three or four hours im leaving for the states nice not having to worry about airline schedules isnt it montvale said and without waiting for an answer went on so ill see you in whattwelve hours or so itll probably be a little longer than that sir im going first to texas and then to pennsylvania thats one of the things im quite anxious to chat with you about charley briefcases in pennsylvania the man you said was going to report to me has never shown up no matter the hour call me when you get to washington and bring him with you if thats possible sir i will but i will see him before i come to washington may i inquire why youre going to texas what i consider to be a bona fide threat has been made against the family of one of my primary sources im bringing them to the states for their protection why do you consider it to be a bona fide threat source and family or just family and where are you taking them among other reasons an attempt was madethere is good reason to believe by the same parties who were at the estanciato kidnap special agent yung he was wounded in the process whats the good reason absolutely no identification on the body we have and he had a hypodermic full of a tranquilizer with him same modus operandi as the attempted kidnappingboth attemptsof my source in budapest and of course the kidnapping of mr masterson montvale grunted you still have no idea who these people are charley ive got a couple of theories ill tell you about them when i see you hows yung hes going to be all right at long last he asks about yung he has a gouge from a doubleaught buckshot pellet in his hand he was lucky now theyre using shotguns yung took a hit when the uruguayan police took down the bad guy and what do the uruguayan police think about all this thats something else i want to talk to you about castillo replied and thought although right now i have no idea what ill say we do have a lot to talk about dont we sir i apologize but ive forgotten your other questions montvale took a moment to remember what they were oh yes are you bringing your source and family or just the family just the family sir his wife and two daughters and where are you taking them in texas to the doublebarc its a ranch my family has in midland its isolated and floating over a sea of sweet crude oil in the midland basin right jesus christ he knows about that too that proved very useful only yesterday montvale said ill tell you all about it when i see you castillo didnt respond what the hell is he talking about montvale went on presumably youve thought about security on the ranch yes sir ive arranged for the secret service to be there by the time we get there i didnt hear about that montvale said making it an accusation i wonder why castillo again didnt reply is there anything i can do to help you charley anything you need how difficult would it be to have edgar delchamps brought home from paris until we get this sorted out hes the cia station chief i know who he is montvale interrupted if you think its necessary ill have him here as soon as he can get on a plane i think its important sir then hell be on the next plane hell probably be here before you get here is there anything he should be told no sir but you will tell me right why you need him when we have our chat yes sir of course at the risk of repeating myself lets have that chat as soon as possible yes sir anything else charley no sir nice to talk to you montvale said and hung up white house i need to speak with mr otto gorner in fulda germany castillo said the number is otto gorner gorners voice came over the phone this is the white house calling herr gorner the operator said in german will you hold please for colonel castillo colonel this line is not repeat not secure i understand thank you castillo said wie gehts otto otto gorner was not at all happy to be reminded that kocian needed protection at all and that castillo wanted to get at least part of it from the argentine side you know what happened in budapest otto castillo said even without involving the argentines hes safer here than he would be there and you trust the argentines i trust them to act in their best interests keeping eric safe is in their best interests and ill have peoplegood peopleon him as well it was a moment before gorner responded ill call as soon as we hang up ill keep you posted castillo said yes of course you will gorner said and hung up castillo turned to alex darby the next call is the local one he said will you call the embassy switchboard and get the operator to block the caller id darby nodded took out his cellular and punched an autodial button this is darby he announced in the next thirty seconds or so there will be a secure call from colonel castillo from the white house he will give you a local number to call block the embassys caller id he paused yes i understand that from our switchboard the call here will not be secure he broke the connection and looked at castillo done go kick the ball for max alex and take susanna with you please he looked at kensington you stay bob but go deaf yes sir darby and susanna walked out of the quincho okay bob castillo ordered motioning with the handset get me the embassy on here hola the male voice answering pevsners home telephone did so in spanish but the thick russian accent was apparent in the pronunciation of the one word castillo thought it was probably the gorilla who had followed pevsner into the mens room at the service station let me speak to mr pevsner please castillo said politely in russian there is no one here by that name tell him herr gossinger is calling and get him on the line castillo ordered nastily there was no reply but twenty seconds later aleksandr pevsner came on the line guten morgen herr gossinger he said did alfredo get the pancake flour and maple syrup to you all right alek yes he did and thank you very much but why do i suspect that isnt the purpose of this call paranoia castillo asked innocently it was a moment before pevsner replied a chuckle in his voice do you know how many people dare to mock me friend charley only your friends and i dont suppose there are many of those are there or insult me pevsner asked probably about the same number castillo said solemnly when was the last time you saw alfredo when i gave him the syrup and flour paranoia makes me wonder if that question implies more than idle curiosity he seems to have disappeared pevsner said im concerned that sounded sincere have you asked howard kennedy kennedys the one who told me he cant find him or his wife and daughters i am going to have to resist a strong temptation to trust himand not tell him not to worry jesus h christ castillo said hoping he sounded concerned and angry what the hell would your friends want with munz what friends would those be charley you know goddamned well what friends the ones who tried to whack me in budapest and tried to kidnap andor whack one of my men in montevideo if my friends had tried to whack you charley we wouldnt be talking pevsner said matteroffactly other peoplenot my friendsmight be interested in what munz knows about that missing money in uruguay why dont you have howard tell the other people that i have it that presumes howardand for that matter meknow who the other people are yes it does i hope howard has relayed my message that anything done to eric kocian i will take personally pevsner didnt reply since you brought it up alek castillo pursued thats the real reason i called has howard relayed it there was a brief hesitation as pevsner carefully framed his reply i believe howard has spoken to some people who may know some other people well tell him to speak to them again and this time tell them ill take anything that happens to alfredo or his family just as personally as i would anything that happens to kocian why are you so concerned about munz does he know something you dont want other people to know you sonofabitch im concerned because hes a friend of mine for christs sake he took a bullet for me we apparently define the word friend differently sonofabitch pevsner parroted coolly its a good thing youre a soldier friend colonel charley soldiers swear otherwise i would really take offense at that would it break your heart to hear that i hope you did no pevsner said chuckling not at all would you be surprised if i told you youre wrong that i think we both define friend the same way yeah it would alfredo munz is a good man he has become almost as close a friend of mine as howard is i trust him as i do howard he worked well for me i try very hard to take care of my friends as you do charley he paused then went on if anything happens to my friend munz or his family then i would take it personally ill be a sonofabitch if i dont believe him maybe you better tell howard to tell some friends who may know some other friends that you feel that way alek i have pevsner said simply im on my way to the states castillo said if you hear anything let me know howard always seems to be able to find me is your friend kocian going with you so long alek always nice to talk to you because of the complex connection there was no easy way to hang up all castillo could do was cover the receiver with his hand and hope that pevsner would become impatient and hang up before the white house or embassy switchboard operators came on the line he was lucky he first heard pevsner swear then the sound of pevsner slamming his handset into its cradle three seconds before the white house switchboard operator asked are you through colonel mr alicia castillo please the white house is calling this is alicia castillo one moment please colonel castillo this line is not secure your party is on the line thank you i understand castillo said then asked abuela im very impressed carlos or should i call you colonel its been a long time since i had a call from the white house dont be are you all right is fernando with you were both fine hes getting the airplane ready were about to leave buenos aires for home by home you mean san antonio yes maam how long can you stay just long enough to drop fernando off then via midland im headed for washington and you cantor wonttell me about midland the same people who murdered mr masterson have threatened the family of a man who works with me an argentine were bringing them with us to protect them until we get this mess straightened out thats why i dont want you anywhere near the doublebarc theyll be in danger at the ranch theyll be protected at the ranch by the secret service until i can make other arrangements for them im sorry i have to use the ranch but i just didnt have any other options you can do whatever you please with the doublebarc carlos you own it that was an inheritance tax thing and you know it its your ranch abuela whose ever it once was the doublebarc is now yours your grandfather left hacienda san jorge to fernando and the doublebarc to you he thought you both should have a ranch for your families yes maam i know how many people are you taking there my friends wife and two daughters young women when will you be going there we should leave in two or three hours its about a thirteenhour flight its ten after nine here if you leave there in three hours that should put you in here about one in the morning right and dont even think what i know youre thinking about castillo said fernando can take a cab from the airport and please dont tell maria hes coming i hadnt planned to say anything to maria your plans have a way of changing well only be on the ground long enough to clear customs and take on fuel abuela he said reasonably so dont think of coming to the airport wont you be tired after a long flight like that too tired to fly on to midland and then all the way to washington i plan to sleep all the way to san antone castillo said fernando may be a little tired but thats not a problem well i suppose you know what youre doing she said fernando will tell you all thats happened castillo said i dont want to do that over the telephone i understand she said ill see you soon abuela castillo said i promise yes im sure you will dona alicia said via con dios mi amor you can break it down bob castillo said to sergeant kensington yes sir castillo looked out the plateglass window of the quincho and saw that corporal lester bradley usmc was again playing with max keep an eye on lester will you bob the kids going to be all right colonel kensington said you dont need to be all muscle to be a good special operatoris that what you mean yeah that too colonel kranz was even smaller than lester and he was a one hell of a soldier until these bastards got him operative words bob until these bastards got him keep an eye on bradley but thats not what i meant castillo looked at him then made a well let me know what you do mean gesture he knows how to handle tough situations well he certainly performed at the estancia didnt he i was talking about mackall no orders except from you and vic dallessando not to say one word about what went down here and what he was doing there awhathundredandthirtypound marine a corporal and everybody else is a sergeant or better you do know what happened there castillo shook his head kensington grinned jack davidson told me he thought some jarhead sergeant major was pulling his chain that lester was sent there as a joke so he asked lester how come he got sent to the q course when davidson asks somebody something he usually gets an answer what lester told him was he didnt know davidson asked him where he came from and lester told him hed been sort of the clerk typist for the marine guard detachment at the embassy here so davidson told him hed better forget about taking the course nothing personal he just didnt have what it takes he hadnt even been to jump school for one thing but since he was a clerk typist until davidson could straighten things out thats what he would do punch keys on a computer keyboard lester didnt even tell him hed done a tour in iraq so thats what he did until general mcnab and vic showed up at mackall to take him to kranzs funeral and mcnab thanked him for saving your ass with those two head shots in the ninjas castillo chuckled i would like to have seen sergeant major davidsons face when mcnab told him that but jack is formidable yes he is and maybe lester was just afraid to say anything oh no i asked him why he hadnt said anything and what he said was that he knew you and vic didnt want him to make waves so he didnt he said he knew everything would come out sooner or later thats my point hes a smart little sonofabitch and i like him yeah me too you still have some clout with mcnab colonel nobody has clout with mcnab i was hoping maybe you could get lester a waiverprobably waiversand let him take the q course he really wants to he wants to take the q course castillo asked dubiously he wants in special ops bad and as far as im concerned hes welcome well we know he performs dont we when this is over if thats what he wants ill see what i can do i owe him speaking of that colonel when you finally locate these bastards and start taking them out id like to be in on the operation if it can be arranged sure are you getting close i wish i could tell you i was a lot depends on what eric kocian yung and munz come up with so keep your other eye on them they already tried to whack yung will do colonel have a nice flight although he wasnt in uniform and therefore was not supposed to salute sergeant first class kensington saluted crisply lieutenant colonel castillo who was also in civilian clothing returned it just as crisply try hard to keep your dickand lestersout of the wringer sergeant castillo said and walked out of the quincho three aeropuerto internacional de carraso general cesareo l berisso carrasco montevideo republica oriental del uruguay august it looks like yung got carried away again charley jake torine said pointing out the cockpit window of the gulfstream as they taxied up to the business aircraft tarmac of the airport what i told him to do was get a picnic lunch castillo who was kneeling in the aisle just behind the pilots seat looked where torine pointed and saw they were being met by ground handlers customs and immigration officials and a large white van on the body of which was lettered airport gourmet isnt airport gourmet something like military intelligence fernando lopez in the copilots seat inquired innocently castillo was less amused the idea was not to attract attention he said he pushed himself upright and walked into the cabin sat on one of the couches and looked out the window the ground handlers guided the gulfstream to a place to park and torine shut down the engines castillo lowered the stair door and looked out the customs and immigration officers walked up to the airplane welcome to uruguay senor one of them said in english may we come aboard certainly castillo replied and stepped out of the way we understand that you are discharging no passengers or cargo thats correct but how the hell did you know that in that case senor there will be no customs or immigration formalities the crew may go to base operations to check the weather and file a flight plan thank you will you require fuel or any other service we just need to top off the tanks and wed like to take some food for the flight the officer gestured at the van the food has been arranged for the officer said thank you castillo said by that goddamned over efficient yung and we can have a fuel truck sent out quickly the officer said please come again and stay longer he added smiling then went down the door stairs with the other official following castillo went to the cockpit jake no formalities just file a flight plan where the hell are our passengers torine wondered aloud i dont know first things first file the flight plan by the time torine reached the doorway the airport gourmet truck had backed up to it so close that when the doors in the rear swung open they almost touched the fuselage dammit torine thought careful near the aircraft a man in a business suit leaped nimbly from the truck into the gulfstream buenos tardes he said cheerfully then looked at the distance between the truck and where he stood shook his head in disappointment and went down the stairs he stood at the rear of the truck and held up his hands as if to catch someone a young girl jumped down she kissed the man on the cheek then looked at castillo as if asking for permission to climb the stair door steps castillo thought that has to be alfredos youngest daughter he smiled and waved her onto the plane in short order another young woman and then an older one jumped from the truck kissed the man in the suit and came onto the airplane the man then climbed the stairs looked around the cabin and went in just to be careful i think wed better close these he said and pulled down the curtains over the windows beside the couches fbi special agent william d yung jr jumped from the truck into the airplane you are going to tell me whats going on right castillo asked yung colonel castillo this is chief inspector ordonez yung said gesturing to the man in the suit jesus christ what the hells the matter with yung introducing me by name and by rank ordonez smiled at castillo put out his hand and said let me express my gratitude to you colonel for doing what you are doing for the family of our mutual friend alfredo castillo shook the hand but didnt reply ordonez turned to torine youre the pilot torine nodded operations is right over there ordonez said pointing i suggest that you file to porto alegre brazil that will attract far less attention than a destination farther north torine shrugged then looked at castillo his facing asking why not castillo nodded and i further suggest that the sooner you get off the ground the better ordonez said torine went down the stairs and passing a fuel truck that had just pulled up alongside the portside wing walked quickly to the base operations building ordonez turned to yung you will help me with the picnic lunch david yung nodded ordonez looked at the women who were now all sitting on the couch you are in good hands i will look after alfredovia con dios then he went down the stairs and started to climb onto the truck yung handed castillo a folded sheet of typewriter paper everything i know is on here he said and went down the stairs castillo started to unfold the sheet of paper but before he had finished he heard yung call his name he went to the door yung was extending an insulated container to him castillo went halfway down the stairs and took it from him he some what awkwardly turned and set the container on the floor of the passenger compartment when he turned again yung was holding another identical container by the time he got that into the airplane and turned again he saw that ordonez was hauling yung into the airport gourmet truck call the office and leave a number where i can reach you castillo called out yung nodded as the truck doors swung closed a moment later the truck pulled away castillo smiled call the office and leave a number where i can reach you said the aluminumsiding sales manager to one of his problematic sales counselors jesus h christ he sensed the eyes of the women on him he walked into the cabin im carlos castillo a friend of your father he said to the youngest daughter she smiled shyly at him you speak spanish very well for a norteamericano the girl said thank you very much castillo said here comes jake lopez called from the cockpit five minutes later after torine dealt with the fuel crew and did his walkaround inspection of the aircraft he came up the stairs and pulled the door shut behind him wind it up fernando he called and turned to castillo we can take off local and change to porto alegre in the air he said torine looked at the women and addressed the youngest girl do you speak english si senor a little torine smiled im the pilot if the flight attendant here doesnt give you everything you want you just let me know i have to tell you hes one of our worst she smiled at him and then at castillo there came the whine of an engine starting sixty seconds later the gulfstream started to move castillo had unfolded the sheet of typewriter paper and was reading it before they reached the threshold of the active runway colonel i wasnt sure if we would have time to talk this is written before we go to the airport of course where we all may be led off in handcuffs ordonez is one smart cop luckily for us hes a good friend of munz he knows a lottoo much but not everythingabout the estancia he knows the russian mafiosas helicopter was there he suspects his involvement he knows what happened has nothing to do with lorimer being a drug dealer he knows it has to do with the oilforfood business im afraid i may have confirmed this for him he knows that we grabbed the money no proof but he knows and i know hes good at finding proof of what he suspects he has positively identified by fingerprints one of the ninjas as major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia who he met when castro was in montevideo and vincenzo was in charge of his security i think as soon as we can get on a secure line we should talk if i have screwed things up im really sorry yung castillo read the note twice then folded it and put it in his shirt pocket when the gulfstream was at altitude he went to the cockpit and showed it to torine and lopez four san antonio international airport san antonio texas august castillo woke up when lopez shook his shoulder he had been sleeping uncomfortably most of the way from quito in one of the chairs next to the forward bulkhead of the passenger compartment his feet on the facing chair the younger munz girl was in the chair across the aisle senora munz and the older girl had taken the two couches when he opened his eyes castillo saw that they were now sitting up and that the eyes of the younger girl now sitting tensely in her chair showed concern maybe even fear and then he saw why there were four other people in the passenger compartment one of them was nattily dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant of the us citizenship and immigration services the other three were heavily armed and dressed in black jumpsuits on the breasts of which were badges of officers of the us customs and border protection service one of the customs officers an enormous swarthy man held an uzi in the position that caused castillo to speak rudely to him point that goddamned muzzle at the floor castillo barked in english gringo lopez said cautiously the officer moved the uzi toward castillo you dont speak english castillo snapped in spanish dont point that thing at me take it easy sir the citizenship and immigration services lieutenant said the lieutenant looked at the big guy holding the uzi and ordered lower that muzzle better castillo said still furious carlos lopez said these gentlemen wish to search the aircraft and our luggage torine thought you might wish to discuss that with them we are going to search the aircraft understand that the enormous swarthy man announced not at all pleasantly castillo locked eyes with him then might i sir with all respect and humility suggest that you begin your thorough inspection of our luggage with my briefcase he asked sarcastically its right there on the floor whats in the briefcase the enormous man asked my credentials castillo said im supervisory special agent castillo of the secret service the swarthy man considered that a moment then said get it thats what he is all right the swarthy man said visibly cowed by the credentials but that didnt last long we are still going to search your luggage and the aircraft thats regulations search away castillo said i simply wanted to identify myself before you saw the weapons we have aboard he turned to the immigration lieutenant how do we get through immigration theres a van outside thatll carry you to the commercial side of the airport and bring us back the lieutenant nodded ladies castillo said leave everything on board but your purses we have to go through the immigration process on behalf of the united states of america i apologize for this rude reception thanks for everything fernando castillo said when they were back at the gulfstream when you get home blame everything on me maria will do that anyway lopez said he picked castillo off the ground in a bear hug if you need me for anything forget it lopez said you got it i didnt mean that gringo and you know it what i want you to do is make sure abuela doesnt go anywhere near midland i will believe me ill find someplace else for the munzes just as soon as i can lopez nodded shook hands with torine kissed the cheeks of the munz women then turned and climbed back in the van as the others went aboard the gulfstream castillo watched it drive away until it was out of sight and then not remembering if he had seen torinedo it or not did the walkaround inspection of the plane then went up the stairs into it he smiled at the younger munz girl colonel torine has said i can ride up in front if i promise not to touch anything she smiled back at him when he stepped into the cockpit he saw that jake torine was strapping himself into the copilots seat im pleased to see that you remembered its the pilot in commands duty to do the walkaround torine said has anything important fallen off five doublebarc ranch near midland texas august as castillo applied the thrust reversers he saw that there were two black gmc yukon xls parked next to the hangar and a silver jaguar well the secret service is here and the jaguar which is almost certainly abuelas is here because so was she when the heat got to her she had the lear pick her up when he had taxied the gulfstream back to the hangar from the end of the runway and stopped torine said ill shut it down charley you tend to our passengers castillo unstrapped himself and went to the passenger compartment where he tripped the door open switch the door began to move and a dry heat started to blow in it had a familiar feel and smell senora munz and the younger girl smiling were on their feet and looking down at the older sister who was sound asleep on one of the couches well they say a perfect landing is one that a you can walk away from and b doesnt wake the passengers he smiled at the younger girl ill get some ice water he said you can pour it in her ear thatll wake her up carlos thats an awful thing to say a familiar voice said from the open doorway behind him in english then the voice switched to spanish im alicia castillo this terrible young man is my grandson welcome to our home castillo turned as his grandmother pushed past him to get at the munz family he saw a heavyset man obviously a secret service agent standing just inside the door the heavyset man shrugged and held up both hands the meaning was clear i didnt know how to stop her xiii one lehigh valley international airport allentown pennsylvania august as he taxied the gulfstream to the lehigh valley aviation services tarmac castillo saw united states secret service special agent john m brittonbrightly attired in a pink seersucker jacket a yellow polo shirt light blue trousers and highly polished tassel loafersleaning against the front fender of one of two black yukons whose darkened windows identified them to castillo as almost certainly secret service vehicles with britton were three menmore sedately dressedwho castillo thought were probably the local secret service castillo parked the aircraft you go deal with the welcoming committee torine said ill do the paperwork and get us some fuel speaking of which you want to give me your credit card castillo unstrapped himself worked his way out of the pilots seat gave torine an american express card then went into the empty passenger compartment and opened the door and went down the stairs nice airplane britton greeted him this is the first time ive seen it how are you jack castillo said as they shook hands britton made the introductions these are special agents harry larsen and bob davis and their boss supervisory special agent fred swanson theyre out of philadelphia im an old pal of isaacson and mcguire swanson said as they shook hands then i guess you heard that my secret service credentials are a little questionable yeah and i also heard getting them for you was joels idea swanson said so youre among friends colonel call me charley castillo said i made light colonel so recently that when someone says it i look around to see who theyre talking to swanson chuckled and you know that jack can hardly be called a grizzled veteran of the secret service castillo went on he told me he also told me joel recruited him which makes him okay in my booki know what jack did in philly too isaacson told me that just when he was going to see if he would fit in the protection detail you grabbed him for whatever it is you do what did heor anybodytell you about that joel was pretty vague britton has been a clam and when i asked mcguire he said you were the only guy who could decide we had the need to know castillo considered that then nodded okay you do the classification is top secret presidential but lets wait until were out of here where are we headed the farm theres not much to see britton said i better see what there is castillo said but first jake and i need a shower and a shave and then breakfast its been a long flight whered you come from swanson asked buenos aires and thats classified swansons eyebrows went up but he didnt say anything were in the hotel bethlehem in bethlehem britton said its not the four seasonsno marble walls in the bathroomsbut theres plenty of hot water and towels and a nice restaurant and its near where were going fine i suppose this is also classified britton said yung called miller from washington and miller called me yung was in miami about to load lorimers body on a plane to new orleans hes really anxious to talk to you and vice versa castillo said lorimers body swanson parroted can i ask who yung is david yung is an fbi agent who now works for me castillo said jeanpaul lorimeran american a un diplomat up to his eyeballs in the iraq oilforfood scamwas whacked by parties unknown at his estancia in uruguay this is starting to get interesting swanson said the secret service is involved castillo said i asked tom mcguire to send people to watch the lorimer family the funeral home the funeral etcetera to see if they can make any of the mourners and to keep an eye on yung these bastards have already tried to kidnap andor whack him really interesting swanson said neither tom or joel mentioned anything about that either i told you they couldnt castillo said and what i said just now about parties unknown wasnt entirely accurate he looked at britton jack we now know who one of the ninjas was he was positively identifiedfingerprintsby a uruguayan cop as major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia no shit britton said in great surprise i suppose you realize colonel that youre really whetting my curiosity swanson said lets get in one of the yukons castillo said we can start clueing you in while torines dealing with the airplane i dont think we can finish but we can start fifteen minutes later jake torine handed castillos american express card to the lehigh aviation services fuel truck driver who took it without question ran it through his machine then handed it back with the sales slip for his signature torine signed the slipusing his own signature but it would have taken the expert eye of a forensic document examiner to determine that the scribble read torine and not castillothen walked across the blazinghot tarmac to the black yukon that castillo and the others had climbed in special agent bob davis of the secret service had to get out of the truck fold down the middlerow seat he had been occupying and get in the back third row of seats so torine could get in if you werent such a paragon of virtue and honesty charley torine said after the introductions were made and as he handed castillo his credit card you probably wouldnt have to pay for the fuel and the landing fee i signed the bill abraham lincoln when torine didnt get the laugh he expected he added somehow i sense im interrupting something i have been regaling these gentlemen with the plot of the mystery castillo said how far did you get dropping the munzes at the ranch in midland castillo said i told them everything jake we need all the help we can get any of this make any sense to you mr swanson torine asked no colonel it doesnt and i am about to be overwhelmed with curiosity as to how these rambo operations of yours are connected with these homegrown muslims were watching as a highest priority tell them jack castillo ordered okay britton said and took a moment to form his thoughts you know fred that when i was on the philly cops i was undercover for a long time in the aariteg mosque that must have been fun special agent davis commented from the backseat how long did you get away with that before they made you three and a half yearsand they never made me im impressed davis said in genuine admiration yeah me too castillo said right after we came back from uruguay britton said i heard that another undercover cop in the aariteg mosque a pal of mine named sy fillmore had gone over the edgethe cops found him wandering around babbling in north philly once they learned several days later he was a fellow cop they had him put in the loony tunes ward in friends hospital so i went to see him and he told me that aals had bought a hundredtwentyacre farm in bucks county on whichor in whichwere some prerevolutionary war iron mines that they were stocking with food and water and in which they are going to take cover when a briefcasesized nuclear bomb is detonated in philly jesus christ special agent davis exclaimed and youre taking this seriously swanson asked his tone serious it sounds incredible yes it does britton said and thats what chief inspector dutch kramer decided when he heard it first of all it came from fillmore who slides back and forth between making sense and babbling and is indeed incredible on its face value kramer didnt even tell the fbi but when i told charley both he and mcguire and i suppose isaacson too decided i should look into it thats when you got involved you mean joel knew this and didnt tell me swanson asked indignantly all i got was some bullshit about starting a highest priority roundtheclock surveillance of these lunatics the reason for which i would learn in due time you werent cleared for that information castillo said reasonably ive got a couple of security clearances swanson said three or four of them with names and joel knows that joel couldnt tell you castillo said only two people can decide who has the need to know the reply didnt seem to surprise swanson he nodded and asked the director of national intelligence and the secretary of homeland security castillo shook his head the president and me only you and the president thats impressive colonel swanson said can i interpret that to mean somebody really high up thinks this threat is credible ambassador montvale thinks its credible and as soon as i have a look at this place jack were going to washington he wants to see you personally oh shit britton said which reminds me castillo said he pointed to a radio mounted under the yukons dashboard is that tied into the secret services communications system i mean in washington swanson nodded id like to get word to montvale that im here and that im coming to washingtonwith brittonas soon as were through here eta to come later swanson nodded and pressed his finger to his lapel cheesesteak here he said is this thing working the response came immediately loud and clear get word to big eye that don juan is with me and will be coming to see himwith englishlater today eta to follow acknowledge delivery got it will do swanson turned to castillo and said done thanks castillo said although i feel like ive just made an appointment with my dentist swanson smiled then asked you think this threat is credible colonel no castillo said ive been talking to some people who know about bombs like this and know about the russians and they dont think so and if i had to bet id go with them why swanson asked simply theres supposed to be a hundred of these briefcasesized nukes hidden around the country there was even some kgb defector who testified before congress that hed scouted places to hide them the defectors name was colonel pyotr sunev castillo said and after the cia set up a new identity for him as a professor at grinnell college he disappeared one day then turned up in europe once again in the kgb disinformation swanson asked castillo nodded and a lot of egg on the cias face castillo nodded again and from everything ive learned about these bombs castillo said which i admit isnt much theyre the size of a suitcase not a briefcase and the firing mechanisms are coded i cant imagine the russians giving a bomb much less that code to a bunch of lunatics what about our friends in the muslim world i think if they had a bomb and the code to detonate it they would have already used it the russians have their own trouble with the muslims i just cant see them handing a nuke to any of them theyd be liable to set it off in moscow so whats going on with these nuts in durham i wish i knew the first thing id like to know is where they got the money to buy the farm in the first place jack tells me the aariteg mosque had trouble paying their rent they paid for it with a cashiers check for drawn against the account of the aariteg mosque clyde j matthews financial officer in the merchants national bank of easton colonel special agent harry larsen said clyde aka abdul khatami is one great big mean sonofabitch britton added hes the head mullah of the aariteg mosque before he found muhammad ol clyde was in and out of the slam from the time he was fifteen mostly drugs but some heavier stuff tooarmed robbery attempted murder etcetera he was doing fivetoten in a federal slamfor cashing social security checks that werent hiswhen he was converted to islam mr matthewss account was opened six weeks before with six hundred in cash larsen went on it was essentially dormanttwo small checks to pay for gas signed by matthews but the payeesame one a gas station in riegelsvilleamounts and dates filled in by somebody else i think one might describe mr matthews as being some what literacy handicapped britton interrupted in an effeminate voice causing the others to chuckle until two days before the cashiers check for the farm was drawn larsen went on there had been a wire deposit of from a numbered account in the caledonian bank and trust limited in the cayman islands he paused and looked at castillo i dont know if you know this or not colonel but the cayman islands have stricter banking secrecy laws than switzerland i did not because im smart but because special agent yung told me hes our resident expert in foreign banking and dirty money our reluctant expert britton said hes seen the light jack castillo said did he see it before or after they popped him so larsen went on a touch of impatience in his voice our chances of finding out who owns that account are practically nonexistent on the day the check to pay for the farm was issued there was a second cashiers check for payable to fred beans cadillac buick pontiac gmc inc north easton road in doylestown as payment in full for a cadillac escalade a white one well ive always said britton said in his effeminate voice if you dont want to attract attention get a white cadillac escalade even larsen laughed is this guy intellectually challenged jack larsen asked hes street smart with a fiveyear postgraduate course in crime at lewisburg behind him hes ignorant but not stupid dangerous and matthews withdrew ten thousand dollars in cash larsen said i dont know anything about this sort of thing castillo said doesnt the irs get involved in this some how believe it or not colonel there are a few nice irs agents i got most of what i have from one of them whos a friend of mine can he keep his mouth shut castillo asked larsen nodded they get notified whenever theres a cash transaction of ten thousand or better when matthews took the ten thousand in cash that gave my guy the in to go into the bank records when i asked him if i suddenly had a deposit of nearly two million from an offshore bank wouldnt i have to answer some questions he said i would but im not a mosque the aariteg mosque so far as the irs is concerned is a religious institution religious institutions do not have to identify their members or their donors or pay taxes shit castillo said id say this whole suitcase nuke thing is absurd larsen said except for all that money and except for the fact that abdul khatami and his loyal muslims helped the holy legion of muhammad steal that britton said he turned to larsen you know that story joel told me larsen said smiled and pointed at torine and castillo and that these two stole it back you think this money came from terrorists colonel i have no goddamned idea where it came from castillo said bitterly but the terrorists are not stupid would they hand this clown two million dollars just because they like him or maybe to pull our chain when we heard about it i dont think so but i dont know swanson said follow the money i say based on my wealth of experience and not having a clue how youd actually do that larsens right about bank secrecy in the cayman islands what we have is a coded list of what we think are names and addresses we took from lorimers safe castillo said by now the whiz kids at fort meade should have that decoded and i have all of eric kocians notes about european involvement in the oilforfood scam theres a cia guy in paris who knows a lot about these sadms these what larsen interrupted nuclear suitcases castillo said the russians call them special atomic demolition munitions this guy is already on his way to washington he may already be there therere two other cia types in buenos aires who know something about them we know now that one of the ninjas was a senior cuban spook he paused in all a lot of disconnected information all we can do is try to put it together he exhaled audibly can we go get some breakfast two state route near durham bucks county pennsylvania august the secret service radio went off in the black yukon xl as they were going down a winding road through the countryside cheesecake go big eye asks for don juans present location destination and eta as soon as possible he will send a taxi swanson looked at castillo dont tell him where we are castillo said jake were going into baltimore right baltimorewashington international thurgood marshall airport torine corrected and eta will be furnished when available castillo said don juan going to bwi eta will be furnished when available swanson said into his lapel microphone cheesecake off castillo saw the questions in swansons eyes i dont care if he knows where i am castillo said but i dont want to talk to him right now swanson nodded the entrance to the farm is about half a mile on the right swanson said five minutes later you cant see muchnothing but an unpaved roadfrom the highway ive got some people really good at what they do in a house directly across the highway taking pictures of everyone going into and out of the farm road we told the guy who owns the house that were investigating a drug operation so far ive recognized all of them britton said theyre all from the aariteg mosque and weve got a cessna that flies over the farm every couple of hours taking pictures swanson said all thats produced is that theyve got three house trailers parked near the farmhouse new ones britton interrupted which makes me wonder where they got the money for them and a ford pickup one of those with two rows of seats also new registered to the mosque in philadelphia same question about how did they pay for that britton said okay swanson said pointing out his deeply tinted passengers window here we are the road winds around that hill to the farm the iron mines are in that hill on the back side castillo saw the steep treecovered hill but almost missed the road as the yukon rolled past it not much to see is there britton said castillo didnt reply directly maybe you better get me a set of those pictures he said im way ahead of you colonel britton said the ones taken from the house are on their wayaint email and digital photography wonderfulto dutch kramer and tom mcguire five minutes after theyre taken the aerials go the same way ten minutes after the cessna lands at allentown so far nobody we dont know is that about all there is to see here castillo said yep swanson said then asked where do you want to go now to the hotel christ we forgot to eat torine said is there some place a mcdonalds or somethingbetter yet a wendyson the way to the airport castillo asked i suppose a shave and a shower is out of the question torine said drily i want to get to washington and a secure telephone as quickly as i can jake castillo said i need to talk to yung and see whats going on before jack and i go see the dragon the last thing i had to eat was a stringy cold ecuadorian chicken leg somewhere over the pacific ocean torine said and that was so long ago i forget when well thats the air force for you castillo said unless theyre being fed a steak by some longlegged blond stewardess with a dazzling smile they think theyre suffering the air force teaches that an officer should never be rude to an officer junior to them in rank torine said in your case im going to make an exception fuck you colonel i want more for breakfast than a goddamned hamburger castillo laughed youre right jake he said so do i and since montvale is sending a taxi for us wed better have that shave and a shower my sole remaining clean shirt and fresh undies are on the airplane torine said we can change on the way to baltimore castillo said if you have to talk to your guy yung in new orleans swanson said and were sitting on him there then once we get to the hotel i can get the number of a pay phone to our guys and yung can call you on it it wont be a secure line but thats how the bad guys communicate and it works for them youre a good man mr swanson so they tell me swanson said three baltimorewashington international thurgood marshall airport baltimore maryland august there was a secret service yukon xl waiting for them at the signature flight support building true to the traditions of the secret service there was no change of expression on the agents face when he came onto the gulfstream and saw castillo on his knees in the passenger compartment removing an uzi a micro uzi and a suppressed ruger caliber pistol from the compartment under one of the couches and then carefully handing them one at a time to torine and britton when castillo climbed into the front seat of the truck beside the agent he was just about to ask where are we headed when the secret service agent spoke into his lapel microphone leaving thurgood for the oeob he said with don juan lindbergh and english aboard advise big eye eta charley torine said why do i think there is something derisive in your code name but that english really fits britton and lindbergh is absolutely appropriate for me because you are modestyimpaired jake i understand thats fairly common in the air force what do you want me to do when you and jack are with montvale pay close attention you might learn something i have to be there you have to be there castillo said four the office of the director of national intelligence the old executive office building washington dc august ambassador charles w montvales office in the oeob was not very impressive for the very powerful man the press had dubbed the new intelligence czar it consisted of two small sparsely furnished rooms and the first thing castillo thought when he saw it was that it was even smaller than the oeob offices of secretary of homeland security matthew hall there was a reason for this both montvale and hall had far larger and more ornately furnished offices elsewhere the primary purpose of their oeob offices was to provide them with a place to wait and take calls until time was found for them in the presidents schedule cabinet members such as himself secretary hall had once only half jokingly told castillo could not afford to be seen sitting twiddling their thumbs on chairs outside the oval office like schoolboys having been sent to the principals office for disciplining it was bad for their public image castillo was surprised when montvale didnt keep them waiting his secretaryor executive assistant whatever she waswent directly to montvales door and opened it the moment she saw them walking into the outer office colonel castillo and two other gentlemen are here the secretary said castillo didnt hear a reply but a moment later the secretary said go right in please gentlemen castillo went in first aware that a pavlovian reflex had kicked in tryingand almost succeedingto make him march in salute stand at attention and bark lieutenant colonel castillo reporting as ordered sir good afternoon mr ambassador castillo said hello charley montvale said he acknowledged torine by saying colonel then looked at britton i like that montvale announced with a smile pink and yellow and blue go well together but you dont bring up what usually comes to mind when someone says secret service i try to put the emphasis on the secret in secret service mr ambassador britton said on a scale of one to ten britton montvale said his tone suddenly serious whats your take on the chances of a nuclear weapon being detonated in philadelphia anytime soon pointzerozeroone mr ambassador britton responded immediately that answer sounded rehearsed your question was expected mr ambassador colonel castillo told you to expect it no but i didnt think you were calling me down here to discuss my wardrobe now i know why colonel castillo likes you montvale said youre about as much of a selfconfident wiseass as he is now you and colonel torine please step out for a momentactually its probably going to be a bit longer than thatwhile i have a private word with the colonel tell joanne no calls except from the president personally and to get you some coffee yes sir britton said thank you thank you mr ambassador torine said and turned and followed britton out montvale waited until the door had closed you understand i hope charley how much rides on brittonsand thus yourassessment of the threat that there is a sadm somewhere around philadelphia ive talked to some other people sir it montvale shut him off by raising his hand like a traffic cop hold that until the briefing he said i thought this was the briefing castillo said it was more of a question right now we have to talk about your elevenhundreddollaraday love nest in the mayflower hotel montvale said sir thats how pulitzer prizewinning reporter c harry whelan jr of the washington post described it no what harry actually said when he called secretary hall and told him he intended to make certain allegations in a story and wanted in fairness to get his version before it was published he was in motel monica lewinsky he paused then added with a thin smile he has a flair for colorful phrases what sort of allegations that an army officer by the name of castillo who is an agent of the defense intelligence agency is whooping it up on the taxpayers dollar in the mayflower and elsewhere all over the world oh shit whered that come from i never was assigned to the dia think about it a moment montvale ordered and tell me the first name that comes to mind three seconds later castillo said mr patricia davies wilson montvale nodded goddamn her hell hath no fury like the female scorned i understand you might want to write that down to think about the next time you experience the sinful lusts of the flesh and are about to throw caution to the winds and with it your career the mission youve been given by the president and the manyall unpleasant to contemplatemanifestations of that the next time what next time im blown the problem now is how to keep the finding operation from being blown with me im blown thats it the most i can hope for is that i will be allowed to resign for the good of the service and go hide somewhere before this reporter can find me once im out of the service i dont have to even talk to this guy if he could find meand i dont think hell be able to do that all the army has to do is say theyre way ahead of the reporter and the guy with the love nest has already been allowed to resign and they have no idea where former lieutenant colonel castillo is and by the way he was never assigned to the dia he paused does general naylor know about this montvale nodded he wont like it but between him and schoomaker i can be out of the army and out of washington by noon tomorrow montvale just looked at him is edgar delchamps here yet castillo said montvale nodded then what i suggest sir is that you keep him under wraps until you can recommend to the president that he turn the finding operation over to him why would i want to do that colonel montvale asked softly its the only way i can think of to keep the finding operation from being blown hes privy to just about everything but theres no way that he can be tied to me the finding operation or anybody else ive been working with once im gone and hes got the finding operation i can meet him someplace and give him everything he doesnt already have the finding operation doesnt have to go down the toilet with me and why in the world montvale asked knowing whats happened would mr delchamps take on that responsibility if i were he id think i was being set up as the fall guy he would reason that mr whelan is not going to let this story go just because he cant find you hes a pro mr ambassador he knows the risks of doing something that has to be done hes been doing it a long time hell take the job and more than likely do a better job with it than ive been doing let me get this straight castillo what you are saying you want to do is quietly fold your tent and steal away into anonymity pay for your carnal sins with so to speak professional suicide i wouldnt put it quite that way mr ambassador but yes i suppose i disappear and the finding operation goes on i dont have any better ideas fortunately i do sir fortunately i do montvale repeated more precisely did whatever you want me to do sir castillo said let me tell you what i did colonel when secretary hall called me to tell me c harry whelan jr wanted to talk about your elevenhundreddollaraday love nest i suggested that he invite mr whelan to luncheon with both of us the next day in his private dining room at the nebraska avenue complex what sir telling him that i would tell him everything there i further suggested that he put major miller back into his uniform and wheelchairthe last time miller came here to tell me what you were up to he was wearing civilian clothing and using canestwo of themwhich naturally aroused ones sympathy but not as much as a fully uniformed wounded hero in a wheelchair wouldand that he advise major miller of the situation and invite him to take lunch with us i told secretary hall that mr whelan was known to be fond of oysters grilled colorado trout avec beurre noir and an obscure california chardonnayjudges peak i told secretary hall that if he could handle the oysters and the trout i would send over a case of the judges peak when i sent the wine i also sent a team of specialists from nsa to install microphones discreetly around the dining room and to instruct miller in their use my god hes telling me he bugged halls private dining room what the hell for miller at my orders was waiting in your office for me when i arrived at the nebraska avenue complex mr whelan was already in the dining room with secretary hall i shall long remember millers response to my question what would you say mr whelans frame of mind is miller said mr ambassador his face looks like hes happily looking forward to nailing all our nuts to the floor i then wheeled miller his knee again wrapped in far more white elastic gauze than was necessary into the dining room whelans eyes lit up they lit up even more when i introduced miller as your roommate in the motel monica lewinsky mr whelan said id like to hear about that what happened to your knee major in good time harry i said ill tell you everything but first id like and im sure major miller would like one of those mr whelan was drinking a vodka martini a large one i dont know where hes going with this castillo thought but he loves telling the tale made with polish hundredtwentyproof spirits the waiter promptly poured martinis for miller and myself ours were one hundred percent ice water with a twist of lemon and two speared cocktail onions you were trying to get him drunk not drunk happy one never knows what a drunk is liable to do montvale said and did you get him happy oh yes first i complimented him on his piece about senator davis in yesterdays post the senator has been using an airplane just like yours belonging to a corporation just awarded an enormous interstate highway construction contract as if it were his own that put harry in a good mood as did the first of what turned out to be three bottles of the judges peak consumed along with some chilean oysters and then we had our lunch the grilled trout with beurre noir washed down with more of the chardonnay by then mr whelan was telling us of his journalistic career how hed started out on a weekly and worked his way up through the louisville courierjournal to the post it was a long story and fascinated with this tale of journalistic skill and prowess i naturally kept asking him for amplification meanwhile the wine was flowing and there had not been a mention of lieutenant colonel c g castillo and this reporter didnt sense what was going on eventually he suspected he was being manipulated or he realized that he had been doing all the talking in any event he asked miller i asked before what happened to your leg and never got an answer to which i quickly responded major miller suffered grievous woundshe will shortly be retiredin afghanistan his helicopter was shot down whelan jumped on that so whats he doing here in this office of organizational analysis and by the way what is that what does it do and for whom etcetera one question after another i asked him if he had ever heard of the west point protective association montvale went on to which he replied of course i have what about it whats miller being protected from and by whom at that point i began to suspect i had him montvale said i told him that actually miller was doing the protecting that was why he was sharing the apartment at the mayflower to which whelan replied something to the effect that we were now getting down to the nittygritty what was miller protecting you from from himself ive very sorry to have to tell you i replied and went on major milleris assigned pending his retirement to the detachment of patients at walter reed now he goes there daily on an outpatient basis for treatment of his knee and his other wounds when miller heard that majornow lieutenant colonelcastillo was in trouble he askedunofficially of courseif he could try to help him they were classmates at west point as well as comradesinarms in bitter combat permission was grantedunofficially of course you told this guy miller is protecting me castillo asked incredulously from what montvale ignored the question this announcement caused whelan to quiver like a pointer on a quail montvale said he just knew he was onto something how is this castillo in trouble whelan asked something to do with his elevenhundreddollaraday love nest in the motel monica to which i replied montvale went on that i wasnt at all surprised that a veteran journalist like himself had found out about your suite in the mayflower and that i therefore presumed he knew about your gulfstream he told this reporter about the gulfstream where the hell is he going with this whelan said that he had heard something about it montvale continued although the look on his face more than strongly suggested this was news to him i then told him i would fill him in on what few details he didnt know and told him that you had paid seven and a half million dollars for what i was very afraid he would be soon calling your flying love nest and then i told him the last anyone heard from you you had flown it to budapest i thought carefully about telling him about budapest but i decided that if i was wrong and didnt have him in my pocket and since you acquired it so recently he might find out about the flight there and ask questions this way i nipped those questions in the bud i dont know what the hell to say castillo said ill tell you when i want a response from you colonel montvale said evenly right now just listen we dont have much time much time for what sorry sir so predictably whelan says something to the effect that he hopes i am going to tell him where an army officer was getting the money to live in the mayflower and buy a gulfstream to which i replied something to the effect that i was going to tell him everything not only because i knew hed find out anyway but also because i knew him well enough to trust his judgment his decency and his patriotism at that moment for a moment i thought perhaps i had gone a bit too far he was more than halfway into his cups but on the other hand he didnt get where he is by being an utter fool and sure enough the next words out of his mouth are why do i think im being smoozed i didnt reply instead i took your servicerecord jacket from my briefcase and laid it before him my jacket where the hell did he get my jacket theyre supposed to be in the safe at special operations command in tampa where nobody gets to see them montvale saw the look on castillos face knew what it meant and decided to explain you asked a while back if general naylor knew of the situation youd gotten yourself in he knew of course how youd met mr wilson in angola and even of your unwise dalliance with her still it required a good deal of persuasion on my part to bring him on board to agree this was the only possible way to deal with this situation and to authorize flying your records up here but that too was a fortunate happenstance because once id brought him on board he provided me with a number of very touching details of your life that proved to be quite valuable very touching details oh shit what does that mean to go on after first reminding mr whelan that the freedom of information act did not entitle him or anyone else to peruse your personal history data i told him i was going to tell him everything about your distinguished record which he could verify by checking the records i had just put into his hands you let him see my jacket theres a lot of classified material in there missions i was on that are still classified they keep the goddamned thing in a safe in tampa your entire file is lassified top secret that impressed mr whelan in no small way i began with going through your decorationsand i must say even i was impressed colonelstarting with your first dfc and purple heart which i pointed out you had earned when you were a mere boy just months out of west point and ending with your last purple heart in afghanistan when that was over i knew i had whelan hooked because he put on his tough nononsense journalists face and tone of voice and said okay very impressive but lets get back to the love nests both of them and i think you should know that i know all about this karl gossinger character i asked you know everything about karl wilhelm gossinger and he replied the elevenhundreddollaraday love nest in motel monica lewinsky is registered to him hes supposed to be the washington correspondent for the tages zeitung newspapers nobody i know ever heard of him and i havent been able to find him yet but i will i told him that he already had that you and gossinger were one and the same jesus christ and that you were born out of wedlock and never knew your father that your mother was a teenage german girl whose name was gossinger you had no right to get into that castillo flared thats my personal business i had of course considered your personal business before i decided i had to deal with whelan and concluded that protecting the president of the united states certain members of his cabinet and finding out who the people who murdered masterson are and dealing with them was the most important thing and far outweighed any momentary embarrassment you might feel you get the picture colonel if you had kept your male member behind its zipper when you should have you and i would not be sitting here would we goddamn himhes right no sir we would not i apologize for the outburst fuck the outburst castillo apologize for not thinking yes sir no excuse sir montvale looked coldly at castillo for a moment then went on conversationally the anger gone from his voice so i told mr whelan that your father was a teenage american helicopter pilot who died for our country in vietnam without ever knowing he had a son and of course that warrant officer junior grade jorge alejandro castillo was a true hero a legend in army aviation in the army i could tell from the look on his face that while he was impressed he thought i was laying it on a little thick of course i wasnt through i asked him if he knew general naylor and of course he said he did and then i told him how general allan naylor becomes involved in the saga of lieutenant colonel castillo i really dont want to know what else you told this man but i realize i should know yes you should montvale said i told mr whelan that when you were twelve your mother the sole heiress to the gossinger fortunei told him i was sure he knew that the tages zeitung newspaper chain was owned by gossinger beteiligungsgesellschaft gmbh he nodded although ill bet he was hearing that for the first timewas diagnosed with a terminal illness i told him your mother went to the us armyspecifically to thenmajor allan naylor who was stationed nearbyand asked for help to find her sons father in the united states and told him why i told him that allan naylor told me he promised some what reluctantly to see what he could do as he had no respect for an officer who would leave a love child behind him and was concerned about what would happen when a man of such low character came into the fortune the boy would inherit and of course that when he did look into it he learned that your father was a posthumous recipient of the medal of honor and not only that but the only son of a distinguished and equally wealthy family in san antonio the question then became would the castillos who traced their texas lineage back to two men who fell beside davy crockett and the other heroes of the alamo accept their sons illegitimate german son castillos anger began to build again why the hell did you tell him all this i dont want any pity well then youre not going to like the rest of this montvale said by the time i was through i was nearly in tears myself about poor charley castillo oh shit castillo said softly i told him that that hadnt turned out to be a problem that your grandmother took one look at the picture of you that naylor had shown her and said he has my jorges eyes and was on a plane to germany that night i then painted a touching picture of this poor illegitimate parentless boy being suddenly thrust into an alien culture with nothing to hang on to but memories of his late mother and the legend of his heroic father of his going to west point and then to war determined to be worthy of his hero father i went over your list of decorations mr ambassador castillo interrupted i dont think thatll keep this guy from writing just about what he started to write in the first place in fact it would appear that he now has a bigger story if youll indulge me colonel montvale said icily ill tell you how i did just that sorry i ended your touching life story by telling him that you stole a helicopter in afghanistan to save millers crew at great risk not only to your career but your life itself oh boy hearing that mr whelan really fixed the hook in himself mr ambassador he asked forgive me but wasnt that a crazy thing to do whereupon i looked at him sadly and said precisely it was an insane irrational act major castillo had gone to the well of his resources once too often and found it dry everybody has a breaking point and castillo had reached his in other words you told him im crazy in effect i didnt use those words i told him you were sent home from afghanistan for some welldeserved rest i implied that on the plane from afghanistan you had decided your number was about up and that being the case you were going to have some fun before you met the grim reaper fun that you were going to pay for with your personal wealth something you had never done before another indication of an overstressed mind and i told him that it was at this point that the west point protective association came into play in the person of general allan naylor i told him that naylor didnt know what to do with you he could not give you in your current state of mind the command of a battalion to which you were entitled the way you were drinking and chasing wild wild women you would soon be relieved of any command you were given jesus is that part true and he was reluctant to have you hospitalized for psychological problems because that on your records would keep you from ever becoming a general montvale paused when he saw the look on castillos face then added that was an original thought of mine getting you psychiatric help never occurred to general naylor what i told whelan was that naylor went to secretary hall who had been decorated for valor and wounds while serving under naylor in vietnam and was thus a fellow warrior who knew how even the best of men sometimes reach their limits oh my god and asked him if he could find something for you to do until you got some rest which hall of course agreed to do and naylor also arranged for miller whose life you had saved to be placed on outpatient status at walter reed so that he could look after you castillo shaking his head in disbelief said nothing so far youre still stressed you mean crazy castillo said bitterly but you seem to be improving general naylor hopes that soon you will be able to return to normal duty in the army the army has done what it could to help a distinguished warrior the son of an even more distinguished warrior and whelan swallowed this yarn he had no trouble at all accepting that there were good reasonstouching reasonsfor your having gone over the edge montvale said castillo gave him an exasperated look but whats important comes next montvale said two things first whelan said ive written a lot of stories that people tell me have ruined peoples lives and ive done it with a clear conscience and ill do it again but im not going to ruin this young mans life simply because some bitch comes to me with a halfcocked story and an agenda whereupon i asked him in surprise a woman gave you this story i knew damned well she had an agenda beyond getting on the right side of me whelan said i knew it has this lady aname shes in the agency whelan said she and her husband both work for the agency her name is wilson i forget his first name but hers is patricia patricia davies wilson thats to go no further than this room of course not i readily agreed you thinkwhat was her name he obligingly furnished it again wilson mr patricia davies wilson i asked you think mr patricia davies wilson had an agenda she did mr whelan replied i have no idea what it was but it was more than just cozying up to me shes fed me stuff before a lot ofmost of itwas useful i thought of her as my private mole in langley whereupon i sought clarification you say you thought of mr patricia davies wilson as your private mole in the central intelligence agency he took a healthy swallow of winein fact drained at least the last third of a glassand said yes i did ive gotten a half dozen good stories out of her theres a lot of things going on at langley that the public has the right to know stories that dont help our enemies but a story about somebody whos been burned out doing his duty and is teetering on the edge is not a good story i write hard news not human interest damn her so what happens now i dont know what whelans going to do to her but i know what i did montvale said i had my technicians erase all but the last minute or so of that recordinganything that could identify youand then personally took it over to langley and played it for john powell and the dci didnt ask you who whelans story was supposed to be about or how you just happened to record their conversation castillo asked im sure he would have liked to montvale said but he was torn between humiliation that i had personally brought him credible evidence that mr whelan had a mole in the agency and anger with himself that he hadnt done more to the lady after i personally had sent truman ellsworth over there to subtly warn themafter our conversation at the armynavy clubthat they had a problem with mr wilson youre sure this guy is not going to write about me im sure hes not he told meso because he feels sorry for the overstressed lunatic thats part of it certainly and part of it is that whelan thinks of himself as a loyal american patriotism is also a actor isnt patriotism supposed to be the last refuge of a scoundrel castillo asked bitterly youre the one who needed the refuge colonel if the scoundrel shoe fits put it on it fits castillo said i guess im supposed to thank you mr ambassador youre welcome but dont let it go to your head i was protecting the president not you yes sir i understand montvale looked at his watch id really hopedso i would have no surprises when you brief the president brief the president where the hell did that come from and the others what others that you and britton would be able to bring me up to speed about these people in bucks county on everything but we dont seem to have the time were due to be over there in ten minutes and i need to visit the gentlemens rest facility before we go yes sir if i have to say this colonel not a word visavis mr whelan yes sir i wonder what the presidents going to think about the stylish mr britton montvale said then rose from behind his desk and waved for castillo to precede him out of the office xiv one the oval office the white house pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc august the secret service agent standing just outside of the oval officea very large man attired in a dark gray suit carefully tailored to hide the bulk of the mini uzi he carried under his armstepped in front of charles w montvale blocking his way excuse me director montvale he said politely he nodded once indicating jack britton who still was wearing his pink seersucker jacket yellow polo shirt light blue trousers and highly polished tassel loafers i dont know this gentleman show him your secret service credentials agent britton montvale ordered quickly we dont want to keep the president waiting britton exchanged a glance with charley castillo then unfolded a thin leather wallet the secret service agent failed to uphold the traditions of his service surprise even disbelief was written all over his face as he stepped out of the way the president was not in the oval office secretary of state natalie cohen and secretary of homeland security matthew hall were they were seated side by side on one of the pair of matching couches that faced each other across a coffee table hall got to his feet and offered his hand to them each in turn then he asked britton i dont believe you know secretary cohen do you jack no sir britton said the secretary of state stood up and offered her hand to britton secretary hall has been telling me what you did before joining the secret service she said im very pleased to meet you its an honor to meet you madam secretary britton said she walked to castillo kissed his cheek and said hello charley how are we doing with the repatriation of mr lorimers remains theyre in a funeral home in new orleans madam secretary castillo said special agent yung accompanied them from uruguay i spoke with him a couple of hours ago he paused then went on hes got an outofchannels message for you from ambassador mcgrory hes supposed to deliver it personally thats odd charley she said do you know what it is yes maam lets have it ambassador mcgrory believes mr lorimer was a drug dealerin his alter ego as jeanpaul bertrand antiquities dealerand that a drug deal went bad at his estancia and he was murdered and the sixteen million dollars stolen my god where did he get that she exclaimed he apparently figured that out all by himself he confided his theory in ambassador silvio she shook her head in disbelief unfortunately castillo went on theres a clever uruguayan cop chief inspector ordonez of the policia nacional whos pretty close to figuring out what really happened that got everyones attention castillo continued and hes also positively identified one of the ninjas we killed as major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia one of the what charley the president of the united states asked as he came into the room did you say ninjas sir thats what were calling the people who bushwhacked us at estancia shangrila the president looked at him strangely sir they were wearing balaclava masks and black coveralls castillo added some what lamely ninjasthats what they looked like well i want to hear about that of course the president said but first things first he walked to britton and offered him his hand youre special agent britton right yes sir mr president i like your jacket the president said whats your assessment of the possibility of a nuclear device being detonated in philadelphia anytime soon on a scale of one to ten when he briefed me mr president montvale said britton said pointzerozeroone god youre clever montvale castillo thought by answering for britton youve painted yourself as really being on top of everything is that right the president asked britton you think the threat is that negligible yes sir well im relieved ill want to hear why you think so of course but that will wait until i get things organized in my mind he looked at castillo that means i want to hear everything charley starting from the moment you left the white house what was it a week ago six days mr president it seems like a lot longer but it was only six days ago charley the president said i want to hear everything you think has affectedor might affectexecution of the finding ill decide whats important yes sir castillo said and immediately decided to leave out the first thing that had happened after he left the white house that had indeed had a bearing on the findinghis some whatstrained conversation with montvale at the armynavy club sir i went to paris he began as he thought he saw a look of relief on montvales face my god you really got around didnt you the president said fifteen minutes later when castillo had finished you must be exhausted i am kind of beat sir sum it up for me charley where are we we know a lot more mr president than we knew when i left herethat a cuban was involved for example and that theres probably a connection with the kgbbut i dont know what any of it really means the president turned to the secretary of state what do you make of the cuban natalie if there wasnt a positive identification mr president id have trouble believing it i just dont know can we tweak castros nose with that now or later if the cubans sent him to uruguayand we dont know or least have no proof of thatby now they know hes dead the secretary of state said so far as embarrassing the cubans i dont think so sir if we laid this mans body on kofi annans desk in the security council chamber the cubans would deny any knowledge of him and the delegate from venezuela would introduce a resolution condemning us for blaspheming the dignity of the un the presidents face showed what he thought of the secretarygeneral of the united nations and of the organization itself theyve washed their hands of lorimer right he asked yes sir secretary cohen said one of annans underlings issued a brief statement regretting the death of mr lorimer butwe invited themtheyre not even sending someone to his funeral so what are you going to do next charley the president asked well tomorrow morning sir im going to assemble what information we haveall the disconnected facts we have both here and in buenos airesand start to try to make some sense of it need any help the president asked anything you need to do that before castillo could reply ambassador montvale said in that connection mr president im going to call dci powell personally and tell him that he is to provide to mr delchamps everything that colonel castillo asks for thats the cia man from paris yes mr president why are you calling powell personally ive already ordered that the ciathat everybodygive charley whatever he asks for and now delchamps works for charley right mr delchamps is about as popular in langley as is colonel castillo mr president and then theres the matter of our not having informed the ciaor for that matter others including the fbiof your finding i thought my personal call would be useful the president looked thoughtfully at montvale then at castillo and charleys not likely to win any popularity contest in the j edgar hoover building either is he the president said then paused in thought let me make some contribution to this the president walked to his desk punched several buttons on his telephone without lifting the handset then sat and leaned back in his highbacked leather chair yes mr president the white house switchboard operators voice came over the speakerphone get me mark schmidt please the president said less than twenty seconds later the voice of the director of the federal bureau of investigation came over the speakerphone good afternoon mr president the president wasted no time on the social amenities mark what i need is a good senior fbi agent he said theres no shortage of them around here mr president may i ask why someone who knows his way into the dark corners over there mark someone whos really good at putting disassociated facts together someone now that i think about it who probably works pretty closely with you and will be able to get you on the phone if he needs some help inspector jack doherty of my staff meets those criteria mr president it would help sir if i knew exactly what you need i told you mark i need some help in putting a jigsaw puzzle together this is very important to me so if this is inconvenient for you im sorry but i want this man to be in ambassador montvales office by nine tomorrow morning hell be working for him for an indefinite perioduntil the puzzle is assembled and montvale is going to tell him that he is not to share with anyoneanyoneanything about the puzzle i think it would be a good idea if you told him about that before you send him to the ambassador that sounds as if im being kept in the dark about whatever your problem is mr president its a question of need to know mark and right now i understand mr president thanks mark well be talking the president reached forward and punched a button breaking the connection when inspector doherty shows up at your office charles the president said you tell him about the finding and then send him over to castillo mr president i cant do that montvale replied the president was known for not liking to have his orders questioned why not he asked sharply sir only you and colonel castillo are authorized to grant security clearances visavis the finding the president stared at him a moment then said youre right id forgotten that okay so when inspector whatshisname shows up tomorrow you relay to him my personal order that he is not to relate to director schmidt or anyone else in the fbi anything he learns while working for castillo then send him to castillo who can tell him about the finding very well sir if thats the way you wish for me to handle it thats the way the president said well castillo thought suppressing a smirk that ends your hope of being able to clear people for the finding doesnt it mr ambassador wait what the hell are you being so smug about hotshot montvale just saved your ass come to think about it the president said thoughtfully making castillo wonder if he was about to change his mind thats a good way to handle the whole expert question if castillo decides he needs an expert from somewhere elsethe nsa for example or state or homeland securitywell run them past you or the appropriate secretary who will relay my order to them that nothing goes back where they came from and then run them over to castillo he may be able to get what he wants out of them without having to tell them why and thus about the finding and hes the only one who can make that decision thatll work matt hall said it was the first time he had said anything ill handle the intelligence community personally mr president montvale said the president looked at him and nodded but didnt respond directly anyone else got anything the president asked there was a chorus of no sirs get some rest charley the president said finally get to bed early i cant afford to have you burn out and i think youre going to have a busy day tomorrow yes sir the president thought he saw something on castillos face and asked smiling naughtily what makes me think you have other plans for the evening don juan sir whats her name actually sir i thought i would go by my office pick up major miller and go to the armynavy club to at the last moment castillo had enough presence of mind to change the next words from drink our supper to have our supper yeah the president said unconvinced good hunting colonel the president got up and walked out of the oval office through the doorway leading to his private working office he was gone before any of the others could rise to their feet sure she has a name elizabeth schneider and i still havent called her or worse even thought of calling her what the hell is the matter with me two lieutenant colonel c g castillo and major h richard miller jr did not go to the armynavy club as castillo had announced to the president of the united states that they would do insteadwith colonel jacob torine usaf and special agent jack britton in towthey went right around the corner from the white house to th street nw there at the old ebbitt grill est they sat at the massive dark mahogany bar and dined on hot roast beef sandwiches au jus with steak fries miller and torine and linguini with white clam sauce castillo and red clam sauce britton washing it all down with heineken beer from the tap by ten oclock all four were in bedsalone and asleepin herr karl gossingers suite in the motel monica lewinsky the management having obligingly made up one of the couches in the sitting room into a bed for special agentbritton although the thought that he should telephone miss elizabeth schneider had occurred to charley castillo he had not made an attempt to do so having reasoned that it was too lateparticularly for him he was about to crash and crash hard and thus in absolutely no condition to participate in a long apologetic and explanatory conversation ill call tomorrow he had thought then buried his head in his pillow if i dont get distracted and forget again he had then groped in the dark for his cellular on the bedside table found it dialed its own number and after the mechanized female voice answered that he was being transferred into voice mail he left the message call betty you heartless bastard then he pushed the end button returned the phone to the table and finally crashed three office of organizational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august welcome home chief mr agnes forbison deputy chief for administration of the office of organizational analysis greeted castillo as he led torine miller and britton off of the elevator or would you prefer that i now call you colonel id prefer that you call me charley agnes she walked to him and kissed his cheek weve been over that she said evenly you are now too important to be addressed by your nickname so which do you prefer i give up castillo said you choose chief has a nicer ring to it she said this town is too full of colonels no offense colonel torine none taken torine said she looked at britton i like your jacket jack thank you britton said its all ive got to wear i hadnt planned to come to washington whats first agnes castillo asked well theres already someone in my office waiting to see you she said as she led the way to the door of castillos officemarked private no admittanceslid what looked like an allwhite credit card through the reader mounted by the lock then pushed the door open and handed the card to castillo they all followed her through the open door first is getting me back to pennsylvania britton said first is credit cards agnes corrected him you wouldnt want to leave home without your american express card would you jack ive got an american express card britton said not one of these you dont agnes said they came in yesterday she went to castillos desk opened a drawer and collected what looked like half a dozen platinum american express cards she handed one card to britton and others to castillo and torine and put the rest back in the drawer millers already got one and so do i she said britton examined his what the hell is gossinger consultants inc he asked well i needed a name of a nongovernmental organization to spend lorimers money she said and that seemed reasonably appropriate the cards are coded so no questions will be asked in case somebody wants to buy a lot of airplane gas thats aviation fuel agnes castillo said smiling youre amazing i told you i was going to be useful she said and the riggs bank is going to get us checks on the gossinger consultants account as soon as they can which may mean today but probably means in three or four days you all have to sign signature cards and i have to get them back to the bank before you can write checks she turned to torine gossinger consultants is now the official owner of the gulfstream she said and signature flight support at bwi is going to direct bill the corporation for hangar space maintenance aviation fuel and so forth yesterday i had to give them charleys credit card torine said it probably hasnt worked its way through the bureaucracy she said ill give them a call and switch over the charge we have a corporation castillo asked a delaware corporation and a post office box agnes replied she looked at britton again where in pennsylvania bethlehem how far is that do you know id guess a hundred and fifty miles maybe a little more you want to take the amtrak to philadelphia and have the secret service pick you up there or have a yukon take you from here i think that would probably be a little quicker and theres already three yukons from the philadelphia office in bethlehem britton said is getting one here going to be any trouble none at all just as soon as you sign the signature thing ill call thank you britton said charley torine said would you have any problem after i make sure the paperwork on the gulfstream is all done and things are set up with signature if i went home for a couple of days no i dont think ill be going anywhere for seventytwo hours anyway but i never know yeah i know you never know torine said if you need me ill have someone fly me back here go ahead castillo said the both of you and thank you the both of you what now agnes castillo asked after torine and britton had left why dont you sit down chief and well have a cup of coffee while i tell you what else is going on you want some coffee dick castillo asked im coffeed out why dont you get on the horn and see if anythings new in buenos aires its half past seven down there miller replied is anybody going to be awake why dont you sit down kill a half hour with a cup of coffee then get on the horn miller shrugged why not agnes pushed a button on one of the telephones on castillos desk and ordered coffee then she said theres a man named delchamps out there chief he would like to see you at your earliest convenience but he wouldnt tell me why great castillo said ask him to come in and order another cup of coffee for him agnes did so edgar delchamps and the coffee came through the door at about the same time the latter was borne by a very tall very attractive african american woman in her early thirties castillo said good morning edgar im really glad to see you delchamps nodded but said nothing juliet agnes said to the attractive woman this is the boss colonel castillo colonel miss knowles handles our classified files she has a masters in political science from georgetown shes got several top secret clearances but youre going to have to think about clearing her for let me get to that later castillo said its nice to meet you miss knowles please call me juliet she said and ill need to talk with you later but right now i have to speak with mr delchamps i understand sir its nice to meet you too as soon as the door closed behind her castillo asked if shes in charge of classified files and has a masters degree from georgetown why is she running coffee well chief its not in her job description agnes said and she has her own office and her own administrative assistant but for some reason every time gimpy here asks for coffee juliet seems to have time to bring it if it was anybody but gimpy castillo said id say she was attracted to him but what it probably is is morbid curiosity miller gave him the finger edgar say hello to mr agnes forbison whos really the boss around here and gimpy otherwise known as major dick miller delchamps nodded at both but said nothing to them id really like to see you alone colonel delchamps said hes pissed about something castillo thought theres a list of people here edgaragnes and dick are on itand you just went on itwho know everything that everybody else knows whats on your mind i was at langley yesterday colonel one of the chairwarmers there had told me ambassador montvale had something for me to do and i was to report to him so i went to see him he was too busy to deal with someone unimportant like me of course but his flunky truman ellsworth who ive met before told me to report to you for an extended period of temporary duty and that you would explain everything to me and explain i will welcome aboard ed before you waste your breath on that let me finish castillo raised an eyebrow okay finish i wanted you to be the first to know colonel that later today im going over to langley and sign my application for retirement which is being typed up as we speak they told me it takes about three weeks to complete the process and be officially retired but i have a bucketful of accrued leave so im going to be on leave until my retirement comes through castillo took a moment to reply if i didnt know better id think that maybe youre a little annoyed about something delchamps made a thin smile i told you in paris ace that i would let you know if i was interested in employmenti think you said reasonably honest employmentin washington that was not a yes i dont want to work here and i wont i need you ed castillo said simply im sorry if montvale summarily ordered you to get on a plane it wasnt even montvale delchamps interrupted disgustedly it wasnt even his flunky ellsworth it was some goddamned chairwarmer at langley but yesterdayi was in argentinai realized how much i needed you and asked montvale to bring you home delchamps shook his head i realize that once youve been infected with washington ace the temptation to build an empire is nearly irresistible but you know goddamned well ive given youand would have continued to give youeverything i know or find out about these oilforfood maggots im not trying to build an empire look at this goddamned office its a bureaucrats throne room blame the office on agnes she said it was important i dont know my way around washington and she does agnes said unruffled yes i do and i make no apologies for trying to teach charley the rules of the game delchamps looked at her looked as if he was going to respond then changed his mind and looked back at castillo ace what made you decide yesterday in argentina that you needed me so badly that you were going to get me whether or not i liked it agnes answered for him it probably started in budapest where these peoplei like your term oilforfood maggotstried to assassinate him castillo looked at her how the hell did she hear about that i know theres a list here and shes on it they tried to whack you delchamps said they were trying to kidnap andor whack my budapest source when their first attempt failed they tried again but i was in his apartment and had to put down two of them miller added delchamps looked at castillo for confirmation castillo nodded slowly youre a regular james bond arent you ace delchamps said indeed he is miller said ace even had the foresight to get a suppressed from the agency guy in budapest castillo flashed miller a dirty look im surprised he gave you any kind of a weapon delchamps said hes a real agency asshole i noticed castillo said it took montvale personally to get him to open his weapons locker how much does the asshole in budapest know about this does he know about the two you took down castillo shook his head i didnt tell him anything that was also smart of you ace delchamps said he paused in thought then added you must be getting close and they tried to whack an fbi agent who was with me at lorimers estanciathat was in uruguayand they were following around threateningly the former head of side in argentina who was also at the estancia and his family what happened to your budapest source delchamps asked i moved him to argentina where two old pals of yours are sitting on him what two old pals make that three castillo said and raised his eyebrows as he added alex darby and mr and mr sieno delchamps considered that a moment then nodded and asked youre sitting on the side guy i moved his family here hes still in argentina at a safe house with everybody else trying to put all the pieces together thats what i need you here for to help with that how could i help with that what if i told you montvale told the president he was personally going to call dci powell to tell him you were coming over there and were to be given everything you asked for delchamps considered that a moment then said when i asked for the retirement forms yesterday they seemed pretty happy about that i guess the word is out i dont think so ed not so soon castillo said montvale told the president that late yesterday afternoon well i guess they were just happy to get rid of me period delchamps said truth to tell i was a little pissed about their eager cooperation he paused and asked can montvale be trusted to do what he told the president he was going to do yeah castillo said i trust him to do what he tells the presidentin front of witnesseshes going to do castillo went to his desk and picked up a telephone handset we up he said into it and after there was a reply he looked at delchamps and said listen to this ed he then pushed the speakerphone button and said open it up a young mans voice having made a fiftyfourthousandmile trip through space came over the speaker corporal bradley speaking sir good morning lester castillo said how long will it take you to get mr sieno for me shes right here colonel she just brought me my breakfast hold one sir good morning colonel susanna sieno said you made it there i guess good morning susanna castillo said im in my office and so is an old friend of yours hed like to say hello he extended the handset to delchamps delchamps shaking his head took it hey sweetie how are you oh ed its good to hear your voice castillo pushed the button that turned off the speakerphone function pretty impressive delchamps said ninety seconds later after the connection was taken down what about the garbling we twentyfirstcentury spooks call that encryption castillo said this system uses a logarithmours alonewe think even nsa cant crack okay delchamps said ill hang around long enough to see if i can do you any good if i cant im off to my vinecovered cottage by the side of the road deal agnes get mr delchamps an american express card castillo said and see that gossinger consultants inc provides him with accommodations suitable for someone we really need why do i suspect that gossinger consultants inc has some sort of connection with the lorimer benevolent and charitable trust you told me about when there was no immediate reply delchamps smiled then asked what happens now castillo said the president at the same meeting called the director of the fbi and ordered him to send over a senior guy first thing this morning skilled in putting jigsaw puzzles like this one together i think youd better stick around and meet him then get yourself settled in inspector doherty is already here agnes said shall i bring him in what was that name again miller asked doherty agnes replied inspector john j doherty oh this should be interesting miller said meaning what castillo asked you dont remember him ace miller asked castillo shook his head miller went on hes the guy they sent to you about the turned fbi agentwhatshisnamehoward kennedy your russian mafiosos pal when he told yousome what peremptorily ill admitthat the fbi expected you to notify them immediately the moment you heard anything about either pevsner or kennedy or they contacted you in any way you told him not to hold his breath christ thats him i forgotten his name if i ever knew it well theres a lot of irishmen in the fbi miller said maybe theres two or more inspectors named john j doherty but i really dont think so show inspector doherty in please mr forbison castillo said and dick you can stop calling me ace you want me to get out of the way delchamps asked no stick around please castillo said inspector doherty unsmiling came through the door sixty seconds later he was a nondescript man in his late forties wearing a singlebreasted dark gray suit he wore frameless glasses and his graying hair was cropped short castillo thought i didnt like this guy the first time i saw him and i dont like him now good morning inspector doherty castillo said thank you for being so prompt and im sorry to have kept you waiting doherty nodded but didnt speak this is mr forbison castillo said and major miller and mr delchamps these are the people youll be primarily working with ambassador montvale wasnt very clear about what im supposed to do doherty said thats because you dont have the proper clearance castillo said im about to grant you that clearance the classification is top secret presidential it deals with a presidential finding that charges me with locating and rendering harmless the people who murdered mr j winslow masterson of the state department and sergeant roger markham of the marine corps and who kidnapped mr masterson and wounded a secret service agent what does rendering harmless mean doherty asked since there is little chance you will be involved in that i dont think that you need to know how i interpret that castillo said what you do need to know is that from this moment you will communicate to no one not cleared for this informationand that of course includes anyone in the fbi who is not specifically cleared for itanything you hear learn conclude or intuit about this operation i dont like this at all i guess you understand doherty said you have two options mr doherty castillo said you can go back to the j edgar hoover building and tell them youre unwilling to take this assignment you may not tell anyone there why you dont want to do it what i have just told you identify me or anyone else you have met here or of course repeat that there is a presidential finding theres been talk of a finding as you probably know theres a lot of talk in washington castillo said evenly whats my second option you can bring to this operation all the skills director schmidt told the president you have i was there when he made that call i want you to understand clearly however that once you become aware of the details we think you need to help sort everything out you cant change your mind if that happens im going to give you an office where you can sit all day read the washington post and drink coffee then send people home with you at night to make sure you dont see anybody you should not or make any unmonitored telephone calls etcetera that will last until were finished however long it takes doherty looked at him coldly you realize colonel that i was an fbi agent when you were a cadet at west point and i dont like being threatened like that mr delchamps here was a clandestine agent of the cia when you were a bushytailed cadet at the fbi academy hes operating under the same rules whats important mr doherty is not how old i am but to whom the president has given the authority to execute the finding thats me and if you cant live with that feel free to walk out right now they locked eyes for a moment whats it going to be inspector castillo asked in or out after a long moment doherty said in with a caveat which is i will do nothing that violates the law well i guess that means youre out castillo said ill do whatever i have to do to carry out my orders and i cant promise that no laws will be broken doherty exhaled audibly you want to know what im thinking colonel only if you want to tell me castillo said that if i turn you down theyll send you somebody else and if he turns you down somebody else until the bureau finally sends you someone wholl play by your rules that sounds like a reasonable scenario castillo agreed when i joined the bureau i did so thinking that sooner or later i would have to put my life on the line i was bushytailed then to use your expression and had in mind bank robbers with tommy guns or russian spies with poison and knives it never entered my mind that i would be putting my lifemy careeron the line for the bureau doing something like this he sighed but if the president thinks this is so important who am i to argue with that and being important to me whos better qualified to keep the bureau from being mudsplattered with this operation than i am he met castillos eyes for a long moment okay im in no caveats your rules and no mental reservations castillo asked softly i said im in colonel that means im in welcome aboard castillo said there were no smiles between them okay agnes where are we going to set up castillo asked i figured the conference room she said its about as big as a basketball court and theres already phones etcetera and of course a coffeemaker why dont you take mr delchamps and inspector doherty in there and let them see it i need a word with major miller and then well both have a look well castillo asked the moment the door had closed after mr forbison and the others i dont think inspector doherty likes you very much miller said i dont give a damn whether he does or not the question is is he going to get on the phone the first time he has a chance hey guys you wont believe what this loose cannon castillo is up to i think i would trust him as far as you trust yung going off at a tangent yung has now seen the light and is really on board did he see the light before or after these bastards tried to kill him britton asked almost exactly the same question castillo said chuckling you know great minds tread similar paths miller replied well i heard about it after they tried to kidnap him castillo said but i have the feeling hed made up his mind before your charismatic leadership i think its more likely that he thought about what i said about spending the rest of his fbi career investigating parking meter fraud in south dakota and realized that would happen anyway if he ever did get to go back the fbi with going back then not an attractive option working for us didnt seem so bad i dont know im not looking the gift horse in the mouth yung is smart and we need him before you sent him down south you said you trusted him because he was moral miller said castillo nodded and i think doherty is moral the difference between them is that dohertys a heavy hitter in the bureau but he knows a hes here because the president set it up and b that if anything leaks to the fbi and we hear about it well know hes the leaker because hes the only fbi guy whos being clued in except yung of course castillo said what did you think of edgar delchamps i think he likes you miller said i think the reason he was really pissedand really pissed he waswas because he thought his friend castillo had stabbed him in the back you think he still thinks that i think hes giving you a second chance miller said castillo nodded i really like him and a dinosaur like him is just what we need i wonder how he and the inspector are going to get along jesus i didnt even think about that castillo said and theres one more guy coming a heavy hitter from nsa he wont work for us but he will get us whatever we want from nsa whens he coming he should be here now castillo said lets go look at what agnes has set up the conference room wasnt nearly as large as a basketball court as agnes had described it but it was enormous there was an oval table with more than a dozen spaces around it each furnished with a desk pad a telephone a small monitor and a leatherupholstered armchair and there was room for more one narrow end of the room had a rolldown projection screen and flatscreen television monitors were mounted in a grid on the walls two wheelmounted blackboardsthe writing surfaces were actually blue and they came with yellow felttip markers instead of chalkwere against one wall and there was room for a half dozen more this place looks as if were going to try to land someone on the moon miller quipped castillo and agnes chuckled delchamps and doherty didnt even smile colonel doherty asked are you open for suggestions on how to do this your call inspector okay first the basics if this room hasnt been swept sweep it and sweep it daily nsa is supposed to send a man here to get us what we need from nsa castillo replied i presume that means technicians that sound okay doherty nodded then went on and seal this room never leave it empty and make sure nobody gets in here who shouldnt be if it gets so we cant walk through the clutter on the floor well shut down for an hour or so turn the blackboards around and have it cleaned not a problem inspector agnes forbison said and speaking of blackboards doherty said twos not half enough get another fourbetter sixin here when do you want them agnes said now the first will be here in five minutes agnes said itll probably take a couple of hours to get another five the sooner the better doherty said whats with all the blackboards castillo asked inspector doherty shares with me delchamps said the philosophy that if youre going to use a computer use the best one what about computers agnes castillo asked i can set up pretty quickly whatever you and the inspector tell me you need we are referring colonel delchamps said to the computers between our ears then youve lost everybody except you and the inspector castillo said computers colonel are only as good as the data they contain doherty said you know what gigo means castillo nodded garbage in garbage out right so anything we put into our computers the kind you plug in the walland ill get with you shortly mr forbison about what were going to need nothing fancyhas to be a fact not a supposition not a possibility the possibilities and the suppositions and the theories go on the blackboards with me so far i think i understand castillo said well probably save time if you watch to see how its done doherty said lets try that then castillo said okay off the top of your head colonel tell me the one name you think is at the center of your problem castillo thought a moment then said jeanpaul lorimer aka jeanpaul bertrand just one just one doherty said how do you spell that doherty went to one of the blackboards and wrote jeanpaul lorimer in the center of it this is the players board he said this guy had an alias bertrand castillo said and spelled it for him on the board doherty wrote aka bertrand he said we know that for sure the names yeah okay when we get a typist and a computer in here we can start a file called lorimer and put those facts in it in a folder called lorimer when do we get the typist and the computer agnes you want to clear juliet knowles for this charley okay but her and a typist you got somebody agnes nodded go get them agnes tell them whats involved and start on the other blackboards doherty ordered he turned to castillo so what about this lorimer what do we know for sure for sure that hes dead castillo said we also believe that he was the head bagman for the maggots involved in the iraq oilforfood scandal facts first hes dead when did he die where what of he died at approximately hours july at estancia shangrila tacuarembo province uruguay of two mm gunshot wounds from a madsen to the head okay those are all facts right facts castillo confirmed okay doherty replied matteroffactly showing no reaction at all to the manner of lorimers death that gives us the first facts in two new folders one folder is the time line the other events spell all that for me colonel please ninety seconds later after writing everything on the blackboard doherty said okay who shot him and why we have only theories about why he was shot castillo said then get to them later who shot him there were six guys in their assault party whose assault party we dont know we have identified one of them positively as major alejandro vincenzo of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia now thats interesting doherty said whos your source for those facts how reliable is he im the source castillo said i was there why we were going to repatriate lorimer to where here he was an american who worked for the un in paris how were you going to do that and why we were going to snatch him chopper him to buenos aires load him on a lear and fly him here to find out what we could from him about who might have murdered j winslow masterson who was his brotherinlaw whos we who was there with you castillo hesitated for a moment then shrugged and started to tell him he stopped when a moment later juliet knowles and a palefaced young woman who looked british came into the room pushing a blackboard mounted on a wheeled frame mr forbison carrying a laptop computer was on their heels colonel gregory j kilgore of nsa is here chief agnes said as she put the computer on the conference table what do you want me to tell him i better see him castillo said this is going to take a little while to get organized anyhow colonel kilgore was a tall slender signal corps officer in a crisp uniform colonel castillo he asked im a brandnew lieutenant colonel and i dont wear my uniform around here sir castillo said ambassador montvale made it pretty clear however that youre the man in charge what would you like me to call you how do you feel about first names mine is charley id be more comfortable with mr kilgore said thats fine with me what can nsa do for you mr castillo this is a covert and clandestine operation authorized by a presidential finding and the classification is top secret presidential understood im going to need some intercepts castillo said the priority is a wire transfer into the merchants national bank of easton pennsylvania from a numbered account in the caledonian bank and trust limited in the cayman islands the amount was what i need is who that cayman account belongs to what monies have been transferred into it when and by whom if nsa provided you with that information it would be in violation of several sections of the united states code as im sure youre aware and even if we gave it to you it could not be used as evidence in a court of law didnt ambassador montvale tell you colonel that you arensa isto give me whatever i asked for kilgore did not respond directly just a question to satisfy my curiosity mr castillo he said if a messenger left an envelope here with only your name on it would you get it no matter the hour twentyfourseven i would and no one else no one not cleared for this operation castillo said while of course we are both agreed that you would not ask nsa to provide intercepts of this nature if doing so would violate any part of the united states code and that even if you did nsa would not provide data of this nature to you under any circumstances i understand colonel speaking hypothetically of course if nsa happened to make an intercept of wire transfers into or out of say a foreign bank in mexico thats all it would have the amount the routing numbers and the numbers of the accounts involved in both banks there would be no way to identify the owners of the accounts by name you get me the numbers colonel kilgore and my man yung will get me the names understood castillo said speaking hypothetically of course how does this work i really dont know kilgore said but ive heard that what happens is that just about everything is recorded in real time and then run through a filter which identifies what someone is interested in the more information thats available for the filterbank routing numbers the time period in which the data sought was probably being transmitted castillo took his laptop computer from under his desk turned it on and called up the data hed gotten from secret service agent harry larsen in pennsylvania he then turned the computer around so kilgore could see it kilgore studied it nodded and said certainly ill excuse you while you meet the call of nature mr castillo i know how it is when youve gotta go youve gotta go and while youre gone i dont suppose theres a telephone preferably a secure one i could use id like to check in with my secretary let her know ill be a little late getting to the office castillo stood up the red ones connected to the white house switchboard he said and went into the private restroom off his office kilgore was sitting behind castillos desk when three minutes lateras timed by castillos watchcastillo came out of the restroom thats an interesting handset kilgore greeted him the small black one it looks like something afc would make and so it is castillo said you know much about afc kilgore asked i even know mr casey interesting man isnt he among my other duties im the liaison officer between nsa and his research facilities in las vegas ive even been there well that would explain i suppose why some people in fort meade are reporting a stream of gibberish coming out of here absolutely unbreakable who in a position to use your services would be interested in anything coming out of here i wouldnt know of course but the agency is one possibility kilgore said i suppose it would be castillo said i once asked mr casey about a rumor floating around that hed given delta forceand only delta forcean encryption logarithm that was really something he used to be a green beret did you know that as a matter of fact i do castillo said what did he say he said that when he was a green beret he was almost blown away several times because somebody with a big mouth had listened to things they didnt need to know and that he was trying to see that that no longer could happen he said special forces was like the marines once a green beanie always a green beanie i suppose thats true castillo said you wouldnt happen to have a green beret in a closet somewhere would you mr castillo a souvenir of happier times colonel castillo said kilgore stood up well its been a pleasure meeting you mr castillo i dont think well be seeing each other again but on the other hand you never know we may bump into each other at an association of usma graduates meeting and get to sing army blue together thank you sir castillo said i left a number on your computer you can call if you need anything else kilgore said he shook castillos hand quickly but firmly and walked out of the office castillo started to return to the conference room but mr forbison put her head in the door one more she said this one says from the secret service that has to be tom mcguire or maybe joel isaacson castillo made a bring em on wave of his hand and went behind his desk sat down and started to shut down his laptop hello charley special agent elizabeth schneider said from the office door castillo was to remember later that his first reaction was oh shit not now he got some what awkwardly to his feet and was aware of his awkwardness i thought youd still be in the hospital he said ive been out for almost a week she said im on what they call limited duty he looked at her carefully and noticed that although she appeared not to be a hundred percenthe thought he heard a catch to her speech as if it was some what painful to speakshe was by all appearances well on the mend now nearly three weeks after the ambush in buenos aires he then recalled from his experience in the first desert war and in afghanistan that it was not uncommon for certain people to rebound some what quickly from trauma particularly ones who had a young strong body on their side and betty indeed had a young strong body castillo crossed the room to her thinking she expected to be kissed he put his hands on her arms and moved his face close she didnt seem at all eager for his kiss much less the passionate embrace he thought was likely thats whats known as a chaste kiss as between aunt and dutiful nephew oh i know shes pissed and has every right to be baby i tried to call you i wanted to call before i went to paris i couldnt there just wasnt time i dont want to get into a long explanation of what happened that night my promotion ceremony and the conversation with montvale at the armynavy club not a problem charley betty said she smiled some what awkwardly congratulations on your promotion thank you undeserved but deeply appreciated nonetheless if it was undeserved they wouldnt have given it to you betty said well im glad to see you he said and oh boy did you arrive at the right time excuse me you can type right weve got a charley im not going to work for you whered you get that idea whats wrong with that idea a lot starting with joels got me a probationary spot in the protection section im not sure what that means it means if i work out and once i get a clear physical i can be permanently assigned to the protection section thats what i want to do and you dont want to work for me be reasonable that wouldnt work out and you know it what if i promise to keep my hands off you during business hours and to call you agent schneider agent schneider visibly did not find that amusing she sighed charley that wouldnt work i had a lot of time to think andwell what happened happened but theres no future in it for either of us we can just be friends right he asked sarcastically frankly i dont even think that charley i dont trust myself or maybe its you i dont know im sorry have i just been told that ive been dumped just because i couldnt get on the horn to tell you i was going to paris one of the things i thought of is how often is that going to happen with you sorry betty the movies off i have to catch a plane to timbuktu and i dont know when ill be back this is what i do for a living you know that i didnt realize what it meant now i know i couldnt live with a situation like that can we talk about this castillo asked sure after i get settled but theres nothing to really talk about lets give it a shot you never know how do i get in touch with you when i leave here im going over to crystal citynear the pentagonwhere another agent is looking for a roommate whats his name betty made a thin smile a female agent if that works out ill call mr forbison and give her the phone number castillo nodded softly okay betty you do that congratulations again on your promotion colonel betty said and offered her hand to shake he took it she shook it briefly turned and walked to the door there she turned again and said take care of yourself charley and then she was gone oh shit castillo said slowly he stared at the empty doorway shook his head then walked to the conference room xv one conference room office of the chief of operational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august castillo saw that there were now names and events and dates written all over the three blackboards most of them marked with symbols arrows and question marks and connected by a maze of arrows juliet knowles and the palefaced girl whose name he didnt know were sitting with their fingers poised on the keyboards of the laptops inspector john j doherty turned from the blackboard on which he was writing to see who had entered the conference room im beginning to understand colonel doherty said what i originally thought was your overzealous desire for secrecy castillo ignored the remark and looked at dick miller i think well know something from nsa about where that two million dollars came from by tomorrow morning maybe even sooner but were going to need yung to make sense out of what theyre going to be able to get for us how about making sure he comes up here just as soon as he can after the funeral miller nodded and picked up one of the telephones thats special agent yung of the fbi youre talking about doherty asked castillo nodded hes an expert in money moving he said i know doherty said castillo didnt like dohertys tone of voice i understand he also knows where the fbi hides their skeletons that too doherty said what two million dollars are we talking about the two million dollars somebody gave the aariteg mosque in philadelphia so they could buy a farm in bucks county in which they are going to hide in old iron mines when someone sets off a suitcase nuke in the city of brotherly love castillo rattled off doherty considered that for a long moment and then exclaimed jesus christ is that credible britton doesnt think so and britton the secret service agent doherty interrupted turning to point at brittons name on one of the blackboards castillo nodded then said when he was a philadelphia cop he was undercover in the mosque for more than three years he doesnt put much credence in the nuke and neither do othersincluding edgar herewho know about things like that but somebody gave these lunatics two million dollars and id like to know who and why maybe its two separate things terrorism and the oilforfood scandal and maybe theyre connected i have a gut feeling they are doherty picked up his yellow felttip pen and said spell that mosque for me and when castillo had and hed written it on the blackboard asked can you tie these people to terrorism they were involved with the theft of the that terrorists were going to crash into the liberty bell you really think they were going to do that doherty asked his tone making it clear he didnt think that was credible yeah i really think they were going to crash it into the liberty bell castillo said when jake torine and i stole it back from them it was about to take off for philadelphia the fuselage was loaded with fuel cells hidden under a layer of fresh flowers doherty accepted that but he didnt apologize not even to the extent of saying i didnt know that so youre saying these people are skilled terrorists doherty asked after a moment no im not i go with britton and chief inspector kramer of the philadelphia police who refer to them as the aal which means african american lunatics and which means just that they have been used by terrorists and they still may beprobably arebeing used i want to know where they got the money and if there is a reason beyond giving them a place to protect themselves from a nuclear explosion which we dont think is going to happen doherty considered that a long moment and then went off on a tangent we can get back to that in a minute you used a helicopter on the estancia raid right castillo nodded where did you get it delchamps says he doesnt know and miller said he doesnt want to tell me until he talks to you castillo looked at the two women who were watching them in fascination this they shouldnt hear lets go in there for a moment castillo said pointing toward the door of the larger of two small offices opening off the conference room once the door had closed behind him miller delchamps and doherty castillo said evenly i borrowed a bell ranger from aleksandr pevsner the same aleksandr pevsner weve talked about before uhhuh jesus christ that opens a whole new can of worms doherty said did he know what you were going to use it for castillo had a quick mental image of doherty writing pevsner on one of the blackboards followed by a very large question mark and then an even larger exclamation point yes he knew castillo said has it occurred to you that your pal is the one who tipped the unknown parties to what you were up to or that he sent them himself doherty asked and then didnt wait for an answer but instead turned to delchamps and said ed this russian mafioso is up to his ears in everything else criminal on both hemispheres so is it likely hes involved in either this oilforfood scam or terrorism castillo picked up on dohertys use of delchampss first name so he likes him at least that much good terrorism no delchamps said thats not saying his airplanes havent flown terrorists or suppliesincluding moneyaround for the muslim fanatics but i say that primarily because his airplanes go to lots of interesting places he has almost certainly been used by terroristswho have paid him extremely well for his servicesbut hes not one of them and jack from what i knowknowthe same thing is true of his association with the oilforfood maggots pevsners airplanes flew a lot of food and medicinelike ferraris and blond belgian hookers for saddams sonsand nice little hundredthousanddollar bricks of hundreddollar bills into and out of iraq but a lot of the same thingmaybe not the ferraris but just about everything elsewent into and out of iraq on air france and lufthansa and a lot of other airlines my information is that pevsners airplanes were used when saddam and company really wanted to be sure the commercial carrier didnt get curious about what was really in the crates marked hospital supplies there wasnt time for pevsner to tip anybody off about the raid castillo said and anyway he didnt know where we were going he only knew who we were after unless he already knew where lorimer was charley delchamps argued he could have told someone youd better take care of that problem before the american gets to him i dont think he knew where lorimer was edgar castillo said why doherty challenged i think if he knew lorimer would have been dead when we got there alek doesnt like people who know things about him walking around and what do you think lorimer knew about pevsner doherty asked change that to alek doesnt like people who might know anything the disclosure of which might even remotely inconvenience him walking around that include you ace delchamps asked you know where he is and youre still walking around where is he castillo doherty asked the last time i saw him he was in argentina castillo said jesus christ doherty said and what about howard kennedy where was he the last time you saw him he was at jorge newbery airport when we came back from uruguay doing what i think pevsner sent him to give him an early headsup in case something had gone wrong so kennedy knows where you were and what went down delchamps asked yeah im sure he does you told him doherty asked incredulously youre operating on a presidential finding and you told that turncoat sonofabitch all about it i didnt tell him anything that he found out from either pevsneror more likely from munz who had been hit and was on happy pillsis something i couldnt control that doesnt worry you doherty asked no kennedy works for pevsner he knows what happens to people who talk what does worry me is chief inspector jose ordonez of the uruguayan police who has figured outbut cant provethat i used pevsners ranger and that special operators put down the ninjas whats he going to do with that information delchamps asked hes a good friend of munz knows that im a good friend of munz and would probably prefer that the whole episode would go away if anything if i had to bet id bet hed go along with the drug dealer theory advanced by ambassador mcgrory the drug dealer theory doherty asked incredulously ambassador mcgrory has developed the theory that lorimer was in his alter ego as jeanpaul bertrand antiquities dealer actually a bigtime drug dealer and got whackedand had his money stolenwhen a deal fell through i dont understand that doherty said presumably the ambassador in uruguay knew about this operation whats this drug deal nonsense disinformation he didnt knowdoesnt knowanything about it castillo said doherty shook his head in disbelief you said something about money doherty said what money lorimer had about sixteen million dollars in three uruguayan banks thats a fact whether he skimmed it from the oilforfood payoffs he was makingwhich is what i thinkor whether it was money he was going to use for more payoffs i dont know wheres the money now we have it castillo said you stole it i like to think of it as having converted it to a good cause castillo said delchamps and miller chuckled does yung know about this yungs the one who told us how to convert it miller said i dont think i want to hear any more about this doherty said good because i can see no purpose in telling you any more than that and i wish miller hadnt been so helpful just now you realize dont you castillo that yungs fbi career is really down the toilet i thought it was alreadyguilt by association with howard kennedypretty much down the toilet so far as im concerned and most of the senior people in the bureau are concerned yung couldnt be faulted for trusting kennedya fellow fbi agenttoo much to believe he was even capable of doing what he did but after this jesus christ what do i have to do castillo said coldly remind you that youre not going to tell most of the senior people in the bureaufor that matter anybody in the fbiabout any of this he already knows too much miller said forcing a serious tone were going to have to kill him doherty looked at miller in shocked disbelief even after he realized his chain was being pulled and even after he saw the smiles on castillos and delchampss faces its an old company joke jack delchamps said the special operators stole it and you think its funny doherty said i guess that depends on the company castillo said not very pleasantly okay i have reminded you before witnesses that you have been made privy to information you are not to disclose to anyone in the fbi are we clear on that inspector doherty were clear on that colonel doherty replied stiffly now so far as your blackboards are concerned castillo went on you will write putin on them whenever you wish to make reference to pevsner and schmidt whenever you wish to make reference to howard kennedy i dont think those young women will make the connection and maybe itll even sail over agness head clear the director of the fbi is named schmidt as you goddamned well know doherty said and you use it to describe someone like howard kennedy what is it with you colonel you have some deep psychological need to really piss people off this is the truth castillo said we are already using those code names in argentina at the timebefore i had any suspicion that we would be dealing with a very senior fbi officerthey seemed appropriate now i readily admit schmidt doesnt but its too late to change it let me say something jack delchamps said nothing disrespectful in this but ive always felt that the fbi could use a little humor castillo wasnt being disrespectful irreverent sure but whats so wrong with that doherty looked at delchamps for a long moment and then without replying turned to castillo are we through in here colonel or can i get back to my blackboards two conference room office of the chief of operational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august inspector john j doherty visibly exhausted suddenly turned from the blackboard on which he was working and announced sorry but my brain just went on automatic shutdown well have to pick this up again in the morning half past seven something like that castillo nodded hes right youre only fooling yourself thinking you can push yourself when youre wiped out and im wiped out were all wiped out fine with me castillo had quickly agreed juliet knowles and the english girlhe finally had learned her name was heather maywoodhad been wiped out when they quit at half past four thirty minutes after normal quitting time since then castillo and miller had been manning the laptops surprising castillo doherty had not wanted to talk to anyone at the safe house in the mayerling country club when he saw the look on castillos face he offered a terse explanation well start with what i get from you here then well get what they have and start looking for both confirmation and anomalies with no enthusiasm at all castillo had decided that he had no choice but to let doherty do whatever the hell doherty was doing the way doherty wanted to do it castillo had given delchamps the printouts of the material eric kocian had given him in budapest as soon as they had been ready he had read them with one eye keeping the other on the blackboards until immediately after lunchpaper cartons of allegedly chinese food the remnants of which filled a wastebasketfor langley to see as he put it first if montvale really got me in over there and second if he did to see what i can find in the fileandforget cabinets that matches this stuff at four oclock yung had called saying he was about to get on an airplane in new orleans and did castillo want him to come to the office or what castillo had told him there was nothing for him do right now he didnt have the data yetby which he meant the intercepts from nsa which at that point he didnt expect until the next daybut to come to the nebraska complex at eight the next morning delchamps had called a little after six and reported that the door was really open to my surprise but that hed had enough and was quitting for the day he had refused castillos offer of supper saying he was going to his room in the marriott and get on the horn to some other dinosaurs to see what they remembered and would see them in the morning doherty had left immediately castillo and miller had stayed until nsa technicians had swept the room and department of homeland security maintenance personnel had cleaned it up then they had set up a security officer outside the door to the conference room from the corridor locked the door to it from castillos office and were driven to the mayflower in a secret service yukon xl in the suv they confessed to one another that they had no idea where doherty was headed with his blackboard but that he obviously did and maybe they could make sense of them in the morning when their heads were clear they went to the suite ordered club sandwiches and beer from room service and went to bed before ten both of them first having fallen asleep watching television in the living room three conference room office of the chief of operational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august castillo nearly didnt pick up when the red bulb flashed on the white house telephone on the conference table for one thing he seriously doubted that the president of the united states wished to speak personally to himespecially at this hourand he didnt want to talk to anyone elseespecially ambassador montvalewho was authorized to use the system what he wanted to doand had in fact ninety seconds earlier begun to dowas study the half dozen blackboards in the room to see if he could make any sense out of dohertys symbols arrows and question marks and he knew that if he didnt pick up the red handset miller would but he picked it up anyway before he could open his mouth a male voice said not bad i understand the protocol requires a pickup in thirty seconds or less that took you twentytwo whos this castillo asked although he had suspicions the reply came in a voice which would not win any amateur night contests softly singing a song from castillos past well bid farewell to kaydet gray and don the army blue how can you be so cheerful at this hour castillo asked ive been up since three colonel gregory j kilgore said thats when the fisherman called to tell me hed hooked a whopper and by the time i got over here about four he was waiting to tell me hed hooked all kinds of things and more have been caught in the net since then im separating the shellfish from the trash fish right now and youre going to tell me what im not going to tell you anything kilgore said i thought that was understood between us but a fleetfooted messengeractually hes driving a mini cooperis headed your way as we speak bearing some of the initial catch watch out for him this is a secure line castillo began but stopped when he realized kilgore had broken the connection twentyfive minutes later a redandblack mini cooper pulled up in the curved driveway of the building a trim young man in a gray suit got out and walked toward the door there was little question in castillos mind that he was kilgores fleet footed messenger but he resisted the temptation to intercept him lets see what he does with the envelope the young man surprised castillo by walking to him the minute he was inside the building mr castillo he asked politely howd you know you were described to me sir the young man said may i see some identification please the only thing castillo had to show him were his secret service credentials the young man examined them carefully said thank you sir and took a large white manila envelope from his jacket pocket and handed it to castillo this is for you sir castillo saw that the young man was wearing a west point ring thank you castillo said do you want me to sign for this that wont be necessary sir good morning sir the young man walked quickly out of the building got in his little car and drove off castillo went to the elevator bank ran his card through the reader and rode up to his office only when he was in the conference room did he open the envelope it contained a sheaf of paper and an unmarked compact disc when he fed the cd to his laptop he saw that it contained a document in microsoft word format he opened it he compared what came onto his monitor with the second pagethe first page was blankof the sheaf of papers they appeared to be identical he started to read what was on the screen synopsis it almost immediately became apparent that a number of entities have an interest in certain activities of the caledonian bank amp trust limited see appendix some of the filter keys used to develop information for these entities are identical to those provided by you see appendix information developed from your filters may be found in appendix and information which you may find of interest may be found in appendix castillo picked up the sheaf of papers and found appendix among the entities listed were the central intelligence agency the federal bureau of investigation and the internal revenue service that was interesting maybeprobablythere was something in files somewhere that would be useful he turned back to the laptop and scrolled down to appendix appendix was five pages of data dates amounts and account numbers it made no sense to castillo at all he went into his office miller was behind castillos desk studying his laptop computer screen his stiff leg resting on an open drawer wheres yung castillo asked miller shrugged you told him to come in at eight wheres he staying i need him now miller shrugged again what have you got miller asked castillo handed him the sheaf of papers miller glanced through it then said yeah youre right you do need him he paused hell be here in an hour give or take youre a lot of goddamned help it is not nice to be cruel to a cripple miller said piously inspector doherty came into the office at seven twentyfive good morning he said without much enthusiasm weve heard from nsa castillo said and handed him the sheaf of papers doherty examined them its gibberish to me he announced you need an expert like yung i thought you sent for him he looked at castillo for a moment his face suggesting he didnt like what he saw then said well back to work and went into the conference room castillo motioned for miller to go with him miller nodded lifted his bad leg off the open drawer with both hands and got to his feet mr agnes forbison came to work at sevenforty she knew where yung was stayingat the marriott by the press club he and mr delchamps are both there could you call him and tell him i need him now well if you want me to i will but you told him to be here at eight and hes probably already on his way here he might have overslept castillo said call him mr forbison was still on the telephone when both david w yung jr and edgar delchamps walked in together she gave castillo a what did i tell you expression then exclaimed look at your hand she was making reference to the bloody damage on yungs hand ol dave delchamps volunteered cheerfully ever the gentleman tried to hold the elevator door for me it got him no good deed ever goes unpunished well have to get you to a doctor agnes said theres no time for that castillo said earning him a dirty look from mr forbison i could use a fresh bandage yung said but i dont need a doctor all the damned door did was crack the scab youre sure agnes asked and when he had nodded said ill get the firstaid kit i didnt know you two knew each other castillo said as he watched agnes tenderly wrap yungs hand with a sterile bandage we met in the round robin yung said referring to the groundfloor bar in the willard hotel which is across the street from the marriott whence i had gone separately for a little liquid sustenance delchamps said the marriott bar being full of road warriors and ladies offering them solace for a price i thought you were going to get on the horn to the retired dinosaurs association castillo interrupted after i had conversed with several gentlemen whose advanced age has fortunately not dimmed their memories delchamps went on and there was this asiatic gentleman with a bandaged wing extolling the virtues of argentine beef to a tootsie at the bar it could have been a coincidence but i didnt think so i thought i was looking at twogun yung the wounded hero of the battle of the river plate whose exploits so shocked doherty yesterday so what i did was borrow a sheet of paper from the bartender and sent him a note you sonofabitch yung said you really got me the note read colonel c thought you would probably talk too much leave immediately go to your hotel and wait for instructions delchamps went on pleased with himself my reasoning being that if confucius had never heard of colonel c no harm would be done but if i was rightand i was you bastard yung said goodnaturedly he read the note and became scrute became what agnes asked as in inscrutable delchamps explained nervously licking his lips he looked frantically around the bar searching for counterintel types and he didnt make you castillo said laughing delchamps shook his head i carry with me this often helpful aura of bemused innocence he said so what dave did was hurriedly pay his bill say goodbye to the tootsie and head for the door at that point i took pity on him and bought him a drink we had a couple yung admitted i hope your mind is clear dave ive got a bunch of stuff from nsa i need you to translate and after that you can tell me about the funeral castillo was not unaware that delchampss attitude had done a oneeighty from that of the previous morning maybe because hes working or maybe because hes working and he senses that hes not going to be ignored now after breaking his ass trying to do a good job good morning inspector doherty yung said politely as he walked into the conference room how are you yung doherty replied and ice filled the room castillo thought so far as dohertys concerned yung has betrayed his beloved fbi and theres not much of a difference between him and howard kennedy and yung not only knows this but probablyalmost certainlyhas to feel uncomfortable about that maybe even a little ashamed of himself is that going to fuck things up is dave going to backslide and become a good little fbi agent again the answer came immediately well aside from this yung said raising his bandaged hand im fine inspector how about you i heard about that doherty said colonel castillo told you doherty nodded i thought he would probably have to have told youedgar delchamps told me what youre doing here so i guess he also told you that you cant go back to the j edgar hoover building and tell them guess what we were right all along about yung he cant be trusted any more than howard kennedy can wait till i tell you what hes been up to colonel castillo has made it clear that your activities yung are protected by the security classification of the presidential finding im almost sorry they are i wish i could tell the bastards in professional ethics that im not ashamed of anything ive done since i got involved in this and that i like being trusted by castillo and the people around him thats more than i can say for the bureau they found me guilty by associationwe cant trust him anymore send him to uruguay or someplacewith no more justification than a determination to cover their own asses doherty paled and looked as if he was about to say something well delchamps said breaking the silence now that the air is cleared and were all pals united in a common cause can we get back to work ive got a lot of paleontological data for your blackboards jack what kind of data doherty asked from dinosaurs delchamps said and i have fifteen pages of mysterious numbers for you to decipher for us dave castillo said and gestured for him to sit down at the conference table what nsa has come up with charley yung said fifteen minutes later is pretty good its a goddamned pity we cant use it to put some of these bastards in jail for what income tax evasion most of them a lot of other charges but none of this would be admissible in court careful youre starting to sound like an fbi agent again castillo said without thinking then heard what he had said and looked to see if doherty had heard him his face showed that he had oh fuck you yung was screwed by the fbiprobably by you personally dohertyand you know it i dont give a damn about the irs castillo went on what use is it to us well we know from which account the people in philadelphia or eastonwherever the hell it wasgot their two million didnt we already know that what we didnt knowthis is in appendix was that there was a deposit the same exact amount into the same account at the caledonian bank and trust limited from which the was wired to the merchants national bank of easton i think we can reasonably surmise this was done in anticipation of sending the money to pennsylvania who put that money in that account castillo asked it came from another numbered account in the caledonian bank and trust limited and whats very interesting about that isthis is also in appendix is that thats a very substantial account with just over fortysix million dollars in it in cash castillo asked incredulously five million in cash the rest in instruments something like the ones lorimer used in uruguaynot the same thing exactly but something like it you want me to explain that first tell me whats very interesting about this second account there have been no deposits made to it since march the invasion of iraq began on march we know that date miller said when castillo and i were simple honest soldiers we were there which suggests to you what the oilforfood scam ended with the invasion yung said that final deposit ninepointfive million was probably in the pipeline so to speak for that threeday difference who owns the account with the fortysix million in it we dont know nsa cant get data like that yung replied but appendix says that a lot of people are snooping around the caledonian bank and trust limited including the fbi one of them should know you hear that inspector castillo asked i heard it doherty said would you be surprised if my first reaction was to say fuck you no castillo said but and not just because i dont like you and this operation of yours but because if nsa says the bureau is interested in this caledonian bank that means there is a legitimate ongoing investigation which may very well be screwed up by you nosing around but castillo asked again if i dont do this for you youll go back to montvale hell go back to director schmidt and hell either order me to get the information or tell somebody else to do it please give inspector doherty the numbers of the accounts were interested in dave doherty hung up the phone fifteen minutes later and handed castillo a sheet of notepaper on which was written kenyon oil refining and brokerage company midland texas castillo was momentarily surprised at hearing midland texas but then realized that it was because munzs family was on the doublebarc ranch there not because the oil company was in midland theres probably three or four hundred oil companies in midland and its not surprising that i never heard of this one many of them are nothing more than a phone number and a post office box thats the account with the fortysix million in it doherty reported the information the bureau has is that theyre a small independent outfit primarily involved in the business of buying and selling crude oil they have a small refinery in houston but thats usually involved in refining other peoples oil there is an ongoing investigation that has so far not turned up anything theyre looking for what is the fbi looking for castillo asked they didnt tell me and i didnt ask get back on the horn please inspector and ask and while youve got them on the phone find out what the fbi haveanything everything they haveon the other numbers yung gave you doherty glowered at him and didnt move do it inspector castillo said unpleasantly doherty grabbed the telephone making no effort to hide it castillo listened and watched him carefully while he made the call itll take some time to get that information doherty reported when he had finished theyll call and while were waiting well all going to take a quick course in how the scans worked castillo said from who doherty asked from my budapest source who is now in argentina i told you castillo i didnt want any data from those people until we sort out what we already have do you speak hungarian inspector no i dont speak hungarian doherty responded in exasperation then youll just have to guess what im saying to my source castillo said and picked up the delta force radio handset sergeant neidermeyer a voice came over the handset are we up castillo asked all green sir data link too all up colonel wake them up neidermeyer castillo ordered then switched the radio to speakerphone and hung up the handset davidson a voice came over the speaker ten seconds later got you working the radio do they jack castillo asked in a strange tongue inspector davidson had never heard before he had no idea what it was but it wasnt hungarian thats not hungarian doherty accused castillo looked at him and softly said in english actually inspector its pashto one of the two major languages spoken in afghanistan the other being afghan persian delchamps and miller smiled and shook their heads castillo turned to the radio and switching back to pashto said do you know if the old mans up yet jack the reply came in pashto thats why im working the radios colonel kocian and kensington are kicking the soccer ball for max i was but that big sonofabitch knocked me on my ass and i quit i need to talk to the old man right now hold one colonel tell him to speak hungarian castillo ordered looking at doherty and smiling will do hold one i wondered if i was ever going to hear from you karlchen eric kocian said in hungarian and i am not surprised that you called ninety seconds before max and i are to have our breakfast uncle billy did you ever see one of those books windows for dummies microsoft word for dummies you called me on your science fiction radio and are making me late for breakfast to ask a stupid question like that delchamps laughed and said i think i like this guy which caused inspector doherty to realize that delchamps spoke hungarian and caused him further discomfiture its important or i wouldnt have interfered with maxs breakfast castillo said what i need is a lecture how the oilforfood scam worked for dummies he switched to english and give it to me in english and slow because we have a man here whos going to write it downmake a chart of iton a blackboard i have the strangest feeling this odd request of yours is important to you kocian said in english one can sense an enormous feeling of relief on the part of our fbi coconspirator delchamps said in hungarian castillo chuckled doherty picked up on the fbi and glared at delchamps which caused castillo to chuckle again its very important to us uncle billy castillo said in hungarian i think were getting close i thought we were going to speak english kocian said also in hungarian make up your mind karlchen i really like this guy delchamps said make up your mind ace english please uncle billy castillo said in english we believe that an american company in midland texas a small broker is involved i need to know how likely that would be who he had to pay off and how that was done there was a perceptible pause as kocian gathered his thoughts remember the first time we did this karl in the bath at the gellert lets try that again it worked for the dummies the first time unsheath your magic marker please inspector castillo said im supposed to put what this guy says on my blackboards yes you are castillo said go ahead uncle billy draw a rough map of iraq on the blackboard kocian ordered down off the lower right corner draw in the persian gulf put a dot on the iraqi coast and label that mahashar thats the major iraqi oil terminal ill spell that for you doherty drew the map as ordered done uncle billy castillo said very well now understand that iraq was a virtually unlimited pool of crude oil outside of iraq that oil was worth at least fifty us dollars a barrelsay a dollar a gallon the problem saddam had was the un had forbidden him to export this oil so it was worthless to him i should mention that under his benevolent administration of iraq the oil all belonged to the government which is to say him he had absolute control of it and nobody could ask him any questions the way he got around his problem was to have the un authorize him to sell some of his oil the proceeds from which could be used only to purchase food and medicine for the iraqi people aside from saying that resulted in a good many aspirin pills being sold to iraq at five dollars per pilland similar outragesdo you want me to get into that stick with the crude oil please for now castillo said very well i presumed you knew at least a little about the price scams and payoffs kocian said about the crude oil do you know how much crude oil a tanker carries no castillo confessed i seem to recall that when the exxon valdez went down she dumped million barrels of crude oil into your pristine alaskan waters kocian said but to keep it simple for the dummies to whom you refer lets say just one million barrels doesnt that spaceage laptop of yours have a calculator can it handle multiplying fifty dollars a barrel times a million castillo could do that simple arithmetic in his head but he had his laptop open in front of him so he punched the keys anyway and reported fifty million dollars give or take very good now we go back to mahashar the un has authorized saddam to sell say twentyfive million dollars worth of his oil to buy food and medicine for his people it has also dispatched un inspectors to mahashar to make sure thats all that leaves the country a tanker then arrives in mahashar to take on the oil which has already been sold to some fine fellow at a good pricethe fellow being expected to make a small gift to saddam but thats yet another story twentyfive million dollars worth of oil is about half a million barrels and thats about half of the capacity of the tanker which shows up in mahashar to haul it away under the watchful eyes of the un so the tanker pumps out half of the seawater ballast it has arrived with replaces that with crude oil and sails away half loaded with crude and half with seawater now no one has ever accused saddam of being a rocket scientist but it didnt take him long to figure out that if he could only devise some way to have future tankers pump out all of their ballast and sail away with the tanks full of crude there would be money in it for him he thinks eureka all i have to do is slip the un inspectors a little gift they look away and off goes the tanker with an extra twentyfive million dollars worth of crude this poses some administrative problems he cant just hand the un inspector say fifty thousand dollars for looking the other way thats a lot of money even in onehundreddollar bills and theres a chance however slight that an honest un inspector exists and might blow the whistle on a dishonest one further what happens to the half million barrels of oil that nobody knows about once its sailing down the persian gulf toward the oilhungry world until its sold its worthless so they find some other government controlled by gangsters and thievesthe russians come immediately to mind but others were involvedwho are oil producers and can legally export oil within the restrictions imposed by that other fine international body opec if they buy the half million barrels of oilsince its otherwise worthless to him saddam can sell it for say ten dollars a barrel under the tablethey can turn right around and sell it as their own and not have to deplete their natural resources castillo looked at doherty who had just about filled half of one blackboard with cryptic symbols but who to sell it to exxonmobil and its peers believe it or not are fairly honest they wont touch it unless they know its clean your congress would love nothing better than to send them all to jail so what they had to do was find small oil refinersthere are thousands of themand offer them a real dealsay thirty dollars a barrel butyou said a small refiner in houston i said a small broker in midland castillo said the one we have in mind does have a small refinery in houston they heard kocian grunt knowingly before he went on a small broker in midland with a small refinery in houston would be aware that your internal revenue service would be looking at his books and might smell the limburger when they saw he had been buying thirtydollarabarrel oil so what does he do he writes a checkactually has his bank wirethe full fair price of the oil to say the cayman islands oil brokers ltd now he either owns this business or has a very cozy relationship with it they acknowledge receipt of the money take a cut and put the difference between what he actually paid for the oil and what hes telling irs he paid for it into another numbered account getting the picture karl yeah castillo said although he was still trying to absorb it all and heres where your friends lorimer and pevsner enter the picture kocian said the un inspector has to be paid for closing his eyes the captain of the tanker has to be paid for taking on more crude in mahashar than he reports to ships ownerand who is better able to do this than dr jeanpaul lorimer a diplomat of the united nations whos always flitting around the world doing good where did lorimer actually get the cashi presume were talking cashto make the payoffs castillo asked offshore banks simply will not take cash deposits kocian said they virtuously want to know where the money comes from okay but there are virtually no restrictions on the withdrawal of funds committed to their care they will happily wire your money to anyplace you designate and there are no export restrictions on cash from a cayman islands bank being hauled away on an airplane i would suspect that lorimer had one or more accounts in the cayman islandsyou understand karl im just using the caymans as an example banks in twenty other places offer exactly the same servicesinto which money was deposited by wire from some reputable bank and from which he made withdrawals either by wire or in cash a lot of the cash went to iraq in one of the palaces of one of saddams sons they found a billiona billiondollars in brandnew american onehundred dollar bills still in the plastic wrappers in which they had come from the us bureau of engraving and printing i suspect most of the moneythe cashwas carried into iraq on one of pevsners airplanes although others were probably involved but pevsner has the reputation for being reliable in the quiet hauling of large amounts of cash is there a russian or a cuban connection castillo asked karlchen i already told you putin is involved in this up to his skinny little buttocks kocian said i just dont have enough proof to print it which putin is he talking about castillo doherty asked your mafiosipal or the president of the russian federation castillo hesitated just perceptibly before replying hes not talking about pevsner jesus christ doherty said theyre no longer useful edgar delchamps said softly and thoughtfully but the hooks been set so why not reel them in as necessary excuse me castillo said delchamps raised his voice thank you ur kocian he said in hungarian well get back to you i really want to hear more of this who is that kocian demanded my name is delchamps ur kocian im a friend of karlchens well that makes two kocian said may i presume i may now take my breakfast bon appetit delchamps said then turned to castillo and switching to english said i really want to talk to your friend karlchen break it down neidermeyer castillo ordered and then turned to delchamps i dont know what the hell youre talking about edgar delchamps smiled ive been trying to make sense of dohertys mystic symbols for two days and getting nowhere and then the moment i hear about the generous smalltime texas oilman eureka everybody waited for him to go on why the hell would a smalltime texas oilmanpresumably a patriotic texas oilmansuddenly donate two million dollars to a bunch of lunatic wannabe muslims in philadelphia answer hes been converted unlikely answer he did not do so willingly so why would he because hes been turned the hook is already set in him what do you mean turned miller asked delchamps didnt reply directly i also asked myself whats with the suitcase nukes he went on where did that come from i have no goddamned idea where youre going with this edgar doherty said delchamps ignored him according to karlchen here uncle billy can call me that edgar but you cant castillo said evenly my most profound apologies ace delchamps said insincerely according to ace here the ninjas he took down at the nevernever land hacienda estancia shangrila castillo corrected him without thinking whatever delchamps went on in faroff uruguay were professionals and we have since learned that one of them was a heavy hitter cuban spook and ace tells us the people who tried to snatch uncle billy on the franz josef bridge in romantic budapest also were pros as were the two you took down in the gellert right ace castillo nodded and they all had garrotes they all had what doherty asked its a devicethese were stainless steelnot unlike the plastic handcuffs the cops are now using they put it around your neck and choke you to death castillo said and what was that about you taking someone down in the gellert whats the gellert its a hotel jack on the banks of the danube delchamps said you should take the little woman there sometime very romantic the man i lost in the uruguayan operation was killed with a garrote castillo said softly the men who attempted to snatch eric kocian on the bridge in budapest had both garrotes and a hypodermic needle full of a tranquilizer the two men who went to kocians hotel room in budapest had garrotes when mr masterson was kidnapped in buenos aires she was knocked out with a shot in her buttocks you had to kill two people in budapest doherty persisted castillo nodded and went on the garrote was used routinely by only the east german stasi and the hungarian allamvedelmi osztaly and allamvedelmi hatosag which are doherty asked they were the hungarian version of the stasi sandor tor kocians bodyguard told his people to find out if the two in the hotel were exavo or exavh they were to call dick here if that connection could be made they havent called which strongly suggests they were not avo or avh leaving only stasi it fits edgar what fits doherty asked off the top of your head jack delchamps asked sarcastically whobesides the israelis and ace heres intrepid band of special operatorscould mount at just about the same time professional snatch operations in argentina uruguay and hungary youre saying you think the kgb is involved in this doherty asked incredulously no jack not the kgb delchamps said if we are to believe mr putin the bad old kgb which he once led is dead it was replaced by the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti rossiyskoy federatsii commonly called the fsb and yes that thought has been running through my head it fits edgar castillo repeated lets see if great minds really run down the same path ace delchamps said whats your scenario putins afraid his role in this is going to come out castillo began so get rid of the witnesses starting with lorimer starting with lorimers number two the guy who got whacked in vienna delchamps said right castillo agreed and lorimer who suspected he was about to be whacked put his plan a into effect the moment he learned his pal was gone plan a miller parroted get the hell out of dodge castillo said he already had his alter ego set up in uruguay and his nest egg plan a was to stay out of sight until they stopped looking for him okay miller said agreeing so when he disappeared how to find him castillo said through his sister you dont really think the fsb keeps dossiers on un diplomats do you delchamps said listing next of kin things like that castillo nodded why wouldnt they when delchamps didnt respond he went on so they snatched his sister and told her they would kill her children if she didnt locate her brother for them and then murdered her husband to show how serious they were so who is they delchamps said the ksb i dont think so but just for the sake of argument lets say that putin out of the goodness of his heart found some sort of employment for a group of deserving stasi types who had lost their jobs when the berlin wall came down you never know when youre going to need a good assassin and if something went wrong no connection with these guys to the ksb miller said clever and they were probably very useful when the oilforfood scam was running delchamps said both in moving money around and removing witnesses to any connection with putin and company and no paper trail miller said whatever money they were spending was oilforfood money that too delchamps agreed okay ace then what i got lucky castillo said otto gorner heard that some west germans were moving oilforfood money to argentina and uruguay and told me about it he also warned me that people who had been curious about this had died and to butt out which of course you were congenitally unable to do miller said and you went to eric kocian he pointed you toward south america and then you got lucky with confucius he had a file onwhats the alter ego bertrand castillo furnished as he glanced at yung dave you havent said a word does that mean you think were just pissing into the wind and youre too polite to say so just before he changed sides kennedy was working on something with a houston connection yung said ive been trying to remember what it was wouldnt there be a record of some sort an interim report of some kind delchamps asked kennedy took everything he had with him doherty said bitterly im sure your friend pevsner read it before it was destroyed why dont you ask him what were you looking for dave castillo pursued was there an oilforfood scam connection not as such yung said we were looking for unusual transferswire transfersof large amounts of money money laundering in other words theres two facets of thatmore than two actually one is income tax evasion when we came across something suspicioussomething for example that looked like someone was concealing income or assetswe turned it over to the irs and let them deal with it when the source of the money was suspiciousas if it might be drug money for example or in the case of politicians purchasing agents etcetera that looked like it might be bribeswe worked on that ourselves the way we were working i looked for anomalies and when i found something suspicious howard looked into it and you remember something about houston castillo asked only just that yung said ive been trying hard to remember the specifics keep trying dave castillo said and turned to the others where were we at the point where you decided to repatriate lorimer miller said right delchamps said meanwhile the bad guys found out where lorimer slash bertrand was how well at first they didnt know where he was castillo said otherwise they wouldnt have taken the risk of kidnaping mr masterson to find out that was an act of desperation so somebody had to tell them delchamps said who knew castillos pal the russian mafioso pevsner doherty said i dont think so castillo said why do you keep defending that slimeball castillo doherty snapped if he knew where lorimer was and had told the ninjas castillo said he wouldnt have let me use his helicopter he didnt want me whacked because he likes you right doherty asked because that would kill the deal he has about keeping the fbi and the cia off his case another possibility is that it was just a coincidence that everybody descended on nevernever land at the same time delchamps said how the ninjas found out where he was doesnt really matter they did and staged that operation to take him out thats one hell of a coincidence wouldnt you say doherty challenged however it happened delchamps said the ninjas went to the hacienda and were more than a little surprised to find ace and company already there why do you think they were surprised doherty asked otherwise the score of that ball game would not have been six to one delchamps said they probably thought theyd come on a bunch of local bandits knocking off a hacienda not in their league not a problem just whack everybody leave the bodies where they fell and take off surprise surprise its the us cavalry yeah castillo said thoughtfully so what happened when there was no phone call to the embassy of the russian federation saying mission accomplished delchamps said what happened who whacked our guys does it matter lorimers dead next step take out kocian after first finding out just how much he knows castillo said which would also apply to special agent yung doherty said yeah it would delchamps agreed which means as soon as they can find him theyre going to have another try at kocian i really want to talk to him ace before that happens we might not be so lucky again pevsner is probably on their hit list castillo said pevsner probably wrote their hit list doherty said what do you want to do ace delchamps asked you never got around to telling us where you think the kenyon oil refining and brokerage company fits into this edgar oh yeah well this may really be off the wall but its also possible the russians know about kenyons involvement with the oilforfood scam maybe they were in it with him i dont know but it doesnt matter the oilforfood scam is over so nobody needs kenyon anymore he paused visibly organizing his thoughts you have to think of putin as being kgb and with a sense of humor delchamps then went on or maybe he just has evil intentions anyway hes got kenyon on a hook do what i say or the fbi will find out what a naughty boy you have been kenyon has all this money in the caymans how do i find out how deeply the hook is in him what is laughingly known as the intelligence community knows all about these lunatics in philadelphia theyre being watched the americans swallowed the hidden nuclear suitcase bombs nonsense hook line and sinker once lets see if we can get them to swallow it again so what i will do is tell the dummy in midland to send the lunatics two million dollars to buy some tunnels to protect themselves from the nuclear blast in philadelphia since they are being watched this will come to the attention of the intelligence community net result the american intelligence community runs around like chickens with their heads cut off looking for nuclear suitcases which have never left the warehouse in siberia haha he paused let that sink in then went on probable benefit two putin knows about the fortysix million kenyon has in the cayman bank putins pal the famous colonel pyotr sunev now back at work after a teaching sabbatical at grinnell university can find many uses for fortysix mil or maybe putin and sunev will just split it between them kenyon probably would not be very anxious to hand it over but that reluctance was before he sent the two million to the lunatics now putin has him for not only illegally profiting from the oilforfood scandaland hiding the moneybut also for sending two million to lunatics in philadelphia known to have terrorist ties getting the picture ace im thinking about it castillo said it sounds off the wall but kenyon either gives them the money or goes to jail miller said to whom could he complain he was robbed right delchamps said so what do you think ace i think we should go have a talk with kenyon in midland maybe we can get him to tell us who got him to send the money to philadelphia maybe miller said what makes you think hell tell you anything at all doherty asked all youve got is a wild theory jesus i just remembered jake went home castillo said miller immediately took his meaning charley you steer and ill work the radios he said castillo looked at him for a long moment before replying youre sure miller nodded okay get on the horn and have them roll the gulfstream out of the hangar castillo said youre going to texas right now doherty asked were going to texas and then buenos aires castillo said why dont you get on the horn to your wife and have her pack a bag and your passport nothing was said about me going out of the country on a lunatic mission like this doherty said i hope that was an observation rather than an indication youre going to be difficult castillo said id like to go yung said i wouldnt think of leaving home without you david castillo said he looked at doherty i can make you go inspector and you know it but i dont want you along if youre going to be a pain in the ass your call doherty met castillos eyes for a long moment before replying how long are we going to be gone he asked finally probably less than a week castillo said thank you what are we going to do about the blackboards doherty asked i was just thinking about that castillo said id like to have that data at the safe house in buenos aires is there some way we can photograph them and replicate them down there not a problem doherty said okay then you start on that ive got a couple of phone calls to make xvi one office of the chief of operational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august castillo sat down in the leatherupholstered judges chair behind his huge ornate desk and looked uncomfortably around his luxuriously furnished office he felt like an intruder he shrugged and picked up the handset of what billy kocian had called his science fiction radio neidermeyer he ordered put me through to sergeant major davidson please hold one colonel five seconds later davidsons voice came over the circuit yes sir jack theres reason to believe another attempt to kidnap or take out eric kocian is likely to happen really whats that phrase take all necessary precautions consider it done colonel theres also good reason to think that the bad guys are exstasi which means you should keep that in mind when youre taking all necessary precautions these guys are pros thats interesting make sure everybody else knows including kocian especially kocian done colonel you dont have a time do you anywhere from four to twentyfour hours after they find out where he is and by now they may already know kocian wants to go into buenos aires for lunch thats off he is not to leave mayerling id prefer that he not go outside the house well you and i have sat on difficult people before ill deal with him well be coming down there after a stop in midland texas to see colonel munzs family no we found out theres a connection in midland between the oilforfood scam and the two million dollars the philadelphia muslims got for their bomb shelter were going to see what we can find out and then come down there got an eta when there is one ill get it to you i think we can handle things here colonel anything else i was about to ask you to patch me through to the embassy but i just decided itll be better if i make a perfectly ordinary call from here i dont want to be responsible for tipping these bastards about mayerling understood okay jack keep your eyes open and watch your back you too colonel break it down neidermeyer pevsners phone numbers were in the cellular telephone alex darby had given him in buenos aires and castillo had to go into his briefcase for it when he turned it on the screen read low battery he pushed himself away from the desk and went into the outermr agnes forbisonsoffice where the moment agnes saw him with the cellular in his hand she put her hand out for it then she pulled open a drawer in her desk wherepredictablyshe had a box full of assorted chargers and in a moment had fitted one of them to the phone theres a socket in your bankers lamp on your desk she said thanks i gather youre going somewhere she asked midland texas and then buenos aires castillo replied i think weve found the link between the oilforfood scam and the nuclear suitcase bombs she didnt say anything but her eyes asked for clarification if i tell you this there will be a nuclear mushroom over philadelphia before i finish the sentence castillo said but right now i really dont think there is a suitcase bomb any nearer than siberia thank god she said that whole scenario was to pull our chain castillo said or at least pulling our chain was part of it can dick tell me about it dicks going with me jake is in charleston is that going to work dicks leg hell navigate ill steer castillo said itll work again her eyes asked for clarification this is what edgar delchamps has come up with he said let me know what you think this may be the dumbest thing ive said all week agnes said when he had finished but it just may be the answer i havent heard anything that makes more sense i really hope so castillo said you really like delchamps dont you she asked hes the one who should be sitting behind that desk castillo said nodding toward his office hes the only one around here who really knows what hes doing no hes not agnes said and he doesnt enjoy the confidence of the president thats because the president doesnt know himyet i wonder how ambassador montvale is going to take this agnes said and when she saw the look on castillos face added you werent going to tell him were you charley you have to no i wasnt castillo said and yeah i do correct me if im wrong colonel ambassador charles w montvale the director of national intelligence said but you are suggesting i go to the president and say in effect not to worry mr president there is no threat of a nuclear detonation in philadelphia all the russian suitcase nuclear devices are still in the soviet union it seems president putin has been playing a little joke on us im not suggesting you do anything mr ambassador castillo said the source of this rather interesting theory is a veteransome might even say burnedoutcia field officer by the name of delchamps who does not im afraid enjoy the full confidence of his superiors in langley montvale went on why do i suspect the people you talked to at langley cannot be counted among his legion of admirers castillo asked for the record i like him very much you can find him in my dictionary under both highly competent or widely experienced not for the record the people i spoke with seem to feel that not only does he regret the cold war is over but that he is both a francophobe andam i coining a phrasea unphobe maybe thats because hes been dealing with the french and the united nations for a longtime they asked me if he might be considering retirement when his temporary duty with me is concluded with all respect mr ambassador his temporary duty is with me and if they ask that question tell them not to hold their breath youre fond of that expression arent you montvale said then finished his original comment and no mr president there is no firm intelligence to confirm this fascinating theory colonel castillo is going on a hunch castillo said nothing no comment colonel mr ambassador i told you i would keep you abreast of what im doing and plan to do ive just done that does the fbi expert inspector doherty whom you told not to hold his breath when he said he expected you to tell him if you had any contact with pevsner or former fbi agent kennedy you knew about that and still sent him to me you asked for their best man and thats who i sent you montvale replied does doherty know about this fascinating theory that putin is playing games with us he does and id say he shares your opinion of it sir well while youre off in texas and argentina would it be possible for him to come see me and tell me what he thinks of the situation im taking inspector doherty with me sir to south america i want him to work with the people and the data down there mr ambassador id really like to have his take on the probability of there being nuclear weapons about to be detonated in this country yes sir does that mean youre going to send him to see or not ive got two more telephone calls to make mr ambassador and then were going to the airport in other words youre not going to send him to see me theres just not time mr ambassador this is another of those times when i really wish you were working for me castillo yes sir i thought something like that might be running through your mind there was a long silence then the white house operator came on the line are you through colonel castillo realized that montvale had broken his end of the connection it looks that way thank you castillo put the white house phone back in its cradle and picked up the handset of another lopez carlos you werent in your office but they gave me your cellular number im at the doublebarc fernando lopez said what are you doing there why do you think gringo abuelas here so are half a dozen secret service agents i thought i should be here okay whats on your mind what do you know about the kenyon oil company specifically the kenyon oil refining and brokerage company is there a kenyon jesus you really dont live here anymore do you lopez said not very pleasantly yeah theres a kenyon theres a lot of them one of them philip is a classmate of mine you dont remember him no i dont now that i think about it im really surprised you belted him good one time when he said you had to be queer because you talked funny and rode a sissy saddle tubby castillo asked as the memory came to him of a heavyset twelveyearold trying to fight back tears after his nose had been bloodied yeah fernando said tubby nobody calls him that much anymore he runs kenyon yeah he does why do i think gringo that i am going to be unhappy when you explain this sudden interest in philip j kenyon iii youre not going to like it fernando castillo said is he in midland now do you think he was yesterday fernando said i saw him in the petroleum club he asked me if i still played poker and i had to tell him no because maria and abuela and the munzes were with me the fridaynight threecard stud games of fame and legend are still going hell be thereat the petroleum clubtonight you going to tell me why you want to know not over the phone ill tell you when i see you and when will that be as soon as i make one more telephone call im headed for the airport its about three hours in the air figure another hour and a half to go wheelsup its now ten knock an hour off because of the time zones we should be there sometime before three midlandodessa or here midland were going from there to buenos aires and i cant do the customs stuff from the strip at the doublebarc whos we yung a guy named delchamps a guy named dohertyan fbi big shotmiller and me plus jake torine itll be a little crowded but itll be all right jakes not coming and we may not be staying overnight first things first yes you are staying overnight abuela will expect you to spend the night jesus you just dont give a damn about peoples feelings do you carlos okay well spend the night if jakes not coming whos flying the gulfstream miller will work the radios castillo said after a justperceptible hesitation sure why not youve been flying that gulfstream for what ten whole days now and really racked up a lot of time maybe ten even twelve hours and shot maybe six landings youre out of your mind you know that i can fly the gulfstream castillo said there are old pilots and there are bold pilots but there are no old bold pilots you ever hear that i can fly it it practically flies itself i was about to say its been nice knowing you but that wouldnt be entirely true so i dont suppose youre going to meet me at midlandodessa castillo asked but before lopez had a chance to reply went on no actually have the senior secret service agent meet us i have to talk to him and id rather do that at the airport your wish is my command carlos see you sometime this afternoon the connection went dead he called me carlos again he called me carlos three times he must be really pissed at me and unfortunately with good reason he got another dial tone and then reading them from alex darbys cellular carefully punched in a long series of numbers hola hello alek castillo said in russian after a long moment aleksandr pevsner replied in russian ah colonel castillo my former friend i am surprised that you would dare to call me ever again former friend alek you lied to me and about something you knew was very important to me are you going to tell what or are you just going to sulk like a little boy you dare to deny it to mock me to mock you sure youre the mockable type but i cant deny anything until you tell me what it is munz is what im talking about what about him you knew where he was all the time and said you didnt i didnt say i didnt know where he was castillo said i didnt tell you i didnt know you jumped to that conclusion do you know where he is now kennedy cant find him or his family colonel exfriend i dont understand the question are you telling me that howard cant find alfredo and his family or asking if i know where senora munz and the girls are if you knew where the women are would you tell me the truth i do and i would where are they safe in the safest place i can think of them to be right now youre not going to tell me where no and alfredo hes in the secondsafest place i could think of for him to be i want to talk to alfredo well he has your number alek if he wanted to talk to you i think he would have called thats his call so far as senora munz is concerned give me four hours or so to have her released from her cell and for the tranquilizers to wear off and ill ask her if she wants to call you but i have to say i dont think shed call unless alfredo said it was okay and were right back to square one you sonofabitch when i find you you will be sorry actually you wont have to find me ill be in argentina in twentyfour hours or less and i want to talk to you and so do several friends of mine ha the reason im calling alek is to try to make sure youll still be alive when i get there meaning what i think its entirely possible that certain peoplecertain of your countrymen as a matter of factwould like it a lot better if you had one of those indian beauty marks youre always talking about in the center of your forehead there was a perceptible pause before pevsner replied my countrymen what exactly is that supposed to mean one of the people who were there when alfredo shot himself cleaning his pistol was a member of the cuban direccion general de inteligencia that being the case isnt it reasonable that the ksb is involved there was a perceptible pause before pevser replied in a tone of disgust the cuban direccion general de inteligencia where did you get that why should i believe it you should believe it friend alek because im telling you and you should also believe that the people who tried to ask eric kocian questions in budapest were exstasi because im telling you that too when pevsner didnt reply castillo went on why dont you ask your friends the cuban was major alejandro vincenzo he was once castros bodyguard i dont have the names of the exstasi people yet but im working on it there was another long pause before pevsner asked what was this fellows name castillo repeated it then spelled it for him where did you get this charley pevsner asked sorry you dont trust me why should i a minute ago you told me were no longer pals there was another long pause then castillo went on alfredo knows but since he doesnt trust you enough to even give you a call to say hi alek how they hanging i guess youre just going to have to guess where we got it alfredo has no reason to distrust me and neither do you pevsner said sharply well truth to tell i trust you up to a point but alfredo obviously isnt so sure otherwise he would have been in touch i want to talk to alfredo charley charley i thought i was colonel exfriend i want to talk to alfredo charley pevsner repeated well maybe when im down there something can be worked out i mean right now give my regards to the family alek and watch your back you dont have as many friends as you think you do two midland international airport midland texas august ive got it dick castillo said miller raised both of his hands fingers spread to show that he was relinquishing control of the aircraft they had been cleared for a straightin approach to runway r they could see the airfield clearly he really hated to turn it over me castillo thought at least subconsciously he knows it wouldnt be safe for him to land with only one good leg dick really loves to fly im not like that never have been i do it because thats what im supposed to do and i try hard to do it well because the alternative to doing it well is not pleasant to contemplate i think i should be able to sit this thing down without any trouble the approach is low and slow and r is feet long and feet wide but fernando was right i really shouldnt be flying this by myself with only a few hours of onthejob training the approach control operators voice in his headset brought him to attention gulfstream threesevennine the controller said be advised that an air force fd has just begun his takeoff roll on r before castillo could open his mouth miller responded to the controller thank you we have him in sight ahead of them a dullsilverpainted air force fighter was moving with everincreasing speed down the runway it lifted off and almost immediately raised its nose so steeply that the entire aircraft seemed to be under them the fuselagejust wide enough to hold the cockpitwas mounted on the leading edge of the sweptback wing between the intakes for the engines there were two vertical stabilizers mounted on the rear of the wing the pilot kicked in the afterburners and the plane began to climb at an astonishing speed look at that sonofabitch go miller said softly in awe whats a d castillo asked the trainer miller replied two seats i wonder what its doing at midlandodessa castillo said then added i think this is the time we put the wheels down ten seconds later miller reported gear down and locked as castillo taxied the gulfstream up to the parking ramp before the avion businessaviation building miller pointed out the window why do i think thats why that fd was here he asked colonel jacob torine usaf wearing a yellow polo shirt and khaki slacks was walking from the building toward them go let him in dick castillo said ill shut it down ninety seconds later colonel torine stuck his head in the cockpit i dont recall giving you permission colonel to play by yourself in our airplane and i didnt know the air force let old men like you even ride in airplanes like that fd castillo said offering torine his hand only if theyre fullbull colonels torine said you think that hard landing you just made did any serious damage that was a greaser jake and you know it beginners luck torine said agnes called me and said you were headed out here and probably to gaucholand she didnt tell me why we found out who sent the money to the aals in pennsylvania to buy their bomb shelter castillo said it turns out he went to texas a ampm with fernando interesting torine said i guess that explains why fernandoand the three secret service guys in the avion buildingare here what happens next i spent most of the trip out here thinking about that castillo said i have an idea its probably not a very good idea but its all i could come up with and are you going to share this not very good idea with me castillo finished unstrapping himself and stood up he met torines eyes yeah and afterto use fighter jock terminologyim shot down in flames you can tell me where i went wrong i dont know torine replied your flying skills leave something to be desired but every once in a good while you have a reasonably good idea castillo motioned that they go into the fuselage miller was sitting on the edge of one of the left forwardfacing leather seats near the door doherty was sitting across the aisle from him delchamps and yung were sprawled on the couches they made room for torine and castillo its getting a little toasty in here ace delchamps said an air conditioner is on the way castillo said then added you dont know jake do you no delchamps replied but i know hes all right when twogun yung here saw him coming he raised his eyes to heaven and said thank you god miller and torine laughed im about to get the others in here castillo said but before i do inspector doherty i want you to understand that what im going to propose is probablyhell certainlyillegal i dont expect you to go along with it but i do expect you to keep your mouth shut when i want your opinion ill ask clear doherty tightlipped nodded castillo nodded back then went to the door a ground crew was installing both an auxiliary power unit and an airconditioning hose castillo raised his voice to be heard over the tug pulling the unit make sure thats working he ordered were going to have a meeting in here that may take sometime then he looked at the avion building and waved his arm he couldnt see lopez or the secret service agents but a moment later his cousin pushed through the door followed by three men in gray suits and all started walking toward the gulfstream when everyone was aboard castillo closed the stair door i know its a little crowded in here he said but im pretty sure its not bugged this earned him a dutiful laugh i wish i could stand up all the way up in here he said earning a second polite laugh after a moment to collect his thoughts he went on okay what follows is classified top secret presidential by authority of a presidential finding you will never disclose anything you hear or learn in this cabin to anyone at any time without my personal permission everybody understand that he looked at each man in turn until he got a nod of acknowledgment some of you are aware that american muslims in the aariteg mosque in philadelphiaa group with known ties to terroristshave purchased a farm near philadelphia where they will seek shelter when a suitcase nuclear device called a sadm is detonated and castillo wound up his opening comments now that you know the manner in which i intend to deal with mr kenyon would drive just about any civil libertarian up the wall im going to give you ninety seconds to make up your mind whether youre in or out those who decide for any reason that they cant participate in this operation are free to go no hard feelings but with that caveat that they are not to reveal anything they have just heard or attempt to interfere in any manner with what im going to do i hate to sound like a hardass but were really playing hardball here and anyone who runs off at the mouth will be prosecuted for unlawful disclosure of top secret presidential material that prosecution will go forward no matter what happens to me and when i said you have ninety seconds to make up your mind i meant it he raised his wrist and punched the sweep second button on his aviators chronometer the clock is running he announced ninety seconds passed in absolute silence it felt like much longer times up castillo walked to the forward bulkhead and opened the door no one moved nows the time to leave he said no one moved you heard that inspector doherty castillo asked i heard you clearly colonel inspector doherty said okay then lets get this circus on the road castillo ordered three avion aviation services transient aircraft tarmac midland international airport midland texas august here they come special agent david w yung jr said gesturing out the window toward a black mercedesbenz s driving up to the gulfstream wind it up jake castillo ordered as he walked to the switch that controlled the opening and closing of the stair door midland ground control torine said gulfstream threesevennine at avion request taxi instructions for immediate departure castillo stood in the passage between the cabin and the cockpit and watched as the mercedes pulled up close to the aircraft the mercedes stopped the front passengers door opened and philip j kenyon iiia large stocky man wearing a white polo shirt a linen jacket khaki trousers and tan western bootsgot out as fernando lopez stepped out from behind the wheel kenyon perspiring in the texas summer heat that baked the tarmac looked admiringly at the gulfstream then smiling he started walking toward the stair door as two men got out of the rear seat of the mercedes kenyon did not seem to notice as a black gmc yukon xl approached the mercedes and the aircraft and pulled to a stop effectively screening the activity near the plane from any possible onlookers as kenyon got close to the stair door the man who had been riding in the left rear seat of the mercedes took what looked very much like a black semiautomatic pistol from under his jacket rested his elbows on the mercedes hood took aim and fired there was no loud sound as there would have been had the man fired a firearm but instead there was a barely audible pop as that of an air rifle firing kenyon made a sudden move with his hand toward his buttocks as if for example he had been stung by a bee then he fell to the ground and appeared to be suffering from convulsions the man who had fired what looked like a pistol tossed it to the man who had gotten out of the right rear seat of the mercedes and then got behind the wheel the man who now had what looked like a pistol went to kenyon and tugged at something apparently embedded in kenyons buttocks then fernando lopez bent over kenyon andwith some effort as the big man was still convulsingpicked him up over his shoulders in a firemans carry and started to climb the stair door there was a whine as one of the giiis engines began to turn castillo came to the head of the stairs got a firm grip on lopezs polo shirt and hauled him and kenyon into the fuselage as the man who now had the pistollike device pushed lopez from the rear as soon as everyone was inside the gulfstream the mercedes and then the yukon drove off the stair door began to retract and the gulfstream began to move as its other engine was started put him facedown on the couch castillo ordered then had a second thought after you take his clothes off being in your birthday suit surrounded by half a dozen ugly men with guns usually tends to make interrogatees very cooperative youre bad ace edgar delchamps said oh shit yung said then chuckled and added literally charley hes crapped his pants is that what they call an unexpected development ace delchamps asked put him in the aft crapper castillo ordered philip j kenyon iii returned to full consciousness to find himself sitting on the floor of a plasticwalled cubicle that smelled of feces an asian manin shirtsleeves with an automatic pistol in a shoulder holster and holding what looked like another pistol in his handlooked down at him what the hell kenyon said what happ yung put the index finger of his bandaged hand in front of his lips and said sssshhh what the yung raised the pistollike device and pointed it at kenyons chest the next time you open your mouth youll get it again he said almost conversationally what you are going to do now is take off your clothing and clean yourself put your filthy shorts in this and hand the rest of your clothes to me he handed kenyon a gallonsized plastic zipper bag philip j kenyon iii naked his handcuffed hands before him holding a small towel over his groin came down the fuselage aisle lay the towel on the seat tubby castillo ordered and sit on it i dont want you soiling my nice leather upholstery god he smells delchamps said kenyon did as he was ordered feeling a little disoriented are you tubby castillo asked jesus christ kenyon said you have been tazed castillo said or is it tasered in any event what that means is that we have caused fifty thousand volts and one hundred thirtyodd milliamperes of electricity to pass through your body you may have noticed that this is some what incapacitating if you show the slightest indication of being difficult or if you refuse to answer completely and without hesitation any questions that i or any of these other gentlemen ask you you will be tasered again you understand kenyon nodded when you are asked a question you will respond by saying at the minimum yes sir or no sir understand castillo noticed more than a little anger in kenyons eyes but his fear clearly was far worse kenyon nodded and said yes sir do you have any questions tubby it took kenyon thirty seconds to respond enough time for him to pick up a little bravado id like to know what the hell is going on here castillo he said stiffly and where i am where were going i was told i was just coming out to see your new airplane thats three questions castillo said from now on when i say you may ask a question that means one question but since you were unaware of the rule i will answer your three questions where are we we are at approximately twenty thousand feet in a climbing attitude on a course of approximately three hundred forty degrees we are headed for florence colorado well get to what the hell is going on here in a bit another question florence colorado whats in florence colorado thats two questions tubby im not going to tell you again the next time he asks two questions at once special agent yung taser him yes sir yung said but since your questions are some what related i will answer them florence colorado is home to the federal admax prison admax meaning administrative maximum security prison are you familiar with the florence admax tubby no kenyon replied some what impatiently castillo held up his index finger no sir kenyon said quickly the florence admax confines very bad peopleand i mean really confines prisoners are not allowed contact with any other prisoners and are released from their oneman cells for exercise for one hour per day they are allowed onehour family visits every other month provided of course their behavior has earned them that privilege and by very bad people i mean for example robert hannsen the fbi agent who was caught spying for russians andof special interest to youboth omar abdelrahman and ramzi yousef the islamic terrorists who bombed the world trade center in they are all going to spend the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole in the florence admax personally i think all traitors and terrorists or those who help them should be executed but the court showed those scumbags leniency perhaps they will too in your case i wouldnt bet on that though tubby youre an aggie you were an army officer you knew better than to do what you did i really cant see a juryespecially a texas juryrecommending clemency for you question i have no idea what youre talking about kenyon said having mustered just a little more bravado the next time he volunteers a mistruth yung taser him yes sir tubby youre not actually going to deny are you that you sent from accounts you probably thought no one knew you have in the caledonian bank and trust limited in the cayman islands to the aariteg mosque in easton a religious group with known connections to muslim terrorists kenyons skin paled his eyes widened are you castillo pursued kenyon sat up abruptly and vomited on the floor jesus h christ edgar delchamps said disgustedly go back to the bathroom tubby castillo ordered get some paper towels from the cabinet and clean up your mess kenyon raised his handcuffed wrists i noticed castillo said as the vile smell spread so what hurry up youre stinking up my aircraft kenyon struggled to his feet from the low couch and walked to the rear of the fuselage looks like something stung tubby on the ass doesnt it delchamps asked the others laughed kenyon came back down the aisle with paper towels in his hands dropped to his knees and started to mop up his vomitus no one said a word yung a handkerchief over his mouth and nose went aft and into the head came out with an aerosol can of air freshener then emptied it as he came forward in the cabin when kenyon thought he had finished he looked at castillo who shook his head clean tubby means clean castillo said it took kenyon three more trips to the toilet for paper towels and a lot of scrubbing before castillo nodded and said sit down okay where were we before tubby disgraced himself castillo asked i didnt know those people in philadelphia were terrorists kenyon blurted i didnt say you could speak castillo said the next time you speak without permission he mimed shooting the taser kenyon recoiled as if castillos finger were the real thing are you going to talk to us tubby or wait for the people waiting for you at florence castillo asked kenyon remained silent your choice castillo pursued whats it going to be kenyon looked off in the distance thinking then he looked long and hard at castillo ill tell you anything you want to know but youve got to believe me i didnt know the people in philadelphia were terrorists well well listen to what you have to say castillo said can i have your recorder jack doherty handed castillo a small tape recorder castillo went to kenyon put your knees together tubby he said and when kenyon had complied castillo laid the tape recorder on kenyons legs if that falls to the floor he said and mimed shooting the taser again kenyon quickly put his hands out to hold the recorder in position on his knees now before i switch that on castillo said theres something i want to tell you in case youre thinking that your civil rights have been violated and therefore it doesnt matter what you tell us it would not be admissible in court youre sitting in a sort of a court we are your judges and the jury let me tell you who we are you know fernando of course and you remember me and may even know im an army officer special agent yung is with the fbi thats edgar delchamps of the cia thats inspector doherty of the fbi those two are george feller and sam oliver of the secret service the airplane is being flown by colonel jake torine of the air force the copilot is an army officer major dick miller youre probably wondering why im telling you this the reason ispresuming you ever get back to midland or when your lawyer is finally admitted to florence and you could tell himthat neither your lawyer nor anyone else is going to believe that you were kidnapped by your classmate at texas a ampm and hustled aboard a giii piloted by an air force officer and an army officer where you were threatened and humiliated by another army officer with whom you were once in the boy scouts and then interrogated by a very senior fbi agent two secret service agents and a cia officer think about it tubby the only chance you have of not spending the rest of your life in a cell at florence admax is to come clean with us do we understand each other i told you id tell you anything you want to know but you have to believe me when i tell you i had no idea that was a terrorist group or mosque or whatever in philadelphia so you keep saying castillo said hes all yours inspector doherty moved from the forwardfacing chairs in which he had been sitting and sat down on the couch facing kenyon he took out a small notebook and a ballpoint pen then reached across the aisle and switched on the tape recorder interview of philip j kenyon iii doherty began begun at fivefifty pm central standard time august aboard an aircraft in the service of the united states somewhere above texas en route to the florence admax florence colorado by inspector john j doherty office of the director federal bureau of investigation washington acting under presidential authority present are colonel c j castillo team chief mr edgar delchamps office of the director central intelligence agency special agents george feller and samuel oliver of the dallas office united states secret service and fbi agent david w yung jr state your name and occupation please kenyon swallowed and then as if he was having trouble finding his voice finally announced that he was philip j kenyon iii chairman of the board of the kenyon oil refining and brokerage company of midland texas mr kenyon doherty said it is my understanding that you are making this statement voluntarily without either coercion of any kind or the promise of immunity from prosecution or the promise of special consideration because of your cooperation is that true kenyons eyes glanced at castillo then looked at the floor he exhaled audibly and said softly yes a little louder please yes thats true lets start at the beginning doherty said how did you first become involved in illegal transactions connected with the united nations oilforfood program kenyon exhaled again they came to me he said finally i didnt go looking for it they came to me who came to you a man named lionel cassidy kenyon said he came to me and asked if i would be interested in some thirtytwodollarabarrel oil do you have an address for mr cassidy no he always contacted me but he was known to you i never saw him before the day he came up to me at the bar at the petroleum club the one in dallas not the one in midland but how did he know you kenyon shrugged helplessly i dont know but he seemed to know all about me and my business and he said ive heard you might be interested in fifty thousand barrels at thirtytwopointfive hell of course i was that was ten dollars under market you say he seemed to know all about your business yung asked doherty gave him a dirty look and held up his hand to silence any reply from kenyon state your name and occupation and then repeat the question doherty ordered special agent david w yung jr fbi on assignment to the office of operational analysis yung said mr kenyon you say the man lionel cassidy who came to you seemed to know all about you and your business yes he did im going to show you a photograph mr kenyon and ask if you can tell me who it is yung said kenyon looked at the photograph yeah thats cassidy all right the sonofabitch who sucked me into this mess this is inspector doherty special agent yung showed mr kenyona fivebyseveninch clear color photograph of a white male approximately fortyfive years of age approximately five feet eleven inches tall and weighing approximately one hundred sixtyfive pounds mr kenyon identified the man in the photograph as lionel cassidy the man in the photograph is well known to me special agent yung and colonel castillo by another name which we know is his real name that name is not germane to this interview im telling you he told me his name was cassidy lionel cassidy kenyon said plaintively why should i lie to you about that no one is suggesting that youre lying mr kenyon doherty said so what did you do when mr cassidy offered you fifty thousand barrels of oil at thirtytwo dollars and fifty cents per barrel well i was suspicious at first but and now we turn to the contribution you made to the aariteg mosque doherty said a half hour later why did you do that well i certainly didnt want to kenyon said and i had no ideai said this before but ill say it againi had no idea there was any kind of a terrorist connection whatever so tell me what happened doherty said it was in cozumel kenyon said i took the family down there for a little sun and sea you know and cassidy was there castillo castillo interjected where in cozumel was this mr kenyon you mean the hotel castillo nodded grand cozumel beach and golf resort kenyon said go on castillo said well i saw cassidy at the beach and at the bar i know he saw me but there was no sign of recognition so i left it there that was fine with me did you happen to notice anyone with cassidy yeah he was with a guy about his age talked funny a russian accent maybe castillo asked could be charley the interview will be suspended castillo said for a brief period while castillo consults a file doherty looked at him with mixed curiosity and annoyance castillo went quickly to the net pouch behind the pilots chair and retrieved his laptop he turned it on hurriedly searched through it and then carried it to kenyon and held it in front of him mr kenyon i show you a computer image of a white male and ask you if this is the man you saw with cassidy in cozumel castillo said kenyon shook his head no never saw that guy before castillo held the computer up for doherty to see it colonel castillo has shown me the same computer image just now shown to mr kenyon that of a white male known to me from other photographs doherty said this man is not known to mr kenyon may i go on colonel please castillo said hold it delchamps said then went on edgar delchamps cia the interview will be suspended until i can get a photograph to show mr kenyon delchamps dug into his briefcase took a stack of fivebyseven photographs from it hurriedly searched through them selected two and held them out in front of kenyon look familiar he asked thats the guy kenyon said and this one same guy youre sure im sure cassidy was talking to him at the bar just before he all of a sudden recognized me came over and told me he needed a favor hold it a second doherty said mr delchamps has shown two clear fivebyseven photographs one color one blackandwhite of a white male approximately fortyfive years of age approximately five feet eight approximately one hundred ninety pounds to mr kenyon who positively stated the photos were of the same man and that this man was with cassidy in the hotel the man is apparently well known to mr delchamps but not to me or colonel castillo delchamps turned his back to kenyon and mouthed the name sunev doherty looked momentarily confused until he made the connection then he smiled then he lost the smile what do you think of your good pal now castillo he asked almost triumphantly i never said he was a good pal i just told you i wasnt going to report on him to you castillo said then he looked at delchamps and announced bingo bingo indeed ace delchamps said doherty turned back to kenyon you say cassidy came and spoke to you at the bar of the hotel thats right did the man in the photograph mr delchamps just showed you come with him no sir you said he said he needed a favor what kind of a favor he said he was having a little cashflow problem and that he needed to make good on a promise hed made to a mosque in philadelphia and he wanted you to wire them two million more or less from your accounts in the caledonian bank and trust limited delchamps asked he said it would just be temporary kenyon said i knew he was lying but what could i do indeed what could you do if you didnt oblige him hed tell the irs what a bad boy youd been right kenyon shrugged and nodded and besides you had fortysix million of oilforfood money in the caledonian bank and trust limited if the irs got involved youd be liable to lose that too right what do you want me to say this interview of philip j kenyon iii is terminated subject to recall at sevenfifteen pm central standard time august all parties present at the commencement were present throughout the interview doherty said then reached over and reclaimed his tape recorder from kenyons knees go to the toilet tubby castillo ordered close the door and sit on it my clothes castillo pointed to the toilet kenyon got awkwardly to his feet and walked naked down the aisle what do we do with him castillo asked when the toilet door had been closed youre asking me colonel doherty asked why not youre in the criminal business im in the terrorist business and whatever else that miserable shit is i dont think hes a terrorist hes a coconspirator doherty said and an accessory before and after the fact if you say so so what do you want to do with him anybody interested in what i think delchamps asked not that i know of castillo said seriously fuck you ace delchamps said goodnaturedly well now that youve asked for my opinion how about jack coming up with some really good interrogators and finding out what else tubby knows with these twohe nodded toward the secret service agentssuitably briefed sitting in on it to ask questions of their own transcripts of the interrogation copies of everything to ooa castillo said and they dont go near a united states attorney until we decide they should i dont like that last doherty said i didnt think you would castillo said but what does that mean we do everything that edgar said doherty said whats the risk of him getting on the phone and asking somebody for help i think we should tell him that his phones are going to be tapped and that hes going to have a secret service buddy with him day and night until were through with him and that if hes a bad boy he goes straight to the florence admax and does not pass go castillo said he looked at doherty okay doherty said and now what i mean right now we go back to midland and tonight we have dinner with my grandmother and in the morning we go to buenos aires doherty nodded castillo walked forward to the cockpit how did it go jake torine asked better than i dared hope but we have to go to buenos aires first thing in the morning i figured as much not a problem how long is it going to take us to get back to midland torine pointed at the ground as long as it takes this onelegged junior birdman to get us down from thirty thousand feet torine said weve been flying a nice big circle over north texas he looked at miller junior birdman commence a gentle descent at this time yes sir colonel sir my pleasure sir miller said and reached for the trim control xvii one aeropuerto internacional jorge newbery buenos aires argentina august it was a clear winter night in argentina and as they made their approach they could see the sea of lights that was buenos aires they could even pick out the bright yellow snake of lights of the superhighway running from the city to pilar they had left doublebarc ranch at six after an enormous breakfast dona alicia had insisted on getting up to prepare for them dick millers disappointment at not being able to go with themcastillo wanted him both to brief ambassador montvale on the interview of philip j kenyon iii and to be available at the nebraska avenue complex to deal with anything that might come upwas more than a little tempered when colonel jake torine got on the horn and arranged for another fd training flight to pick him up in midland and carry him to andrews air force base outside washington castillo concerned about yungs wounded hand had thought of trying to find some way to tactfully leave him behind in the states without killing his newfound enthusiasm for the ooa but in the end had decided that he would be needed in south america both to lend his expertise to putting the pieces together at the safe house in the mayerling country club and to deal with chief inspector ordonez in uruguay if that became necessary dinner at the doublebarc had turned out to be very pleasanteven jack doherty seemed to be having a good timealthough fernando lopez had nearly choked on his mouthful of wine when dona alicia had suddenly announced oh damn old age why didnt i think of this earlier you remember philip kenyon dont you carlos you were in the boy scouts together we ran into him at the petroleum club yesterday and if i hadnt been asleep at the switch we could have had him and his family here tonight i know he would have loved to see you as everyone had loaded into one of the secret service yukons dona alicia had handed castillo an aluminumfoilwrapped package of barbecued beef ribs for ricardo carlos she said making reference to special agent ricardo solez of the drug enforcement administration give him my love and tell him he can warm them on low in a microwave but they would be better if he could find a grill of some kind im sure we can find a grill for him abuela castillo had said on the way to the airport they passed a sams club probably because of the fivepound package of ribs in his lap food was on castillos mind anyone got a sams card he asked inspector doherty confessed that he did go back to that sams club please castillo said its already open a half hour later castillo came out of the sams club carrying two tenpound sacks of pancake flour and a gallon jug of vermont maple syrup followed by colonel torine who carried plastic packages of shorts and tshirts a two andhalfpound bag of hersheys assorted miniature chocolate bars and a lined denim jacket they had cleared customs and were off the ground at one minute past eight their first stop had been quito ecuador which was almost exactly midway between midland and buenos aires they landed there at during a very pleasant grilledchicken luncheon and looking very pleased with himself special agent yung of the fbi turned to inspector doherty of the fbi and said before we get to buenos aires inspector youd better give me your pistol why in the world would i want to do that because otherwise the argentine customs will take it away from you doesnt that apply to you too i have a diplomatic passport yung said smugly you dont twogun yungs got you jack edgar delchamps said and what about you doherty challenged ive already given him mine delchamps said if hes nice enough to sneak yours into argentina i guess well have to start calling him threegun yung they were back in the air at five hours and thirtytwo minutes later castillotrying very hard to make a perfect landingtouched down much too long and some what hard on the runway at jose newbery because of the twohour time difference jake torine told castillo i will put it in the log that we landed at local time because i am a really fine fellow who would never hurt a junior officers delicate sensibilities i will withhold critical comment on that absolutely awful landing they were met as they had been the last time by paul sieno and ricardo solez who had the same unmarked mercedesbenz traffik van and who again pretended to be argentines sent to transfer american tourists to an unnamed estancia once they were through the customs and immigration formalities and off the airfield it was different sieno was obviously a great admirer of edgar delchamps and delighted to see him two nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august as soon as he walked into the house delchamps got an equally warm reception from susanna sieno and an only slightly less enthusiastic one from alex darby castillo was not spared a welcome home max was so pleased to see him that he put his front paws on castillos chest knocked him down and then to show there were no hard feelings enthusiastically licked his face castillo was still trying to regain his feet when eric kocian came down the stairs paused halfway and announced i see my jailer has arrived forgive me for trying to keep you alive uncle billy castillo said any man who shamelessly steals the affection of another mans dog is beneath contempt kocian said eric kocian jack doherty castillo said im sure the two of you will become great buddies this is the schoolteacher with the blackboards kocian said i recognize the voice and these two inspector doherty castillo continued are inor were inyour line of work sandor tor formerly inspector of the budapest police and colonel alfredo munz former chief of argentinas side which is sort of the fbi and the cia combined i know what it is doherty said as they shook hands carlos i dont suppose you saw my family munz said oh yes castillo said as he went into his briefcase for his laptop computer and i have to tell you they will probably want to stay in the states he turned on the computer found what he was looking for and held it out to munz theres a bunch of pictures he said just push this key with the arrow for the next one munz looked at the first picture then showed it to tor it was of his daughters decked out in chefs whites including enormous billowing hats broiling steaks on a grill as senora munz and dona alicia their arms around one another like sisters smilingly watched thats my abuela alfredo castillo said munz went through the twentyodd pictures one by one then handed the computer back to castillo i think i want to kiss you carlos munz said and then kill pevsner very slowly dont do either please castillo said it would give inspector doherty the wrong idea and pevsner may not beprobably isntthe villain yung took dohertys and delchampss pistols from his briefcase and gave them back which caused darby to suggest that carrying them might become a problem but one that could probably be dealt with by making an effort to travel in an embassy car the diplomatic plates of which would guarantee immunity from spot roadside searches by the policia federal castillotrailed by maxtook two bottles of beer from the refrigerator and went to the quincho susanna sieno had told him corporal lester bradley usmc was out there on radio duty as castillo entered the quincho bradley leaped to his feet popped to attention and said good evening colonel i have the duty sir stand at ease castillo replied trying to stifle a strong urge to smile it didnt work he smiled then handed bradley a bottle of beer have a beer les when he saw that bradley was more than a little discomfited castillo went on you may wish to write this down corporal when the senior officer in the area hands you a beer and orders you to consume same you are then immunized against prosecution under the uniform code of military justice for drinking on duty yes sir thank you sir what do we hear from the states les castillo asked about an hour ago sir there was a message from major miller to be delivered to you on your arrival i passed it to sergeant major davidson sir well now that im here and davidson isnt do you think you could give it to me yes sir quote the canary is really singing end quote major miller said you would understand what it meant sir bradley said yeah i do castillo said les go getdiscreetlymr sieno mr darby sergeant major davidson sergeant kensington and mr solez ill watch the radio yes sir bradley said and headed for the door then he stopped and carefully set his beer bottle on the floor i think it would be best if i left this here sir sergeant major davidson might not understand that i have your permission to drink on duty good thinking corporal lieutenant colonel castillo said when they had all assembled castillo asked if anyone had seen anything that suggested an attack on the house or the waylaying of a car going to or from it nothing colonel davidson replied and weve looked the only thing remotely suspicious was the driver of a laundry trucka van white with eco on the panelswho seemed pretty interested in the house the second time he drove by bradley and i followed him the both of you lester chased him around the country club on a bicycle and i went just outside the gate and followed him in a beamer lester said all he did inside here was deliver and pick up laundry and dry cleaning and then i followed him when he came out he went to the eco placenear the sheraton hoteland unloaded dirty clothes and thats it he looked around at the others and there was general agreement well ive got a gut feeling that theyre going to try to whack billy kocian castillo said and the chances of that happening will multiply exponentially after i go see a man i have to go see they looked at him for clarification but he offered none ill need a weapon susanna he said is that micro uzi i borrowed in budapest still here she nodded davidson asked where we going charley were not going anywhere im going to see a guydelchamps and i are susanna sieno said colonel you heard what alex said if youre going to take that micro uzi you better take one of the embassy cars with cd plates and somebody to drive it i happen to be a very good beamer driver in case anyone cares sergeant major davidson said castillos eyebrow went up for everyones edification he said its bimmer davidson looked at him in a rare moment of confusion its what castillo shrugged and said not that it really matters but a bmw motorcyclethe thingee with two wheelsthats called a beamer or beemer with two es the fourwheel bmw is a bimmer like i said not that it matters but thats that davenport nodded and without any conviction replied right tomato towmawtoe got it castillo smiled anyway he went on i need you to hold the fort here jack castillo turned to bradley think you can handle a bmw lester sir i am certified to drive any wheeled or tracked vehicle including the ma abrams tank and the corresponding vehicleretrieval vehicles as well corporal bradley announced the question corporal was can you handle a bimmer i am confident that i can handle a bimmer and a beamer sir castillo smiled okay lester go with mr sieno anddiscreetlyget the micro uzi from her and put it in the backseat of the car she shows you and theres two sacks of pancake flour and a gallon of maple syrup in the traffik put that in the bimmer too ill be out in a minute with mr delchamps aye aye sir corporal bradley said and how many magazines sir theres only two castillo replied extra boxed ammunition sir i think the two magazines will be sufficient make sure theyre charged aye aye sir when they were out of earshot davidson said you cant help laughing at him but when you do you feel like youve just kicked a puppy yeah sergeant kensington said as for me i have a very soft spot in my heart for people who have saved my ass castillo said curiosity overwhelms me charley alex darby said whats with the pancake flour and the maple syrup aleksandr pevsner junior castillo said who is ten has acquired a taste for pancakes and maple syrup from an american classmate its hard to get here in argentina so i brought him some from the states and just told bradley to put it in the car darby said yes i did can i put that together to mean youre on your way to see this pancake loving kids daddy hes here i hope later today that ill be able to put it all together for you alex but right now pevsner has my word that i wont tell anybody where he lives that depends on pevsner wish me luck and taking delchamps with you darby asked i want edgar to tell him something i dont think hed believe coming from me i dont really know whats going on charley is that on purpose while im gone yung and doherty can bring youeverybodyup to speed castillo said i dont think ill be gone long he took what he now thought of as the argentine cellular from his briefcase pushed an autodial button and put the phone to his ear hola a voice said there you go in that heavily russianaccented spanish again castillo said in russian what do you want castillo call the gate alek and tell them to pass me in im almost there and im bringing pancake flour maple syrupa gallon of itand an old friend to see you castillo said and hung up edgar delchamps was already in the backseat of a dark blue bmw l with heavily darkened windows when castillo came around the side of the house bradley was holding the door open for castillo castillo had forgotten that max had been following him around until the dog decided the door was being held open for him and bounded into the backseat get this goddamned dog out of here delchamps said you tell him edgar castillo said you have a forceful personality maybe hell listen to you he gestured for bradley to get behind the wheel then opened the front passengers door and got in go to that shopping center off route castillo ordered bradley the one with the jumbo supermarket ill give you directions from there yes sir castillo put his arm on the back of the seat and turned to the passengers in the rear give that nice man a kiss max he said in german hes ugly and old and needs a little affection purely by coincidence of course max took that moment to take a closer look at his fellow passenger and apparently liking what he saw or perhaps what he smelled leaned over and licked his face ill get you for that castillo delchamps said three buena vista country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august turn in here lester and put your window down castillo ordered theyre determined to keep out the riffraff the bmw and its occupants were inspected at the guardhouse barrier not only by two wellarmed members of the security staff but also by janos pevsners massive bodyguard who stuck his head into the car and peered into the rear seat surpriseand more than a little concernregistered on janoss face when max showed his teeth and growled menacingly then surprise showed on castillos face when delchamps greeted janos in hungarian janos my old friend how in gods blessed name are you janos his head already out of the car nodded but didnt reply he signaled to the security guards that they could raise the barrier pole and then waved the big bmw through castillo turned to speak to delchamps is there some reason you didnt want to tell me you knew janos castillo asked i thought you had enough on your mind ace and didnt want to confuse you further what about pevsner you know him too delchamps nodded i meet a lot of people in my line of work delchamps said they were halfway to pevsners house when janos caught up with them in pevsners black mercedesbenz s then passed them aleksandr pevsner looking a member of the british landed gentryhe was wearing a barbour rainproof jacket corduroy pants a checkered shirt and a plaid woolen hatstood waiting for them under the light over his front door janos stood behind him go open the door for me lester castillo said i want him to think youre an embassy driver yes sir then get the pancake flour and maple syrup from the trunk yes sir hola alek castillo called in spanish as he got out of the car been out in the rain have you i was at the stable pevsner said hey mr respin delchamps called cheerfully in russian i knew when i saw janos that youd probably be somewhere around its been a longtime nine years pevsner replied after a long moment so long i forget what name you were using then as a matter of fact so do i delchamps replied saffery maybe i dont think that was it pevsner said what name are you using these days delchamps edgar delchamps and what about you vasily well mr delchamps while im pleased to see you after all those years youre not the old friend i expected our mutual acquaintance to have with him im sorry to have to tell you this alek castillo said but that old friend isnt at all sure youre really a friend of his why does ol charley here keep calling you alek vasily because thats my name pevsner snapped where would you like me to put this stuff sir lester bradley asked as he walked up with the maple syrup and pancake flour pevsner looked at what bradley was carrying i just happened to be passing a sams club castillo said and i remembered how much sergei and aleksandr like their pancakes and i figured what the hell give it to janos pevsner ordered hell ill carry it castillo said if janos takes it hell have to take his hand off his pistol and i know how much he hates to do that he took the flour and the gallon jug from bradley thatll be all for now bradley he said then turned to pevsner you are going to ask us in arent you alek pevsner exhaled audibly shook his head and turned around and held open the door to his house janos followed everybody inside i just remembered where it was the last time i saw you vasilyexcuse me alek delchamps said where was that pevsner said delchamps turned to castillo remember when laurent kabila was trying to overthrow mobutu sese seko in the congo charley yeah vaguely what was that ninetyseven well the good guys needed some guns so i called alek herewhat does that stand for aleksandr my name is aleksandr pevsner pevsner said icily as if you dont already know that right delchamps said so i called aleksandr here and he not only had what the good guys needed and at the right price but was prepared to dropship it for me he had just acquired his first boeing before that he hadexcuse me aleksandr but its the trutha couple maybe three really ratty wornout antonovs that i was always surprised could get off the ground castillo looked at pevsner and saw that while his face showed no emotion pevsners iceblue eyes could have burned holes in the old cia agent delchamps went on but he wanted cash on delivery aleksandr did by then i would have thought my credit was good wed done a lot of business before and hed always gotten his money and there wasnt all that much involved in this deal a couple hundred kalashnikov aks ammo a few mortars and i think there was even a dozen light caliber browning machine guns left over from vietnam right aleksandr we all know youre not here to remember the past pevsner said dare i hope this charade will soon come to an end let me finish this for charley aleksandr delchamps went on casually so what that meant was i had to go to kisanganiwhat used to be stanleyvillewith all this cash in my briefcase goddamn it charley pevsner suddenly interrupted having clearly lost his temper what have you done with alfredo munz and his family ive had all of your sick humor that i can handle the girls have been put to work in the prison kitchen castillo said they seem to have adjusted well to it would you like to see a picture if it would not be too much trouble pevsner said icily his face was still flushed but he seemed to have his temper under control could we go into the living room the pictures are in my computer i need some place to put it down you know the way pevsner said the lady holding senora munzs shoulder is my grandmother castillo said in russian when hed opened the laptop and shown pevsner how to cycle the images onscreen by using the arrow keys a minute later castillo said i should be very angry at you for even considering the possibility that i would be holding them hostage but all i am is a little sorry for you pevsner met his eyes for a long moment then said i didnt know what to think your apology is accepted castillo said and alfredo hes near here i want to talk to him he wont come here there are some questions i have to ask him and i want to do that facetoface and alone well he wont come herehe doesnt trust you alekand i wont take you to where he is the telephone wont do pevsner shook his head i need to look in his eyes castillo didnt reply he trusts you apparently pevsner said i think so do you trust me let me ask that first alek do you trust me with the caveat that we have different agendas yes i do same answer alek and now let me tell you what my agenda is i want howard kennedy let me rephrase that i am going to have howard kennedy which means what that i am going to run him down and then take him to the united states the deal we have is still on but it no longer includes howard kennedy why do you want howard kennedy for one thing i want to know what his relationship with colonel pyotr sunev wasis i dont think howard even knows who sunevis kennedy knows who sunev is delchamps said we have a very reliable source who saw him and sunev together in cozumel in that hotel you own there the grand cozumel beach and golf resort pevsner considered that carefully but didnt challenge it instead he asked and if i dont choose to give you howard kennedy you dont have any choice alek castillo said im going to have him before either of us says anything more that we both might later regret lets get back to alfredo munz youre not proposing a swap castillo asked incredulously now you owe me an apology pevsner said on several levels i dont barter away my friends both alfredo and howard are friends of mine youre going to have to convince munz of that he doesnt think so thats one of the reasons i have to see him that brings us back to step one i told you hes not going to come here i keep a suite in the sheraton the one here in pilar right off the highway near the jumbo pevsner said he waited until castillo nodded indicating he knew what he was talking about then went on i use it to accommodate business associates id rather not have in my home and will i bring alfredo to your suite in the sheraton come on alek hes my friend im not going to set him up to be whacked charley i swear before god i mean alfredo no harm i wish i could believe you castillo said but why should i because its the goddamned truth thats why what exactly do you want to ask him looking into his eyes with that penetrating stare of yours thats really none of your business it is if you want me to even ask him to put his neck in the garrote castillo said then we have a problem because i wont tell you youll have to be satisfied that i mean alfredo no harm and i am determined that he will come to no harm castillo said he has already taken a bullet for me and one is too many so i suppose our conversation is over i know youre going to tell kennedy he is no longer part of the deal i have no problem with that i can find him but anything else you do to protect him from me will nullify our whole deal you understand pevsner nodded coldly i really am sorry it came to this pevsner said i think in the long run we will both regret it i need a minute alone with you ace delchamps said before you kiss aleksandr goodbye for all time you want to take a walk for a couple of minutes alek or is there someplace we can go i will leave you alone pevsner said when you have finished ill be right outside that door you really want to walk out of here ace delchamps asked softly when the door had closed behind pevsner no i thought he would cave and he didnt but now i dont know what the hell to do next hes one tough sonofabitch delchamps said let me ask you this would munz tell you about their conversation if they had it castillo considered the question youre wondering if he would tell you all about it delchamps pursued hed tell me all about it castillo said ten seconds later well then delchamps asked how do we explain our change of mind we tell him if there is to be a meeting it has to happen right now and the reason for that is that he wouldnt have time to set up a reception for munz at the hotel those exstasi bastards are pretty good castillo said thank you sir i will want to remember that so i will write it down castillo shrugged an apology want me to handle pevsner delchamps asked and then when castillo nodded went to the door and pulled it open deal time alek he said pevsner came into the living room and looked between castillo and delchamps well colonel castillo will go this far delchamps said one he will ask colonel munz if he is willing to meet with you if munz is willing two we will tell you where to meet us and give you fifteen minutes to get there three you will come alone and if there is anything that even looks suspicious well takeoff agreed but i would like janos to drive me delchamps considered that for ten seconds then said okay janos can drive pevsner nodded lets go colonel delchamps said pevsner followed them to the door as castillo and delchamps approached the car delchamps quietly but clearly said you get in the back with that damned dog ace charley pevsner called from his doorway castillo turned to look at him thank for the flour and tree syrup pevsner said and smiled youre welcome castillo replied then got in the backseat of the bmw max licked his face four you open to suggestions as to how we do this ace delchamps asked after they had left the buena vista country club castillo nodded and delchamps offered a plan great minds castillo intoned solemnly when he had finished walk the same paths youre only saying that because you had absolutely no idea how this should be handled in a professional manner delchamps said castillo took his cellular phone from his pocket and pushed an autodial button he put the phone to his ear and after a moment said castillo alex were on our way back there eta ten minutes or less when we get there i want that traffik ready to move with solez at the wheel and munz in the back i want davidson and kensington with cars and handgunsand whizbangs if there are anyready to get into this bimmer the minute we get there delchamps and i will transfer to the traffik delchamps will need something heavier than his pistol if theres another uzi there fine put that and some whizbangs in the traffik if not a car there may be people watching who i dont want to see any of this happening do what you can about that got all that yeah i think so darby said whats going on and make sure that solez has a cellular i can call from this one both that bmw and the traffik have radios did you know that no i didnt but i dont know how to work them and theres not time to learn you dont want some company on this excursion no the rest of you go on high alert its possible that this excursion is being set up as a feint to cut down the people sitting on kocian the priority is still to keep him alive alex darby thought over what he had just been told youre not going to tell me what this is all about well one thing is to determine whether pevsner is one of the semigood guys or the unscrupulous murderous bastard most people think he is how do you think that determination will come out were about to find out castillo said then added we just turned onto route and broke the connection when they reached the safe house in the mayerling country club castillo saw that the traffik was now parked on the driveway so that it blocked a view of the main door of the house from the street and that enough room had been left between it and the shallow steps up to the door for the bmw from the street no one would be able to see the bmw les pull between the traffik and the house castillo ordered softly yes sir the door of the house was closed and castillo could see neither davidson nor kensington but when bradley had stopped the car and castillo started to open the door so that he could go in the house and see where the hell they were delchamps touched his arm and pointed toward the traffik the rear door was open and davidson looked as if he was quickly prepared to jump into the bmw castillo waved him off theres more room in the van castillo said delchamps opened his door and ran around the front of the bmw and quickly got into the traffik no max castillo ordered sternly and reached around the dog and opened the rear door max looked at both open doors decided they had been opened for him and that he had misunderstood castillothat what castillo had really said was go max oh shit castillo said then slid across the seat and followed max into the van he saw that alfredo munz was seated in the third row of seats were going to meet aleksandr pevsner castillo said they expect usdelchamps munz and meto be in the bimmer so well be in this if they hit the bmwa real possibilityjust get the hell out of the line of fire if anybody is here theyre probably exstasi and therefore good at what they do and while i would really like to take them out a firefight with bodies lying all over would cause all sorts of problems i dont need where do you think theyre going to hit us colonel jack davidson asked on the road somewhere the highway lets find out castillo said and took out his cellular punched an autodial button and then the speakerphone button hola pevsners voice loudly came over the phone you really ought to work on getting rid of the russian accent castillo said you really sound funny well tell me more about this suite of yours in the sheraton castillo said alfredo has agreed to meet me with me no im thinking of taking a suite in the hotel myself castillo said and thought id have a look at yours first its on the fourth floor pevsner said there is a stairway then the elevators and is the second door on the right and who would be in if i decided to call no one may i make a proposal go ahead you tell me when you can be there and i will get there ten minutes before you do there is a basement garage people have been known to get whacked in basement garages there is also an outside parking garage but people going to and from it are far more visible than those using the basement garage your choice thats your proposal i will have janos check out the suite or he and i will check it out and then there is a lobby bar if you park outside walk across the lobby and there it is if you park in the basement there is an elevator take it to the lobby floor and then turn right janos will go there and bring you to the suite you will come to the bar castillo said all right i can leave here in five minutes and it will take me twenty minutes to get there castillo said thank you and tell alfredo i said thank you twentyfive minutes alek be there castillo said and broke the connection its only ten minutes from here to the sheraton karl munz said in german i know castillo said as soon as davidson and kensington get in the bimmer well go to the basement parking garage in this jack you wait five minutes and then you go there tell bradley to drive slowly im not sure bradley knows where the hotel is carlos solez said in spanish good in case somebodys watching let them see him looking for it as if he doesnt know where it is castillo said when you get to the basement park somewhere where we can get out in a hurry pevsner probably will be in a big black mercedes an s operative word probably got it davidson said im a little confused charley are you going to be in that bar or what not on your life if pevsner shows up when hes supposed to in the basement garage the minute he gets out of it well get out and join him and go right to his suite thats when well really have to have our back covered got it davidson repeated okay you two get in the bmw davidson and kensington moved to the car kensington returned to hand castillo a small package just as solez was starting the engine castillo opened it it was the micro uzi and its magazines not to worry ace delchamps said everybody gets a little forgetful once in a while especially when they get older castillo chose not to respond instead he said dont get us pinched for speeding ricardo but the sooner we get there the better castillo had seen the sheraton pilar hotel before and remembered where it was but he had never paid much attention to it now he wanted to drive real slow when you get close to the hotel ricardo he ordered solez missed the turn off of route they now would have to go to the next exit by the jumbo shopping center cross the highway on an overpass and approach the hotel by a service road castillo kept himself from snapping at solez and was glad he had when he realized that it was probably a good thing solez had missed the turn now theyd have a chance to look over the hotel and the approaches to it more slowly as they came close to the sheraton pilar hotel and convention center a fairly new brickwalled structure four or five stories high castillo saw in a line of small businesses a glassfronted store with eco laundry and dry cleaning on the window there were two white vans like the one davidson had told him bradley had chased around mayerling on his bicycle hell better safe than sorry davidson did the right thing when they turned into the hotels driveway two hundred yards later castillo saw that the outside parking lot pevsner had mentioned was to the left of the main entrance to the atrium lobby to the right was another entrance that looked deserted that one castillo decided after a moment was obviously the convention entrance to the hotel and convention center there was a small sign with an arrow pointing to the underground garage there was a rather steep down ramp when solez took a timestamped parking ticket from a machine at the bottom a fragilelooking barrier pole rose giving them access that barrier wouldnt keep anybody out of here but it probably sets off an alarm if somebody goes through it the lowceilinged garage was not crowded maybe fifty sixty vehicles there was room for at least twice that many cars strange its the dinner hour it should be nearly full answer this garage was designed to handle convention traffic obviously there is no convention tonight circle it once ricardo castillo ordered and then park over there he pointed to a spot which would give them quick access to the exit ramp another fraillooking barrier pole guarded that obviously ricardo is going to pay that ticket the machine gave him or have it stamped or whatever to get that barrier pole to rise if we have to leave here in a hurry so long barrier pole and off goes the alarm there was near one end of the garage another white eco laundry and drycleaning truck backed up to what was probably a service elevator large white clothsided wheeled baskets were clustered around the truck this place is nice but its not the mgm grand in las vegas withwhat did i hearsome five thousand rooms it probably makes more economic sense for the hotel to have the local laundry do the sheets and towels as necessary rather than running its own laundry when solez had backed the traffik into the spot castillo had picked he saw that it had been a lucky choice it gave him a pretty good view of most of the garage he could see the down ramp and the opening of a passageway with signs and an arrow pointing to the elevator now we wait delchamps said this is the part i love best about this job you think hes going to come castillo asked come yeah delchamps said but with who and with what purpose in mind ricardo i dont suppose you have a leash a what for max i think he needs to take a leak walk him up the exit ramp and then when you come back walk him around the garage before you come back to the van lets see what he smells solez didnt reply id do it myself ricardo but these people might know me or at least have a description of me and youre an unknown quantity ill have to use my belt solez said max go with ricardo castillo ordered five minutes later solez and max got back in the van when we walked past the laundry truck solez reported max got real antsy it was all i could do to hold him maybe he doesnt like the smell of dirty laundry delchamps said and maybe he smelled guns he doesnt like that smell when the bimmer gets here ill give davidson a headsup why dont you do that now ace delchamps said because jack davidson is a devout believer in the preemptive strike well tell him to behave youre a colonel you can do that castillo pushed an autodial button on his cellular were about two minutes out colonel davidson answered lester missed the turn theres an eco laundry truck down here it may be picking up laundry but max smelled something he didnt like just be aware its there no repeat no preemptive strike jack understood yes sir two minutes later the big dark blue bmw rolled off the down ramp delchamps and castillo readied their weapons there had not been another uzi available so darby had provided a car two of them castillo thought as solez picked one from the floor of the van and worked the action the bmw circled the parking garage and backed into a space across from them nothing happened castillo called bradley on his cellular and hit the speakerphone button lester he said quietly go into the hotel take a look around the corner and see if you see pevsner or his gorilla or anybody interesting at the bar yes sir sir if i may say so that will also serve to suggest to the person in the cashiers office that i am notifying someone their car is available and alleviate any suspicion of my sitting here very good lester youre absolutely right castillo hit the cellulars end button then chuckled and shook his head dont be smug ace delchamps said the kid is right he usually is castillo said i didnt even think about the cashier nothing happened in the next four minutes which seemed like much longer lesters back solez said pointing as bradley walked back toward the bmw and theres pevsner and janos the gorilla delchamps said nodding toward the mercedesbenz on the down ramp so he did show give them a chance to park the car and get out of it and then well join them castillo said hey there alek small world isnt it the big black mercedes circled the garage the heavily darkened windows of the bmw would permit him to see only lester which he would expect to do but the same was true of the mercedes when it rolled past the traffik castillo could see only janos not into the rear seat janos showed no interest in the traffik well what does that mean maybe janos is the stalking horse and pevsners not in the backseat janos backed the mercedes into a spot close to the parking garage cashiers office and the tunnel to the hotel he got out walked around to the right side of the car and opened the rear door aleksandr pevsner got out and started walking toward the tunnel with janos three steps behind there was suddenly the sound of submachine gunfire very loud in the lowceilinged garage castillo saw where it was coming from there were orange flashes from three maybe four muzzles beside the white eco laundry truck oh shit castillo said as he jumped out of the traffik he saw that pevsner was down sprawled flat on the floor and that janos was sitting down pistol in hand bleeding from at least one wound in his side and looking dazed castillo emptied the micro uzi in two bursts directed in the general direction of the eco truck and reached for a second magazine then came fire from the other side of the eco laundry van the peculiar familiar sound of a car being fired in short controlled bursts of three to five rounds each who the hell is that davidson or kensington one of them mustve got out of the car to cover the laundry truck then immediatelybefore alfredo munz carrying a pistol could get out of the traffikthere came the sound of more short bursts from a car in the vicinity of the bmw and then the familiar report of a a colt semiautomatic the was being fired steadily but some what slowly suggesting aimed fire from a skilled pistoleer all down a voice that only after a moment castillo recognized as that of sergeant major jack davidson called out hold fire as castillo his ears ringing madly ran to see what had happened to pevsner he saw davidson runningcarefullytoward the eco van with his car at the ready janos still sitting holding his pistol looked at castillo without comprehensionthen fell over castillo dropped to his knees and felt for a pulse there was one where the hell is pevsner max answered the question the big dog was growling deep in his throat and trying unsuccessfully to get under the mercedes come out of there with your hands up a very sincereif some what youthfulvoice ordered from behind castillo castillo turned to see corporal lester bradley holding a a colt in both hands aimed at the underside of the mercedes well now i know who that skilled timedfiring pistoleer was okay max castillo ordered in hungarian sit max visibly reluctant to do so sat but did not stop growling his lips were drawn tight against a very impressive row of massive teeth come out alek castillo called when max saw movement he stood up goddamn it max sit aleksandr pevsner appeared hands up goddamn it bradley ordered pevsner got to his knees then to his feet and raised both hands in the air there is fear on ol aleks face but whats scaring him max or the boy with the pointed at his forehead so far hes managed not to get shot hes okay bradley castillo said then saw the dog moving again max sit can you control that animal so i can go to janos pevsner asked go ahead castillo said pointing a finger at max and mouthing stay is he dead pevsner asked as he dropped to his knees beside janos not as of thirty seconds ago castillo said davidson came running up all down colonel five of them davidson reported i knew goddamned well that goddamned eco laundry truck was dirty now what now you help me get this guy in the traffik castillo ordered and then you get kensington in the bmw and get the hell out of here ill take janos to the safe house he looked across the garage intending to signal solez to get in the truck and saw that the truck was already in motion but headed for the eco van not them help me get janos in the car pevsner pleaded ive got to get him to a hospital please take a look at it alek the mercedes isnt going anywhere castillo said and we cant take him to a hospital with bullet wounds the mercedes was apparently only lightly armored while the cabin was mostly intact the headlights and hood were bulletriddled two tiresclearly not runflat modelswere punctured and flattened there was the smell of gasoline and the front windshield and left side windows were crazed whats going on down there davidson asked nodding in the direction of the eco van i think delchamps is taking pictures and collecting dna samples and whatever else he can find that looks useful look what i found davidson said holding up a bluedsteel garrote castillo shook his head slowly at the sight alfredo munz came up i need to talk to you alfredo pevsner said doesnt this speak for itself munz said youve been betrayed alek and you know by who i had my suspicions pevsner said i didnt want to accept them would you have believed me if i told you munz asked almost sadly bradley go tell solez i need the traffik right here right now castillo ordered at that moment the traffik started toward them what we are going to do is load janos in the traffik and get him and us the hell out of here castillo said im surprised the cops arent here already the garage is soundproofed munz said professionally and the poor girl in the cashiers office is going to cower in her little cubicle and do nothing whatever until she is sure we are gone and the police are here and she will tell them that she saw nothing for fear well be back we have another minute perhaps until someone finishes dinner and comes for their car sergeant robert kensington came running up and dropped to his knees beside janos whats he doing pevsner asked whatever he can to keep janos alive munz said hes a medical soldier janos needs a hospital a surgical doctor pevsner pursued who will ask questions munz said kensington can treat him alek he took a bullet from my shoulder your call alek castillo said evenly you can stay here and wring your hands over janos and deal with the cops or you can help us get him in the van in thirty seconds were out of here pevsner met castillos eyes for a moment then moved to janos putting him in an erect position so that it would be easier to pick him up thirty seconds later janos was stretched across the rear row of seats sergeant kensington was applying a pressure dressing to janoss side watch your feet delchamps called i grabbed two madsens and theyre still loaded ten seconds after castillo and max got in the front seat and closed the door solez drove the traffik to the exit ramp and took out the fragile barrier as he went up castillo heard an alarm bell start ringing fifteen seconds later they were in the onehundredthirtykilometerperhour lane of route headed south castillo turned to look out the rear window the bmw was following them he looked at delchamps what else did you find at the laundry van ill tell you later delchamps said if as seems highly likely we shortly find ourselves chatting with half a dozen of pilars finest law enforcement officers it will be better if you dont know five nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august castillo pevsner and delchamps leaned against the wall of one of the downstairs bedrooms watching as us army special forces medic sergeant robert kensington finished bandaging janos the bed had been raised three feet off the floor on concrete blocks to make a perfectly serviceable operating table bullets are like booze kensington observed professionally the larger the bodyunless of course the bullets hit something importantthe less effect they have and we have here a very large body janos feeling the effects of three of kensingtons happy pills agreed cheerfully oh yes he said i am much larger than most men perhaps not as smart but indeed larger pevsner said fondly castillo and delchamps chuckled pevsners cellular buzzed he looked at its screen to see who was calling and then pointed to the french doors leading from the room to the backyard may i he asked sure castillo said pevsner left the room and walked to the center of the backyard with the cellular to his ear the floodlights which normally illuminated the backyard had been turned off but there was still enough light from the house and the quincho so that he could be seen clearly castillo and delchamps left the bedroom and stood on the tilepaved patio when pevsner took the cellular from his ear they walked to pevsner anna and the children are pleased that i am impulsively taking them to our place in san carlos de bariloche for a little skiing pevsner said anna is concerned that they will lose a few days in school but under the circumstances i understand castillo said they are en route to the jorge newbery airfield by car pevsner went on i have arranged for a lear to fly us to bariloche now if i can further impose on your hospitality there is something else id like you to do for me which is castillo asked i dont want anna and the children to see janos in his present condition of course and janosdespite his present very good humoris really not in shape to fly halfway across argentina there is a place not very far from here that is both safe and where he can recuperate in peace what i would like to do is have the ranger pick us up not here castillo interrupted sorry of course not pevsner said please let me continue my friend okay continue there are eight polo fields at the argentine polo association on the north of pilar do you know where i mean castillo shook his head right off route pevsner said i would like to rendezvous with the ranger there on the most remote of the polo fields take janos to the place i mentioned then have the ranger take me to jorge newbery to meet my family would you carry us to the polo association when right now if that would be possible castillo exhaled audibly then he said set it up please edgar lead car traffik trail car shooters in everything ill ride with alek and janos in the traffik delchamps nodded and walked toward the house thank you friend charley pevsner said i am greatly in your debt castillo shrugged can i give him some money aleksandr pevsner asked castillo looked at him and saw that he was looking toward the house where kensington was leaning against the wall outside his operating room puffing on a cigar you mean sergeant kensington castillo asked your doctor i am very grateful for what he did for janos i would like to show my appreciation giving sergeant kensington moneyhow do i put thiswould be like slipping your priest a few bucks for granting you absolution except that if you tried kensington would probably rearrange your face so you would remember not to make that particular faux pas again please tell him i consider myself in his debt and if there is anything i can ever do for him tell him yourself alek castillo said hell be in the traffik with us and janos he paused chuckled and went on but as a shooter he has pretty much given up his medical career similarly my friend charley i am deeply in your debt and not solely for saving my life you can pay that debt by staying out of my way while im running down our great mutual friend howard kennedy i want him alek if i knew where he was id tell you i want him without a beauty hole in his forehead you understand that with great difficulty pevsner said nodding slowly there is only one suitable punishment for a man who enters your life dishonestly and gains your confidence and affection got a little egg on your face do you alek i beg your pardon aleksandr pevsner that great judge of character trusted the wrong guy and mistrusted the good guy good guys plural im not familiar with the expression you know what i mean alek i am where i am today because i by where you are today i guess you mean hiding under your mercedes from your good friends in the fsb while they tried to whack you pevsners face tightened if that was the case no if about it alek edgar delchamps knew one of the guys in the laundry truck lieutenant colonel yevgeny komogorov deputy to colonel pyotr sunev director of the fsbs service for the protection of the constitutional system and the fight against terrorism pevsner glared at him thats a mouthful isnt it castillo asked service for the protection of the constitutional system and the fight against terrorism and i guess they define terrorist as anyone who might be able to identify former lieutenant colonel putin of the kgb as just one more maggot in the oilforfood scam if putin was involved in that i dont know about it sunev and the late colonel komogorov must have thought you did otherwise why did they try to whack you pevsner didnt reply and to whack you sunev didnt send some secondrate cubanhe sent komogorov pevsner stared icily at castillo for a long moment howard kennedy is not stupid pevsner said finally he knew that you were sooner or later going to suspect him of tiesor find ties as you did in factwith the fsb and that if you did you would probably tell me i think its entirely possible that he told sunev that we were becoming too close exchanging information and after all kennedy had been really working for sunev all along hadnt he getting paidbetter paid obviouslyto provide just that sort of information i paid howard well but nothing like nearly sixteen million dollars pevsner said the first suspicion i had of howardand of course i felt guilty about having itwas when he was so upset about those bank drafts you took from lorimers safe he acted almost as if you had stolen the money from him i really hope i did castillo said i think he had a deal with the cuban the cuban would shut lorimers mouth take the bank drafts give them to howard and they would split the proceeds and you ruined this plan for him charley i want him alek what will happen to him after you interrogate him ive given that some thought the first one i had was to have him sent to a really terrible prison in colorado where the prisoners spend twentythree hours a day in solitary cells with no contact with other prisoners but then an fbi friend of mine said that all we could convict him of is stealing fbi investigation reports that would put him away for fivetoten maybe hed be out in a couple of years so youll just i would like to but we dont operate that way what i think ill try to arrange for him is to be sent to a mediumsecurity prison where he would be in what they call the general population unpleasant things happen to former fbi agents in the general population therere even rumors that they get raped regularly there was a shrill whistle and they looked toward the house where edgar delchamps was standing in the door to the living room he was signaling that the convoy was ready one last time alek castillo said dont get in my way if i find him before you do ill tell you where he is somehow the notion of howard being regularly traded as a sexual commodity seems a fitting consequence for his actions they started walking toward the house six nuestra pequena casa mayerling country club pilar buenos aires province argentina august what castillo thought of as the philosophers as opposed to the shooters were gathered in the quincho the main room of which looked very much like a schoolroom complete to blackboards a teacher and nine overage eighthgraders raising their hands for permission to offer the teacher their deep thoughts the teacher was fbi inspector jack doherty the philosophers were special agent yung eric kocian alex darby colonel alfredo munz and mr and mr paul sieno also present was colonel jake torine who was included not so much for his knowledge of the situation but for his brains castillo and delchamps sat in although both regarded themselves far more as shooters than philosophers and there was the class pet who lay asleep with his head on castillos shoe and from time to time made strange pleased sounds which castillo thought might be because he was dreaming of a shapely bouvier des flandres of the opposite gender corporal lester bradley technically a shooter was manning the radio with instructions to tell anyone who called from washington that colonel castillo was momentarily unavailable but would get back to them as soon as possible there were still a lot of pieces to fit together and castillo didnt want to interrupt that process the shooterssergeant major davidson sergeant kensington sandor tor and ricardo solezwere on perimeter guard duty no less efficient because they were seated comfortably in strategically placed upholstered chairs edgar delchamps not only approved the perimeter guard but suggested that castillo recruit more shooters for it he said that he trusted aleksandr pevsner about half as far as he could throw him visavis not revealing the location of the safe house and pointing out that pevsner was now aware that just about everybody with knowledge was gathered in one place which made it one hell of a rich target for somebody who wanted mouths shut permanently delchamps also volunteered the hope that castillo was not holding his breath waiting for pevsner to tell him anything about the location of howard kennedy the race was onand in high goddamned gearif castillo wanted to get the sonofabitch before pevsner did castillo was of two minds professionally he agreed with delchampsand just about everybody elsethat pevsner couldnt be trusted and wouldnt hesitate to have them all killed to protect himselfor perhaps more important to reduce or remove a threat to his family personally castillo trusted pevsner at least to a degree but obviously he had to go with his professional judgment when his cellular went off he had just about decided that school was going to be in session for a weekor longerand to tell bradley to get dick miller at the nebraska avenue complex on the horn and to tell miller to call either general bruce j mcnab or vic dallessando at bragg and tell them to get a tenman ateam on the next flight out of miamiput em in civvies and tell em to make like theyre soccer playersand yeah we have weapons here hola castillo said to his phone you on the other hand sound like a porteno his caller said so hows the skiing very nice thank you our friend is in at the conrad in punta del este youre sure castillo said but after a moment he realized he was talking to a broken connection delchamps looked at him with a question in his eyes o ye of little faith castillo said and turned to yung whats the conrad in punta del este fancy hotel fanciest with a casino is there an airport there yeah jake could we take the gulfstream from here to wherever punta del este is in uruguay on the atlantic about a hundred kilometers from montevideo yung furnished and then to quito without refueling no problem what do you plan to do about immigration worry about that when we get to the states castillo said he stuck out his tongue at delchamps made a loud humming sound then said you can interpret thatits the best i can doas sounding boots and saddles kennedy is in room of the conrad and were going to go get him who we delchamps asked you munz me and twogun castillo said alex can you get on a secure line and tell the cia guy in montevideowhats his name robert howell darby replied bob howell to meet us with a carbetter yet a yukon or at least a van something bigat the punta del este airport and that were leaving right now do i tell him why no just that its important max happily trotted after castillo as he headed for the quincho door not this time pal castillo said he could hear max barking and whining even after hed entered the big house and headed for the driveway seven punta del este airport punta del este republica oriental del uruguay august robert howell the cultural attache of the us embassy was waiting for them at the small but wellequipped airport with a blue yukon displaying diplomatic tags castillo introduced delchamps to himhowell knew who delchamps was but had never met himthen explained what he intended to do grab howard kennedy bring him back to the airport and fly him to the states with only a fuel stop in quito id like to have you in on this but if it would make things awkward for you just give us the truck and come back in two hours if were lucky ill leave the key under the mat howell said im in we may need my diplomatic carnet if theres trouble all they can do is expel me as persona non grata thank you how do we get him out of the hotel and into the truck lets make sure hes there first then worry about that delchamps said our noble leader is placing a lot of faith where im not at all sure it belongs castillo ignored him how come this place looks so deserted castillo asked theres nothing here but a couple of light twins and some cessna s its winter howell said punta del este is just about closed in the winter wait till we get downtown ten minutes later castillo could see a long line of highrise apartment buildings overlooking a wide nicelooking beach when they came close to the apartments however he was surprised at what he found the blinds were drawn behind almost all of the apartment windows there were few cars on the street and even fewer in the parking lots under the highrise buildings and only a very few people on the streets this is almost surreal castillo thought five minutes after that the conrad came into view an imposing structure castillo guessed was twenty stories high they keep this open for the gamblers howell said but id say its not even onequarter full he turned off the road and drove up the driveway well theres activity here delchamps said why does that make me feel uneasy the parking area in front of the main door of the resort was crowded with vehicles with the exception of two stretch limousines and a volkswagen bug they were all police vehicles of one description or another why do i think going back to the airport would be a good idea delchamps asked oh lets go play the slots castillo said i feel lucky well i suppose its remotely possible that somebody tried to knock off the casino and the entire uruguayan police force has responded delchamps said and opened his door they walked up a wide flight of marble stairs and were halfway across the lobby when a voice called alfredo everybody stopped a man was quickly walking toward them i am not as happy to see you my friend chief inspector jose ordonez said as he wrapped munz in a bear hug and kissed his cheek as i would be if you were alone he looked at the others and my friend david yung and mr howell of the culture department of the american embassy how nice to see you both again he turned to castillo and delchamps and put his hand out to delchamps colonel castillo im chief inspector jose ordonez of the federal police and ive been looking forward to meeting you my name is smith delchamps said no hable espanol ordonez smiled at him and shook his hand im castillo castillo said jose ordonez colonel ordonez replied offering his hand if i may say so youre very young to have done all the things people say you have done i try to live clean castillo said what did we do walk in on a police convention i suppose it does look like a convention doesnt it ordonez said but sadly no we are all here on duty one of your countrymen has run into some difficulty you dont say i was just about to call your embassy and tell them but since mr howell and mr yung are here i can dispense with that ill show them the problem if its all right with them the rest of you may come along he gestured toward the elevator bank and they all got in the door from the corridor opened into the living room of suite one wall was mostly glass and offered a view of the punta del este downtown skyline and the atlantic ocean there were two men sitting in highbacked upholstered chairs one of them who looked as if he had slipped down in the chair had his mouth open the back of the chair behind him was matted with blood and brain tissue the other man was howard kennedy he had been strapped into his chair with duct tape there was something in his mouth either a red ball or a ball of another color now covered with blood his eyes were wideopen his body seemed strangely limp and after a moment when he saw kennedys hands castillo understood it would seem ordonez said matteroffactly that mr kennedy was beaten to death not with a baseball bat or something like that but with a piece of angle iron they started with his toes then his feet then his shins and then changed to his fingers hands wrists etcetera you can tell by the blood pattern it must have taken some time for them to finish we believe this man to be howard kennedy thats howard kennedy castillo said was howard kennedy were not sure who the other man is ordonez said thats lieutenant colonel viktor zhdankov delchamps furnished of the fsbs service for the protection of the constitutional system and the fight against terrorism thats not what his passport says senor smith ordonez said it says hes a czech businessman then im obviously wrong delchamps said i really hope so ordonez said what we have here is bad enough an american businessman and a czech businessman murdered during a robbery even if that robbery as has been suggested was part of a drug deal that went wrong that would pose far fewer problems for meand indeed for uruguayif i had to start investigating the murders of a senior ksb officer and a man known to have close ties to an international outlaw by the name of aleksandr pevsner you understand i think so delchamps said i am really sorry to have subjected you to this i fully understand that it ruined your holiday and has caused you to feel that you have to leave uruguay immediately and not to return until this terrible memory has had time to fade the man has a point ace delchamps said chief inspector ordonez castillo said offering his hand may i ask you one question before i leave certainly i read something in the papers about some bodiessix i recallbeing found on an estancia somewhere here in uruguay what was that all about our investigation concluded that was another drug deal that went wrong such an ugly business yet so common the estancia owner apparently led a dual life as a drug dealer i frankly doubt if well ever be able to make an arrest the case is closed for all practical purposes thank you very much not at all he said pumping castillos hand perhaps well meet again under happier circumstances any friends of my dear friend alfredo so to speak are friends of mine id like that castillo said eight the restaurant kansas avenida libertador san isidro buenos aires province argentina august castillo waved the waiter over and called for the check why dont you let me take care of that ambassador juan manuel silvio said i can charge it to my representation allowance your pockets sir are nowhere near as deep as those of the lorimer charitable trust but thank you anyway im really grateful to you for coming all the way out here to meet with us this is argentina the only other place you could have eaten before eight would have been one of the places in the port or a mcdonalds not to ask a rude question but isnt this the place where they snatched mr masterson delchamps asked in the parking lot silvio said pointing so in a way this is ending where it began i suppose but its not ended castillo said mastersons murderers for all i know are still running around free but some of their peers and their superiors are no longer with us are they silvio said and some have left us under circumstances god forgive me that i consider entirely appropriate castillos cellular buzzed now what he muttered he took the phone from his pants pocket hola he said into it im sorry i had to go back on my word friend charley you sonofabitch you told me i could have him he knew too much about me to have him talking to you charley fuck you alek and besides i decided that five years of regular rape was not sufficient punishment for his betrayal of me fuck you again there was a moments silence before pevsner went on coolly let me tell you what ive done and why should i believe anything you tell me hear what i have to say and then you can decide i spoke with sunev and told him that i have deposited with certain people envelopes that will be sent to the cia in the event i even suspect he has sent anyone near me my family or anyone involved in the recent events we have shared and whats in the envelopes oh im sure you can make a good guess friend charley goddamn you alek well be in touch pevsner said and then the change in the background noise told castillo that pevsner had broken the connection castillo punched his autodial button for pevsner but got a recorded message saying that the telephone number called was no longer in service he put the phone back in his pocket i hope you appreciate mr ambassador delchamps said that you are in the presence of the only man in the world who can tell aleksandr pevsner to fuck himself twice in thirty seconds and probablyoperative word probablylive until the morning silvio laughed are we going to see more of you mr delchamps if youre coming back to work with the others maybe i could be of some assistance someplace to live etcetera thats very kind of you sir but im going to spend the next couple of months trolling through the basement at langley twogun here will be coming back though im going to take these two with me when i go face ambassador montvale castillo said in numbers there is strength but if you want to be useful see what you can do about keeping twogun here out of trouble upon his return it will be my pleasure now we have to get a cab nonsense ambassador silvio said ill take you out to your jet nine office of the chief office of organizational analysis department of homeland security nebraska avenue complex washington dc august well castillo said that went pretty well i think ace you didnt say a word that the president was going to come with montvale that was just too much to spring on an old man except of course that he turned a deaf ear to my suggestion that it was time for me to return to being a simple soldier you might as well forget that ace he likes things the way they are yeah yung agreed the part i liked was when he said its a shame to leave all that oilforfood money in that fellow kenyons account its not right that he be allowed to keep it isnt there some way we could add it to ooa operating funds castillo said i hope you werent just running off at the mouth when you chirped not a problem mr president no problem at all yung said you want me to go to dallas and do that before i go back down there absolutely and you can catch a direct flightamerican i thinkfrom dallas to buenos aires but before you go to dallas theres something really important i want you to do what get on the net and google for a breeder of bouvier des flandres in the dallas area for a what delchamps asked max is a bouvier des flandres i thought you knew and yung asked buy the best breedable bitch availablecost is not a factormake sure her papers are in order and take her with you to pilar i actually think youre serious delchamps said i dont know how things are done in the spook world castillo said but in the army when someone saves your ass the least you can do for him is get him laid he looked at yung and added tell billy kocian i want pick of the litter ill be goddamned delchamps said smiling twogun tell kocian i get second choice
