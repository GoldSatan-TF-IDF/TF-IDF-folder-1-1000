peninsula you have given me a great honor that i will never forget and to all the men and women who serve your commitment and sacrifice is something that i think of every day prelude washington dc october the motorcade rumbled down the cobblestone street three motorcycles led the way followed by a dc police squad two secret service sedans and then two identical limousines after the limousines came the suburbans and more sedans it was an impressive sight especially when one considered that the two men being protected had yet to win the white house however earlier in the week a fringe terrorist group had announced their intent to disrupt the upcoming election and the secret service had no choice but to take the threat seriously mark ross sat in the back seat of the second limousine and massaged his forehead a monster headache was building from the base of his brain and slowly spreading to the front he tried to block out the incessant chatter of the man sitting next to him while at the same time wondering just how in the hell he had gotten himself into this mess he would have been better off staying in the senate where he had real power it was power though that had gotten him here or at least the promise of it the relationship was cracking there was no doubt about it it had always been an arranged marriage of sorts they each had their strengths and weaknesses and for the most part they didnt overlap it was explained to them by the power brokers and gatekeepers that they would complement each other perfectly on paper it all looked perfect a real marriage made in heaven if they had bothered to read any of the classic greek tragedies though they would have known that the gods could be very cruel especially when it came to the hubris of men ross had naturally been aware of josh alexander all along alexander the upandcoming star of the democratic party was governor of georgia the old white men who ran the party had finally got it through their heads that a northeast liberal was simply unelectable their only real chance of winning was to draft a southern governor who believed in jesus christ this way they could split the bible belt vote and steal enough red states to win it all alexander was the obvious choice he was handsome smart and polished and his wifes family had more money than most thirdworld countries his only drawback was his relative youth at fortyfive he was deemed a touch green and definitely weak on foreign affairs his early polling numbers suggested that people werent sure he would be a strong enough leader in the war on terror that was where mark ross came in a threeterm senator from connecticut ross was the new director of national intelligence he had a reputation as one of the more hawkish democrats in washington in a normal national election the two men would have never ended up as running mates this election however had been turned on its ear when the current president announced that he had parkinsons disease and would not be seeking a second term with only a year to go before the general election the party was caught flatfooted the primary season was upon them and the only real candidate they had was vice president sherman baxter iii everybody including the president agreed that baxter would be a disaster he was perhaps the most marginalized vice president in the history of the republic and that was saying a lot the mans approval rating in his home state of california was below thirty percent a lot of things could have been ignored but not that number the party elders pulled him aside and told him it was the end of the road having been confronted with his limits and deficiencies for the last three years the man did not put up a fight ross in the meantime worked feverishly behind the scenes he was well connected on wall street regarded highly by his old club the us senate and savvy enough to know not to throw his hat in the ring too early he waited until new hampshire when alexander walked away as the clear frontrunner then he began networking pushing the idea that the young governor needed a running mate who had some gravitas in the national security arena he sent his surrogates to lobby on his behalf he personally wined and dined the partys big money people and he carefully began to court the handsome young governor from georgia everything fell into place exactly as ross had wished when he took the stage at the national convention the place erupted they hit the ground with a bounce and an eightpoint lead that had been three months ago the pinnacle the apogee of the campaign since then theyd been bleeding like a stuck pig with two weeks until election day they trailed their opponents by three points and ross was feeling the pressure their pollsters kept coming back with the same problem voters perceived the pair as weaker than their opponents on national security this was where ross was supposed to step in and fill the breach but how could he have known the president would leave them high and dry the man had abandoned them in their hour of need yes he had endorsed them but what in the hell else was he going to do endorse the republican ticket campaigning on their behalf was assumed it was all part of the battle plan he would help them raise the millions of dollars it would take to win the tv ad race he would step in and use that bully pulpit to announce his confidence in the young candidate and his seasoned running mate but all they got was silence and a cold shoulder the press was told that the presidents disease was taking a toll on him and he simply didnt have the energy to campaign his obligation was to his office and the american people ross believed the excuse for a few days and then reality set in word had gotten back to him through two solid sources that the president had a real problem with the ticket he was offended that no one had bothered to consult him as to who alexander should pick as a running mate beyond that the president made it clear that he considered ross the wrong choice the words had stung ross to the core but he had since written them off as the musings of a bitter old man at the end of his journey true to his neverquit attitude ross redoubled his efforts and stayed positive this morning however he was feeling a sense of dread there were only two weeks left and the polls could move only so far in such a short period of time they needed a real october surprise to put them over the top and then ross would take great pride in sticking it in the presidents face on inauguration day as the motorcade slowed the lead vehicles began peeling off ross looked through the tinted bulletproof window at the media who had gathered in front of the mansion the heavy black iron gate opened and the two limousines pulled into the narrow circular drive dumbarton oaks was a twentytwoacre estate in georgetown that was noteworthy for hosting a conference in that led to the formation of the united nations it was rosss idea that they host a national security conference at the estate and bring in the greatest minds to discuss the issues that threatened the country a former chairman of the joint chiefs was on hand as well as two former secretaries of state a former secretary of defense several retired cia directors a few lesserknown generals and a smattering of middle eastern experts and muslim clerics from around the world after the threehour event they were to head to the vice presidents house at the naval observatory the vice president was set to host a diplomatic reception on their behalf all of the important ambassadors would be there and both ross and alexander would present them with their vision for security peace and prosperity in the twentyfirst century the event should have been held at the white house but they had been denied the entire electionhellhis entire political career was going to come down to this one afternoon if he believed in god he would have said a prayer but he didnt so he cursed the president instead the limo came to a stop and ross looked his yammering campaign manager in the eye for the first time in five minutes stu ross checked to make sure his tie was straight shut up youre giving me a headache with that ross stepped from the back of the limo he buttoned his suit coat with one hand and waved to the reporters and photographers with the other he was about to comment on how beautiful a day it was when the whole gaggle swung their lenses and microphones away from him ross turned to see the tanned and slender legs of jillian rautbort alexander emerge from the other limousine the press loved her they called her america s diana her likebility number was in the seventies far higher than either of the candidates she was a stunning beauty in every conceivable way she was five foot nine with shoulderlength blond hair and a body to die for shed been raised among the super elite schooled in switzerland and then brown where her father had gone the familys fortune was in real estate and lots of it new york and florida was where they had made their killing there were homes in paris manhattan and palm springs at thirtysix jillian was one of those rare women who got better with age she drew men into her orbit without having to bat an eye or flash a smile she was gorgeous classy and hot all at the same time ross had thought about taking a run at her on more than one occasion she was no vestal virgin that was for sure but a real opportunity never presented itself josh alexander joined his wife and the flashes erupted once again he was sixone with black hair and the tanned skin of a lowhandicap golfer he was polished in that southern televangelist sort of way his suits were always a bit shinier than everyone elses his hair a bit longish and perfectly styled and his teeth a few shades too white this appearance of course fit the master plan to split the southern christian vote and the polling numbers told them it had worked a little too well in fact their real problem now lay with the base they felt betrayed and were threatening to stay home on election day ross watched the presidential candidate and his wife pose for the cameras they stood there smiling those same forced smiles that ross had grown to hate even so he kept his own fake smile going and acted like he was admiring the sheer beauty of the super couple rosss wife was back in connecticut at the bedside of their daughter who was about to give birth to their first grandchild at any moment it was just as well she had grown sick of the campaign it was no joy being outshined at every stop by a woman twenty years her junior alexander finally left his wifes side and came over to ross he stuck out his right hand and clapped ross on the shoulder with his left how you feeling today mr vice president good mr president ross strained to keep the smile on his face calling each other president and vice president had been alexanders idea the week after the convention when theyd had their eight point lead it had been fun now it just seemed delusional and childish ross still thought they had a chance he just didnt think the power of positive thinking was what was going to put them over the top five key states were up for grabs the negative ads were in the can and if they didnt shrink the gap in the polls by monday morning things were going to get real ugly ross knew theyd be using those ads against their opponents it was just a question of whether they started this week or the following this was going to be a street fight right to the bitter end four blocks awaygavrilo gazich paid for his espresso with cash and was careful to keep the brim of his red washington nationals baseball hat tilted down so that the security camera mounted above the teller couldnt get a good shot of him he was also wearing sunglasses to help conceal his features it was a sunny fall morning in georgetown and the killer fit in perfectly gazich preferred to operate in africa that was where he had made a name for himself after years of training in his wartorn homeland of bosnia the corrupt politicians and generals of the subcontinent made it an extremely targetrich environment the billions in aid that were simply thrown at the impoverished region by foreign governments and international relief organizations provided an extra incentive for them to slaughter each other the prevalence of graft from the national level all the way down to the smallest village was astounding of every dollar in aid it was estimated that only ten cents actually made it to the people who really needed it the men at the topwarring heads of political parties tribal leaders gangsters military commanders and thugsall fought for their piece of the action and little value if any was placed on civilian life a half a million people dead one year a million the next the level of carnage was mindboggling respect for human life nonexistent the lawlessness staggering it made the civil war in yugoslavia look like a skirmish a simple dustup between a couple of neighborhood gangs during the siege of sarajevo gazich had witnessed some horrible things but nothing that compared to the sheer scope of suffering that existed in the wartorn areas of africa he used it to his advantage though the mix of chaos corruption brutality and lawlessness created the perfect working environment for him the warlords of africa were constantly looking to expand their hold and increase their plunder they operated under the principle of market share if you werent growing you were on your way out the most difficult part for gazich was keeping all the players and their shifting alliances straight he had a simple rule in this regard work only for the most ruthless and never meet them facetoface in their own backyard if they wanted to hire him they had to send someone to athens or istanbul occasionally he would travel to cairo but since the towers had fallen in new york he no longer felt safe in the egyptian capital their president was too close to the united states and his security service was far too efficient and brutal to toy with cyprus had been his home now for more than a decade it was where he went to find the solitude that he needed between jobs to get in and out of these wartorn countries hed posed as a reporter an oil company engineer even a mercenary from time to time more often than not though he was acting on behalf of international relief organizations he had a small business in limassol cyprus called aid logistics inc that specialized in cutting through the red tape in the wartorn areas of africa hed even been recognized by the international committee of the red cross for his services the business turned a tidy little profit on the side but more importantly it gave him legitimacy it helped him build up his contacts and keep track of the everchanging players in the subcontinents continuing saga now here in america he was simply a tourist a greek tourist at that somewhere in his familys history there had to be a few drops of greek blood or at a bare minimum a healthy portion of macedonian hed traveled greece extensively and knew the language well enough since it was also the national language of cyprus the customs officer at jfk had waved him through with a smile which seemed to confirm gazichs belief that the greeks were well liked by mostly everyone with the exception of the turks as with pretty much any job gazich had his reservations but with this one there were more than usual in part because he was operating in america a country that was on high alert for terrorist attacks their border controls and linked computer systems made traveling under false identities very difficult in africa he rarely had to worry about being picked up by a surveillance camera here in washington though they were everywhere this was a rush job which was never good on the nerves he had been given one hour to accept or decline the job without even knowing what it was all he was told was that he would have to travel to america the hit would take place this coming saturday and he would be paid two million dollars this was double the most lucrative contract hed ever landed his initial thought was that it was a trap but after he analyzed it for a moment he dismissed that possibility he had done nothing to offend the americans there would be no reason for them to go to this effort to capture a man whod made a living in the killing fields of africa pretty much without exception gazich dispatched his targets in one of two ways he either shot them in the head from a safe distance or blew them up with highpowered explosives simplicity was at all times his primary objective having grown up on a farm outside sarajevo gazich and his older brothers had been raised to hunt they were all expert marksmen by the age of ten when he was sixteen his father sent him and his three older brothers off to fight with the bosnian serb forces who had laid siege to sarajevo that was when gazich turned his crosshairs from wild game to man for the first time in certain ways he found hunting man less of a challenge in other ways he found it far more exhilarating today would be one of the most thrilling kills of his career his only regret was that he hadnt been given more time to plan the hit killing a man with a single shot from up to a mile away was the biggest rush he had ever felt killing the target by remote detonating a bomb was a distant second but a thrill nonetheless thats what it would be today there simply wasnt enough time to prepare for a head shot on monday he was given the target and the motorcades route that same day he gave them the list of what he would need he never spoke with his employers directly he in fact had no idea who they were although he had a good idea they were muslims to be sure terrorists who had promised to upset the american election gazich did not care for muslims but the money and the thought of screwing with the americans was exhilarating they had meddled in the affairs of his country it would be poetic justice to return the favor these terrorists were getting smart sneaking their own devoted followers into america had become extremely difficult hiring a freelancer was much easier and even with the two milliondollar fee it was probably cheaper than training equipping and transporting a team to handle the operation the most difficult part for them had to be getting the explosives and detonators hed asked for it had all been waiting for him in a storage garage in rockville sneaking five hundred pounds of high explosives into america was not easily done and this was good stuff highgrade russian military plastic explosives not the decaying unstable crap he was forced to use from time to time when he operated in africa the blasting caps the prime chord and the remote detonator were also the best the russians had to offer gazich tried not to think too much about the fallout that would take place after the van exploded in africa he rarely had to think about such things they all wanted to kill each other one more body on the pile meant nothing this was different though washington was the grand stage of espionage and diplomacy not some backwater mosquito infested third world hellhole this was elephant hunting and gazich had tracked the real beast to kill the giant with a rifle shot from a safe distance was not difficult the real sport of it was getting close belly crawling for hundreds of meters and sneaking in among the herd that took skill fortitude and a bit of insanity still the shot itself was relatively easy the real danger lay in getting trampled by one of the massive gray beasts after the herd was spooked gazich left the starbucks with his espresso in one hand and a newspaper under his arm so far the most difficult part had been finding a parking spot two million dollars for finding a parking spot gazich laughed to himself and started up the street screwing with the american political system was sure to bring about a backlash he told himself he would worry about that later now it was time to sneak up on the herd and hope he didnt get trampled special agent rivera stood near the door and looked into the large conference room at thirtyfive shed managed to keep her figure by beating up her fellow agents on a weekly basis karate burned a lot of calories and rivera worked on her moves as if it was a religion the campaign had cut into her classes and the other agents on the detail had grown wise to the fact that she was a seconddegree black belt they were done sparing with her and she was getting bored although shed avoided weighing herself she could feel the extra pounds two more weeks she kept telling herself then she would decompress back in arizona shed sleep eat and work out kick some ass at the gym pay her old dojo a visit and show him who was the boss now maybe shed even bump into a real man someone unattached and not looking for anything serious boy would that be nice she thought to herself she didnt even want to try and figure out how long it had been her boys were seated at the head of the ushaped table the cameras had been allowed in for the first fifteen minutes of the meeting and then they were asked to leave alexanders campaign manager had decided they would look more legitimate that way at some point if you were going to get serious about national security you had to exclude the press and at least look like you were talking about important secrets of state rivera was as tough as they came but even she was exhausted it had been a hellish campaign each day brought a new city and with each city came an entirely forgettable hotel room bland hotel food and a cramped hotel fitness center every morning she received a wakeup call from one of her fellow agents that in addition to telling her what time it was also reminded her where she was and where she was headed sometimes there were as many as four states in a day the events were one after another from sunup to midnight and she and her people had to be sharp every step of the way these presidential elections were a logistical nightmare as hard as they were on the politicians and their staffers though they were worse on the sentinels who were tasked with protecting them rivera was the special agent in charge or sac of presidential candidate josh alexanders secret service detail shed been with the secret service for thirteen years during that time shed worked in the los angeles miami and new york field offices shed also done two presidential details and had risen through the ranks quicker than any other agent in her class along the way shed had one brief marriage and a thankfully quick divorce to go along with it that was almost ten years ago it had been a pretty easy decision for rivera her husband was a federal prosecutor working out of the manhattan district theyd met on an organized crime task force and hed swept her off her feet looking back on it now she should have known marrying an attorney was a mistake four months into the marriage she stopped by her husbands office one day to surprise him and busted him instead right there in the middle of the afternoon he was screwing a female nypd detective on his couch rivera knocked him out cold and filed for divorce that very afternoon maria rivera was secondgeneration american but she spoke spanish fluently thanks to her grandmother who still prayed every day for her marriage to be resurrected grandma rivera had been crushed when she parted ways with the harvard hotshot attorney he was a good catholic boy and quite the charmer rivera didnt have the heart to tell grandma that the ivy league attorney was a whore free of her matrimonial bonds rivera took every tough assignment the service threw at her shed worked major counterfeit and credit card fraud cases for years and inbetween managed to do stints on presidential details a year ago shed been promoted to assistant special agent in charge of president hayess detail or asac when alexander took the lead after new hampshire her bosses called her into headquarters and told her to pack her bags they put her in charge of alexanders detail and told her not to screw up that she was on the short list to run the next presidential detail to run a presidential detail was every agents dream it was also a position within the service where the glass ceiling was still intact if rivera could keep it together she had a legitimate shot at being the first female agent to run a presidential detail she had thought of little else for the last nine months the pace of the campaign had been tolerable for most of that time early on alexander didnt have to work too hard he was ahead in the polls he was a fresh face and the new political darling of the moment he had ridden that wave all the way to the democratic partys convention in august where he walked away with a landslide of the delegates and a new running mate then everything went to hell rivera had been expecting the pace to pick up as they hit the home stretch for the november election but the demands of the campaign had surprised even her alexanders opponents launched a blistering ad campaign that made hay out of the young governors penchant for embellishing stories and sometimes simply making things up his youth and relative inexperience were brought into doubt as well as his integrity by the time labor day rolled around a fivepoint lead in the polls had evaporated the answer from the alexander camp was to fire their campaign manager and redouble their efforts the first two weeks of september were spent on trains and the second two on buses they crisscrossed the country hitting every state that was deemed winnable events were scheduled canceled and then rescheduled advance teams were left stranded in cities as the campaign changed directions on an almost hourly basis it was an absolute logistical disaster but through it all rivera had stayed at the helm and rolled with the schizophrenic scheduling of the campaign now with just two weeks to go she could finally see light at the end of the tunnel rivera a voice whispered urgently maria rivera backed out of the doorway and came face to face with stuart garret like most people in law enforcement rivera was a quick study when it came to people when she was assigned to protect someone she was careful to not let her personal feelings or opinions affect her work josh alexander for instance was a pretty nice guy wellmannered sometimes aloof but for the most part appreciative and respectful of the job she and her people performed mark ross on the other hand was arrogant and condescending rivera didnt like the man but she kept it to herself garret however pushed her professional demeanor to the limits he was quite possibly the biggest asshole she had ever met she was now face to face with the abrasive californian who was running the show yes stu were fifteen minutes behind schedule rivera nodded the campaign was behind schedule not the secret service rivera and her people were not conductors on a train they were not in charge of keeping people on time they were in charge of keeping the candidates and their families alive as soon as theyre done in there garret continued i want everybody in the cars im going to need some oneonone time with josh and mark so put jillian in the second limo shes going to the vice presidents only for the receiving line and then she wants to go back to her hotel for somefucking spa treatment or something fine rivera answered ignoring garrets foul mouth rivera had spent the last nine months of her life with the presidential candidate and his wife and she still hadnt had more than a twosentence conversation with jillian she was very reserved very attractive and very aloof it had been garrets idea to bring her along today eye candy was what he called her her likability number was higher than her husbands and his running mates combined jillian was currently in the second floor salon meeting with a group of muslim women and discussing their role in combating islamic extremism she wants that big agent of yours to go with her garret snarled special agent cash i dont know hisfucking name hes the big guy a lot of riveras agents were big guys she thought she knew which one he was referring to though so she said ill take care of it good be ready to roll in five minutes garret turned and rushed off down the long hallway rivera watched him leave on more than one occasion shed visualized delivering a roundhouse kick to the mans head the scuttlebutt among the campaign staffers was that win or lose garret wasnt sticking around hed been chief of staff for a brief period under a previous administration and openly complained that it was the worst six months of his life he was a hired gun who had accepted a rumored sevenfigure fee to come in and bail out the campaign rivera had heard him say on more than one occasion that anyone willing to work for a government salary was a chump this of course further endeared him to the agents who were assigned to protect his candidates rivera started for the front door she was dressed in a dark blue pantsuit with a light blue blouse she never wore skirts or dresses at least not when she was on duty they simply werent practical every agent on the detail carried the new fn pistol and two extra clips of ammunition the fn was the finest pistol shed ever fired it carried twenty armorpiercing rounds in the grip plus one in the chamber and had half the recoil of the old sig in addition to her weapon she carried her secure motorola digital radio a mobile phone and a blackberry all of that gear had to be stowed someplace and a dress just wasnt going to cut it rivera opened the large front door and stepped out onto the stone terrace of the dumbarton mansion she was a walking contradictionunderstated yet beautiful graceful yet athletic her shiny black hair was almost always pulled back in a simple ponytail thanks to her ancestors she was blessed with a wrinklefree complexion she wore very little makeup while on duty and made every effort to downplay her looks the secret service was still very much a mens club a mens club with an extremely difficult job part of that job was to be seen to let people know they were there at all times monitoring the situation at no point though were they to outshine the people they were protecting donning a pair of sunglasses she surveyed the scene from the elevated terrace and checked her watch it was almost a quarter past noon she couldnt wait to get alexander and ross safely tucked away at the naval observatory then the vice presidents detail could take over and she and her team could get a few hours of much needed down time before they had to fly to st louis rivera spotted the man she wanted to talk to at the far end of the veranda she started in his direction it was drilled into agents to look presentable at all times clothes were to be cleaned and pressed no ties with ketchup stains or dirty shirt collars footwear was stressed to the point where one would think they were training for the olympics agents had to stand post for long hours they needed to be comfortable it was function over form rivera remembered an instructor shed had at the training center in beltsville maryland who used to tell female agents if they couldnt sprint two blocks in their shoes then they shouldnt be wearing them this was the same instructor who used to admonish female agents for wearing skirts hed tell them do you want to be remembered as the agent who saved the presidents life by wrestling a gunman to the ground or do you want to be remembered as the agent who showed the world her panties while tackling an assassin rivera took all these lessons seriously that was why she was wearing a pair of black laceup loafers with twoinch heels and rubber soles they were made of patent leather because she hated shining shoes the rubber sole made them comfortable and quiet rivera was reminded of this second attribute as she neared the agent at the far end of the veranda he had no idea someone was coming up from behind him this was a bad sign rubber soles or not her people were running on fumes a few feet away she decided to have some fun she stuck out her finger and jabbed it into the small of the large mans back matt cash a nineyear veteran of the secret service jumped as if hed just been startled from a nap one wrong move and youre dead rivera laughed cash wheeled around and it was obvious from the expression on his face that he was not amused what in the hell is wrong with you rivera grinned showing her perfect white teeth the press is right there on the other side of the fence cash whispered she looked at the tv vans parked on the street and the photographers perched on ladders so they could shoot over the brick wall she stepped in front of the agent and looked down at his groin you didnt piss yourself did you yeah he said angrily hurry up and give me one of those super jumbo maxipads you carry around maybe i can soak it up before it seeps through my boxers wowarent we in a good mood today dont start with me cash grabbed the lapels of his suit coat and gave them a yank im sick of this shit such an open admission caught rivera off guard as the special agent in charge of the detail she wasnt just their boss she was also their den mother byshitare you referring to me your job or both not you he snarled the job ive been on the road for three straight months my kids miss me my wife hates me and here i am back in dc for the day and i cant even stop by my own house and say hello rivera smiled well ive got some good news for you hq is going to let us stand down for a few hours while the vice presidents detail babysits our boys cashs jaw went slack youre serious yep take a few hoursgo surprise the family just dont miss the plane or ill shove one of my maxipads up your ass and transfer you to fargo so once we get to the observatory i can take off he asked with a smile not right away you have to hang around for thirty minutes and then take the princess to her hotel after that youre free until five the princess rivera was referring to was alexanders wife why me cash complained because youre her favorite and she asked for you personally send someone else you think this is fuckin democracy she shot back and waited to see if he would be stupid enough to disagree with her i didnt think so take her to the hotel put her to bed and then go see your family what in the hell is that supposed to mean what in the hell is what supposed to mean asked a genuinely confused rivera put her to bed he said in a falsetto you trying to say somethings going on rivera frowned and said its a figure of speech einstein well i dont appreciate the connotation i think you mean implication and there is none rivera straightened up and took on a decidedly more businesslike tone youre in the second limo with her im in the lead limo with the principals we get to the observatory and she shakes hands for thirty minutes then you take her to the hotel make sure shes secure in her room and then turn things over to whomever hq sends do you have any questions special agent cash no good gazich crossed the street and started up the east side of wisconsin avenue he had seen the itinerary the thing was actually posted on the internet they were supposed to be on the move at noon but it was likely they would be running late rarely were these types of things ever on time this next part of his plan was a bit risky gazich could have set up a camera and done this from a safe distance but the window for success was too small to risk it he needed to be precise the shaped charge in the cargo area was more than capable of defeating the protective shell of the armored limousine as long as it was detonated at the right moment gazich figured he had a twentyfoot window not all that much longer than the limo itself if the motorcade was moving at a good clip the timing would be difficult that was why he had parked the minivan as close to the corner of wisconsin and s street as possible the motorcade would have traveled only one block by the time it reached wisconsin the vehicles would then be forced to slow for the ninetydegree turn onto wisconsin avenue where the minivan was perfectly positioned for a broadside blast if it were the presidents motorcade things would be quite a bit more difficult in addition to the armored limousines and suburbans the ambulance and a myriad of other vehicles the presidential motorcade also contained a special vehicle that was designed to jam all signals except those used by the secret service this made the remote detonation of a device impossible gazich had checked and discovered that the detail assigned to the candidates had no such equipment even so he would still need to get close enough to make sure he could see when the limo came even with the minivan gazich passed a young couple sitting on a bench eating bagels two blocks ahead he could see the orange stepladder hed strapped to the roof of the van it had been a lastminute idea when hed noticed that white minivans were more common than he would have thought the color of the ladder would also make it easier for him to time the detonation not wanting to get too close to the van he stopped and looked at the listings posted in the window of a real estate office he felt the vibration of the treo phone in his pocket and grabbed it hello two oclock works for me does it work for you two oclock works gazich pressed the end button breathed a sigh of relief and put the phone away he kept meandering his way up the street taking his time windowshopping as he went a few minutes later he heard the quick blast of a police siren being flicked on and then off he looked up the street and watched as one of the dc metro police motorcycles eased out into traffic and blocked the northbound lane on wisconsin avenue gazich flexed his hands several times and asked himself how much closer he dared get the motorcade would be along shortly there was a goodsized tree of some sort a little less than a block away it was about four feet across even though the full force of the blast would be directed away from him there would still be flying debris and a concussion wave that could kill him if he didnt get cover gazich reached the tree and pulled out the treo phone he fished out the small stylus and used it to tap the web browser icon on the screen a few seconds later he was logged onto the site he punched in the password and looked up at the motorcycle cop standing in the middle of the street all that was left to do was hit the send button and the blast would be nearly instantaneous the cop would be dead for certain and quite possibly the people in the first several cars he had stopped there were also shops and apartments directly across the street there was a chance the limo would block the brunt of the blast but it was unlikely a fivehundredpound shaped charge of semtex was just as likely to hurl the limousine across the street and send the vehicle directly through the building gazich tried to remember the phrase the american generals used when one of their twothousandpound bombs missed its mark and flattened the home of one of his countrymen the first police car reached the corner and turned toward gazich its lights and sirens going pedestrians stopped to watch the impressive sight as the motorcade moved from the side street onto wisconsin avenue the phrase came to him and as the first limousine reached the corner he smiled and saidcollateral damage the truth was her people could do this in their sleep that was how well trained they were the candidates stepped out onto the veranda of the mansion and waited for the former cabinet officials intel gurus and generals to join them for one last photo op rivera stayed close but out of the picture her entire detail was shifting now they were a protective bubble that floated with the candidates as they moved there was one counter sniper team on the top floor theyd been up there since before sunrise scanning the windows of the houses across the street getting the general lay of the land noting the range of certain targets and identifying the most likely spots for a shooter to set up riveras head was on a swivel her dark sunglasses concealing her dark eyes she was like a radar sweeping the sky for an incoming raider except her job was much more difficult the press was penned in behind some ropes snapping away recording tape and shouting questions rivera paid almost no attention to what they were asking on a subliminal level she was listening to their tone as her eyes scanned everything never hovering on any one person for more than a second or two most agents did this naturally a few had to be taught the ones who didnt catch on were weeded out the job was nothing if not instinctual their concern was the nut bag their fear was the professional the nut bag they could detect they were the ones with the wild eyes dirty fingernails and unkempt hair occasionally they were women but mostly they were men fidgety nervous men who paced back and forth they were for the most part mentally ill which made them sympathetic but no less lethal the professional was an entirely different matter the lone man who was cool enough to act completely normal right up until the moment he pulled out a gun and blew her candidates brains all over the sidewalk that was why she stayed close today was no big deal she knew all the faces in the press gallery they were the only people close enough to do anything and she had two agents watching them ready to pounce at the first sign of trouble the only other possibility was a shooter from one of the houses across the street but the odds of them getting an accurate shot off before the counter sniper boys drilled them in the head was negligible all she had to do was get them down the steps and into the limo and she could relax the naval observatory was only a few blocks away this was a gravy run compared to the rest of the campaign no rope lines with hundreds of unscreened people touching the candidates no banquet hall where she had to escort them through a kitchen with knives everywhere and temperamental chefs sulking over ruined meals everything today was controlled rivera saw garret gesture to the campaigns press secretary the woman stepped in front of the cameras and thanked them for coming alexander and ross had done this so many times they no longer needed to be given direction both men started down the stairs for the waiting limo the rear passenger side door was already opened and an agent was standing next to it rivera fell in behind the two men and stayed close as they went down the steps alexander got in first followed by ross and then garret rivera closed the door and looked to her left to check the status of alexanders wife she was sliding into the backseat special agent cash turned to look at rivera it was impossible to tell what his eyes were doing behind his sunglasses but from the tension in his jaw line it was apparent that he was still in a foul mood cash shook his head and then disappeared into the backseat rivera didnt give it a second thought egos feelings and friendships needed to be put on hold for two more weeks and then they could all get drunk and tell each other off rivera climbed in the front seat closed the heavy door and looked at the driver lets roll tim the driver pulled the gearshift into drive and took his foot off the brake the heavy limousine began to roll along the narrow cobblestone drive both vehicles pulled up to the open gate and they turned the emergency lights in the grilles on the other vehicles were waiting on the street the limousines eased into the open slots and then rivera gave the word to pull out her eyes kept scanning as they moved they were as safe as babies in this rolling tank but habits were hard to break the old cobblestone street was rough and they were jostled around as they accelerated they reached wisconsin avenue where traffic was stopped in both directions for five blocks the limo slowed for the righthand turn and then accelerated the twelvepiston hp detroit engine roaring as they gained speed rivera was looking at the faces of the pedestrians who had stopped to watch the motorcade all of this was very normal they referred to it as stopping and gawking up ahead barely half a block down a man caught her eye he was partially shielded by a tree and holding something even though the man was wearing a red baseball hat and sunglasses she could sense intensity in the way he was watching the motorcade suddenly almost as if he was trying to hide from someone he disappeared behind the tree before rivera could give it another thought there was a thunderous explosion the limousine started to rise in the air and then everything went black washington dc january irene kennedy looked out at the white landscape from her seventhfloor office three fresh inches of snow had fallen overnight the capital had a majestic winter wonderland feel to it when it snowed it tended to be the kind of wet heavy snow that coated every branch statue and park bench the city looked frozen in time and in a sense it was a lameduck president occupied pennsylvania avenue and the presidentelect was one week away from taking his oath of office traditionally the only business that got done the week before the inauguration was the business of pardons lawyers lobbyists and bigmoney players lined up to ask the president to forgive someone for a crime they had committed or been accused of committing politics had gotten so rough that sometimes just being a friend of the president could bring about the unwanted attention of a special prosecutor with that attention also came a mountain of legal bills it was quickly becoming a tradition for outgoing presidents to wave a magic wand and make these legal problems go away pardons could also be about bricks and mortar a new presidential library needed to be built and they were not cheap with this president however it was mostly about setting things right this should have been on kennedys mind but it wasnt as director of the central intelligence agency she should have been lobbying for a blanket pardon herself but her mind was occupied with the here and now this transition period between presidential administrations was always stressful but even more so this time the nation was without decisive and focused leadership until the new administration took over and that left them vulnerable to make matters worse the word was out that the new administration was going to clean house this was no surprise to kennedy she knew the minute the election results came in that she was out of a job actually she knew several weeks earlier when the cias global ops center called to alert her of the attack on that saturday in late october the motorcade of presidential candidate josh alexander had been hit by a car bomb alexander and his running mate had narrowly escaped their limousine had been flipped by the blast of the bomb but the structural integrity of the outer shell held alexander walked away unharmed while his running mate mark ross suffered a separated shoulder and a cut above his left eye the second limousine did not fare as well the front third of the vehicle collapsed under the blast and exposed alexanders wife and three secret service agents to the superheated gases of the explosion all four people were virtually incinerated fifteen other individuals were also killed and another thirtyfour were wounded seven of them critically an alqaeda splinter group had released a statement the week before the attack that they were going to disrupt the american elections in the immediate aftermath of the explosion kennedy had a pretty good idea how the american people would react to such foreign intervention in the democratic process two weeks later they proved her right they turned out in record numbers on election day and josh alexander and mark ross were swept into office by a landslide shortly after the election ross began making statements to the press that he was going to do a topdown review of the cia that was code for cleaning house despite twentythree years of service kennedy took none of this personally it simply wasnt worth it the people had spoken and in one week there would be the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another her chief focus for this last week would be to purge every possible piece of information that could come back and bite her or any of her people in the ass part of her unpleasant history with ross was that he was a vindictive prick simply running her out of the job after two brief years as the first female director of the agency might not be enough for him kennedy felt there was a real chance he would want to burn her at the stake tie her up in investigations for the next decade she made a mental note to ask president hayes for that blanket pardon after all shed done it would not be out of line to do so kennedy took her eyes off the frozen landscape and checked her watch they were late it must be the snow she thought to herself it was a saturday morning and kennedy worked most saturday mornings at least for another week for all she knew theyd take away her pass and cardkey when she showed up for work a week from monday that would be rosss style hed make it as painful and embarrassing as possible there was an upside to all of this at least that was what she kept telling herself at fortyfive shed given twentythree years of her life to the cia she had a beautiful tenyearold son whom she didnt get to spend enough time with soon he would enter that stage where he would want nothing to do with her this premature departure from the agency would give her a chance to spend more time with him it was no secret in washington that she was on her way out shed already received two offers from local universities to teach three from think tanks and another from a private security firm that was without lifting a finger she tried to stay positive tried to tell herself they were great options but in the end nothing else would match the mission and the people she worked with that was what bothered her most there was a knock on the door and then it opened kennedy smiled when she saw it was skip mcmahon sorry im late said the hulking sixfootfour fbi special agent people in this town lose their minds when it snows its a good thing its a saturday mcmahon was holding a large briefcase he crossed the room and kissed kennedy on the cheek so whats this all about have you finally decided to announce your intention to marry me and make me an honest man kennedy smiled and gestured toward the sitting area coffee or tea since when do i drink tea she poured him a cup of coffee while mcmahon sat on the couch he kept the briefcase close kennedy handed him the cup and sat in one of the wing chairs the fbi man gestured with his hands and said i half expected you to have all of your stuff boxed up and ready to go kennedy sipped her tea do you know something i dont funny mcmahon looked around the wood paneled office ignoring her feigned naiveté the walls were covered with photos of people and places some of the photos were selfexplanatory former cia directors the twin towers the berlin wall others were more obscure a babys hand wrapped around a fathers finger a demolished building with a man standing in the foreground sobbing and a group of arab women covered in black from head to toe walking down a dusty street mcmahon had been to the office many times a naturally inquisitive person he had asked kennedy about some of the photos before her response was always the same she simply smiled and changed the subject it occured to him that this might be his last chance to glean the importance of the more cryptic shots the photo of the arab women in black is that saudi arabia no yemen why do you have it in a frame its a reminder of the subjugation of women in the arab culture mcmahon nodded thats what i thought kennedy began laughing what asked mcmahon its not a reminder of the subjugation of arab women its actually a team of delta force commandos who were on their way to say hello to an individual who lets just say wasnt playing by the rules youre shitting me mcmahon stood up so he could examine the photo more closely who were they going after thats classified did they get him kennedy nodded good mcmahon settled back into his spot on the couch so whats the deal with the meeting this morning do you know cap baker the republican strategist yes hes the mystery person you dragged me out here to see he assured me it was in your best interest a scowl of irritation fell across mcmahons leathered face why in the hell would i want to spend two minutes with a political whore especially a republican one kennedy looked at her watch and ignored the question why the hell didnt he just come see me at the hoover building before kennedy could answer there was a knock on the door a second later it opened and cap baker entered if it werent for his signature shock of gray hair they might not have recognized him they were used to seeing him on tv wearing suits expensive shirts and fancy ties he was rumored to charge eight hundred dollars an hour for his advice and lobbying skills this morning he was dressed in boots khakis and a plaid flannel shirt a puffy winter jacket was held under his right arm a second man wearing a suit followed him into the room sorry were late announced baker in his deep baritone voice the roads are horrible kennedy stood to meet the visitors thats all right she extended her hand cap baker took it thank you for seeing me i know this is a bit unusual mcmahon stood but stayed silent baker turned to the fbi man i promise you special agent mcmahon this will not be a waste of your time as if he could sense mcmahons disdain baker didnt bother to offer his hand instead he gestured to the man who had followed him into the office this is my attorney charles wright he wont be staying long sit he motioned with his hands sit mcmahon and kennedy took their seats and baker and his attorney grabbed two smaller chairs opposite mcmahon kennedy gestured to the tea and coffee service on the table but before she could speak baker declined no thank you i have a plane waiting to take me to vail i need to get the hell out of this town before all the crazies start showing up for the inauguration vail mcmahon said with feigned excitement i would have taken you for an aspen man baker smiled aspen is a democratic ski town agent mcmahon vail is where us republicans go life must be rough replied mcmahon baker stared at the fbi man for a moment the smile on his face was one of amusement i like you youre an open book you dont know me but you dont like me and thats fine because in about five minutes im going to walk out that door and were never going to see each other again is that right asked an amused mcmahon yepand youre never going to forget this meeting whys that because what im about to give you is going to change your life is that right mcmahon didnt sound too convinced yep but before we get started theres one piece of business we need to take care of baker looked to his attorney and nodded the attorney opened his large briefcase and extracted a file he handed the file to baker who opened it and grabbed three contracts he kept one for himself and handed the other two to kennedy and mcmahon whats this asked mcmahon confidentiality agreement answered baker id tell you to read it but i dont have that much time just turn it to the last page and sign and date charles will notarize each signature and then we can get this over with this is bullshit mcmahon tossed the contract on the table im not signing anything baker looked to kennedy who was speedreading through the document irene without looking up she asked cap tell me why it would be in my interest to sign this its not in your interest its in mine but if you want to see what i have inside that briefcase youre going to have to sign this contract why us asked mcmahon good question baker placed his hands on his knees and thought about it for a second three reasons where youre concerned special agent mcmahon the first as far as feds are concerned youre someone who is known for his discretion the second what im about to show you will have a direct impact on your current investigation and your third point youre a son of a bitch you hate politicians and you cant be bought thats five points mcmahon said flatly yeah baker grinned but the last three kind of go together so well just count them as one hes hard to argue with smiled kennedy she then turned to baker and asked why me thats easy i lived in awe of thomas stansfield and so did you he was a good frienda mentor this town has never had anyone who worked so effectively behind the scenes before he died he told me to keep an eye on you he also told me that you were someone i could trust kennedy pulled off her reading glasses and looked at baker thomas stansfield had occupied this very office until cancer took his life two years earlier he had also been a mentor to kennedy he was the greatest man she had ever known and he had told her the same thing about baker without further thought kennedy flipped the contract to the last page and signed above her printed name what are you doing asked mcmahon kennedy slid the contract in front of baker so he could sign skip just sign it so we can get this over with i dont think cap would have gone to this effort if it wasnt something serious but i need to run this by justice i cant just go around signing confidentiality agreements while im on the government dime kennedy glanced at him sideways since when do you care about what justice thinks just let go of your control issues and sign it kennedy handed him her pen mcmahon hesitated for a second and then took it and signed his name if this comes back and bites me in the ass im going to make someones life miserable baker laughed as he took the contract from mcmahon dont worry in about two minutes this contract is going to be the least of your worries the attorney finished notarizing the contracts and placed them back in the briefcase baker stuck out his hand and wright gave him a legalsize manila envelope thank you charles why dont you wait for me down in the car the attorney left without saying a word and when the door closed behind him mcmahon said this better be pretty fucking good thats going to depend on how you look at it baker stared at the mysterious envelope in his hands let me ask you something agent mcmahon how is your investigation going thats confidential i hear its pretty onedimensional whats that supposed to mean baker shrugged you guys are only looking at this one way when all the evidence points in one direction thats pretty much the way it works all the evidence from what ive heard there is very little evidence you know what i didnt come here to talk about my investigation with you this meeting was your idea and i think its time you put your cards on the table fine baker nodded he opened the sealed envelope and extracted a series of x blackandwhite photographs he turned the first one over and placed it on the coffee table so both mcmahon and kennedy could view it it was a closeup of a woman the photograph had the slightly grainy quality of a surveillance photo taken from a distance and then blown up that if you didnt know it already is jillian rautbort presidentelect alexanders deceased wife baker grabbed a second photo and set it down next to the first this one was not blown up it showed jillian rautbort and a man it was evening and they were standing on a terrace jillian was in a halter dress and the man was in a suit baker put down the next photo this one was of just jillian from the waist up she had a very mischievous look on her face and she was reaching behind her neck with her hands baker glanced at kennedy this is where it gets interesting and i apologize in advance but you need to see this he laid down the next photo jillian rautbort was now standing with her dress around her waist her tanned and perfectly sized breasts exposed baker put the next photo down now jillian and the man were kissing the photo after that captured jillian on her knees her face buried in the mystery mans groin baker began lying the photos down like a blackjack dealer would cards they showed rautbort and her lover in an escalation of sexual acts culminating with him on his back on a lounge chair and her completely naked on top of him baker placed the empty envelope on the table next to the photos and said thats pretty much it are you sure asked kennedy that the woman in these photos is jillian rautbort yes when were they taken and how the hell did you get your hands on them mcmahon asked i think they were taken over labor day at the rautbort estate in palm beach and no i didnt hire someone to do this then how in the hell did you get your hands on them i was contacted by the man who took them replied baker mcmahon scoffed so you didnt hire him but in the end you paid him there is a distinction agent mcmahon im not going to sit here and tell you im an angel politics is a rough business since you were willing to sign my confidentiality agreement ill give you the straight facts i paid for these photos i paid a lot of money for these photos and it was all legal my only regret now is that i didnt destroy them the moment i received them why is that asked kennedy because i allowed my ego to get in the way and in the end it cost my candidate the white house how could these photos have cost your candidate the white house asked a skeptical mcmahon there are very few people in the world who i truly despise mark ross and stu garret are two of them kennedy and mcmahon shared a look and mcmahon said youll get no argument from us well with a month to go in the race my guys had an eightpoint lead which if you know how polls are conductedwho answers their phone who doesnt who says they vote and who actually votes and all these national polls have a builtin bias for the democratswith four weeks to go is huge especially if youre on the republican ticket i never really wanted to buy these photos and i certainly never wanted to use them at least not in terms of releasing them to the press then why did you buy them asked mcmahon to take them out of play kennedy answered thats right elections are about controlling as many factors as possible and ill be damned if i was going to allow these things to float around and do god only knows what the conventional wisdom would be that they would hurt the alexander camp but one never knows for sure the smart thing is to leave nothing to chance we were flush with cash so i paid the guy that was the only reason why you bought them kennedy asked in a slightly skeptical tone baker grinned there was one other small reason he shifted in his chair and crossed his right leg over his left i wanted to make garret and ross sweat you sent them these mcmahon asked with his mouth agape only a few i had them personally delivered to garrets hotel room during a campaign stop in dallas did he know you sent them no are you sure he may have guessed but i made sure the delivery couldnt be traced back to me i did however send a message along what kind of message i only sent three photos i wrote one word with a black sharpie on each photo what word three words youll never win you and garret have a history asked kennedy you could say that weve been on the opposite sides of some pretty big battles and let me guess said mcmahon one of your favorite sayings with him was youll never win actually he was the one who was fond of the saying so you thought youd rub his nose in it baker nodded and if id just left it alone id be the one getting ready for an inauguration and they baker pointed at the photos on the table would still be alive what do you mean they asked mcmahon jillian and the man she had the rendezvous with mcmahon picked up one of the photos and pointed to the person underneath jillian rautbort this man is dead that man is special agent matt cash of the united states secret service mcmahon couldnt sit any longer hed been down this road before just never on such a highprofile case instinctively it was a nightmare law enforcement was in great part about maintaining order in society there were rules and they needed to be enforced the people who enforced them tended to be very organized individuals who approached their jobs in a methodical manner never more so than when they were investigating a crime and with a sensational crime such as this one you investigated the case with one eye on the crime and one eye on the eventual prosecution of the perpetrators usually prosecutors were brought in later but on this one theyd been looking over his shoulder every step of the way this steaming pile of crap that this republican shark had just dropped in his lap was now forcing him to rethink all of the suppositions and evidence that he and hundreds of agents had spent months running down and collecting he wanted to dismiss it as inconsequential bullshit tell him to take his envelope and his confidentiality agreement and take a flying leap off a cliff but as much as he hated to admit it his gut told him that there was something here mcmahon wished kennedy would break the ice and speak but she wasnt going to that wasnt her style she was too smart for all he knew this was a setup she could have known about this for weeks mcmahon didnt like any of this he stopped his pacing and looked down at kennedy how long have you known about this she looked at her watch for about six minutes mcmahon studied her placid face and fought to conceal his own rage he loved kennedy and he trusted her but at the end of the day she was still a spy a professional perpetrator of deceit and lies as much as he wanted to believe her he could never really be sure he turned his attention back to baker why should i believe any of this and why in the hell did you wait two months to tell anybody about this im no saint agent mcmahon im not afraid to bend the rules here and there especially when it comes to stuff like these moronic campaign finance laws but this baker gestured to the photos if someone on the other side decided to make this go away and do it in such a way as to make it advantageous to their causethen they stepped way over the line thats a big if and you still didnt answer my question why did you wait until now why didnt you come forward the day after the explosion are you kidding me the opposing candidates wife gets incinerated by a car bomb and you think i should have gone public with a bunch of pornographic photos of her screwing her bodyguard who by the way also got killed in the explosion i would have been branded the biggest bastard in the history of politics i didnt say go public why didnt you bring it to me baker stood and waved his hand in frustration at mcmahon youre where i was in the weeks after the attack except i still had a campaign to manage a campaign that we almost won which is amazing when you think about it he grabbed his jacket off the back of the chair i didnt want to believe any of this things were happening so fast those final two weeks there were the funerals and then alexander decided to go on with the debates after wed been informed that he was pulling out we were in a street fight with our hands cuffed behind our backs we couldnt fight back we had to just sit there and take it so again mcmahon said forcefully why now why sit on this for two months because i didnt want to believe it this is going to sound really corny to you but i believe in this country i believe in the twoparty system i believe in the peaceful transfer of power and from everything ive seen josh alexander is a decent man im not about destroying institutions and ruining the peoples faith in their government but baker fell silent but what prodded mcmahon mark ross and stu garret are motherfuckers and i mean motherfuckers the severity of the comment caught even mcmahon off guard pathological liars the both of them baker continued the more i sat and thought about this the more i realized they are absolutely capable of orchestrating some fucking coup like this thats great mcmahon said sarcastically your personal opinion and all but do you have a shred of evidence that the vice presidentelect of the united states plotted to have his own motorcade attacked evidenceno baker shook his head but motive yes and trust me agent mcmahon ive been following your investigation in fact ive already read the draft youre going to deliver to the president on monday its heavy on supposition and light on the facts yeah you have all your standard lab analysis on the bomb you guys are great at that but beyond the lab report its all fluff you guys dont know where that van came from or how the explosives got into the country most importantly though you dont have a suicide bomber and we all know how the islamic radical fundamentalists love to martyr themselves thats not always the case fine then wheres the guy in the red nationals baseball hat mcmahons eyes widened what are you talking about who not a what and dont act so surprised i told you ive been following your investigation mcmahon looked anxiously at kennedy and then back to baker who have you been talking to you know that is something that has always driven me nuts about this town everybody gets hung up on who said what to who and they ignore the fact that the truth is staring them right in the face you have a thirteenyear veteran of the secret service who has an impeccable record and she reports that just before the blast she saw a man in a red nationals baseball hat and sunglasses standing behind a tree and acting suspicious the man was and i will quote from your original draft not the one that you are going to give to the president on monday in your first draft you wrote agent rivera saw a man holding a device and right before the explosion he suddenly ducked behind the tree agent rivera was under a lot of stress at the time dont start acting like one of those attorneys over at justice i can see from your face that you believe that bs about as much as i do and youre sounding like one of those crazy conspiracy theorists baker laughed loudly better than some shill for the government whod rather bury evidence than face the facts mcmahon was up off the couch with surprising quickness for his size id be careful about questioning peoples motives mr blackmailer i did no such thing and you know it but im glad to see youre angry youre going to need it if youre going to get to the bottom of this youre out of your mind and youre in denial youve accounted for every person at the scene of the crime that day except the man in the red hat the man in the red hat doesnt exist baker stepped back and smiled oh really if he doesnt exist then why does the starbucks on wisconsin have him on digital surveillance buying a cup of coffee roughly thirty minutes before the explosion what in the hell are you talking about blackandwhite surveillance tape red doesnt look red your people had it right in front of them and they missed it go back and check youll see mcmahon was at a complete loss for words this shark knew more about his own investigation than he did watch your back agent mcmahon these guys dont play by the rules and neither should you if you want to find the truth baker turned to kennedy one last thing you know that ross will move to get rid of you right after the inauguration yes and anyone else he deems a threat are you thinking of anyone in particular mitch mitch rapp said mcmahon what in the hell does ross have against rapp its a long story said kennedy not wanting to answer the question cap i know you have a plane to catch so cut to the chase i think it would be a good idea to bring in a fresh set of eyes on this are you sure you dont mean youd like to let the bull into the china shop and see what he breaks oh thats a tempting visual but its not what i had in mind i was thinking more along the lines of an assassins assassin someone who knows the ins and outs of this world its not a bad idea what baker and mcmahon didnt know and what kennedy was not about to tell them was that she already had mitch rapp on the case she had known about the mystery man in the red hat for almost a month and rapp and his team had been working quietly to find out who he was and more importantly who had hired him limassol cyprus he was six inches taller than her and ten years older i think you should kiss me she said softly mitch rapp ignored her and watched the door to the café across the street if we were really lovers you wouldnt be able to take your hands off me she slid her chair closer to his and placed a hand on his thigh she ran her hand through his long black hair streaks of gray were coming in on the sides for three straight weeks shed studied him she knew every wrinkle and scar and there were quite a few of the latter some visible some buried in his psyche she had no proof the mental scars were there but they had to be no body lived the type of hard life hed lived and came out unscathed she lifted her sunglasses off her nose just enough to reveal her hazel eyes they were more green than brown which she thought might be part of the problem his exwifeno that wasnt right his deceased wifehad the most stunning green eyes cindy brooks made the mistake of calling her the ex one night and hed made her sleep on the floor brooks had been with the agency for only five years and she considered it a huge honor to work side by side with a living legend like mitch rapp at least she had when she was first given the assignment listen hardass her words were harsh but hushed the expression on her face was pure feigned adoration you handpicked me for this im supposed to be your wife were on our honeymoon when people are on their honeymoon they kiss a lot they talk they hold handsthey act like they love each other your point rapp turned toward her but kept his eyes on the café he was wearing a pair of black persol sunglasses that allowed him to see out but no one else to see in no one is going to believe our cover because you keep acting like i dont exist people fight on their honeymoon all the time we fought yesterday we were in istanbul yesterday none of these people know we were fighting im sick of dealing with your foul mood she took her hand off his leg and leaned back after a moment the smile on her face disappeared fighting it is then brooks stood with such quickness that it surprised even rapp her chair tumbled over and she put her hands on her hips my mother she yelled told me i shouldnt marry you she reached out and grabbed her glass of wine from the table rapp looked up at her from behind his sunglasses his jaw tight with tension he whispered sit down youre making a scene i know im making a scene she yelled i want to make a scene youre an ass then with a great flourish she took her wine doused rapps blue polo shirt and khaki pants and stormed off down the street rapp sat there motionless the people at the surrounding tables all looked on in amusement it had been a bad year the worst year of his life he went to bed every night blaming himself for her death and woke up every morning hoping it had all been a nightmare but it wasnt the unborn baby she was carrying the other children they would have undoubtedly hada lifetime of dreams and memories gone in an instant and he never saw it coming that was the other problem the thing that ate away at him from the inside out he had let his guard down he had allowed her to change him to give him hope that he could be something different something other than a killer he supposed there was a chance she would have succeeded in changing him but it was small his was a vocation that was very difficult to walk away from especially with so much on the line he was unwilling to let go of his past there was always one more job one more operation to handle shed told him to let someone else man the ramparts for a while hed seen the younger guys though hed even helped train a few of them and they had a lot to learn before they were anywhere near as good as he was at thirtynine he was at his peak his knees and back were not what they once were but he still had no problem keeping up with the rookies who in some cases were nearly half his age the years of experience were what really made the difference if he could do it all over again the decision would have been easy he would have given it all up for one more day with her the hunt for her killers was the only thing that got him through the first nine months after that hed tried pills for a while at first they worked at least they helped him sleep but after a month they started to make him crazy so he threw them all away that was when he dropped out he flew to paris made a stop in switzerland and then disappeared for two months he drank profuse amounts of alcohol and went on an opium binge in bangkok that lasted for a week he even slept with a couple of women along the way but the brief flings only worsened his guilt finally in late october he woke up one early evening in his hotel room in calcutta and turned on sky news that was how he heard about the attack on the motorcade he looked at his puffy red face and bloodshot eyes in the mirror and knew he had reached the tipping point he either went back to the states and got back to work or he would drink himself to death rapp was a lot of things but nothing more so than a survivor kennedy was happy to see him but there were questions and rapp wasnt good at answering questions the cia got a little skittish when their operatives disappeared the fbi also took notice kennedy covered for him as best she could and told the inquisitors that rapp had taken a leave of absence most understood the death of his wife was a very public affair rapp had his enemies in the government however and they wanted answers rapp in his typical manner told them to go fuck themselves which only served to make the situation worse in the end it was the president who intervened on his behalf the commander in chief came down extremely hard on those who questioned rapps loyalty this was not the cold war no longer did agents get turned by the enemy this new war was about terrorism and the thought of rapp going over to the other side was simply preposterous this all came down the week before the election and it was rosss people at national intelligence who made the biggest stink when alexander and ross pulled off their comefrombehind victory both rapp and kennedy knew their days were numbered almost two years earlier he had warned kennedy that he thought alqaeda or one of its offshoots might try to hire outside help to run some of their operations they had the cash to do it and they also had a practical motive the us and her allies had done a tremendous job of rolling up terrorist cells which operationally left alqaeda ineffective when it came to striking at the heart of america the motorcade incident changed all of that somehow they had managed to stage a spectacular attack inside and they had left surprisingly few clues in rapps experience lack of evidence meant a professional was involved nowhere in any of the early reports did rapp read a thing about the mystery man in the red hat he learned that when he sat down to talk to special agent rivera at first rapp was shocked that there was no mention of him in the reports but then it began to make sense rivera was the only one to notice the man he didnt show up on any surveillance monitors from the surrounding businesses paramedics did not treat him after the explosion he simply disappeared or as several doctors tried to tell rivera he never existed except in her mind shed suffered a serious concussion it was a given that she might be confused about when and where things had occurred the long and short of it was that the lawyers at the justice department didnt like loose ends especially loose ends that would fan the flames of conspiracy theorists for decades to come rapp went back to the scene of the crime with a map that listed where every pedestrian and vehicle was on that afternoon in october when history was changed two of the apartment buildings across the street were now holes in the ground the adjacent buildings on either side were under construction other than that everything looked normal the huge crater in the road had been filled and repaved and fresh trees had been planted rapp found the tree where rivera said the man had been standing right before everything faded to black the large oak was still there but damaged some of the bark that faced the explosion was gone and there were several scars left by debris that had imbedded itself into the trunk for rapp it came down to the tree and one other thing if the attack had really been carried out by jihadists there would have been a body or more accurately tiny parts of a body a true believer willing to martyr himself for the cause no body parts meant remote detonation and if rapp had been the trigger man that day he would have stood right where rivera said she saw the man in the red hat the fbi and the rest of the government could scour the planet for the terrorists who claimed responsibility but rapp was going to look elsewhere the shadowy world of contract killers it was a world rapp knew well the covert ops business required rubbing shoulders with people who were on par with swiss bankers when it came to secrecy in essence it was a loose network of former intelligence law enforcement and military types many of these people worked for real security firms the firms handled legitimate work and subcontracted out the black bag stuff on the side rapp ruled these companies out from the start of his investigation targeting a presidential candidate and setting off car bombs in washington dc was way off the reservation no big security firm or foreign intelligence service would touch a contract like this the downside was simply too great the job would have been taken by someone out of the mainstream someone small a one two or threeman shop at the most it would also have to be someone who didnt mind taking money from terrorists and that made the list of potential suspects pretty thin all of this was going through rapps head when they got the first big breakthe starbucks tape there had literally been hundreds of tapes to review from local georgetown businesses a computer genius at langley named marcus dumond had caught the oversight dumond had written a computer program that piggybacked the recognition software they already used the thousands of hours of surveillance footage was scanned with the new program looking for baseball hats it came back with over a hundred hits but it was the starbucks one that fit the time frame and riveras description of the man shed seen it did not provide them with a clear photo of the suspect but it was a start the brim of his hat blocked most of his face from the camera but they knew what his mouth and chin looked like and they also got a brief glimpse of his nose and the lower portion of his eyes they also knew his height and approximate weight most important for rapp though was that he now knew how the man moved how he carried himself they had him on tape for twentyseven seconds while he waited in line to order his drink thanks to the time stamp on the surveillance footage they were also able to go back and find out exactly what the assassin had ordereda double espresso definitely more european or middle eastern than american and that was where the hunt had led themto the countries that bordered the mediterranean rapp started with the cias database and then contacted his colleagues in britain france and italy for close to four weeks rapp and a small team had been hopping all over the mediterranean running down leads theyd been in tunisia italy greece turkey and now cyprus they had narrowed the search down to three names whether those three names represented three separate individuals or one they couldnt be sure the business was funny that way it was very easy for an operator to take on multiple identities and use different pseudonyms depending on the target the type of hit or the region with each passing day though rapp was beginning to believe it was one man there were too many similarities too many intersecting paths rapps contact in istanbul was dependable a deputy undersecretary in the turkish national intelligence organization who had been on the cia payroll for almost three decades he told rapp there was a good chance the man he was looking for lived in cyprus he did business in istanbul from time to time but limassol cyprus was his home the turkish spy gave rapp an address an email account and a lowquality surveillance photograph dumond pulled all the information together in less than a day and was still trying to connect the dots they had real estate records tax returns past and present email accounts and banking records the guy he was looking for operated a front company out of an office above the café hed been sitting across from for the past two hours the owner of the café was his landlord the tenant went by the name of alexander deckas rapp thought it a strange irony that the suspected assassin went by the same first name as the last name of the man he had tried to kill rapp stood and dabbed the wine from his pants a sympathetic waiter handed him a second napkin he cleaned the wine as best he could while trying to come up with the worst possible overseas posting for brooks the waiter gave him a third napkin and rapp gave him the two soiled ones he glanced around the area to see how much attention he had garnered the café was on a oneway street in front of the hotel so all the parked cars were pointed east halfway down the block to his left something caught his eye casually he threw some cash down on the table and thanked the waiter in italian he didnt know greek and figured it was the next best option rapp then started down the street he pulled at his wet shirt and continued to act concerned over his soiled clothes he glanced to his right and confirmed what he had seen two men were sitting in a car one of them was holding a camera with a telephoto lens and it was pointed at the same café rapp had been watching rapp looked away and grabbed his phone after several rings a man answered whats up where are you asked rapp athens get your ass to cyprus and i mean yesterday whats wrong i dont think were the only people looking for this guy im at the airport right now ill see whats available and get back to you rapp hit the end button and kept walking he was trying to figure out his next move when it presented itself in the form of a mannequin perched in a storefront window near the end of the block new clothes and a view of the two men across the street were exactly what he needed zermatt switzerland the partygoers in the alex hotel were all in a good mood and they should have been since not a single one of them had paid for a thing all weekend this particular environmental conference was one of the hottest tickets on the annual circuit one day of workshops and panels and two days of skiing and debauchery at one of europe s finest ski resorts a grateful dead cover band was on a tiny stage playing cumberland blues as the crowd of rhythmically challenged birkenstock wearing patchouli oilsmelling prematurely gray mother earth lovers danced a herkyjerky dance that would have made any lover of the motown sound either cry or double over in laughter mark ross stood near the back of the room with a permanent smile on his face he had attended the event five previous times as a us senator and the attendees had always been nice to him but now they treated him like royalty he had been smart to embrace this issue years ago if one was to rise to the top of the democratic party it was very important to have the proper credentials no résumé builder was more vital than the role of compassionate environmentalist these were the foot soldiers the people who got out the vote who organized things from the grass roots with their email blasts and blogs he appreciated everything theyd done for him and would hopefully do for him in the future he was already thinking about his turn eight years wasnt so long there were limits though he was now at the top of the political heap one place from the pinnacle hed put in enough time with the unwashed now it was time to head off to mount olympus and bask in the adoration of the truly powerful the toughest invite of the entire weekend was for joseph speyers party at his mountainside villa the deadheads were not welcome speyers party was for the heavy hitterseuropean royalty fashion icons from paris london new york and milan international financiers media moguls the occasional movie or rock star hip politicians and ultrawealthy trust funders in other words the beautiful people who flew in on their private planes partied hard wrote big checks and then flew on to the next big party or one of several mansions they owned conservation to these people meant having their staff recycle their diet pop cans and designer plastic water bottles some of them went so far as to buy a small hybrid car but the purchase was simply to drive to a friends house on the weekend they still kept their limos suvs luxury sedans and sports cars for ross speyer s party was a must it allowed him to tap into people with obscene money people who could write million dollar softmoney checks because that was how much money their bond portfolio had earned the previous week ross had been welcomed into this crowd from the getgo he was tall relatively handsome and fit but equally important was the fact that hed built himself a small fortune on wall street which endeared him to his fellow multimillionaires the ultra wealthy had a much easier time writing checks to people who were already in the club on some level they thought a fellow millionaire was less likely to abscond with the funds ross shook a few more hands and turned for the door the smell of cannabis was pungent michael brown the secret service agent in charge of his detail stood a few steps away with a frown on his face he fell into step with ross as they left the room whats the matter michael ross asked with a smile youve never been stoned i dont do drugs sir never have you dont have to lie to me ross said casually im not going to tell anyone five more agents fell in around them the shortest was six feet one and the tallest was six feet six they looked more like a basketball team than a security detail i dont lie sir browns eyes scanned the crowd in the lobby just so you know im going to have to put this in my report what in your report the presence of marijuana ross looked at him sideways you cant be serious it was pretty thick in there sir and we take drug tests i have to write it up ross frowned he could just see the press getting a hold of something like this dont worry sir itll be internal were good at keeping secrets the secret service agents and the vice presidentelect stepped through the front door and onto the sidewalk two more sixplusfoot agents were waiting for them they were traveling light which was the other reason for agent browns foul mood motorized vehicles were banned in the town of zermatt brown wanted to get an exemption from the swiss but ross wouldnt let him it was after all an environmental conference ross would ride the electric city busses just like everyone else this was both a logistical and security nightmare for the secret service there was no bombproofing let alone bulletproofing electric vehicles they simply didnt have the horsepower to handle the extra weight especially with some of the steep inclines they had to deal with that meant ross would be exposed to and from every venue all weekend long in light of the attack on the motorcade no one at the secret service liked this idea but ross held his ground the other problem was that ross had sprung this trip on them at the last minute that meant the advance team had arrived barely a day before the rest of the detail a city bus was commandeered for the weekend and two agents set about learning how to drive the large lowpowered vehicles brown arrived the next day to discover that his boys had crashed the bus the narrow village streets were simply too difficult for amateurs to navigate so now they had a civilian driving them and no backup bus available as a decoy nor a replacement should this one fail the entire trip had degenerated into everything hed been taught not to do with ross refusing to allow him to bring in one of the limos or suburbans on standby in milan they were forced to adapt and settle for a less than ideal situation a perimeter had been formed around the yellow and green village bus black paper had been taped over the large windows along the back half brown escorted ross onto the bus and walked him to the rear where he sat him down between two black clad and heavily armed members of the counter assault team more agents piled on the bus and they started to roll a light fluffy snow was falling as the bus hummed through the narrow streets they didnt have far to go that was one good thing about zermatt the village was small speyer s house was barely a mile away most of it uphill two agents had been deployed in advance brown had wanted to send a team of six to sweep the house and wand the other guests as they arrived but when ross got wind of it he hit the roof ross chewed his ass out and brown had to stand there and take it he kept headquarters appraised of his every move and left a significant email trail explaining that ross had overruled him every step of the way if something happened brown wasnt going to take the blame for it hed watched what theyd done to rivera after the attack on the motorcade shed been put on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigation now shed been cooling her heels for two and a half months even if they cleared her there was no way she would get anywhere near the presidents detail with barely a hundred meters to the house the bus rounded a hairpin turn and stalled the driver turned to brown and in clear english said too heavy too much weight wonderful brown scowled and then mumbled to himself what a chicken shit operation he looked around at his fellow agents and said everybody off accept kendal and fitz brown was referring to the two men sandwiching ross one by one eight agents piled off the bus and then slowly but steadily the vehicle climbed the last steep incline the agents who had disembarked dogged it up the hill double time without having to be ordered the bus couldnt go very fast so they kept pace but when they got to the top they were all panting due to the thin mountain air one of the two advance agents was waiting for them with a smile on his face it vanished as soon as brown stepped off the bus what in the hell do you think is so funny nothing boss the man said sheepishly whats the situation in there brown jerked his head toward the house eightythree guests plus sixteen people from the caterer no whack jobs exits were piggybacking his security system everything is wired and covered brown stepped back onto the bus and said sir were ready ross stood and buttoned his tweed sport coat he was wearing a gray and blue nordic sweater underneath and some jeans he exited the bus and proceeded to the front door where it was opened for him by one of the hosts servants the heavy wooden door swung in and ross was met by speyer who was waiting for him the banker was dressed in a red velvet smoking jacket black pants and a pair of black suede house slippers he was every bit the stylish host even here in the mountains mr vice president speyer made a rolling motion with his right hand and then bowed at the waist it is an honor to have you as a guest at my humble abode ross laughed im still just mark to you joseph i wont be sworn in for another week ohdo not deprive me the joy of using such an exalted title the banker looked up at ross and smiled stand up you imbecile before i have you flogged speyer winked and said promises promises you look well and so do you what can we get you to drink i would love a martini we will get you one and then i would like to show you my new wine cellar i think you will be most impressed ross started to follow the host and after a few steps could feel that someone was following him he looked over his shoulder at agent brown and gave him a look that clearly told him to back off wait by the front door if i need you ill scream a bar was set up between the stone fireplace and the massive picture window that looked down on the village and out onto the most recognizable peak in the world the matterhorn with the light snow falling the sheer face was all but obscured but ross knew it was there hed stood at this window just three months before and coveted the view the guests all gravitated toward him extending their sincere congratulations many of them had helped finance the campaign he was their horse and they had backed him ross was well into his martini and speyer was well into his second hilarious story when ross noticed a familiar face watching him from across the room ross became uncomfortable before he even knew it his hands got sweaty and his throat tightened a bit he avoided looking at the man directly he expected him to be here but not out in the open ross suddenly felt the need to dull his nerves a bit he turned to the bartender and motioned for another martini a little liquid courage was what he would need to get through the evening limassol cyprus rather than fly into limassols international airport gazich took a more circuitous route he flew first from bucharest to athens and then took the ferry to rhodes where he stopped for a few days before jumping another ferry to cyprus immigration and passport control at the ports was virtually nonexistent it had been more than ten weeks since hed set foot on the island he called home he had spent much of that time hopping from one country to the next and trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible before the bomb had exploded hed already decided to lay low and hide out in america for a week or two that was his style where others rushed to get out of a country after a hit he remained calm and waited for things to blow over every step of the way he had been relaxed and deliberate run away from the scene of a crime and you attract attention stand and watch lurk and loiter for a while and nobody notices you blend in with all of the other gawkers who congregate to stand in awe of the carnage carnage was plentiful that saturday afternoon in late october at first gazich had been unable to take in his handy work the dust and debris cloud was massive fortunately he had remembered to put in earplugs before the bomb went off it had been more powerful than hed expected and surely would have blown both his eardrums he had stayed pressed against the tree for ten seconds his eyes closed and his tshirt over his mouth and nose holding his breath when he opened his eyes a crack day had been turned into night with a cautious step gazich left the protection of the tree and started down the sidewalk even though he could barely see he wanted to make it to the perimeter before the dust settled he wanted to be standing amid the first group of onlookers slowly the air cleared and the sky began to brighten debris was everywhere broken glass hunks of metal bricks and wood were strewn about the sidewalk with the earplugs pulled out he began to hear cries for help he walked past those cries and made it to the bottom of the hill across the street from the starbucks where he had been before the attack a man stopped him and asked if he was all right gazich still had his tshirt over his mouth and nose he nodded coughed and kept walking a half a block later he reached the safeway parking lot and stopped this was his first chance to turn around and take in the destruction the size of the crater surprised even him it crossed both lanes of traffic and looked to be at least six feet deep it was as if a meteor had come in at a shallow angle slamming into the middle of georgetown it was hard to tell due to the smoke and fire but it looked like the apartment buildings across the street were no longer there most importantly gazich counted only one limousine it was turned over on its back like some helpless turtle gazich guessed that the other limo had been close to incinerated as the crowd of onlookers grew gazich fell farther and farther back with each move he was careful to shake more dust from his clothes emergency vehicles began to arrive within minutes and they just added to the chaos when the pandemonium reached its peak he simply crossed wisconsin avenue and walked four blocks to his parked car on t street twenty minutes later he was merging onto interstate and on his way north he changed out of his clothes as he drove not daring to pull into a rest stop too many cops patrolled those places with the windows down and the cruise control set at the legal limit he shook the dust from his hair and put on a new tshirt and a pair of jeans when he crossed the state line into delaware he finally relaxed a bit the reports on the radio kept repeating the same information over and over so he turned off the radio and drove in silence a couple of hours later he ditched the car in newark and took the train into manhattan hed already booked a room at the sheraton hotel and towers near times square rooms lots of tourists and near complete anonymity hed arranged for two tickets to a show that night and he picked them up from the concierge before he headed up to his room he didnt want to go to the show he would much rather go to one of the high end strip clubs and blow through a wad of cash but he reasoned that if he was playing himself off as a tourist he should act like one when he got up to his room he turned on the tv and any thought of going to the show a strip club or anywhere else for that fact completely vanished he could barely believe how quickly everything had gone from perfect to disastrous hed missed the target the candidates were alive and the wife and a whole lot of other people were dead gazich knew it had not been his fault the man on the phone had told him they would be in the second limo the limo that he incinerated would the person who hired him believe it when he told him hed hit the car hed been told to hit would they want him to try again gazich already knew what the answer to that would be you only got one shot at something like this anything after that was a death wish gazich barely slept that night despite the fact that hed put a serious dent in the minibar as soon as the stores were open he found a tmobile kiosk and purchased a pda with web browsing capabilities hed been paid a million dollars in advance and promised a million more upon completion of the assignment in gazichs mind the second million was still his his employer had assured him that they had an impeccable source everything on his end had been done to perfection this screwup was the sources fault and he was not about to take the blame for it gazich logged onto the email account using the password hed been given and opened the draft menu where a message was waiting for him it was pretty much what he had expected they were blaming him for screwing up as quick as his two hands could type the assassin punched in his terse reply placing the blame where it belonged he finished by demanding the rest of his fee and then logged off over the next fortyeight hours they went back and forth with things getting worse before they got remotely better both sides made threats and both were presumably in a position to follow through even though they had never met facetoface one side had the money and presumably could find the assets to retaliate while the other side had the talent and determination in the end it was a standoff this was a war that neither side wanted to fight the demands for a second attempt on the candidates lives was dropped and they eventually admitted that their inside source had relayed bad information since the job was not completed they asked if he would accept a reduction in his fee he told them he would take his full fee and kill the inside source free of charge they went back and forth several more times and eventually settled on when the money showed up in his swiss account gazich breathed a sigh of relief but only for a second the next day he called his banker and gave him instructions on how he wanted the money relocated he then left new york and headed west by train to begin his tenweek journey home throughout his travels gazich couldnt shake the feeling that this entire affair was going to come back and bite him in the ass when he finally stepped off the boat in limassol he couldnt help but smile hed traveled two thirds of the way around the planet and had done so without raising the suspicion of a single law enforcement or intelligence agency maybe his worries had been exaggerated it wouldnt be the first time gazich threw his bag over his shoulder and threaded his way through the terminal toward the taxi line he was suddenly eager to see a few familiar faces to find out how things had been on the island and most importantly if anyone had been looking for him he powered up his cell phone and then punched in a local number after a few rings a woman answered and gazich said andreas he waited for the woman to get his landlord and joined the line of people waiting for a taxi gazich had talked to the landlord two days ago and had asked him if anyone had been looking for him it was not an unusual question gazich often left on short notice and was sometimes gone for a month at a time this trip was longer than usual though and andreas had expressed some concern when hed first checked in almost a month ago gazich answered by telling him hed been detained in darfur by some overzealous government soldiers the main thing where andreas was concerned was that he paid his rent on time and stay away from his daughters five of them worked in his café and they were all dropdead gorgeous gazichs office was on the third floor above the café when he was on the island he took his meals in the café almost every day hello the voice said in greek my friend how are you ahgavrilo are you finally home yes good will i see you for dinner tonight yes what time around nine i have a few things to take care of first i will save a table for you and put aside your favorite bottle of retsina before gazich could respond the old man hung up he stared blankly at the phone for a second and then climbed in the waiting cab zermatt switzerland ross was holding court in the corner of the vaulted living room his back to the giant picture window he looked like he was standing on the altar of one of those new age churches that focused more on entertainment than theology a sixfootone waferthin model hung on his every word as ross spoke about environmentalism being the key to bringing the middle east and the rest of the world together a common ground that everyone could agree upon the others all nodded in earnest and threw in an occasional comment of their own but this was rosss show he was the new man of the hour how is your president asked the model she had a dutch accent the current one or the new one the new one ross consciously hesitated before answering heshes hanging in there hes a pretty tough guy i cant imagine the pain a slender older woman added she tried to convey a sense of sadness but her new facelift prevented her from showing anything other than a look of permanent alertness they seemed like they really loved each other the model added yes they did very much so enough melancholy speyer announced as he wedged his way into the semicircle with a flippant wave of his wrist he said this is a party and more importantly it is my party i demand that you all start having fun the group relaxed a bit and cracked a few smiles several of the men laughed and begged speyer for his forgiveness i will consider it but i will not tolerate boring or depressing conversation at my parties start having fun or i will not invite you next year he said this with great theatrical flair and the group dispersed with the exception of ross and the model i have something i would like to show you mr vice president and what would that be joseph my new wine cellar may i join you as well the model asked hopefully im afraid not my darling boys only speyer grabbed ross by the arm and led him through the living room a few people tried to stop them but speyer simply smiled and kept moving they reached the entrance hall where special agent brown and two other agents were standing watch by the front door the agents watched their protectee and his host walk across the stone floor speyer opened a wooden door to what looked like a closet but was actually an elevator agent brown turned to the man on his left you didnt tell me there was an elevator i didntknow there was an elevator the agent responded in an embarrassed tone i was told it was a closet brown moved quickly crossing the entrance hall in six long strides mr speyer where does this elevator go to my wine cellar im fine michael brown ignored the vice presidentelect is there another way to get to the wine cellar there is also a back staircase from the carport the wood paneled elevator door slid open before the two men could get in agent brown stuck out his arm to block their path ill need to clear the room first brown turned to the other two agents but before he could motion them over ross stopped him youll do no such thing ross said firmly i have known joseph for years this place has a better security system than the white house go wait by the door and ill call for you if i need you but sir you know i cant allow you to enter a room without protection unless it has been checked you can and you will now go stand by the door brown hesitated briefly and then relented he stepped out of the way and watched as the person he was charged with guarding stepped into a steel cage with a man brown barely knew the door slid shut and somewhere behind the thick walls brown could hear the electric motor of the elevator kick in this entire trip was quickly becoming a textbook example of how not to run a security detail brown returned to the other two agents and began venting i want you both to write this up before your heads hit the pillow tonight make it very clear that he has prevented us from doing our jobs brown looked back at the elevator and added now go find that staircase and secure it thirty feet beneaththe house the elevator came to a stop the door retracted to reveal a huge underground cavern they stepped onto a hewn stone slab that had been polished to a reflective sheen in front of them was a vault with row upon row of wine racks the dimension of the room and the lack of any support columns shocked ross more than the size of the wine collection joseph was all he managed to say i know it took me three years and it had to be done with the utmost secrecy but why this is zermatt the heart of the environmentalist movement this wine cellar is carved right into the mountain the town would have never granted me permission for such a project it was difficult enough to get my house built i had to bribe and cajole every official and inspector in the valley ross stepped forward and looked into the cavernous room expensive crystal chandeliers hung from the barrel vaulted ceiling every fifteen feet or so racks of wine jutted out from the wall on both sides like pews in a grand church to his immediate left was a door to his right a wine tasting table and four leather chairs how big is it one hundred feet deep by thirty feet wide amazing how did you do it i brought in a family of albanian miners a father and four sons how many bottles from the shadows a voice answered thirty thousand give or take a few midway down the cavern a man stepped from between the racks he was wearing a blue blazer with gold buttons and an opencollar white shirt his hair was brown and slicked back which made it appear darker than it actually was he was of average height tan and overweight in a way that could be attributed more to indulgence than neglect his nose was by far the most prominent feature on an otherwise forgettable face what are you holding there speyer asked with uncharacteristic concern creeping into his voice ohthis the man flipped the bottle up in the air it turned end over end twice and he caught it speyer gasped his entire body going rigid please tell me that is not one of my fortytwo rothschild château moutons no its one of your fortyone château moutons the man spoke with a slight new york accent isnt that the same year your fathers friends rolled into france they were not my fathers friends and the year was nineteen forty speyer marched forward and took the extremely expensive bottle from the mans hands i thought it was well documented that the nazis carted off the rothschilds private collection during the war it just seems a bit of a coincidence that the son of a swiss banker would be in possession of so many rare bottles of wine i can assure you said a slightly more calm speyer that i paid for every bottle of wine in this cellar most of it with the fees i earn by hiding your vast fortune from the us government the man with the new york accent smiled broadly showing a set of freshly capped white teeth you are worth every penny joseph now how about we open one of these rare bottles in celebration of our victory the banker hesitated for a second and then said i think that is a wonderful idea an absolutely wonderful idea speyer was now nodding with enthusiasm i will decant it and in the meantime i will find something significantly less expensive and infinitely more suitable to your boorish american palate speyer sauntered off leaving the two americans alone cy you look well cy green was born in new york in to jewish immigrants who had fled hungary as the communists consolidated their power over the country in the wake of wwii hed made his first million by the age of twentyfive and his first billion by the age of thirtyfive thank you replied green ive been on vacation for a long time now ross grinned but didnt dare laugh congratulations on winning the election green said with a raised brow thank you how is my pardon coming were working on it ross said working on it that doesnt sound very convincing cy i cant guarantee that im going to be able to pull this off you were willing to give me guarantees three months ago when you were desperate this is a delicate situation if we push too hard it might backfire if you dont push hard enough it might backfire green said with an edge and i mean really backfire theres no need for threats i have over one billion dollars in assets that have been frozen by the us government my companies in the states are paying fifty thousand dollars a day in contempt of court charges and i have not set foot in the country i love in more than four years my estate in palm beach my penthouse in new york my mansion in beverly hillsall of them have been seized by the feds my own children arent even allowed to step foot in my homes the mix of vodka and recent success made ross a bit braver than he normally would have been maybe you should have thought of some of this before you started trading with the enemy not to mention committing fraud and tax evasion dont lecture me on the intricacies of multinational corporations green snapped i am the victim of an overzealous prosecutor if thats the case you should meet him in court with an army of highpriced lawyers and show him for the hack that you claim him to be green was not used to anyone speaking to him in such a way especially someone who was so indebted to him he was about to blow his lid when speyer returned with two glasses of wine one of your countrymen sent me a case of this caymus vineyards nineteen ninetyfour special selection cabernet a perfectly fine table wine to be served at one of your backyard barbecues but not at one of my parties green took his glass and said joseph i think you will need to leave us alone for a few more minutes certainly i will go put on some music when the host was far enough away greens face twisted into a questioning frown and he said you are either drunk or you have grown awfully proud of yourself its probably a bit of both ross smiled i am after all the vice presidentelect of the united states of america he held up his glass in a toast to himself green ignored the glass and how did you get there do you think for a minute that josh would have picked you for a running mate if his fatherinlaw hadnt told him to do so his fatherinlawmy real estate partner cy lets not make a big deal out of this were green cut him off i told him if we put you on the ticket you could make our problems go away and guess what i got you on the ticket and then i had to save your ass a second time now its your turn to deliver suddenly ross wished he had been sober for this meeting he could use a clear head right about now im sure your partner would find it interesting to know that you had his daughter killed green clenched his jaw and took a half step back i suppose youve deluded yourself into thinking that you played no part in that entire affair i most certainly did i almost died youre unbelievable youre more selfabsorbed than i am ross took a sip of his wine i think we were beginning to close in the polls i think we could have i think youre an idiot snapped green you were not closing in the polls and even if you had been they would have released the photos of jillian that little slut giving a blowjob to a damn secret service agent now the american people might have loosened their morals a bit over the years but they sure as hell arent about to accept a whore as their first lady those photos could have just as easily backfired if they had released them you really are delusional green laughed need i remind you of the frantic phone call i received from you with one month to go in the campaign your pit bull of a campaign manager had received the photo of jillian having the sword put to her by the hired help he was a secret service agent exactlyand on the back of that photo someone had written the words youll never win do you remember the phone call you made do you remember that you were practically in tears do you remember saying we should have the bitch killed green was five inches shorter and he got right up in rosss face go right ahead and convince yourself that you had nothing to do with this its probably a good place to be when youre dealing with other people but when youre with me drop the attitude youre a motherfucker just like i am the only difference between the two of us is that im under no illusion to the contrary i have devoted the last twelve years of my life to public service and i most certainly youve devoted your entire life to yourself you didnt run for the senate because you wanted to help people you ran for the senate to feed your ego so dont stand here and try and sell me a load of crap i know exactly who you are even if you dont you know cy a little gratitude might go a long way gratitude for what for being allowed to stand in your presence are you fucking kidding me the only person who should be showing any gratitude right now is you im the one who got you elected you havent done shit ill show you my gratitude when you get my pardon signed a week from today ross nodded im working on it but we might need more time you dont get more time you assured me you could get president hayes to sign the pardon so get him to sign it next saturday with all the others ill make it happen ross said because he knew it was the only answer green would accept wanting to change the direction of the conversation he asked the man you hiredhave you taken care of him yet im working on it why the fbi knows he exists do they know he was the trigger man no but its not worth leaving it up to chance he needs to be taken care of dont worry about him green pointed a finger at ross just worry about getting me my pardon ross took a big gulp of wine and smiled he had no guarantees that he could get green his pardon in fact if he had to guess it was more likely that president hayes would turn them down flat which would mean that josh alexander would have to start out his term with an extremely controversial pardon either way this would not be easy there was one other option that occurred to ross he looked into greens eyes and held up his glass to your pardon to my pardon green clanged his glass against rosss ill drink to that ross smiled and thought to himself and may you die of some tragic accident before next saturday limassol cyprus rapp was careful to stand back from the window he looked through the telephoto lens and adjusted the focus a second man entered the frame rapps right index finger pressed the trigger halfway down and the digital camera automatically adjusted the focus he pressed the button all the way down and snapped off two quick images with a deep exhale he lowered the camera but kept his eyes on the street a frown creased his brow and he said who the fuck are these guys hed been asking himself that question since midafternoon and he wasnt any closer to an answer the photos had been sent back to marcus dumond at langley so he could run them through the facial recognition system but so far theyd come up with nothing the system worked well when you could narrow the parameters a bit but rapp didnt have a clue where these guys came from or for whom they worked rapp told dumond to start with the assumption that they were local cops so the cyber tech hacked into the limassol police department database dumond ran through the personnel files and came up with nothing then it was on to the national police and after that the hellenic national intelligence service again they came up with nothing rapp had spent time in cyprus before most of it in nicosia the capital of the greek side of the island the northeastern side was controlled by the turks geographically cyprus had occupied a position of great strategic importance throughout history it dominated the eastern end of the mediterranean for thousands of years the island had been fought over due to its value in controlling the sealanes between europe the middle east and north africa the phoenicians assyrians greeks persians egyptians romans arabs the frankish lusignan dynasty venetians ottoman turks and many lesserknown countries had all controlled the island at one point or another throughout recorded history because of its significance to the trade routes the island had also long been favored by outlaws real pirates and slave traders and their modern day cousins narco traffickers mafiosi and now terrorists after it was discovered that cyprus was one of osama bin ladens favored banking venues the island was famous for its seedy underbelly which only deepened the mystery of who these guys might be the only thing rapp did know for sure was that he had spotted three of them to do really good surveillance you needed bodies and gadgets rapp was in short supply of both at the moment hed sent brooks to pick up coleman and his men from the airport he could have asked kennedy to send some bodies from the embassy in nicosia but there was a real downside to going that route it was likely the ambassador would end up catching wind that the cia was running an operation in his backyard which would lead to him throwing a shit fit and calling the state department and then the whole thing was likely to spin out of control the key with these operations was to move slow and stay off everyones radar screen if at all possible on the gadget front rapp wished hed at least brought along a parabolic mike so he could hear what these guys were saying to each other since they were flying commercial rapp had made the decision not to load himself and brooks down with surveillance kits it was hard enough to sneak a gun a silencer and two extra clips of ammunition into a country the electronic listening devices scopes cameras scanners and parabolic mikes took up a lot of room and raised a lot of eyebrows it simply wasnt the type of stuff newlyweds brought on their honeymoon coleman and his boys were in charge of transferring that stuff and they were doing it under the guise of a director doing location scouts for a film they had business cards with the name of a development company an address in beverly hills and a phone number with a area code that was answered by a woman in langley virginia the sun was setting over the eastern mediterranean there was maybe another ten minutes of sunlight at best in this part of old town the streets were narrow and winding so the shadows were already falling across large areas of the street and sidewalk cafés below the hotel was four stories high and rapp was on the top floor the contact in istanbul had said the man they were looking for used a front company called aid logistics inc the office of which was located on the third story of the stone building directly across the street the first floor was the café and the second floor was a real estate company there was no alley behind the building so the only way in was through the front door of the café and then up the stairs to the right rapp knew this because hed visited the real estate office earlier in the afternoon and walked to the landing between the second and third floors before coming back down rapp watched an old man come out of the café located below aid logistics inc and the real estate office as best rapp could figure this guy was the owner he wore a white apron and doled out a lot of orders to the wait staff the man walked down the sidewalk to where the sedan was parked and began talking with the two occupants this was the first time rapp had seen the old man converse with these guys stakeouts all had their own vibe their own rhythm most of them were literally as boring as watching paint dry sometimes the subject knew he was being watched and he tried to lull you to sleep so he could make his move thats what the real pros did you could watch them all day and have no idea that theyd done two dead drops and a pickup it was like they had eyes in the back of their heads which was partially true like wayne gretzky gifted hockey players had a birdseye image in their mind of where everyone was on the ice at all times the great spies had the same ability but in an infinitely more complex and dangerous game they remembered faces and shoes and pants things that were hard to change they ignored hats glasses jackets and facial hair things that were easy to change they cataloged each face that passed them and anticipated not just the actions of those in front of them but those behind them even people they couldnt see very few criminals were actually that good most had no idea they were being watched but more importantly they knew on some level they were doing something illegal and in many of these countries they were doing something that could result in having their head separated from the rest of their body under this type of pressure it was next to impossible to stay relaxed and normal as you prepared to do whatever it was that might get you killed whether it was making a dead drop meeting a contact or preparing to grab someone it didnt matter peoples body language changed their pace quickened and their moves became more rushed and sporadic rapp had noticed the pace of things below begin to pick up over the last hour or so he was watching the body language of the café owner and the other man standing next to the car he was trying to read their lips but he couldnt make out what they were saying it did look like they were speaking english though which rapp found interesting rapps mobile phone started ringing it was lying on the bed but he didnt bother to leave the window he had a tiny motorola wireless earpiece stuck in his right ear with his longer hair it was nearly impossible to detect the device which picked up his voice through vibration in the ear canal rapp tapped the end of the device and asked whats up we just landed it was scott coleman rapp wanted to ask him what in the hell had taken so long but he didnt bother brooks rented a blue minivan shes waiting at the curb were stuck on the tarmac what do you mean stuck theres another plane at our gate we cant pull up to the gate until it leaves and then we have to wait for our luggage rapp watched the big man standing next to the car put his arm around the older man in the apron as the big guy moved to put something in the shirt pocket of the old guy rapp pressed the trigger on the camera and held it all the way down the camera clicked off six photos in quick succession the big man then patted the café owner on the cheek several times before releasing him rapp frowned as he watched the older man walk back into the café he looked down at the viewing screen on the back of the camera and toggled back a few frames he then increased the zoom until he could see what the man had placed in the owners pocket it was cash cops for the most part didnt go around stuffing cash in peoples pockets especially in this part of the world where they could throw someone in jail for a week by simply making up a reason did you hear me asked coleman yeah rapp looked at the horizon nightfall was fast approaching and when the darkness came something was going to happen have one of your guys wait for the luggage i need you to get your ass here asap retsina is a greek wine that is preserved with pine resin to some deluded greek nationalists it is the wine of the gods to anyone who has ever tasted a decent bottle of french bordeaux retsina is about as enjoyable as drinking turpentine gazich hated retsina and so did andreas the old mans promise that he would set aside his best bottle of retsina could have been taken as an attempt at humor one friend ribbing another but andreas did not stay on the line to listen to his tenants response he didnt even laugh he hung up right after taking his shot that was not andreass style he liked to goad and tease something was wrong gazich could feel it his house was in the hills on the outskirts of limassol he was tempted to go there first but he resisted the urge he had the cab drive him by his office nice and slow but not too slow he saw the man sitting behind the wheel of the parked car and the other man on the sidewalk gazich then asked the driver to take him to the amathus beach hotel where he checked into a room cleaned up and plotted his next move gazich was not someone who was quick to anger he was more apt to stew over things and let them come to a boil that was what happened while he ate his dinner on the private balcony of his hotel room in his mind it was already a foregone conclusion that these assholes who had hired him had decided to go back on their word there was a chance that the law had come looking for him but it was slim gazich had followed the fbis investigation in the press and their was no mention of them looking for a lone trigger man everything coming out of washington suggested that they were going after several terrorist groups gazich did not have a complete sense of the fbis capabilities but he did know it was next to impossible for them to run an investigation without leaking to the press running would be the smart thing to do he had over three million stashed in various banks around europe and the mediterranean invested properly he could live in relative luxury in any third world country of his choosing for the rest of his days he had grown attached to cyprus though his house his office the lax banking laws it was the perfect fit an island nation unto itself the more gazich thought about it the angrier he became and not just at his doublecrossing employer but at himself why had he been in such a rush to take their money the answer was obvious the money he should have followed that old axiomif it sounds too good to be true it probably is there was the issue of andreas and his family to consider gazich could only guess what kind of pressure was being put on him they were good people trying to make an honest living and now they were sucked into this lethal drama the easy thing for gazich would have been to leave the island hop on the first ferry in the morning and forget about cyprus his assets and the friendships hed forged there but he was tired of running for over ten weeks hed been packing and unpacking every few days running may have been the smart thing to do but it was also the cowardly thing to do gazich was no coward never had been never would be he knew he was a thrill seeker someone who needed action someone who often liked to choose the path of most resistance he did it to test his skills he did it to prove that he was better than all the others he needed to prove he was king of the jungle in dc he had gone elephant hunting here on cyprus he was going to turn the tables on the hunters the objective was survival the side game would be to kill these men without getting caught or even raising the attention of the local authorities one more body dumped in the mediterranean was nothing although a couple of men killed on the sidewalk in front of andreass café might actually be good for business either way the end game was to find the man or men who had hired him and kill them that was the only way to finish it the tricky part would be keeping one of these guys alive long enough to get something useful out of him gazich checked his watch it was a saturday night which in limassol meant the dance clubs and bars would get hopping soon he would have to make one stop and then by the time he arrived at the café things would be nice and busy these men would never know what hit them as darkness fell on the old part of town things seemed to come to life music floated up from the cafés below people were heading in every direction darting across the street dodging the scooters taxis and cars laughter and lively conversation could be heard as couples and groups lined up at the various establishments to wait for a table rapp kept the lights off in his room the window was actually a skinny french door that opened inward a black ornamental railing ran from waist height to the floor providing the illusion of a balcony to help fight boredom and keep himself alert rapp dropped to the floor every fifteen minutes and did either pushups or situps the alternative was drinking profuse amounts of coffee but that also meant frequent trips to the bathroom he still had five pounds to lose from his sixmonth binge so he opted for the exercise his eyes casually swept the scene from one end of the block to the other every vehicle and pedestrian was noted he paid special attention to those heading in to the café across the street and of course the man sitting in the car near the café earlier in the day he spotted the other two men getting off the elevator in the hotel lobby until reinforcements arrived all rapp could really do was sit and wait hed spoken to coleman twice since he and his men had landed he was finally in the van with brooks and on his way here rapp checked his watch it was eight minutes past nine they should be arriving any minute a car horn sounded at the far end of the street rapp shifted from one side of the open window to the other and scanned the scene a man and a woman were standing in the middle of the oneway street the man was flipping off the driver of the car and screaming in greek from rapps angle he spotted a lone man enter the picture on the far sidewalk something about this guy made rapp give him a second look he was dressed in the hip nightclub style of the younger generation with faded and ripped designer jeans retro track shoes a blue warmup jacket and a john deere baseball hat the baseball hat was pulled down low the collar on his jacket was turned up and he had his hands stuffed in the pockets his head was slowly almost imperceptibly sweeping from left to right rapps mind thought back to those twentyseven seconds of surveillance footage from the starbucks in georgetown the average person could glean very little from that tape but for rapp it was a treasure trove of informationa virtual admission of guilt by the mystery man captured buying an espresso at first glance the man on the tape seemed very casual rapp looked at things a little differently though like a magician watching another magician rapp knew what to look for because he had been there before in a foreign land on an operation trying to bide time until the hit took place he had acted in almost the same manner baseball hat pulled down low to block surveillance cameras physical demeanor relaxed yet alert eyes always scanning and on guard is that you alexander rapp whispered to himself while he leaned back slightly without taking his eyes off the man rapp brought the camera to his eye and snapped a few photos as the man approached the moment of truth was fast approaching would he turn into the café and go to his office or would he circle the block and check things out rapp knew what he would do and was slightly disappointed when the man stopped in front of the café he started talking to the old man who was standing at the hostess stand rapp had a sudden pang of anxiety he needed this guy alive with his back to him rapp could now see the mans warmup jacket had a white adidas logo across the back rapps eyes slid to the man sitting no more than forty feet away in the parked car he hadnt moved a muscle the guy in the adidas jacket lit a cigarette and continued talking to the old man then kissed him on both cheeks and walked away everything about the guy matched the surveillance footage except the cigarette but then again he wouldnt have been able to smoke a cigarette while waiting in line at a starbucks in the united states the man in the john deere hat threaded his way through a few pedestrians who were waiting to get into the café rapp relaxed a bit but kept an eye on him he lowered the camera and wondered if this was actually the guy he was after or if he was reading too far into things he rubbed his eyes and checked his watch again when he looked back down at the street he saw something totally unexpected the man in the adidas jacket suddenly veered toward the parked car with the guy sitting in the front seat rapp hastily brought the camera up and hit the auto focus button the image of the pedestrian and the car came into focus the glow of the street lamps threw off enough light that he could see what was going on but rapp worried that there might not be enough light for the camera to capture any clear images suddenly the pedestrian began waving to the guy sitting in the parked car as he got closer to the vehicle he casually bent over so he could see through the open drivers side window it was a oneway street and the car was parked facing the café on the same side of the street the man in the car was sitting in the front passenger seat probably so he had more legroom rapp realized what was going on only a second or two before it happened he twisted the lens as far as it would go and held the trigger down the highspeed digital camera began clicking away at the rate of six frames per second in the faint light he glimpsed the man in the hat reaching into the car and then there was an eversobrief flash not the white flash of a camera but the yellow flash of a muzzle rapp took his finger off the cameras trigger and stood completely still he didnt want to miss what would happen next three seconds went by and then five rapp counted to ten and the man in the hat was still at the car window chatting away moving his hands like he was telling an involved story rapp lowered the camera and said youre talking to a dead man arent you he shook his head and said youre going to stand there and act like nothing happened and then youll slowly put your gun back in your pants and walk away rapp watched all of this unfold with sincere professional admiration this guy had a set of balls on him what he had just witnessed verified his suspicions the terrorists who paid to have alexander and ross killed were not happy with the services alexander deckas had provided them and now they wanted him dead it was not unusual in this line of work in a sense the business arrangement was a bit like a man leaving his wife for the woman hes been having an affair with the fact that the same man decides to then cheat on the woman he originally cheated with should surprise no one least of all the woman herself rapp watched as the assassin stood up and stepped away from the car he then waved at the dead man sitting in it and started back down the street rapp quickly glanced back toward the café to see if anyone was following him the big guy hed spotted earlier in the day was nowhere to be seen only the old man appeared to notice what had just happened rapps eyes glided back to the man in the john deere hat he expected him to turn the corner and vanish maybe lose the jacket and hat and come back around for a shot at the other two should they appear the urge to follow was strong but with so many unknowns it was not wise this was deckass neighborhood he would know every crack and crevice and there was no telling who he might have working for him the assassin surprised rapp by entering the last building on the street it looked like it was probably an apartment building what the fuck rapp muttered to himself he scanned the apartment building and noted the windows where lights were on after thirty seconds not a single light had been turned on or off something told rapp it would be a good idea to move further away from the window he took two steps back if this guy had a night vision scope he could be sitting in one of the dark apartments scanning the hotel to see who was watching if rapp were in his shoes that was exactly what he would be doing rapp took another step to the side and looked at the screen on the back of the camera using his right thumb he spun the wheel and scrolled through the photos when he got to the right sequence he tightened the frame the quality wasnt great but he could make out what looked like an arm coming through the window of the car and extending across the front seat he went back one more photo and the screen went bright with a muzzle flash suddenly everything was much clearer rapp could now make out a gun with a silencer attached to the end this had to be alexander deckas and if he knew about the guy in the car it was likely he knew about the other two men who were looking for him that was where his focus would beeither trying to avoid them or coming to kill them based on what he had just witnessed rapp felt it was the latter but why the apartment building rapp thought back to the big guy who earlier in the day he had spied stuffing money in the shirt pocket of the old man who ran the café the old man did not appear overjoyed to be talking to the goon it was likely that they had leaned on him probably threatened him in some way the old guy had several choices at that point play along go to the authorities or tip off his tenant and if the tenant was in fact alexander deckas or whatever his real name was and the old man knew what he did for a living why wouldnt he go to him rapp had just watched him dispatch a hired gun in the middle of a busy commercial district without raising even the slightest suspicion rapps thoughts were interrupted by the ringing of his phone he assumed it was coleman or brooks so he pressed the button on the earpiece and said where are you guys its marcus mitch marcus dumond was a computer expert who worked counterterrorism for langley whats up asked rapp i just spoke to a buddy at the dgse dumond was referring to the direction generale de la securité exterieure france s top external intelligence organization they have a line on this alexander deckas they say his real name is gavrilo gazich hes a bosnian who cut his teeth during that nasty little thing they had over there rapp stepped away from the wall and looked out the window lovely what else did they tell you hes wanted in the hague for war crimes rapp asked somewhat surprised how old is he thirtyfive well he couldnt have been more than a grunt when they were killing each other back in the midnineties rapp checked the windows on the apartment building across the street why in the hell would they mess with someone so far down the chain of command he was a sniper i guess he shot over fifty civilians when they laid siege to sarajevo rapps entire body went rigid for a split second and then he casually walked away from the window it took him a few seconds before he even took a breath and then he swore out loud whats wrong asked dumond next time you might want to get to that part first what part never mind rapp growled what else do you have on him hes rumored to have operated in africa mostly the east side sudan ethiopia uganda but they dont have anything concrete on him how about a photo yeah but its not very good good enough to give us a match on the surveillance tape not a definite but it doesnt exclude him either all right send this stuff over to the africa division and see what they have on him will do and see if you can get the evidence the hague has on him i want to know how good of a shot he is ill get on it good work marcus rapp pressed the button on the earpiece and disconnected the call very few things rattled him but snipers were one of them sneaky little bastards the good ones could kill you from nearly a mile away that was hardly a fair fight rapp sat motionless in the dark hotel room and tried to process the new information would this guy have any idea rapp was looking for him the answer was probably not rapp had been very careful and other than colemans team and a few select people in washington no one knew he was on the case rapp wondered if there was a chance these other guys had worked with gazich in the past maybe but for some reason rapp doubted it these assassins were usually loners out of necessity they couldnt afford to trust anyone else rapp had met the type before former soldiers and paramilitary types who always performed better on their own than they did within a unit rapp knew because he was one of them then there were also what the cia euphemistically called thugs drugs and outlaws guys who came out of the ranks of organized crime and the drug cartels these guys typically didnt operate alone they traveled in packs like hyenas it was the old man he was the key these goons whoever they were had leaned on him and like a good greek the old man played along all the while plotting their demise he alerted his tenant who just happened to be an assassin that these guys were looking for him and now the problem was in the process of going away in a very permanent manner what would gazichs next move be if he was in fact a trained sniper his options were plentiful the specter of this guy sitting on the rooftop of the apartment building with a highpowered rifle and night scope made the hair on the back of rapps neck stand up it occurred to rapp that the other two guys probably were not as disciplined as he was it was likely that they were sitting around with the lights on watching tv and waiting for their guy on the street to let them know the target had showed up rapp moved to the edge of the window and looked down at the car he could barely make out the silhouette of the dead man sitting in the front seat nothing had changed no one had gone down to investigate with only his left eye peering out from the edge of the curtain rapp scanned the roofline of the apartment building that gazich had entered a few minutes ago everything looked normal at least as far as he could tell but a good sniper would have no problem concealing his position the possibility occurred to rapp that the other two guys might already be dead if the angle was right and they had their window opened like rapp did it would be an easy shot rapp was scanning the rooftop again when a flash of movement caught his eye someone was on the roof next to the apartment building rapps room was on the fourth floor of the hotel all of the buildings across the street were three stories high and their flat roofs pretty much matched up to within a few feet of each other rapp saw the movement again someone was moving from rapps left to right toward the café rapp leaned out to get a better look and saw a shadowy figure make the short hop from the building onto the roof where gazichs business was located rapp smiled as he realized his instincts had been correct when hed checked out the building earlier in the day he questioned why their guy would set up shop on the third floor of a building that had no side or back alley the only way out was through the front door not exactly code back in the states but over here where the streets had been laid out thousands of years ago they had to make do it was almost unthinkable for a guy like gazich to back himself into a corner with no avenue of escape the answer was that he hadnt gazichs escape route was the roof from there his options were plentiful rapps eyes searched the darkness for more movement but there was none the roof was dotted with airconditioning units as well as some ventilation pipes and a few other things he assumed gazich was hiding behind one of them or that he had crawled over to the edge where there was a lip suddenly the front left window on the third floor lit up a few seconds later the silhouette of a man appeared on the cream colored shade rapp realized the access hatch must be located behind one of the airconditioning units why the hell would you turn on that light rapp asked himself the silhouette moved about disappearing and then coming back into view it looked like he was gathering something even so gazich had to know these guys were watching him this made no sense he could have easily snuck in used a small penlight to get what he needed and go back out through the roof without anyone ever knowing hed been there rapp was stuck on the stupidity of this when he suddenly realized what was going on there was almost no time to react grabbing his phone off the bed he stuffed his arms into his jacket and rushed for the door russians gazich growled to himself goddamn russians he stood bent at the waist his forearms draped across the open windowframe of the car his gun dangling out of site in his right hand gazich hated russians almost as much as he hated muslims the two groups had ruined his ethnic homeland the muslims with their allornothing backward religion and the russians with their arrogant clumsy bullying pagan ways bosnia could have been so much more if only theyd left her alone but of course they hadnt the muslims had encroached from the southeast and the russians from the northeast the muslims did so slowly over centuries while the russians swept in after wwii and took everything by force while western europe flourished communist yugoslavia suffered the russians were now gone and the muslims had either been killed or turned into refugees gazich looked at the dead man and resisted the urge to spit on him leaving dna at the scene of a crime was not a wise move he had shot the man once in the heart and then a second time because he was so pissed hed wanted to shoot him in the head but given the relatively public environment he was in it was illadvised the man even smelled russian he reeked of cheap cologne and unfiltered cigarettes what are youkgb or russian mob not that theres a big difference anymore i should shoot you again gazich muttered he honestly didnt know what upset him more the mans nationality or that the people who had hired him to do the job in the states thought so little of him that they had sent a russian to kill him gazich casually took a drag of his cigarette and slipped the tip of the silencer into the waistband of his pants with his right hand he pulled the bottom of his jacket over the gun he spotted a small twoway radio on the seat and decided it might come in handy after stuffing it in his pocket he stood and took a step back as he waved goodbye to the dead man he pushed the gun further into his pants and looked up at the hotel across the street and to his left about half the rooms were lit up gazich had surreptitiously stopped by the café owners house earlier in the day he had come in through the garden even though he doubted the russians had enough men to watch both his office and the old mans house gazich told andreas that he was sorry hed been caught up in the middle of this andreas accepted the apology and then eagerly agreed to do whatever he could to rid himself of these russians he told gazich everything he knew about them including the fact that they had two rooms on the third floor of the hotel directly across the street a quick survey of the windows told gazich they were every bit as lazy as he expected them to be no one was keeping an eye on the street who knew with russians there was a very good chance they were already drunk the bosnian stuffed his hands in his pockets and started down the street with renewed anger part of him wanted to march over to the hotel kick in their door and shoot them in the head but as tempted as he was he needed to talk to them he needed to find out who had sent them two doors down gazich entered an apartment building and proceeded to the top floor at the back of the building in a maintenance closet there was a metal ladder screwed into the wall gazich climbed it and popped the hatch that led to the roof he pulled himself up lowered the hatch and started working his way toward his building he stayed in a crouch not because he was worried that someone would see him but because he was afraid hed walk into a clothesline a minute later he knelt next to the hatch that accessed his building gazich lifted it up and descended into the darkness closing the hatch behind him he was now in the center hall at the rear of the building he walked toward the front and pulled out his cell phone he punched in the number for the café and after a few rings one of the daughters answered a half a minute after that the patriarch was on the phone hello the old man answered andreas had told him the phones were tapped but at this point gazich didnt care andreas it is me alexander how are you gazich slid his key into his office door and turned the lock fine my friend are you coming to see me yes in fact im up in my office gazich hit the light switch i have a little work to do and then ill be down for a drink good ill see you when i see you gazich put his phone away and looked around his office everything was not as he had left it they had tried to put things back but they were too sloppy to do it right in addition to the slight disorder he could smell their cigarettes they had been so arrogant they actually smoked while pilfering his stuff gazich continued surveying the room there was a large wood desk with the usual stuff on top a lamp an old rolodex computer monitor keyboard mouse and phone the walls were lined with bookcases gazich turned to look back at the door that was when he noticed something it was a motion sensor placed just above the trim board by the floor good he said aloud we can get this over with sooner rather than later gazich grabbed the twoway radio and clipped it to his belt next he moved the coat rack next to the desk and draped his jacket around the top pegs to finish it off he set his baseball hat on top and turned on the desk lamp the radio on his hip crackled to life and a male voice began speaking in russian gazich didnt know russian but he didnt need to he knew what they were asking two similar radios sat in a charger on the bookcase across from the desk gazich grabbed one turned it on and set it to the same channel as the one hed take from the dead russian next he held them within inches of each other and pressed the transmit buttons highpitched feedback squawked from each box creating an extremely irritating noise gazich released the transmit buttons and walked back out into the hallway he closed the frosted glass door and inspected his work the silhouette of the jacket and hat on the coat rack wasnt perfect but it would be enough to confuse them the twoway erupted again with an angry russian voice yelling what gazich guessed were curses the bosnian held the devices next to each other one more time and let loose a blast of feedback as he walked to the window he pressed the button one more time and then turned his attention to the entrance of the hotel across the street five seconds later two large men came tearing out the front door shoving a pedestrian out of their way one of them was still struggling with his jacket a shoulder holstered pistol clearly visible against his offwhite shirt with pure professional disdain gazich shook his head and positioned himself for the ambush rapp turned the phone to vibrate mode dialed colemans number and stuffed the phone in the breast pocket of his coat as he grabbed the door handle with his right hand his left hand slid around to the small of his back and gripped the handle of his glock pistol rapp drew the weapon and looked through the peephole to make sure no one was waiting outside his door with the gun at the ready he flipped the dead bolt and opened the door a stubby suppressor added another three inches to the gun he did a quick check of the hallway slid the gun into a specially designed pocket on the inside right side of his jacket and moved out rapp bypassed the elevator and went straight for the staircase as he opened the fire door colemans voice came over his wireless earpiece brooks says were five to ten minutes out traffics pretty bad this whole damn thing might be over by the time you get here rapp had just reached the first step when he heard a commotion from below what do you mean it might be over coleman asked rapp couldnt answer right away two men burst into the stairwell one floor beneath one of them was speaking loudly in russian he recognized one of them as the man who had shoved money in the old mans shirt earlier in the evening it was exactly as rapp had feared gazich had already killed one of them and now he was drawing these two into a trap whats going on coleman asked rapp waited for the two men to get to the second landing before he whispered his reply i think weve got an unsatisfied customer what in the hell are you talking about ill explain it when you get here rapp started down the stairs that is if im still alive slow down mitch youre not making any sense tell brooks to call marcus so he can bring her up to speed on who this deckas guy really is and tell him the guys in the surveillance photos are russian rapp hit the next flight where are you rapp glanced over the railing as the two men hit the first floor landing im in the hotel following two russian idiots who are about to get killed just wait until we get there the men hit the fire door hard and burst into the lobby you dont think i can take care of myself rapp bounded down the steps two at a time now that he was the only one in the stairwell thats not what i said youre going into this blind with no backup that is not what i would call a prudent tactical decision rapp laughed you seals are all such pussies dont make this about some macho bullshit just hang tight for a few more minutes as rapp hit the first floor landing he could hear coleman yelling at brooks to step on it he pushed the fire door open and entered the lobby two minutes okay coleman pleaded sorry buddy the train is leaving the station i need to make sure these idiots dont all kill each other rapp walked casually through the lobby so as to not raise any unwanted attention this was not difficult due to the fact that everyone was staring at the two bulls squeezing through the turnstile door just stay on the line rapp said and ill keep you appraised as best i can rapp calmly smiled at the bellman as he reached the door out in front of the hotel one of the russians was stopped in the middle of the street trying to get the attention of his friend sitting in the parked car the other russian was already across the street and yelling at the man to follow him rapp continued to give coleman the tactical update as he waited for a car to pass he watched as the russians bullied their way through the crowd of people waiting to get into the café rapp moved to the left and crossed between a row of parked scooters he avoided the dozenplus people standing by the hostess stand while all of the patrons were focused on the commotion caused by the two rude men shoving their way through the crowd rapp stepped over the sagging faded velvet rope that formed the perimeter of the patio he discretely threaded his way through the tight tables and bobbed his head to avoid the corners of table umbrellas rapp checked the patio to see if the old man was about but he was nowhere to be found this thing was going to go one of two ways either bad or good rapp was not exactly sure how he was going to proceed but he had a rough idea what his rules of engagement were going to be the russians were now pressing through the front door of the restaurant through the large plate glass window rapp watched them start up the stairs to the right with a dose of caution he slid through the front door and resisted the urge to follow them going up a set of stairs blind like this was a good way to get shot which rapp presumed was exactly what was about to happen to them straight ahead the old man was conversing with a table of customers but it was obvious his concern was elsewhere he kept looking up at the stairs rapp turned to his left there were two tables between the bar and the front window the bar ran a good thirty feet taking up the front third of the restaurant in the back and to his right there were more tables the customers were stacked three deep at the bar and virtually every single person had a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other the place was loud plaster walls with a tin ceiling and tile floor wood tables and wood trim lots of hard surfaces as rapp smiled excused and nudged his way through the crowd he kept an eye on the mirror behind the bar two shelves of liquor bracketed the top and bottom of the mirror and in its reflection he could watch both the old man and the staircase rapp did not hear the noise but he did catch the mirror and the bottles shake ever so briefly no more than a second later the liquid in the bottles danced yet again rapp sighed and cracked his neck from one side to the other as he thought about what had just happened upstairs he flexed his fingers extended them and then scrunched them into the palm of his hands one dead for sure probably two dead his left hand slid over to his right wrist and without looking he pressed the stopwatch function on his digital watch next came his breathing it automatically settled into a steady almost hypnotic rhythm he was about ninetynine percent sure the tremors were a result of the russians hitting the ground one after the other as theyd been shot by gazich was there a chance gazich was already climbing onto the roof rapp doubted it the way hed stood next to the car after hed killed the first man suggested he was too cool to turn and run there were also the police to consider simply leaving the bodies lying around would mean the police would show up at some point and they would have a lot of questions rapps bet was that he would stay and clean up his mess someone was still alive upstairs in truth any of the three would do but rapp wanted it to be gazich he was the man who had been standing on the street that day in georgetown someone had hired him to do the job and now they wanted him dead rapp wanted that information and playing it safe wasnt going to get it in life theres the phrase the calm after the storm in war there is the letdown after the battle some people call it an adrenalin hangover elite soldiers train methodically in an effort to reprogram their biology to fight off this letdown it is drilled into them to replenish spent magazines clean weapons and make sure they are battle ready before they so much as relieve themselves in a roadside ditch gazich was not an elite soldier he was a sniper and an assassin he would be focused on other things right now rapp was going upstairs that much hed already decided thered been too much watching and waiting lately the only real question was how long should he wait at least a minute that would allow for the post adrenalin hangover to kick in the old man started to move rapp watched him in the mirror he came toward the front of the restaurant one of the waitresses tried to ask him a question but he ignored her and went straight for the staircase rapp checked his watch and casually pivoted away from the bar he brought his right hand up squinted his eyes and covered his mouth and nose as if he was about to sneeze instead of sneezing he said im going up to his office the steps were worn checkered linoleum tiles turned on their side so as to give the squares a diamondlike appearance black and white with a black rubber cap on the edge of each riser to the left and right the tiles and cap were in good shape but in the middle they were so worn the tan backing of the linoleum was beginning to show through rapp smiled at two women who were standing at the bottom of the steps he placed his hand on the shoulders of one and slid around behind her rapp stayed to the right less noise and almost no chance of being seen until he made the turn at each landing he moved quickly to the first landing assumptionsmore often than not thats what it came down to educated guesses based on reallife experiences were what gave you the edge in these situations rapp pictured what was going on upstairs as he placed each foot carefully on the treads the old man was about five foot eight and weighed close to two hundred pounds on top of that he favored his right side when he walked his hips and knees were probably shit from working on his feet all day and carrying an extra forty pounds around hed make it up one flight all right but the second would really get his heart and lungs going add to that the stress of the situation and there was probably a pretty good chance that by the time he got to the third floor hed be on the verge of cardiac arrest the first landing was no trouble rapp hugged the outside wall and kept moving taking the turn and heading up the next flight to the second floor the last thing he wanted was for one of the waitresses or bartenders to notice him and start yelling for him to come down back pressed flat against the wall he stood completely still and listened below there was light music and loud conversation above there was darkness and silence rapp slid the pistol from its pocket three tiny green dots marked the tritium sights two in back and one in front rapp brought the pistol up and held it next to his face the stubby suppressor pointing at the ceiling the aroma of metal and oil mixed together to create a unique comforting smell there was one more choice to make rapps pistol was currently chambered with a federal hydrashok mm hollowpoint cartridge the ammunition was subsonic and near silent it was perfect for taking care of business in a discreet way but it had one significant drawback the subsonic round had eighty percent less velocity than its supersonic cousin forget body armor the bullet could be stopped by a thick leather jacket at about thirty feet it was not the type of round you wanted to use in a gunfight the problem with the supersonic rounds though was that they were not silent they made a fairly loud snapping noise as they broke the sound barrier rapp glanced down the staircase and remembered how loud it was in the bar area the scale in his mind weighed velocity and stopping power against stealth velocity won rapp switched the pistol from his left hand to his right and hit the magazine release the black magazine dropped into his left hand and he stowed it in his right front pocket rapp turned the weapon on its side placing the butt of the grip against his chest he cupped his left hand over the ejection port and moved his right thumb up under the slide release using his fingertips and the meaty part of his palm he gripped the slide and pushed back until he felt the cold brass of the chambered round fall into his cupped hand at the same time his right thumb pushed up on the slide release and locked the slide in the open position he dropped the loose round into the same pocket as the magazine and fished out a different magazine from his left pocket rapp took the first supersonic round off the top of the magazine and placed it between his front teeth he then quietly slid the magazine into the grip using the palm of his hand to make sure it was locked into place the gun was switched again to the left hand rapp carefully took the single round from his teeth and while pointing the muzzle at the ground he dropped the round into the chamber it was a bit like loading a torpedo into a launch tube grabbing the top of the slide with his right hand he pulled back just enough for the slide release to drop and then slowly let the slide come forward until the breach was closed this wasnt hollywood real shooters carried their weapons hot that meant a round in the chamber none of this racking the slide macho bullshit all that did was slow you down and make a bunch of noise rapps only alternative to this complicated process would have been a soft rack which basically meant putting a fresh magazine in the grip and then carefully letting the slide come forward in a slow controlled motion the problem with a soft rack was that you risked an improperly chambered round which was the last thing you wanted especially when you planned on getting off the first shot rapp gripped the weapon with both hands and extended it pressing both hands away from his body his arms formed a triangle he moved to his right his weight perfectly distributed his footfalls as light as a featherweight boxers he started up the stairs slowly two steps at a time when he reached the landing between the second and third floors he could hear voices a swath of dim light shone on the wall up above rapp guessed it came from gazichs office he stared at the wall for a few seconds to see if he could make out any shadows there were none that meant no one was standing in the doorway to the office rapp listened the voices were faint barely audible he thought it was greek suddenly the silence of the third floor was shattered by an unsettling scream rapp instinctively took a step back his whole body coiled his muscles tensed as he prepared to strike out the scream was followed by a harsh but controlled voice the language was definitely greek the greek was followed by heavy breathing and russian rapp immediately knew what was going on he crouched low and moved forward two steps to get a view of the landing above the first thing he noticed was that the office door was closed the second thing he noticed was a dead man lying on the floor rapp moved halfway up the next flight until he was eye to eye with the dead body lying across the top landing in the poor light rapp couldnt be sure but he thought it was one of the russians the way the guy was positioned rapp figured hed been shot in the right side of his head spun ninety degrees and then crumpled to the floor literally dead before his mass settled against the worn dirty linoleum his eyes were wide open his left hand pinned under his body one leg bent and the other straight rapp doubted the guy even had the time to register the pain of a piece of lead slamming into the side of his head not a bad way to go all things considered rapp paused to take a closer look at the body it was definitely the second russian the one who had stopped in the middle of the street to yell at his friend gazich would have been hiding in the hallway to the right he would have let the first guy pass let him open the door and then he would have shot them one two subsonic rounds from ten maybe twenty feet max first shot to the head of the second guy second shot probably right into the first guys right hip or maybe the knee if he was an exceptionally good marksman the big russian would have gone down hard gazich would have been moving after the first shot he would have closed the distance for the most difficult shot of all he wanted at least one of these guys alive which meant he might have to shoot the gun out of the first russians hand if he didnt drop it after hed been winged rapp was practically lying on the steps now his right hand was out in front of him flat on the tread his left hand held his gun it was angles and inches now hed maximized his position of cover three quarters of the frosted glass office door lay in plain view shadows floated back and forth and at least two distinct voices could be heard one much louder than the other rapp figured that had to be gazich he would be the one asking the questions staying on the stairs was not a good option the position offered minimal cover and left him vulnerable should someone wander up from the café tactically that left two choices either rush the office or move to the relative cover of the hallway rapp made a mental picture of what the office was probably like on the inside they were all pretty much the same a desk a few chairs maybe a couch and some bookcases or a credenza a guy like gazich would never sit with his back to the door that was for sure it was also likely that his main work area would put him in a spot where he could not be seen directly from either window snipers were like that they were always thinking angles and trajectory not just their own but that of their most feared enemyanother sniper with two windows facing the street that left pretty much one place for the desk there was still the old man to consider though there was no way of telling where he might be when the door flew open if he was directly between rapp and gazich he might have to be put down the thought of having to kill a potentially innocent bystander pushed rapp away from one tactic and toward another hovering in nomansland was untenable so rapp made his decision he moved to the top step staying as low as possible and stepped over the dead russian hugging the wall he moved down the corridor a few steps and settled against the outside wall of gazichs office the hallway was like a sewer culvert the farther he went the darker it became rapp looked to the end he could barely make out the dark wood frame of a door against the yellowed plaster walls if the third floor was set up the same as the second floor that was where the bathroom would be and maybe the access to the roof there was one more door directly across the hall from him that was the other office suite rapp had no idea who it belonged to all he cared about was that the place was empty he was thinking of coleman and was about to ask for an eta when gazichs office door opened throwing a splash of light into the dark corridor rapps pistol was up and aimed in the flash of a half second he took three silent steps back retreating farther into the darkness both hands gripping the weapon a solid immovable base three neon green dots lined up in a perfect row the pad of his left forefinger resting gently on the trigger the old man appeared he stepped into the hallway closing the door behind him he stood there for a five count his left hand still holding the doorknob his chin slowly sinking until it rested on his chest it was a posture of contemplation he was a man trying to gather his thoughts before he decided what to do he held the pose for just a second longer and then with a shake of his head he bent over and grabbed the feet of the dead russian the first tug did nothing the second tug moved the body maybe a few inches the third tug was more of an allout yank the old man really leaned into it and the body started sliding across the worn linoleum floor rapp matched him step for step with little worry that he would be detected the old man was preoccupied in thought and deed and probably mostly deaf from working an espresso machine his entire life they retreated almost to the end of the hallway where the old man gave up and dropped the russians lifeless feet they thudded against the floor one of the shoes falling partially off the old man swore and bent over placing his hands on his knees he made no effort to put the shoe back on he was too exhausted he stayed where he was breathing heavily and cursing to himself rapp silently slid the pistol into the inside pocket of his jacket and extracted a folding knife from his belt with one hand he opened the knife and took a step forward he hovered for a second waiting for the old man to make his next predictable move when he finally stood rapp lunged forward clamping his right hand around the mans mouth while pulling him up and nearly off his feet the knife hand came around and rapp pressed the flat edge of the blade against the mans throat dont make a sound rapp whispered his mouth only inches from the mans left ear or ill slit your throat rapp had no idea how involved the old man was in all of this hed had ample time to think about it over the last day he had obviously tipped off gazich about the russians and now he was helping him again but this was not necessarily proof that he had been involved in what had happened in america back in october not by a long shot helping get rid of the bodies was in his own selfinterest regardless of any involvement with gazich he had to run a business and in a resort town like limassol a few dead russians found on your property could spell real trouble then again he could be gazichs business partner complicit in every action maybe he was the one who negotiated the contracts almost anything was possible and until rapp had proof one way or the other the old man would live in no way shape or form was mitch rapp the picture of mental health but through it allthe killings the torturing violence piled upon crueltyhed managed to stay relatively sane the answer lay in the fact that he was different from the men and yes the occasional woman he hunted many of them killed for an idea often the idea was a perversion of islam these were all men no women were allowed to join their crusade of intolerance yes occasionally the palestinians had used female suicide bombers and so had the chechens but they were few others killed for a paycheck like gazich some of them the ones who did their job with precision and avoided harming innocents rapp was indifferent toward gazich was not one of them what he had done crossed the line by leaps and bounds he was a terrorist not an assassin he proved that when he set off the car bomb in georgetown killing nineteen people seriously wounding another thirtyfour and ruining the lives of who knew how many more and who was the target in this case was it a corrupt arms dealer a narco trafficker a sponsor of terrorism no the target was two political candidates and what was their crime did they preach death to islam and the arab world did they advocate the wholesale murder of every palestinian no they did no such thing that was what the mullahs and clerics preached in places like iran and saudi arabia death to america the great satan death to israel nuke the entire zionist state and push the infidels into the ocean these two liberal politicians on the other hand preached tolerance and acceptance every chance they got they advocated real statehood for palestine and sincere respect for religious diversity and what did they get for it they got some crazy islamic fascist like osama and his ilk putting a price tag on their heads rapp still recalled the anger hed felt while sitting in his hotel room in calcutta months before sky news showed footage of the crater left by the car bomb rapp had been up and down that street at least a thousand times from the size of the hole alone he knew it had been a powerful bomb the death count was sure to be high the next set of images provided by sky news came from muslim cities across the middle east and beyond they were all a slight variation on the same theme young men clogged the streets again no women american flags burned molotov cocktails were thrown at us embassies cars were torched and men chanted cheered and danced all in celebration that the great satan had been dealt a grievous blow the fact that so many could so brazenly celebrate such a barbarous act snapped rapp back to reality this clash of cultures trivialized his pain and anguish the images on the tv that evening in calcutta crystallized for him what was at stake the only time you ever saw anything like this in america was when detroit won an nba title and they were merely celebrating their home teams victory not the indiscriminate destruction of human life the old man would live that was how rapp was different from gazich he didnt simply eliminate innocent people because they were in the way of his objective yes rapp was capable of restraint when the situation called for it but he was equally capable of committing acts of sheer ruthless violence gazich would die but before he drew his last breath he would talk down on your knees rapp whispered he kept his right hand on the mans mouth and the knife at his throat as the man got down on one knee and then the other im going to take my hand off your mouth rapp whispered but the knife is going to stay at your throat rapp took the point of the knife and jabbed the tip into the fleshy skin just beneath the old mans adams apple the steel point slid through the first two layers of skin drawing a drop of blood thats your voice box keep your mouth shut until i tell you to open it if i see your lips begin to move the knife goes all the way in and i promise you whatever it was that you were going to say is going to die right there in your throat nod if you understand the old man did and rapp decreased the pressure on the tip of the knife rapp could feel the man breathing heavily through his nose listen im not going to kill you unless you give me a reason to just relax and take a few deep breaths keeping the knife at his throat rapp used his right hand to reach down and grab a towel that was stuffed into one of the pockets at the front of the old mans apron rapp looked at it before bunching one end into a ball with his fist open your mouth wide rapp whispered the old man did as he was told and rapp stuffed a third of the towel into his mouth he then made the man lay down flat on his stomach and put his hands behind his back rapp cut the long ties off the apron and used them to hogtie the mans ankles and wrists together when he was secured rapp stowed the knife and drew the pistol rapp showed the gun to the old man and whispered any noise at all and ill shoot you dont try to bang your feet against the wall or roll over otherwise youre a dead man do you understand the old man nodded how many people are in the office blink your answer the old mans eyelids opened and closed twice deckas and the big russian the old man nodded his head up and down is deckas interrogating the russian again he nodded all right sit tight rapp patted the old mans head this whole thing will be over in a minute rapp sprang to his feet and started down the hallway gliding along the right edge gazich would have used a silenced weapon most likely subsonic rounds probably nine millimeter the walls were old probably lattice covered with plaster they would definitely stop a ninemillimeter round subsonic or not maybe even a fortyfive rapp again tried to visualize the layout of the office desk in the middle on the left and a couple of chairs or a couch on the right gazich would be standing and that meant he would have minimal cover the russian would not be a problem he was either immobile from gunshot wounds or tied up if gazich was interrogating him he had probably switched to a knife options increased and techniques varied with a knife rapp stopped one step short of the door his mind was made up on a plan of action it would be lightning fast one two three four he listened for a moment it sounded like gazich was asking a question the russian pleaded with him in broken english his voice much louder and more fearful than that of his inquisitor rapp took all of this as a good sign reaching out he placed his right hand on the doorknob and waited a second as soon as he heard gazich begin to speak he twisted the old brass knob and flung the door inward with a good push he was ninety percent sure gazich was on the right but he had to make sure he wasnt on the left first rapp hugged the door frame as his left hand and gun filled the void of the open doorway the door sailed past ninety degrees revealing the edge of the desk exactly where rapp thought it would be the gun came straight up and locked in a level position the door continued its arc swinging inward on its hinges revealing an empty desk rapp started swinging the gun back to his right at the same time he shifted his weight to his left while hugging the door frame and leaned just enough into the open doorway so his left eye could take in nearly the entire right side of the room while exposing only a fraction of his body gazich came into view first he was standing sideways the russian was in a chair directly in front of him but rapp wasnt worried about the russian rapps eye was locked on gazich a literal tunnel his gun not quite there yet ninetynine percent of his focus on the threat he heard the door bang hard against something as his eye searched gazichs hands the bosnian was turning toward him his hands still at his side he was expecting the old man some recess of rapps brain registered that the door had not opened degrees against the wall so it had probably hit a bookcase or some other piece of furniture the black finish of a gun and its long silencer against the faded denim of gazichs pants caught rapps eye the elevation of rapps left arm dropped immediately gun seeking out gun a tenth of a second later rapp squeezed the trigger letting loose the first shot gazich stood a mere fourteen feet away the round caught him square in the back of his right hand plowing its way through flesh crucial tendons and then bone his hand clenched for a millisecond and then opened like a clamp with a broken spring the brain made none of these decisions it was simply mechanical failure the gun dropped freefalling to the floor but before it hit a second round caught gazich in the right knee and then a third in the left knee for two seconds time stood still nothing moved rapp waited still concealed by the door frame and watched the same way you would watch the demolition of a building that strange moment of disbelief in the immediate aftermath when the explosive charges have just blown out all the support columns yet the building still hangs there for a second or two defying gravity and then physics takes over and everything comes crashing to the ground gazichs legs wobbled his arms began to move away from his body in an effort to provide balance but balance wasnt the problem the problem was two shattered kneecaps it was structural he picked up his right leg to widen his stance and when he put it back down the limb folded like a cheap rental chair at a backyard wedding gazich went down hard somehow managing to get his left hand out in front of him to prevent a face plant he ended up on his side his left hand stretched out a mere four inches from the pistol he had dropped rapp stayed right where he was completely aware of the proximity of gazichs hand to the weapon he watched as gazichs eyes moved from the pistol to the stranger in the doorway rapp knew what was going through his mind so he stepped partially into the doorway and started to lower his weapon his eyes were locked on gazichs rapps pistol almost got to a point where it was perpendicular with the floor but he saw the fingers on gazichs hand open and reach for the weapon rapps pistol came up and a fourth shot spat from the end of the silencer it bored a hole through the center of the assassins palm before it ever reached the gun one two three four just like rapp thought it would be rapp stepped into the room and kept his gun trained on gazichs head he walked over placed his right foot on the gun and slid it back toward the doorway gazich started to move keep your hands away from your body or ill put a bullet in your head the russian took all of this as a sign of his salvation and exclaimed thank god you are here rapp looked at him with a furrowed brow the guys left ear had been partially carved away from his head and the tip of his nose looked like a filleted lobster tail blood cascaded down his face and onto his white shirt untie me my friend rapp didnt move untie me right now the russian demanded rapp leveled the pistol at the russians groin all three green dots in a row shut the fuck up or ill blow your balls off groin injuries could be really messy lots of blood and lots of pain since the russian could barely keep his mouth shut as it was rapp assumed the lout would scream like a stuck pig if he pierced one of his testicles with a ball of lead rapp was not one to make empty threats and the russians inability to keep his mouth shut and follow a simple order was pushing him to the brink he was one of these irritants who liked to think out loud the type who gives a running narrative of the obvious he alternated between muttering to himself and attempting to bribe rapp with riches his volume increasing with each passing moment rapp was on the phone with coleman giving him a quick situation report they were less than a minute out rapp told him to have brooks drop him off in front if anyone tried to stop him from going upstairs he should tell them he was going to meet alexander deckas from aid logistics inc the russian jabbered during the entire conversation rapp had already frisked gazich and now he was rifling through the assassins desk as he finished giving coleman instructions everything was going fairly well except the russian the man simply wouldnt shut up finally coleman asked rapp who was making the racket rapp reached his boiling point he raised his pistol and squeezed the trigger a round spat from the thick suppressor and imbedded itself in the wood seat of the chair a mere two inches in front of the russians crotch the russians eyes opened wide with fear and his mouth hung slack with shock rapp muted the phone walked over stuck the smoking barrel into the russians groin and growled shut the fuck up the russian closed his eyes whimpered for a second and then slammed his mouth shut rapp took the phone off mute and said hurry up i need some help up here with that he jabbed the red end button on the phone and considered his next move he walked over to the door and leaned out into the hallway to check on the old man all he could see was a dark mass on the floor at the far end rapp paused for a second while he did the time conversion ten oclock in cyprus meant it was four in the afternoon in dc kennedy could be anywhere rapp decided to call her secure mobile he punched in the country code area code and then the number it started ringing almost immediately the science and technology people at langley provided the top echelon of employees with the most secure phones available and then installed special encryption software they issued new phones at least once a year if not every six months rapps phones never left the box he didnt trust them and it wasnt because he feared the russians or the chinese it was his own agency and the national security agency that he feared most the full capabilities of the nsa and what they could do with their satellites listening stations and eight cray supercomputers that they kept deep underground in a vast cooled chamber was known to only a select few what rapp did know was that they collected an unbelievable number of foreign calls made into the us every day those calls emanating from the middle east received special attention the nsa acted like a big fishing trawler they threw out their nets reeled them in and then decided what fish to keep except with them it was phone calls emails and other electronic transmissions these were prioritized by criteria like fishermen who throw the worthless fish back into the sea the nsa was getting more efficient at maximizing its resources at the heart of their mission was code breaking it always had been and always would be these billions of intercepts were worthless if they couldnt decipher them rapp knew there were elite teams of brainiacs within the nsa whose sole job was to defeat encryption software as good as the folks at langley s s ampt were the truth was they were no match for the talent that the nsa employed from a patriots perspective one would think none of this should matter after all they were all on the same teamthe cia the nsa the pentagon the department of justice the fbiall americans working to defeat global terrorism the reality was far more complicated just because one administration advocated a certain policy it didnt mean the next one would or that some opportunistic politician on the hill wouldnt seize the chance to grab the limelight by calling for an investigation into any one of a dozen things rapp had done in the last year what a veteran of the clandestine service deemed appropriate action was often very different from what a lawyer at the doj might think and then there were budgets and interagency turf wars in many ways the domestic side of the business was more dangerous than the operating abroad at least when he was in the field rapp knew who his enemies were at home politics and personalities were thrown into the mix and any sense of a unified mission was lost the climate had gotten so bad that rapp couldnt trust his own people at langley the cias own inspector generals office had gotten into the game of leaking things to reporters senior officers were contributing to politicians campaigns spouses were serving on advisory committees for candidates and admin types were regularly dining and rubbing shoulders with journalists lobbyists and political strategists add to that amnesty international and a dozen other human rights groups and you had a climate that was about as unfriendly to someone in rapps position as you could imagine he couldnt even trust his own employer to hand him a secure phone for at the end of the day the inspector generals office could be recording everything he said in rapps mind there was no such thing as a secure line so he went with the odds practically every month he bought a new phone from a major carrier and got a new number and every time he went on a mission like this he picked up a phone that rarely lasted the length of the mission even with all of the precautions he took he was still very careful about what he said he gave only the vaguest information and spoke in generalities when kennedy finally answered rapp did not bother with greetings he simply said i need a plane there was a brief pause what kind of plane the plane almost as if on cue the russian started his running narrative again rapp looked at him the gun in one hand and the phone in the other his palms up and his arms out from his body a couple feet the expression on his face seemed to say you have got to be kidding me the russian said i work for the kgb through his earpiece rapp heard kennedy ask who is that rapp said give me a second he pressed the mute button on the phone and moved around to the side of the russian i told you to keep your mouth shut you stupid fucker i am russian intelligence former kgb we are on the same side now america and russia gazich was immobile on the floor and no doubt in a great deal of pain as the adrenaline wore off and he was left with the searing pain of four gun shot wounds to extremely sensitive areas of his body despite his less than humorous situation he started to laugh and said you work for the russian mob i do not the russian shouted gazich laughed harder you are a bitch for the oligarchs and nothing else rapp was standing midway between the russian and gazich if he didnt need to talk to these two morons he would gladly shoot them both in the head just to shut them up the russian was craning his neck looking up at rapp babbling on about his distinguished career with the kgb rapp took another step putting himself off to the russians left side about three feet away rapp pointed across the room and asked you see that computer over there the russian looked away from rapp and fixed his attention on the large offwhite monitor sitting on the desk rapp turned to the side and shifted all of his weight onto his left foot his right leg came up and his torso leaned away from the russian rapps leg hung in the air for a second his hands were pulled in tight gripping the phone and the gun his forearms and fists providing a shield for his upper torso and face he did it out of habit not out of fear of being hit it was years of training a simple side kick done properly it could be delivered with more force than any other blow done poorly it still provided quite a punch rapp hadnt delivered a poor side kick in more than fifteen years the toe of rapps heavy soled shoes was drawn up toward his shin his eyes were locked on the russians chin like the three green dots on the sights of his glock in a flash rapps leg straightenedhis oneinch layered leather heel striking the large chin of the russian the directed force of the blow broke the russians jaw the speed of the kick caused the russians head to move laterally so quickly that his equilibrium was thrown completely out of whack the effect was the physiological equivalent of turning off a light switch the russians entire body went limp and he slumped forward in the chair unconscious his bound hands the only thing keeping him from falling to the floor satisfied with the results rapp took the phone off mute and said sorry about that what is going on kennedy asked a bit irritated nothing you need to worry about rapp looked at gazich and said just get me the plane there was a long pause and then kennedy asked you found him yes youre sure one hundred percent go see marcus tell him he was right about the bosnian hell fill you in on the rest where are you limassol cyprus i think the plane is in eastern europe let me make sure and ill get back to you with an itinerary make it quick i need to get off this rock fast what have you done asked a worried kennedy i havent done anything but theres a third party involved and some of their boys got hurt how bad body bag bad i see this was followed by more silence and then kennedy skeptically asked and you had nothing to do with this rapp never liked to be secondguessed by people who spent their days sitting in comfortable leather chairs behind large important desks while he risked life and limb watch your step he snarled i dont need this shit im over here with a fucking rookie and blondie and his boys have been stuck in airports all day what i need is some serious support right now i need the plane and i need it asap and then im going to need a followup team to come in here and do a little cleaning kennedy should have known by his tone that it was a mistake to question him while he was still in the field theyd been down this road dozens of times and it never ended well she relented by saying ill get back to you with an answer in ten minutes or less one more thing our friends on the other side of the pondthey have a base close by that would be best no customs freight delivery to the back gate make the transfer in a hangar real private no dogooders shooting video absolutely ill arrange it anything else for now that should be enough good great work give me a few minutes to get the pieces moving and ill get right back to you thanks rapp disconnected the call and looked down at gazich hed lost a bit of his color and he was starting to shake a bit rapp knew he hadnt hit any major arteries both by his aim and the lack of blood on the wood floor nonetheless shock was fast approaching gazichs body would be trying to shut certain things down to stave off the excruciating pain rapp had no fear of losing him gazich was young and fit he could take it and he honestly deserved this and a whole lot more rapp squatted down on his haunches and looked gazich in the eye i dont suppose youd like to tell me who hired you the plane was big bigger than they needed but rapp wasnt complaining it was a lockheed martin tristar she was designed to carry up to passengers or pounds of cargo this one with its wide body and three big engines was configured for cargo she was a sister ship to the venerable dc as far as aviation went she was a little long in the tooth from the outside the plane looked like any other international freight carrier there were no windows other than the ones in the cockpit the skin was painted a generic white and the nameworldwide freight ran along the back half of the fuselage in large blue letters the cia had more planes than some small air forces but thanks to a politically motivated hack in the cias inspector generals office rapp couldnt go near them at least not for something like this a little over a year ago this same bureaucrat took it upon herself to tell a reporter that the cia was ferrying terrorists around eastern europe in a gulfstream and a boeing many of these terrorists were high ranking alqaeda operatives they were taken to undisclosed locations and put in uncomfortable situations until they decided to talk which all of them eventually did the information they provided proved invaluable in picking apart alqaedas operational and financial infrastructure that single leak had crippled one of langley s most important operations in the war on terror yet again rapp was forced to stay one step ahead of his own government the strategy with the planes was not very different than the one rapp used with his mobile phones the worldwide aviation market was a vast and intricate association of sellers resellers leasers and lessees carriers were constantly updating their fleets replacing older models with newer more fuel efficient ones that left a surplus of unused aircrafts these planes were often kicked down the line leased and subleased a half dozen times until they either broke down or crashed flying in and out of some wartorn country in africa the big lockheed tristar was still in good shape she had been leased for one month through a company in seattle the company specialized in subleasing planes on a shortterm basis their business model was simple as power companies sold excess power to other utilities these guys leased planes that werent being used during slow times of the year they had no idea the cia was their client everything was done through an attorneys office in frankfurt the pilots were a couple of old us air force colonels who liked cash and knew how to keep their mouths shut rapp stood on the tarmac next to a battered gray royal air force hangar the big tristar was inside the sky in the east was showing the first signs of morning the humid salty mediterranean air rolled in across the flat expanse of the base there was nothing but asphalt concrete dirt and scrub brush for miles in every direction about fifty feet away scott coleman was talking with a british officer who had met them at the back gate fifteen minutes earlier coleman handed the officer something and the man took it then they shook hands and the raf officer jumped in a land rover and sped off coleman walked over slowly shaking his head a grin on his face the retired navy seal said god i love the brits rapp nodded they know how to keep their mouths shut he gets off in a couple hours he said hed leave the van in the airport garage with the keys under the mat all we have to do is call the rental company good and the plane refueled and cleared for takeoff good lets get out of here before the sun comes up the two men turned and walked into the shadowy hangar where rapp was darkhaired and oliveskinned coleman was fairhaired and fairskinned rapp fit in pretty much anywhere in the middle east coleman with his blue eyes and blond hair would have looked more at home in sweden or norway probably iceland as well he had the high cheekbones and the stoic demeanor of the northern tribes the stoic part worked well with rapp less was almost always more especially when it came to conversation coleman like rapp was not one for idle chatter after coleman had arrived at gazichs office he and rapp had taken a moment to figure out a plan of action neither liked the idea of staying put if the police showed up they would have to explain two dead russians another russian who looked like some african tribe had gotten hold of him and a bosnian with four bullet holes in him marching everyone out of the café in the middle of a busy saturday night would also not work sitting tight until the place closed was the best option in order to do that though they would need the old man to cooperate sooner or later someone was sure to come looking for him they untied the old man and sat him down for a talk the big russian was still unconscious and gazich remained silent on the floor despite the obvious pain of his wounds the mans name was andreas papadakos and he was the owner of the building he had met alexander deckas five years ago the man paid his rent in advance every six months he traveled frequently and had never been a problem that was until the russians showed up a few days earlier looking for him they told papadakos that deckas was a hired gun an assassin they told him they worked for the russian state police and they were there to arrest deckas and bring him back to russia for trial the old man asked the russians for identification they told him not to worry so he said he would call the local cops that was when things got ugly papadakos had five daughters who worked for him he had grandchildren coming and going all day sixteen of them the russians had already cased the place and told him if he called the authorities or warned deckas they would dismember his grandchildren one by one up until this point the only real opinion rapp had formed of the big russian was that he was an irritant he even felt a little sorry for the guy now that his face looked like one of those latex masks costume shops sell around halloween after hearing that he had threatened to cut up little children all of rapps sympathy vanished over the years rapp had done a lot of interrogations they ranged from the mundane like talking to a street vendor in damascus about something he may have seen to threatening to blow a mans head off all those years of experience had led to an ability to pretty much tell from the start when someone was being either forthright or deceptive in their answers papadakos denied any knowledge or involvement with deckas furthermore there were the five daughters and the sixteen grandchildren why would he endanger them by getting into business with a guy like gazich in the end the situation dictated what they needed to do involved or not involved papadakos did not want the cops snooping around if rapp found out later that the man and gazich were full business partners he would come back and get him papadakos had spent his whole life in limassol he was not going to simply disappear and leave his business and grandchildren behind so a deal was struck once the café was closed rapp would get rid of the bodies and the old man and his family could go on living their lives as if nothing had ever happened rapp followed papadakos downstairs and kept an eye on him the rest of colemans men showed up a few minutes past all three were former seals who had served under coleman wicker and hacket casually walked up to the sedan with the dead russian in the front seat wicker climbed behind the wheel and hacket got in back wicker started the car put it into drive and slid out of the space fifteen minutes later they found a nice dark alley a little more than a mile away hacket got out and walked it from one end to the other just to make sure it was deserted wicker circled back around drove halfway down the dark canyon and turned off the car the dome light was extinguished and the trunk popped hacket was waiting at the rear bumper snapping on a pair of disposable latex gloves when the trunk lid came up he reached in and yanked the clear plastic cover off the light casing he flicked the cover into the recesses of the trunk and pulled the small bulb out of its slot with darkness restored hacket walked around to the front passenger door and opened it a few feet the body began to fall out of the car hacket placed his left hand on the head of the dead man opened the door the rest of the way and then grabbed the limp body under both armpits he dragged him out of the car and back to the trunk wicker stood on the other side of the car his head slowly turning from one end of the alley and then back the russian was at least pounds but hacket was a solid he hefted the torso into the trunk face down and then picked up the legs and twisted and bent the body the rest of the way in hacket softly closed the lid and they drove away by the time they got back to the café the place was nearly empty parking was not a problem brooks was across the street packing and sanitizing the hotel room coleman and stroble were treating wounds securing the prisoners and going through gazichs stuff looking for information both the big russian and gazich were given morphine rapp sat at the bar drank a glass of wine and kept an eye on papadakos as business slowed and the place began to empty the old man joined rapp at the bar and ordered a bottle of red he drank three glasses in under thirty minutes and ordered another bottle he was clearly anxious to be done with the entire drama at in the morning the last two patrons were shown the door they stumbled off weaving their way down the sidewalk in search of the nightclubs a few blocks over by am the street was pretty still brooks stood watch at one end of the block and wicker the other the big russian was marched down the stairs under his own power the dead russian and gazich needed to be carried they debated wrapping them up in tablecloths but decided the better route was to make it look like they were drunk hacket and stroble carried gazich out first the two former seals bookending the bosnian one under each arm like three drunk sailors on shore leave they stuffed him in the back of the van and then went back for the dead russian he was carried down in the same fashion and placed in the backseat of the car that wicker had driven earlier wicker came back from his post at the end of the block and climbed behind the wheel of the car with one dead russian in the backseat and another one in the trunk he pulled away from the curb with hacket following him in the rental car they had picked up while they waited for their luggage at the airport they were headed back to the same alley the dead russian in the backseat would join the dead russian in the trunk and then wicker would abandon the car in a nice shady spot where with any luck the stench would go unnoticed for a few days after that they were to head up to gazichs house in the hills where they would search it from top to bottom rapp said goodbye to papadakos and thanked him for his cooperation the old man asked rapp what would happen to deckas rapp lied and told him he wasnt sure even though he knew exactly what he was going to do with him he was going to squeeze every last bit of information from him and then he was going to give him a death befitting a man who set off car bombs in the middle of an urban neighborhood he needed to be made an example of rapp could tell the old man was worried so he told him that people way above his pay grade would be sorting the whole mess out if rapp had only known how accurate that statement was he probably would have finished off gazich right there on cyprus washington dc the phone rang at am kennedy noticed the time before she answered the phone she was lying on her left side and the glowing green numbers of her alarm clock were staring her straight in the face when she opened her eyes she reached out with her right hand and grabbed the handset attempting to view the small caller id screen without her glasses would be futile the cord got caught on something so she tugged a magazine and the tv remote fell to the floor for security reasons she did not own a cordless phone she kept her head on the pillow and brought the sturdy beige handset to her right ear hello director kennedy speaking major hansenduty officer white house situation room yes major potus has called a meeting for zero seven hundred potus was the militarys acronym for president of the united states in the situation room no the oval maam ill be there kennedy placed the handset back in its cradle and thought so much for sleeping in on sundays she threw back the covers and laughed to herself she was going to be out of a job pretty soon or at least this job and whatever job came after this one would be undoubtedly less demanding she could sleep in all the sundays she wanted the tile on the bathroom floor felt cold on her bare feet january in dc kennedy turned on the bathroom light and studied her face in the mirror at fortyfive she looked pretty good for her age but at six in the morning with no makeup and bed lines on her face she was frightening being a woman in this town wasnt easy she turned on the shower to give it a chance to warm up and started brushing her teeth with toothbrush in mouth she walked out to the kitchen and put on some hot water for her tea on the way back she poked her head in her sons room to check on him he was safe and warm beneath the covers kennedy did not like being cold she put her hair up and stepped into the hot shower for five minutes she stood under the water increasing the temperature until her skin turned pink it took her five minutes to dry off and get dressed and another five to put on her face by shed alerted her security detail of the meeting and was in the kitchen taking her first sip of tea and dialing the global ops center at langley on a secure line the duty officer answered on the first ring kennedy asked him if there was anything worth reporting he said it had been a pretty slow night she was surprised by the answer and asked him if he was sure he told her he was the director thanked him and hung up kennedy grabbed the warm mug with both hands leaned against the kitchen counter and asked herself why the president was calling a am meeting on a sunday morning if the global ops center was in the dark the odds were the crisis had emanated at the pentagon or maybe justice with one week to go until the ax fell kennedy found herself strangely ambivalent about the whole thing she took another sip of tea and wondered if this was good or bad shed been the consummate professional her entire adult life she spent more than twenty years at langley and she had given it her all the job had even cost her a marriage she thought about that for a moment and realized it wasnt fair to blame the failed marriage on langley it would have failed if shed been a stayathome mom her ex was too selfish he proved that yet again when his second marriage fell apart after nine short months he was a decent man but a mamas boy which made him extremely high maintenance and kennedy had neither the time nor the desire to give his ego the attention he desired plus oneway relationships were never a good idea kennedy climbed into the back of her town car and picked up the sunday edition of thepost maybe withdrawing from the job was her subconscious protecting herself from the inevitable disappointment of being shown the door anything was possible she supposed she did not want to leave langley especially after such a brief stint as director shed been there over twenty years practically her entire adult life she would miss the people and the action that went along with running the worlds most unfairly maligned spy agency she wouldnt miss the hours and she most definitely wouldnt miss the politics shed miss the place though there was no doubt about it when they pulled up to the first checkpoint it was already am by the time she cleared security she was five minutes late when she entered the oval office she found four men standing in a loose circle around the presidents desk they were the president himself attorney general stokes fbi director roach and presidentelect alexander roach was in a gray suit and striped tie the other three were wearing blazers dress slacks and opencollar shirts at first glance she was surprised by the absence of several key players the secretaries of defense and state the presidents national security advisor and his chief of staff then she remembered it was a sunday morning with just six days left until the peaceful democratic transfer of power very little got done this week the career bureaucrats and professionals were busy running the government while the political appointees had either moved onto new jobs or were busy looking for one president hayes stopped talking when he saw kennedy and said there she is the woman of the hour all four sets of eyes focused on kennedy she blushed slightly and asked and why would that be mr president always modest this one hayes said to presidentelect alexander youll figure that out soon enough no offense to these two over here hayes gestured to stokes and roach they have done admirable jobs but this one hereshes done an amazing job and she gets almost no credit for it all of her victories and successes are locked up in a vault out at langley a hundred years from now theyll be writing about her in the history books kennedy blushed she stood motionless midway between the door and where they were standing she was not used to such attention and looked uncomfortable hayes smiled gestured toward the furniture opposite his desk and said lets sit two lengthy couches big enough to comfortably seat four adults each faced one another with a glasstopped coffee table in between in front of the fireplace sat two blue and gold striped silk armchairs president hayes gestured for alexander to sit next to him in front of the fireplace the place of honor would anyone care for coffee or tea hayes was hovering in between the two couches he bent down and dropped a bag of green tea in a china cup and added hot water his hand shook ever so slightly irene he placed the cup on a saucer and handed it to kennedy kennedy had not missed the presidents unsteady hand even with the medicine hed been taking for his parkinsons the tremors had grown in frequency and severity over the last few months hed lost nothing mentally but she understood why hed decided to not seek reelection in this new media age the scrutiny would have been horrible the other side would have attacked him as selfish for not stepping aside elements of his own party would have undoubtedly done the same and with an approval rating in the low forties his chances for victory were a crapshoot at best with his decision not to run he had secured his reputation in the history books he would be looked on as a wise unselfish man kennedy agreed with that assessment robert hayes had never lost sight of the fact that the office was bigger than the man the other three men took coffee and then hayes settled in next to alexander in front of the fireplace he looked over at his replacement and asked where are you staying this week the willard ah the president nodded a grand old hotel yes they have you in a good room i hope hayes grinned the top floor my offer still stands blair house alexander said in a dead voice its close and very secure thank you mr president but there are simply too many people coming and going this week the party has me booked from sun up till sun down thanking all the fat cats hayes nodded having gone through the same thing four years earlier hayes was turned sideways in his chair half facing his replacement he barely knew the governor from georgia but it was obvious that he had changed since the attack on his motorcade he seemed more distant his eyes were not as full of promise as theyd been during the early months of the campaign hayes wondered if this would help him when he took over the reins of power make him more thoughtful and reflective or if hed become jaded from his experience the president felt sorry for him this should be a week full of hope and promise a renewal of sorts maybe the news he had for him would help bring about some closure hayes smiled wellif you change your mind and decide you need to get away from it all just let me know i will mr president thank you the presidentelect took a sip of coffee and then asked is there anything i can do for you mr president for me hayes grinned and shook his head im looking forward to retirement although my dreams of becoming a master model plane builder have been dashed hayes held up an unsteady hand theres still a lot of other things i can do my doctor who happens to be my old college roommate tells me the parkinsons shouldnt affect my golf game at all which really surprised me his explanation was very interesting he said ive never been able to putt and since it was impossible for my putting to get any worse there was actually a chance it might improve hayes laughed at his own humor and the others smiled can you believe that one of my oldest friends and i actually have to pay him to hear crap like that everyone laughed alexander smiled briefly and then stared at the man whose job he was about to take mr president your attitude amazes me hayes shrugged and said what are you going to do youve been dealt a bad hand if you dont laugh about it itll eat you up i dont think ive laughedi mean really laughed in over two months hayes cringed slightly youre situation is a little different from mine i have a disease a manageable disease he added in a hopeful tone its no joy but i still have some good years ahead of me your situation is a little different you were blindsided and someone very important to you was taken away forever he added with a force that surprised everyone its hard to find any humor in that no just anger shock and sadness wellthis might help hayes uncrossed his legs and leaned forward as you know after the attack on your motorcade the fbi launched one of the biggest investigations in the history of the organization homeland security defense state nsa ciaeveryone got on board to help but the fbi was the lead agency this is where they excelthe forensics the thousands of manhours it takes to run down every lead director roach tells me he has kept you fully briefed on the investigation yes good now heres the part you dont know hayes pointed to stokes and roach they dont know about it either homeland security national intelligence tearing down walls between the fbi and the ciathats all fine in theory and in the wake of it actually looked like it might happen for a brief period but its a pipe dream itll never really work not in this town not with all the gotcha politics and the journalists who care first and foremost about making a name for themselves the fbi must follow the law and tread very carefully everywhere it goes lots of rules now the cia on the other handthey deal with a different crowd and when it comes to international thingsthey can move much faster and in circles where the fbi would find themselves in over their heads agree or disagree with some of their methods the cia is much more suited to go up against an enemy that does not play by the rules an enemy thats willing to set off car bombs in georgetown on a saturday afternoon alexander looked down at the floor and slowly nodded hayes continued after the attack on your motorcade i sat down in private with director kennedy and told her to pull out all the stops to put her best people on thisand once again she did not disappoint me alexander looked up his eyes wide with hope did you find out who was behind the attack hayes looked to his spy chief irene kennedy set her cup back on its saucer shed only realized a minute before what the president was up to she covered her mouth with her fist cleared her throat and got down to business do you recall hearing about the man in the red hat during any of your briefings with the fbi no alexander looked to roach and stokes to make sure he was remembering things accurately the man in the red hat attorney general stokes said is something that has never been proven as with any chaotic event like the attack on your motorcade there was conflicting testimony among the eyewitnesses several recall seeing this man on the street just prior to the explosion but most do not we culled surveillance tapes from all the local businesses and nowhere does this individual show up we believe that he is kennedys gaze moved from stokes to roach she was sure mcmahon would have informed his boss of the meeting hed had in kennedys office less than twentyfour hours ago the one where baker had dropped the bomb on them the two fbi men had worked together for a long time mcmahon would have called him immediately she doubted though that the fbi director would have bothered his boss on a saturday afternoon it was a potentially crucial but small piece of the investigation he would have figured telling the attorney general could wait until monday morning stokes was sitting closer to alexander roach on the other side kennedy watched as roachs face twisted into a frown and he leaned forward sticking his arm out to get his bosses attention in an investigation like this stokes was saying we have to be very careful marty roach said i have to interject something yesterday afternoon i was informed by the special agent in charge of the investigation that the man in the red hat does in fact exist i was planning on telling you about it in our staff meeting on monday morning i had no idea the cia was already pursuing this matter roachs basset hound eyes settled on kennedy and his expression seemed to say thanks for blindsiding me as the president said kennedy reasserted herself we operate under a different set of rules than the fbi a special team headed up by mitch rapp has been pursuing this individual for almost a month last night their hard work paid off and they found him where alexander asked eagerly cyprus a town on the western end of the island called limassol have we arrested him kennedy pursed her lips as she considered the wordarrested rapp had not briefed her on the specifics of the operation but she doubted he had asked permission from the local authorities lets just say we have him in our possession what is that supposed to mean asked stokes the president laughed it means mitch probably whacked him over the head and hogtied him are we sure hes the right guy stokes asked with great concern irene the president asked mitch says hes one hundred percent sure this is our guy thats good enough for me the president slapped his knee with finality are they still on the island roach asked kennedy shook her head no theyre in transit where they had a layover in germany kennedy glanced at her watch theyre probably somewhere over the north atlantic right now i want this man put on trial alexander said with absolute conviction i want these terrorists to see that no matter how well they plan no matter how far they run well hunt them down and they will be brought to justice feet northatlantic rapps eyes fluttered and then opened he checked out his surroundings not sure where he was for a moment and then things fell into place he rubbed his face and then stretched his arms over his head behind the cockpit was a small cabin with seating for twelve old gray worn leather first class seats had been installed in two rows four seats on the port side four in the middle and four on the starboard side no personal dvd players or entertainment of any kind it was a barebones operation what it lacked in ambiance it made up for in space plenty of legroom and the seats reclined to a comfortable napping position rapp sat in the back row on the port side he checked his watch and for a second couldnt remember if hed changed it before theyd left germany he must have as was his custom the arrow on the red and black dial on the outside of the submariner was pointed at that was the time they were due to arrive in dc a little more than two hours from now the layover in germany had lasted a little longer than intended theyd stopped to take on a load of cargo so as to cover their tracks and then the warning light for the portside cargo door wouldnt shut off even though a visual inspection showed the door to be seated properly they sat on the tarmac for almost three hours while they waited for the faulty warning light to be switched out that was when the big russian woke up the only thing theyd gotten out of him so far was a fake name rapp knew it was fake because dumond had run it through langley s database and come up with a dossier for aleksandr zukof everything was wrong age height weight eye color everything except the black hair and the fact that zukof was a former employee of the kgb rapps instinct was to pummel the big idiot for lying to him but caution got the best of him and he decided he should at least wait until they were back in the air even with the broken jaw the russian tried to speak rapp was running out of energy and patience brooks sensed this so she shot the russian up with another dose of thorazine and sent him back to lala land by the time they were wheels up and pointed west toward home rapp was too tired to do anything other than sleep that was over three hours ago rapp unbuckled his seat belt and stepped into the aisle the years of pushing his body to the limit were catching up to him his lower back his knees his hips everything ached he was hit with a flash of vertigo and grabbed the leather seatback in front of him to steady himself brooks was sitting in the seat working on a laptop she felt her seat move and looked up may i help you she said with a bit of attitude rapp knew hed been unduly hard on her but he hadnt decided yet if he was going to apologize this was a hard business the cia in general was one thing it was more like ibm than most people realized but the clandestine service was a different thing all together it was more like wall street timid artists and wilting flowers need not apply if you needed a lot of positive reinforcement to motivate you to do your job you were at the wrong place would you like some coffee she stared at him for a long moment before she answered sure there was a small galley at the front of the cabin next to it were two sleeping berths stroble was sleeping in one coleman the other blue privacy curtains were drawn across each rapp quietly opened one of the metal cupboards and grabbed a packet of coffee he dropped it in the top of the machine and pressed the green button rapp stretched and cracked his neck while he waited for the coffee to finish brewing when it was done he poured two cups and brought one back to brooks brooks set her laptop on the seat next to her and took the white mug thanks youre welcome rapp sat on the armrest of the seat directly across the aisle you see that wasnt so hard was it what rapp frowned mannersi say thank youyou say youre welcome he rolled his eyes and said you know you didnt do a bad job over the last month whoaslow down there partner she arched her brows in a show of mock surprise thats a hell of an endorsement is that how youre going to write it up in my file didnt do a bad job listen you need to understand this is not an easy job i dont stop brooks put her hand up cutting him off this isnt about me thats what i finally realized when i threw the wine in your face i was still thinking about me i was frustrated with the way you had treated me the way you ordered me around like a little kid like i was some brainless rookie i did let me finish youre mitch rapp the living legendblablabla i was really impressed for the first month intimidated beyond belief and then something clicked when we were on cyprus it wasnt me it was you youre going to have to get a little more specific i didnt do anything wrong other than the fact that i didnt stand up to you earlier listenyou have a lot to learn i wouldnt disagree with you for a moment but you need help what rapp didnt know if he should laugh or be offended my dad was a little bit like youwell no one is really quite like you but he was similar in the sense that he was a horrible communicator he was a fixer he had to do everything himself never thought anyone could do as good of a job as he could sounds like my kind of guy yeah brooks stared off into space for a second you would have liked him hes not around anymore no we lost him five years ago massive heart attack sorry to hear that thanks he was a good man very faithful to my mother and us kids just couldnt communicate for shit what about your dad died when i was little was he in the business no rapp shook his head he was a suit good man though you see this is good what talking talking is overrated brooks smiled and her eyes lit up youve got some issues and youre not going to solve them by keeping things bottled up we all have issues you really have issues your wife died over a year ago and ill bet you havent talked to a single counselor about it rapps face turned hard watch your step you never met my wife and you dont know me well enough to talk about this fuck you rapp cocked his head to the side as if he couldnt believe what hed just heard excuse me you heard me i learned it from you no bullshit speak the truth and get the job done thats you you dont respect people who are incompetent you dont respect people who waste your time and you really dont respect people who are intimidated by you and im speaking the truth and you know it you just dont want to admit it big tough mitch rapp cant go see a shrink and talk about his problems because that would be a sign of weakness and the one thing you despise more than anything in others is weakness so your solution is to repress to bury the pain and all youre doing is making it worse rapp dropped his head into his right hand and mumbled ohfuck my head hurts hed had virtually the same conversation with kennedy on christmas eve why do you women always have to psychoanalyze me because we all secretly want to be your mother or your lover rapp lifted his face out of his hand huh im teasingkind of but lets not get off the subject you need to talk to someone about what happened to your wife you need to watch your step brooks defiantly shook her head no what are you going to do hit me throw me out off the plane i dont think so you need help youre just too scared to admit it i dont need any help rapp stood keep telling yourself that you might actually believe it someday rapp opened the door at the rear of the cabin and stepped into the forward pressurized cargo area he closed the door behind him and leaned against it the metal floor was streaked with dirt and grease where cargo had been pushed in and dragged out a series of three overhead lights lit the space it was empty except for one halfmoon cargo container that was secured flush against the far bulkhead rapp looked at the shiny dented aluminum container with a complete lack of enthusiasm subconsciously hed been hoping to put this off let someone else deal with it someone who was properly motivated he was sure they could find plenty of secret service agents who would give up their badge for five minutes alone with gazich maybe even the presidentelect himself would like a private audience with the bosnian rapp tried to focus on his next step but couldnt get his mind off what brooks had said hed allowed a twentysomething rookie to get under his skin to the point where hed actually thought of hitting her just to get her to shut up shed driven him out of the windowless cabin and back into the cargo hold simply because he didnt want to hear another word he was not well he knew it he just didnt want to hear it especially from someone he barely knew with two hours left in the flight he could think of only one excuse to get away from her the unofficial manual on interrogation was pretty straightforward when it came to a situation where time was not critical you softened up the detainee by stripping them of all sense of time and place while at the same time building up a dossier on their history then you carefully crafted your plan of attack in the same way a prosecutor prepares to question a defendant at trial except in this situation there is no defense attorney to object and no judge to sustain the objection you start by asking only questions that you already know the answer to that way if the detainee lies you have grounds to make him uncomfortable until he tells you the truth when he finally does you move on to the next question if he is honest you move on again if he lies the painpleasure principle is put in to play this continues until a pattern of honesty is developed and then you begin with the important stuff usually twentyfour hours was the minimum time needed to properly disorient a subject gazich had been in the container going on thirteen hours not ideal but then again the man had four gunshot wounds to very sensitive areas of the body his last morphine shot had been delivered on the tarmac in germany right about now the drug would be wearing off and the pain would be hitting him in wavesincreasing in frequency and strength rapp approached the aluminum box and grabbed the handle the front wall was basically two interlocking doors rapp was not worried that gazich would be able to make any attempt at escape he twisted the handle spun it ninety degrees and then swung the right door open the inside of the door as well as the rest of the container was lined with gray acoustic foam the box was five feet deep by eight feet wide rapp grabbed the other door and opened it as well light spilled into the dark chamber throwing rapps shadow onto gazichs body the bosnian was lying on a nylon field stretcher that sat only a few inches off the ground his pants had been cut away so stroble could clean and dress the gunshot wounds to his knees rapp looked at the bandages they were clean and white no sign of blood four wide straps secured gazich to the stretcher as well as two wrist cuffs even if he were healthy he would have a hard time breaking free with the wounds to his knees and hands it was hopeless gazich squinted and turned his head just enough to look at the shadowy figure before him is it time for my inflight meal rapp laughed yeahfilet mignon accompanied with a firstclass cabernet i prefer bordeaux great so in addition to being a terrorist youre also a wine snob no i just hate america gazich smiled showing off a slight gap between his top two teeth the fact that gazich might harbor ill will toward the united states was something he had not considered so you have a beef with america doesnt everybody no actually we get along pretty well with most people as rapps eyes adjusted to the change in light he could see that gazich was sweating would you like another shot of morphine gazich hesitated he was not stupid he had a fairly good idea how this game was played not very sporting of you the way you sneaked up behind me back in cyprus you hid behind that doorframe like a woman the same way your pilots like to drop bombs from the sky rapp laughed yeah you bosnians are famous for fighting fair is that what you were doing when you rounded up all those innocent muslim women and children and slaughtered them i have no idea what you are talking about so youre not a bosnian rapp asked in a sarcastic voice i am greek rapp shook his head youre a liar and a bad one at that but ill play along with you for a while what were those russians doing in your office last night i dont know i have never seen them before so the guy on the street the one sitting in the front seat of the parked caryou just shot him for no reason i do not know what you are talking about for the first time rapp was starting to think that gazich might not be very smart i watched you walk down the street stroll up to the open window and shoot the man twice in the heart and then you stood there and talked to him for a while before you took off and did your little dance across the roof tops gazich squirmed under the straps after a long moment he said it was a disagreement so you do know them no who was the disagreement between then a friend of mine and those russian gangsters rapp eyed gazich with suspicion he wondered for a moment if it was possible that the attack in america and the russians showing up in cyprus were in fact unrelated once he started with the russian hed get to the bottom of it the man would not be hard to break the café owner yes thats interesting why gazich shut his eyes as he was hit with a wave of pain the café owner says those russians were looking for you hes not all right in the head he owed them money they were threatening him so i stepped in to help him out we greeks stick together rapp looked down at him his patience quickly running out he squatted down on his haunches and said im not a particularly patient man so im going to get down to business i know who you are i know youre not greek i know that those russians were sent to cyprus to kill you and i know you were in washington two and a half months ago im afraid you are confused confused rapp chewed on the word for a moment im a lot of things but confused is not one of them ill tell you what i am though im the last man on the planet that you want to piss off any further than you already have i dont enjoy this shit but each time you jerk me off with one of your bullshit answers i lose what little sympathy i have for you you dont strike me as the caring type anyway youd be surprised do you care about the truth about justice are you open to the idea that maybe your cocksure american attitude has blinded your judgment do you think its possible that maybe im not the man youre looking for rapp grinned and scratched the black stubble on his chin ohboy you just dont get it youre in way over your head i would like to speak to a lawyer lawyer rapp laughed thats a good one did i forget to show you my badge rapp patted his pockets oh thats right i forgot i dont carry one he leaned in closer there arent going to be any lawyers no judge no jury just a really painful interrogation a confession and then your execution based on your attitude so far id say theres about a ninetyfive percent chance thats the way things will turn out gazich licked his lips and blinked his eyes rapps words were having very little effect on him due to the fact that he was more focused on the everincreasing pain that seemed to be shooting from every inch of his body and the other five percent compared to option a i think its a pretty easy choice but then again you havent shown yourself to be the most rational person so far what is it you tell me everything who hired you how it was planned where the money is everything rapp could see gazich weighing his options you and i both know rapp added youre going to tell me either way then why not torture me you seem like the type who would enjoy it rapp shook his head id prefer to do it the civilized way and when youre done with me well stick you in a prison for the rest of your life maybe youll be eligible for parole in thirty years i dont know rapp was making it up as he went he knew he had to give the man some hope someone higher up than me will be making that decision doesnt sound like a very good deal compared to months of torture and an execution i think its a pretty great deal youre not the one on the receiving end im not the one who set off a car bomb that killed the new presidents wife rapp watched as gazich blinked and then looked away the words had hit home how about a shot of morphine gazich asked in a tight voice id like to think about your offer rapp reminded himself that time was on his side all right ill show you how nice we americans are ill give you the shot and then the cabin door opened and brooks stepped into the space she had a satellite phone in her outstretched hand someone needs to talk to you there was something about her tone that told rapp it was serious all right rapp looked back at gazich and said ill be back in a minute he stood and started shutting the container doors what about the morphine gazich yelled rapp sealed the doors and gazichs screams were reduced to a hollow muffle rapp walked across the open space and asked who is it director kennedy rapp took the phone from brooks held it to his ear and asked whats up he listened for ten seconds and then said have you people lost your fucking minds ovaloffice washington dc the horse had left the barn that much kennedy understood and there was no getting it back attorney general stokes and fbi director roach were over by the presidents desk using two separate secure phones to get their people moving the president and presidentelect were talking in earnest still in the two chairs in front of the fireplace the news of his wifes killers capture had melted the wall between them kennedy had seen alexander on only two occasions since the election both times the future leader seemed somber and detached which was very uncharacteristic for the charismatic fortyfiveyearold from georgia the news had reignited a spark in him that had been missing since the tragic death of his wife kennedy watched the president and presidenttobe talk one on one she couldnt help thinking of the photos baker had shown her less than twentyfour hours ago based on the way alexander had acted over the last few months kennedy doubted he knew of his wifes infidelities but she had seen stranger things washington was replete with torrid tales of the rich and powerful and their strange marital arrangements her instincts told her alexander was genuinely bereaved but shed been fooled by politicians before thomas stansfield her mentor had taught her that the good politicians were better than any actor in hollywood they were real stage actors performing in front of a live audience three or four times a day and they often did it on the fly with alexander though there was something about his pain that seemed very real kennedy wondered how much of her assessment was formed by wishful thinking the alternative made her shudder the best part of her wanted to believe that he was a good man a man she could support that was back on the table now kennedy could see clearly now what president hayes had been up to what hed been trying to do for her and for the cia with vice presidentelect ross in europe hayes saw his opening and used it ross and kennedy did not get along alexander had virtually turned over the national security piece of the puzzle to his running mate the former director of national intelligence alexander was focusing on the domestic and economic teams and ross the defense and intelligence translation kennedy would be out of a job shortly after the two were sworn in what hayes was trying to do was show alexander that kennedy and her people were really effective at what they did not the type of people you simply threw overboard because your running mate doesnt like them a running mate who happens to have a massive narcissistic complex while all of these kudos felt good for a change kennedy saw a potential problem the president should have seen it as well but he probably thought the ends would justify the means the problem was mitch rapp hed sooner get a colonoscopy than deal with the justice department add to that the media firestorm that was sure to follow and he was sure to be in a foul mood for months to come she could try to lay it all at the feet of the president but rapp would be so upset that an operation was dragged into the public eye he would feel the need to spread his anger around kennedy stood and took a step toward hayes and alexander they stopped talking and looked up id better inform mitch of the change in plans if youll excuse me im going to go down to the situation room and call him well come with you announced hayes id love to congratulate him and id like to thank him alexander added kennedy winced ever so slightly and said i dont think thats a good idea at least not at the moment alexander looked confused and asked why president hayes laughed mitch does not like the limelight hes going to hate all of this youre right sir hayes seemed to take great joy in the fact that all this would bug rapp alexander was frowning like he didnt get it hayes looked at him and said hes not like us we hang all of our awards on the wall for everybody to see his medals and commendations are kept in a safe out at langley and ill bet not once has he ever gone to look at them am i right he asked kennedy yes sir you are have you met him hayes asked alexander no ive heard a lot about him though dont believe everything you hear especially if it comes from your vice presidents mouth kennedy decided this would be a good time to exit as soon as im done ill come back and give you an update she turned and left the room cutting through the secretarys outer office and then down the stairs and past the white house mess she stopped outside the secure door of the situation room and grabbed her barcoded and laminated badge that was clipped to the lapel of her jacket she stuck it under the scanner next to the door and listened to the click a small camera above the door monitored her every move when the door clicked she entered and was greeted by a freshfaced man in civilian clothing with an obvious military bearing major hansen i presume yes maam another marine she thought they were always throwing around maam instead of ms she didnt take the use of the antiquated phrase personally it was a byproduct of being yelled at by their drill instructors for three straight months while they tried to make it through boot camp or officers candidate school would you please contact the global ops center and have them get mr rapp on the line for me ill take it in the conference room yes maam anything else maam she considered telling him to stop calling her maam but figured the call was more important just the call please kennedy went into the conference room and set her purse down on the table while she waited for the call to be connected she tried to guess on a scale of one to ten just how upset rapp would be she considered the possibility that this might be one of those rare occasions where she would need to bite back it wasnt her style and it could be a dangerous proposition when dealing with rapp often the best way to manage him was to let him blow his lid and get it out of his system if it wasnt something that was her direct fault she could often ride it out in silence and then make him feel bad for losing his cool she hoped that would be the case this morning the large white secure phone rang once kennedy grabbed the handset and identified herself the voice on the other end asked her to hold and then a moment later a woman came on the line it was agent brooks kennedy asked for rapp and then waited about thirty seconds later a tired gruff voice came on the line and asked whats up youre not going to like this kennedy started so im going to get right to the point the president just told the presidentelect that you found gazich and are on your way back to the states kennedy paused knowing it was the next part that would upset him in a voice lacking conviction she said alexander wants the man put on trial when you land youll be met by the fbi and they will take custody of the prisoner there was a five second pause before kennedy got her reply have you people lost your fucking minds kennedy took a deep breath and said no this guy is a terrorist a hired assassin a foreigner with i dont know how many passports and aliases i kidnapped him for christ sake and and rapp screamed think big picture think tactics and techniques i dont want the fbi asking me a bunch of questions about how i run my operations well be able to limit that bullshit you know you wont if they put him on trial that means the piece of crap gets a lawyer and that means i get to spend a week in some conference room getting deposed by a bunch of socialists who do pro bono work for fucking amnesty international mitch you know i wont let that happen you cant promise that a year from now when this all goes down youre not going to be in a position to protect me youre gonna be writing a memoir and giving speeches for a hundred grand a pop kennedy was expecting him to be upset but not this upset mitch i dont see the problem you said you were a hundred percent sure this is the guy you must have some pretty good evidence against him not the kind of evidence you use in court kennedy detected something in his voice did you torture a confession out of him no rapp muttered that didnt sound convincing i did not torture a confession out of him then whats the problem rapp muttered something again swore and then said i shot him we can deal with that im sure you had cause i shot him four times and hes alive kennedy snapped i wasnt trying to kill him kennedy placed her hand over her forehead oh god please dont tell me you kneecapped him please dont tell me youve been torturing him no then why in the hell did you shoot him four times she barked youre supposed to be an expert marksmen ohfuck youre killing me if i have to listen to another desk jockey question what i do in the field im going to go postal im killingyou are you kidding me mitch you need to help me you need to explain to me why you shot the prisoner four times because when you land the fbi is going to take this guy into custody and they sure as hell are going to ask trust me you wouldnt understand try me you work behind a desk and i work in the field mitchell she snapped he was armed i was in his backyard there were other people involved and i was operating without backup where were the others they got delayed at the airport and you couldnt wait for them no or was it that you didnt want to wait for them yeah irene i wanted to be the lone cowboy so i could get all the credit ill tell you what maybe ill have the pilot drop us down to five thousand feet ill open the cargo door and kick this piece of crap into the ocean and you can all kiss my ass mitch im not saying you did any of this to try and get credit what im doing is secondguessing me from thousands of miles away im not secondguessing you im trying to find out what happened so we can figure out what to say to the fbi it was like i said it was his home turf hed already killed two people and i didnt have time to wait around for backup so i moved in and took care of the situation why did you have to shoot him four times this guys good i was flying solo so i needed to put him out of commission fast what do you mean put him out of commission i needed to cripple him kennedy thought about what that meant for a moment filling the dead air rapp said this isnt the type of guy who surrenders when you shout freeze so you shot first and asked questions later basically where did you shoot him once in each knee thats only twice you said you shot him four times and then in each hand so you crucified him no if id shot him in the feet i would have crucified him kennedy was starting to figure out how bad this would look dont you think you might have gone a bit overboard irene im going to say this one more time im the one out here risking my ass to hunt this guy down id just seen him kill two men in the span of about ten minutes and neither of them had a chance this guy is good i was the one onsite i was the one who had to make the decision and anyone who wants to secondguess me can go fuck themselves including me yes including you and president hayes and presidentelect alexander and anyone else who wants to armchair quarterback me in fact ill tell you what the next time this shit happens you can all get off your bureaucratic asses pick up a gun and head out into the real world and see how you fare you try taking a guy like gazich and hell put a bullet in your head before you finish utteringfreeze kennedy clutched the phone in one hand and had the other one on her hip she was staring straight ahead at the wood paneled wall and asked are you done yeahim done in fact as soon as i land im on the next plane out what do you mean the next plane out the next plane out the first plane i can get on that will get me as far away from washington as possible you cant do that mitch you need to be debriefed by us and then the fbi is going to want to talk to you well tough shit i did the hard part the rest of you can figure out how youre going to run your circus because im not going to be a part of it you cant do the line clicked and then went dead kennedy stared at the white handset for a second and shook her head in all her years she had never known anyone who could so thoroughly annoy her as mitch rapp the main door to the conference room opened and the president entered with alexander hayes saw kennedy holding the phone and asked is that mitch let me talk to him id like to pass along my thanks and im sure josh would as well kennedy shook her head were having some technical problems well lets get them fixed these guys down here are whizzes when it comes to that maybe we should wait awhile it sounded like he had his hands full hayes looked at alexander and then back to kennedy fine maybe mitch can stop by this week and we can thank him personally kennedy looked the president in the eye and uttered a polite but untruthful reply im sure hed appreciate that sir feet northatlantic rapp was leaning forward both hands placed flat against the bulkhead as if he was trying to push the plane through the air his eyes were shut his head down coleman and stroble were up standing in their stocking feet in the galley they had been awakened by rapps heated conversation with kennedy with sleep still in their eyes they looked at rapp tentatively unsure of what had him so pissed off brooks was standing in the aisle next to her seat a look of deep concern on her face coleman looked at brooks for a clue she shrugged and shook her head mitch coleman asked what happened rapp didnt bother to open his eyes or raise his head the politicians are involved how bad bad the fbi is going to meet us when we land and take our guy into custody didnt we pretty much always know that was a possibility brooks asked coleman looked at her and quickly shook his head from side to side rapp dropped one arm and looked at brooks with a withering stare yes it was a possibility he said with an edge but considering how things went down in cyprus i would have advised against handing him over to the fbi or at a bare minimum i would have made sure we had a week with him to make sure we interrogated him properly brooks nodded sheepishly and then looked at the ground theyre going to meet us at the airport a surprised coleman asked yes how in the hell did the fbi find out so fast hayes told alexander that we caught the guy who killed his wife alexander wants him put on trial he wants the whole world to see that we caught the guy but we dont have any hard evidence against this guy i know they jumped the gun so theyre going to meet us at the airport coleman asked again when we land he looked at his watch in less than two hours thats right what about media who the fuck knows this isnt going to work coleman said with real concern why brooks asked what do we have to be ashamed of we did their job for them youre not thinking of the big picture news like this is huge id bet my left nut that the phone lines in washington are burning up right now everybody is going to try and get in on the act and either take part of the credit or act like they were in the know i still dont see the problem this is a huge success for us for the agency coleman laughed i dont work for the agency and i sure as hell dont need any publicity well the agency does thats debatable rapp said come on mitch were the redheaded stepchild ive heard you say it a dozen times over the past month we need some good press youre assuming the press is going to treat us well well why wouldnt they every news story has its cycle and when its about the agency no matter how good it looks at the beginning it eventually gets ugly come again brooks said in a skeptical tone it all comes down to our methods theyre vegetarians were meat eaters well never see eye to eye this plane our tactics the way we deploy the way we put a black bag over someones head in the middle of the night sneak them out of a country without anyone knowingit will all come under scrutiny i think youre being a bit paranoid i think youre naïve rapp looked at his watch we dont have a lot of time so heres what were going to do our russian friend here rapp pointed over his shoulder at the slumbering oaf in the corner have any of you told anyone else that he exists coleman stroble and brooks all shook their heads good he doesnt exist what are you going to do with him brooks asked rapps patience was wearing thin this would be a good time for you to watch and learn are you going to kill him brooks look me in the eye so theres no doubt between any of us that you understand what im about to tell you brooks guardedly folded her arms across her chest and looked at him with her greener than brown hazel eyes stop asking questions this isnt a fucking debate club its a benevolent dictatorship and im not feeling very benevolent right now so unless you want to find your ass transferred out of the clandestine service and into some secretarial pool at one of the offsite locations youre going to do everything i tell you to do for the next two hours can you do that she took a moment to decide and then reluctantly said yes rapp yanked open the light aluminum door and looked down at gazich it was obvious by the prisoners pasty skin that the morphine had worn off his forehead and upper lip were covered with beads of sweat and his entire body quivered beneath the drab gray blanket rapp knew from firsthand experience that simply going from darkness to light in such an agonizing state could be painful he watched the bosnian shut his eyes and winced with understanding rapp did not like gazich but he took no joy in his discomfort rapp had just spent the last five minutes on the phone with marcus dumond learning more about gazich there were passports financial information a key to a safety deposit box cash weapons computers backup disks and hard files all found by hacket and wicker at gazichs office and home all of it was scanned or photographed and sent to dumond back in dc at first glance the information gave them a pretty good idea of what alexander deckas had been up to for the past seven years dumond had already taken to referring to the prisoner as two separate people gavrilo gazich was the man wanted by the hague for war crimes in bosnia and alexander deckas was a seemingly legitimate businessman who had run a company called aid logistics inc based out of limassol cyprus hacket and wicker had taken the hard drives from both the office and home computers of gazich and uploaded them via satellite to dumond so far the encryption programs had frustrated the mit genius but he expected to have them decrypted by later in the day rapp told him to make sure no one at langley knew what he was up to including dci kennedy dumond was used to working on a needtoknow basis but dci kennedy was pretty much always in the needtoknow loop rapp told dumond he was short on time and would explain everything when he saw him later today the more pressing issue at the moment was to get gazich to talk before he had to turn him over to the fbi moving one step to his left rapp managed to block out the light that was hitting gazich in his face the cia operative held out a syringe and said heres how we play this game im going to ask you a series of questions if you answer them truthfully you get your shot of morphine if you lie to me just once no shot gazich nodded eagerly i want to be really clear about thisi know more about you than you can possibly imagine ive talked to the big russian rapp lied the one whose face you were in process of carving up he had some very interesting things to say about you russians are professional liars gazich growled rapp help up a cautionary finger weve gone through your office and your house and have run your photo through our facial recognition system we have you on tape buying coffee at the starbucks on wisconsin avenue the morning that the bomb went off if you lie even once i shut the door and we start over again in thirty minutes ill tell you whatever you want hurry up and give me the shot oh no rapp laughed we talk first and then you get the shot then hurry up with your questions rapp had a theory and he was going to test it after he started with a few easy questions who hired you i dont know gazich moaned in frustration fine rapp took a step back and started closing the door i swear gazich yelled in a panic everything was handled over the internet rapp stood there with the door half closed this was the answer he expected if gazich had given him a name he would have been suspicious big money contracts like these were rarely handled face to face you didnt know them but they knew you rapp asked by reputation only then how did they track you down i dont know he snarled i was in the process of finding that out when you burst into my office and shot me how did you get into the us rapp watched gazich hesitate before answering so far the man had denied any involvement in the attack on the motorcade be careful take your time to think this one through you wouldnt want to lie to me gazich squirmed under the strain of the straps and said i flew into new york the day before which airport jfk the explosives they were waiting for me where pennsylvania the state yes the state now give me my shot not quite yet youre doing a good job though so you pick up the van drive it down to washingtonwhen on friday no gazich snapped i told you i arrived in new york on friday it was possible to fly into jfk stop in pennsylvania and get to washington in one day but rapp wasnt going to argue with him not yet the fact that his fuse was so short was a good sign he wanted the morphine bigtime so you stayed in pennsylvania on friday night yesyes the van was waiting for me and i drove it down to washington early on saturday morning i found my spot i parked it i waited and then when the time was right i blew it up end of story there you go now give me my shot rapp squatted down and pulled back the blanket to reveal gazichs hand a port was taped to the back of his right hand stroble had put it in earlier so he could give gazich a bag of plasma and his first two shots of morphine rapp popped the cap off the premeasured dose and was about to insert the needle when he thought of one more question where were you standing when you detonated the bomb gazichs eyes were focused on the needle with such intensity that he didnt understand the question what when the bomb went offwhere were you standing the fucking tree gazich yelled i was standing behind a tree a half block away now give me the shot rapp nodded agent rivera had been right he slid the needle into the white port and pressed the plunger the dose was just enough to keep him comfortable for thirty to fortyfive minutes and then the pain would come back with a vengeance rapp watched as gazich began to relax almost immediately his body went from rigid to relaxed and his breathing settled into a normal pattern as the alkaloid drug eased his pain so they tried to back out of paying you the rest of the money after the job rapp said this casually like one professional talking to another the second part gazich scoffed they wanted their deposit back not very professional rapp said with a disappointed look on his face so you waited a few seconds too long and you only got one limo instead of both the drug was working fast gazich looked up at rapp with dilated eyes and slurred his first few words i did exactly as i was told i fulfilled my part of the deal they were the ones who screwed up how so they told me to hit the second limo rapps brow furrowed with surprise tactically this made no sense the van had enough power to take out both limos picking just one from the outset cut your odds of success in half why not take out both i dont know im not paid to question my employers so when did they tell you to hit the second limo rapp was thinking maybe hed received the order when hed picked up the van twenty to thirty seconds before it all went down before the blast asked a surprised rapp yes they must have had a spotter that morning watching the candidates get in their vehicles rapp wondered if agent rivera shuffled the limousines as they left the compound it was a fairly common secret service tactic that would explain why they blew up the wrong limo the phone you received the call onwhere did you get it it was waiting for me in the van was it also used to remote detonate the bomb yes i dont suppose you hung on to it no okay rapp was trying to wrap his mind around the entire operation it wasnt how he would have done it but then again the enemy had proven in the past that they werent always logistical geniuses he stood and looked down at gazich one more question i read your file you obviously hate muslims why work for them gazich smiled for the first time my enemys enemy is my ally that and the fact that they probably paid you a shitload of money the money was fine but i wanted to strike a blow for my country rapp would have gladly debated him on the issue but it would have been a waste of crucial time guys like gazich didnt simply change their mind after a brief conversation rapp began closing the cargo door and said well be landing in an hour baltimorewashingtoninternationalairport the big plane touched down softly at am eastern standard time rapp and coleman joined the pilots in the cockpit as they taxied to the cargo portion of the airport they half expected to be greeted by a welcoming committee of police cars fbi sedans and a gaggle of news vans fortunately it appeared their cover story had held it looked cold outside which was a good thing customs officers were humans too the cold weather would keep them huddled inside rather than out on the tarmac nosing around rapp took one final look out the window and then turned to coleman who was now wearing the same uniform as the pilot and copilot black pants white shirt with black and silver epaulets and a black tie he was listed as tom jones the planes navigator on the official manifest he had a full set of worn credentials to match coleman would clear customs with the two pilots and be off the airport property in thirty minutes or less rapp stuck out his hand ill see you in a few hours good luck with the handoff coleman replied you sure you dont want to come along yeahright after i get my barium enema rapp laughed at him and left the cockpit he passed stroble who was now wearing a soiled bwi ground crew uniform dont drop the container i wont boss and stop calling me boss sure thing boss brooks was waiting by the cargo door with her two bags are you all set rapp asked yes good lets go the two of them proceeded into the storage area with stroble following them the big russian had already been transferred into the container and placed bound and gagged on the floor next to gazich like gazich he was also drugged there was just enough room for rapp and brooks to sit at each end of the container once rapp and brooks were situated stroble closed and locked the doors the plane was guided to its spot on the tarmac and the engines were shut down ten minutes later two trucks pulled up one with a set of stairs the other with an extending cargo box the two pilots and coleman came down the stairs their black trench coats flapping in the wind they held their hats with one hand and dragged their carryon bags behind them as they made their way to the cargo terminal the forward port cargo door opened from the inside and the aluminum cargo container was pushed into the back of the trucks extended cargo area and secured stroble shut both the trucks and planes cargo doors and walked back through the plane and down the stairs when he hit the tarmac two more trucks manned with bwi ground personnel pulled up and went to work emptying the cargo in the lower holds stroble gave the guys a wave and a nod as he jumped in the front passenger seat of the truck he had just loaded the man sitting behind the wheel was someone he had never met and didnt care to know someone who worked for rapp at the cia handled this end of the operation the truck headed straight for the customs checkpoint a customs officer left the warmth of his booth just long enough to grab the paperwork from the driver and then he retreated inside stroble assumed this guy was also on the payroll thirty seconds later the guy came back out with the paperwork and gave it back to the driver they rolled through the gate and stopped at a truck yard no more than a quarter mile away a truck of similar size but without the ability to lift the cargo box vertically was waiting with its rear door open stroble jumped out opened the cargo door and climbed in the truck from the airport backed up until the two cargo areas were aligned with just a sixinch gap in between the cargo container had ball bearings on the bottom so it could be easily maneuvered in tight spaces stroble unhooked two straps that had kept the container in place and then pushed the aluminum box from one truck into the back of the new one once the truck from the airport left stroble jumped behind the wheel of the new vehicle and began driving toward an industrial park on the patapsco river only four miles away he took the quickest route just like rapp had told him five minutes later he pulled into an old brick warehouse and closed the door the entire trip took just under thirty minutes two white vans were waiting side by side other than that the place was empty stroble let rapp and brooks out of the cargo container and they transferred gazich into one van and the russian into the other rapp put his bags and brookss bags in the van with the russian and then walked brooks over to the other van do you know where youre going she nodded what if they wont let me in she held up a passport this isnt even real i told you id call and make sure youre on the list candice jonesjust give them the passport and theyll tell you where to go brooks shook her head and frowned what rapp asked theyre going to be expecting you yes they are but im not going why do i have to do this because youre the one who thinks this will be good pr for the agency i do but i dont see why youre dumping it all on me cindy listen to me i promise you this will not hurt your career in fact it will probably help it just hand gazich over and leave dont hang around and let them start peppering you with questions theres going to be an agent there who i know pretty well hes a big guy late fifties his name is skip mcmahon just tell him ill call him when todaytomorrowi dont know youd better tell him today but whatever you do dont tell him how we got into the country are we clear on that yes good follow us to the interstate and then once we hit the exit for andrews youre on your own give them gazich and get out of there ill call you in an hour all right yeahi got it good lets roll brooks climbed behind the wheel of the one van and rapp got into the passenger seat of the other stroble pulled down on the gearshift and put the van in drive they pulled out of the garage and headed toward interstate stroble looked over at rapp and said theyre going to shit their pants when they figure out youre not there i know they are so whats your master plan sandbag them huh sooner or later the media and the clark kents at the fbi and justice are going to turn the spotlight on me and make this about my tactics yeah im just making sure they do it sooner rather than later and why is that a good idea im going to give them enough rope to hang themselves and then im going to kick the chair out from under their legs im still not sure i follow rapp held up his treo phone and played back the recording hed made of the session hed had with gazich dont worry he said to stroble by tomorrow evening theyre all going to be diving for cover dullesinternationalairport ross had flown commercial with his secret service detail even though a private jet had been offered to him by one of the billionaire attendees at the conference the offer was tempting but ross knew the media the vicious bloggers and the crazy talk radio folks would light him up taking a private jet home from a conservation summit smacked of elitism and hypocrisy he could wait one more week untilair force two was at his disposal besides the air france flight wasnt bad the stewardesses up in first class were extremely attractive and spared no effort in fawning over him his fellow passengers wanted their photo taken with him ross was a man of the people his notsopleasant conversation with green in the wine cellar the night before had driven him to drink more wine than he should have and he had boarded the plane with a headsplitting hangover everything after midnight was a slight blur he remembered being in the kitchen with speyer and the lanky blond talking though about what he could not remember for the life of him music was playing the blond started dancing and the next thing ross knew he was pinned against the refrigerator her ass pressed firmly against his groin he had a glass of wine in his left hand she had his right hand wrapped around her body and placed dangerously close to her left breast ross would have had her right there in the kitchen if it hadnt been for speyer and the lascivious look in his eye the president of one of the worlds most private banks speyer didnt so much keep secrets as he did collect and trade in them a prince of europe s unofficial gay mafia the banker would have loved nothing more than to be able to hold such a salacious bit of information over rosss head the vice presidentelect had managed to extricate himself from the situation by playfully chastising speyer and giving the leggy blond a kiss and a promise that hed put her on his dance card for next years conference the secret service had arranged to get ross off the plane first and expedite him through customs theyd also arranged to have his skis and bag picked up and delivered to his house ross walked through the terminal with a real sense of purpose and optimism hed miraculously banished from his mind all thought of cy green and the debt he owed him his detail of agents were spread out around him three in front one on each side and two more behind the formation looked like a kickoff which in turn reminded ross that his new england patriots had a playoff game this afternoon ross was born and raised outside wilmington delaware and had cheered for the colts growing up after graduating from princeton he worked at the cia for a few years before getting a law degree from yale and then moving on to wall street where hed made his fortune by thirtyfive he and his wife had moved to the ultrarich enclave of greenwich connecticut where they raised a boy and a girl and where ross eventually decided to jump on the patriots bandwagon rosss son was out in seattle trying to find himself this bothered the politician more than he cared to admit but he was too busy to obsess over the fact that his twentyfiveyearold son had gone to the nations best schools and still couldnt figure out what the hell he wanted to do with his life his daughter was a new mother and living in new york city they were for the most part good kids they burned through money at an alarming rate but at least they stayed out of trouble their mother had done a relatively good job ross hadnt been around all that much he was too busy making money and having fun and it had all paid off he was now only six days and one heartbeat away from the most powerful job in the world just on the other side of the security checkpoint ross saw his chief of staff jonathan gordon waiting for him ross smiled and gave him a little wave gordon was a good man very loyal the secret service agents all knew gordon and made just enough room for him to enter the inner protective circle the scrum kept moving toward the exit without missing a stride jonathan nice of you to come all the way out here on your day off in this business there are no days off not even the sabbath ross was joking knowing full well gordons agnostic views especially not the sabbath the group passed through the large sliding doors and out into the cold january day i assume you havent bothered to turn your phone on no ross smiled and patted the left breast pocket of his jacket i forgot all about the damn thing well ive left you a few messages and im sure im not the only one whats wrong nothings wrong its just a bit of breaking news they were midway between the door and the waiting limousine when a car came flying around the corner to their left tires squealing and engine revving ross and gordon looked toward the noise and slowed their step agent brown who had stayed consistently one step behind ross from the jetway to the curb placed his large hand in the middle of rosss back and grabbed a handful of fabric he did not slow for a second he picked up his pace driving ross forward leaving gordon behind the scrum picked up speed coats were thrown open hands reached for guns some eyes turned toward the possible threat others turned away to make sure it wasnt a diversion of some sort and then it was over before it began the car a black lincoln town car skidded to a halt at the end of the motorcade and the rear passenger door flew open agent brown was one step away from tossing his protectee headfirst into the back of the limo when he saw stu garret emerge from the back of the town car brown released ross and straightened out his jacket before turning to find the agent who was in charge of the ground detail the access to the upper ramp was supposed to be shut down until they had ross out the door buttoned up and on his way garret marched along the sidewalk moving agents out of his way like a bowling ball through pins he had on a puffy down jacket with a floppy furlined hood mark garret yelled even ross was a bit miffed the speeding car and the way the agents had reacted had caused his heart to race yes stu i need to talk to you it was classic garret no greetings no niceties no small talk formality or informality the campaign manager and head of the transition team was forever in a rush great to see you too ross quipped did you get a new jacket im fucking freezing my ass off if there wasnt so much to do id get on a plane right now and fly back to california ross looked at the sky it was a gray overcast afternoon with little wind the temperature was probably somewhere in the high thirties not really that bad you need to toughen up garret entered the inner circle and growled you need to pull your head out of your ass and turn on your damn cell phone the smile on rosss face disappeared excuse me get in the limo garret grabbed ross by the elbow and pointed at the open door lets go jonathan gordon tried to follow but garret put out a hand and said ride in one of the other cars i need him alone gordon was eye to eye with garret he had grown to detest this foul little man gordon had been with ross since the beginning of his political career it had been his job to temper rosss narcissistic tendencies without crushing his fragile ego he had been fiercely loyal even during the campaign when garret had been brought in to shake things up jonathan ross called out from inside the limo its all right well talk when we get to the house garret climbed in closing the door behind him he sat in the seat opposite ross and craned his neck around to make sure the privacy screen was up it was garret spun back around threw open his coat and rattled off a series of expletives ross kicked out his feet and said i see the holidays havent improved your mood holidaysthats a good one almost as good as you flying commercial the limo started moving ross looked out the window and said considering the fact that i was at an environmental conference i think it was a rather good idea how was the conference it was nice the skiing was great the foot soldiers really appreciated me showing up garret leaned forward placing his hands on his knees he was right youre drunk on power what are you talking about ross asked with a frown do you think i give a shit about the skiing or how impressed the tree huggers were that you showed up garret shook his head in disbelief im not kiddingyou need to pull your head out of your ass rosss face flushed with anger stu you need to watch your mouth my mouth is the least of your problems fuck he sat back and frowned i was on the phone with our friend for nearly thirty minutes this morning who our friend garret tilted his head and looked at ross to see if he was putting two and two together the one you had wine with last night ohthat friend yeahthat friend hes pissed he says youre delusional youve somehow managed to rationalize this whole thing and wash your hands of it ive done no such thing he sounded pretty convinced hes not exactly the most stable person ive ever met do you have any idea how fucking serious he is theres only so much i can do i get the feeling your idea of what you can do and his are miles apart i told him ross pointed his finger at garret that i would do everything i could to help him but in the end it would be up to you know who no i dont know who the president current or future current i seem to remember you also telling him if hayes balked you would get josh to do it once he took the oath i did not you sure as hell did i heard you you said that between you and his fatherinlaw you would get him his pardon shhhh ross held his finger to his lips garret glanced over his shoulder at the two agents in the front seat and then looked back at ross you fucking think they have us bugged you really are out of your mind in this town you never know fuckyoure paranoid and youre a rude little bastard stu yeah well guess what were not in high school anymore im not trying to win any popularity contests my job was to get you elected and i did that you werent the only one working on the campaign garret shook his head and said our friend told me that you actually said you thought you were making up ground in the polls and that you had momentum on your side he told me you said we may have won the thing all on our own you didnt really say that did you ross looked out the window yet again stu elections are a strange business mark elections are my business ive been running them and rigging them for over thirty years and im going to tell you right now you guys were dead in the water you had about as much of a chance to win that thing as a republican does the mayoral race in san franciscowhich is to say none you dont know that yes i do mark and youd better fucking snap out of it because im telling you right now our friend over in europe is not the type of man you want to fuck with ross had heard just about enough next saturday im going to be sworn in as the vice president of the united states of america i think our friend should start thinking about whohe wants to fuck with yeah wellhes not your only problem mr vice president garret looked out the window and said something under his breath what the fbi department of justice and cia have scheduled a joint press conference for tomorrow morning at ten why the word on the street is that they caught the guy who was behind the attack on the motorcade the guy behind the attack ross repeated with eyes as big as saucers you mean the guy who carried out the attack or one of his associates there are a lot of rumors flying around right now i dont know for sure who they have does the media have the story yeah theyre all running it on the crawler but they dont have any specifics yet shit ross swore he told me he was going to take care of this he told me last night when i talked to him when i spoke with him this morning the news hadnt broke yet and i dont think he knew or he would have said something can this be traced back to us ive been thinking about that garret hesitated and then shook his head i dont think so you dont think soyour lack of certainty isnt exactly comforting me what do you want me to tell you the only way we can be linked to this is through cy and hes a very careful guy hed sell us down the river in a heartbeat for sure but if i know cy he covered his tracks have you talked to marty ross was referring to the attorney general i tried but hes not taking calls well hell take mine ross retrieved his mobile phone and turned it on while he stared at the small screen waiting for it to come to life a contingency plan occurred to him he was about to float the idea with garret and then decided at the last second that it was best to keep it to himself he would have to first find out what the attorney general knew washington dc rapp stood in front of the tv in his towel and brushed his teeth the perky duo on the screen told him a warm front was moving into the potomac river valley the forecast for monday morning was clear skies and an afternoon high of fifty degrees by tomorrow they expected the mercury to hit sixty the morning tv anchors were doubly excited about this in light of the ice storm that had hit the city the previous friday rapp cared about the weather only to the extent that he needed to know how he should dress other than that he tended not to get excited one way or the other it was what it was and there was nothing he could do about it what he really wanted to know was how much play the upcoming joint press conference was getting the apartment didnt have cable it didnt have much in fact other than the essentials this was rapps crash pad his bolthole that he kept in washington his brother steven was the only other person who knew about it hed shown it to his wife on one occasion he brought her late at night so no one would see them and he showed her how to enter from the back fire escape the building was an eightunit brownstone that his father had bought as an investment a few years before his death rapp was just eight years old but he remembered riding with him to the apartment on the weekends to clean the hallways and the laundry room the brownstone was located approximately a mile north of the white house in the columbia heights neighborhood only a few blocks away from the upscale adams morgan neighborhood columbia heights was one of the many neighborhoods in the city that had fallen to urban decay in the sixties and seventies rapps father a real estate attorney had bought the place for next to nothing it was four units up four units down sturdy as all hell and full of character rapps mother almost sold the place twice after his father had passed away of a massive heart attack but steven had been adamant that they keep it steven just a year and half younger than mitch could spot trends even back then they werent losing money on the brownstone but it was a real pain it was a rental property in a bad neighborhood drugs prostitutionthered even been a murder right in front of the building there were lots of complaints by the tenants late rent checks and more evictions than they could count not the type of hassle a single mother of two from the suburbs needed in her life steven persisted though he insisted that their father had said the building was a gold mine as soon as the neighborhood turned around theyd make a small fortune steven even went so far as to put an ad in the paper for a new building supervisor he dragged his mother down there on a saturday morning and helped her pick a nice old man whose apartment building was scheduled to be torn down by the city to make room for a section eight housing development the man worked for free rent he stabilized things and got good longterm tenants to move in the neighborhood started to turn in the late eighties and then the super passed away in and they decided to sell each unit as a condominium their father had been right over a threeyear period they sold all eight units and made a small fortune one of those units was bought by an llc out of the bahamas the cia had taught rapp to be a careful man hed operated for years without an official cover in some very hostile places hed been ordered to do things by his superiors that he knew were illegal the fact that this apartment was illegal in the eyes of the cia didnt bother him for a second hed been trained to live a lie to deceive to do whatever it took to survive and complete the mission without being caught this apartment was a natural extension of what they had taught him rapp walked into the bedroom sparsely furnished like the rest of the place it contained a queensize bed with a wooden headboard that matched the nightstands and dresser rapp threw the towel on the end of the bed and grabbed a pair of boxers white tshirt and black socks from the dresser he put them on and opened the closet there were half a dozen shirts and two suits all wrapped in plastic rapp put on a light blue shirt and the blue suit he found a silver and light blue tie and held it up to the mirror on the back of the closet door it worked he knotted the tie and walked over to the dresser on top sat a metallic rolex submariner his maryland drivers license a wad of hundreddollar bills a sleek kahr mm pistol a small concealtocarry holster an sim card and a new cell phone that was partially dismantled rapp put the gun in the holster and placed it inside his waistband at the small of his back he put the new cell phone in his left breast pocket and the battery and battery cover in the right breast pocket of the suit coat he walked back out into the living room turned off the tv and looked out the window it was am on monday the press conference was a little more than three hours away rapp grinned and wondered if they were still going to go through with it they really had no choice they had a person in custody someone they could blame for the attack if they canceled the press conference they would look like fools so rapp was willing to bet that it would go off as scheduled at am between now and then he had a few calls to make but he didnt dare do it from the apartment he would leave the neighborhood and then make his calls cia headquarters langley virginia brooks had never set foot on the seventh floor before let alone the directors suite she sat nervously in the small reception area with two very large men staring at her and one very small woman ignoring her the men were exmilitary for sure they had short hair and broad forwardslouching shoulders that were caused by too many bench presses and curls and not enough back exercises they wore the telltale signs of a bodyguard on each hip gun most likely on the right hip and a radio and extra magazines on the left shed gone through twentyfour years of life never noticing such things and then she went down to the farm where the cia trained their new clandestine service recruits the farm changed her forever it was like someone lifted the curtain and showed her another dimension to life there was nothing magical about it they simply taught you that your survival one day would likely depend on how aware you were of your surroundings brooks thought back to the months shed spent at the farm and tried to remember what theyd said about insubordination and being threatened with obstruction of justice brooks looked up to see special agent skip mcmahon enter the small reception area he was a big man with an even larger presence he looked brooks over from head to toe frowned shook his head and then looked at the directors gatekeeper the diminutive woman sitting behind the desk said good morning skip go right in shes expecting you mcmahon mumbled something unintelligible and entered kennedys office closing the heavy door behind him with a thud brooks looked down at the floor and wondered how she had let rapp put her in this situation here was a man shed been ready to strangle with her bare hands less than fortyeight hours before and now he had talked her into putting her entire career on the line he was mitch rapp though an honesttogod living breathing legend he had kennedys ear he had saved the presidents life and it was said that hayes would do anything for him shed worked with him in the field one of the few covert operatives at langley who could make such a claim even if it was more like watching him than working with him the experience was invaluable rapp promised her that while things might be uncomfortable for a day or two in the end she would want to be on his side theyd found the man responsible for the attack on the motorcade and they were going to go public with it the cia was actually going to get some credit for a change with her entire career ahead of her brooks thought this sounded like a pretty good deal she would forever be linked to an important manhunt even if all she did was act like arm candy for rapp at least she thought it all sounded like a pretty good deal now she was starting to wonder special agent mcmahon had been predictably upset when brooks had delivered the prisoner to him at andrews air force base hed been expecting rapp and hed been expecting more than a shotup drugged man on a stretcher mcmahon must have asked her ten times where mitch was and every time she told him she didnt know and the truth was she didnt brooks had left andrews and returned to her apartment in alexandria for the first time in almost a month she turned off her phones just as rapp had told her to do and laid down for a nap hed told her all the action and lack of sleep would catch up to her and she would sleep like a baby he was right again she took a sixhour nap when she woke up it was dark and her message light on the home line was blinking she turned on her agencyissued mobile phone the one that she had been told in training to never turn off there were thirteen messages each one was progressively worse it started with her supervisor then his boss and then her boss and jose juarez the deputy director of the clandestine service he stated very clearly that he expected to see brooks in director kennedys office at am on monday or her relationship with the cia would be terminated brooks found the use of the wordterminate very unsettling especially when uttered by the head of the clandestine service interestingly enough though rapp had predicted all of this even the am meeting brooks was turning all of this over in her mind when jose juarez came marching into the reception area juarez was six feet tall with thick black hair and an even thicker black mustache born in honduras his parents immigrated to america when he was nine juarez graduated from high school in miami and joined the marine corps after four years of exceptional performance he was accepted into officer candidate school shortly after he had accepted his commission the cia discovered him and borrowed him for a little conflict they had in central america in the mideighties juarez had performed so well the cia offered him a permanent position brooks had never served in the military but she jumped to her feet upon seeing the spy boss juarez s jacket was already off his top button of his white buttondown shirt was already undone and his sleeves were rolled halfway up his arms he marched straight for brooks and stopped two feet away his thick black eyebrows scrunched into a frown what in the hell is your problem im sorry sir i dont i dont want to hear youre sorry i asked you what your problem is sir if i may rapp told me is mitch rapp your boss juarez barked no i didnt think so sit your butt back down juarez pointed at the chair if the director wants to see you ill let you know my advice is that she fire your ass and ask the fbi to investigate you juarez turned around and went back to the reception desk he stuck out his hand and said sheila pad of paper and pen please when the receptionist had given him what he wanted juarez marched back to brooks and said you may want to update your résumé he dropped the pad and pen in her lap and then entered kennedys office brooks looked down at the yellow legal pad and then up at the two stonefaced sentries the receptionist finally acknowledged her presence by saying that mitch rapp is a real charmer isnt he brooks looked at the woman she was approximately fifty a little overdone hair a bit too red and makeup a bit too heavy excuse me didnt you spend a month in europe with him it was hardly a vacation the woman smiled and said ill bet brooks looked down at the blank piece of paper her mind struggling to reconcile the severity of the situation with this older womans lustful fantasy brooks was way out of her league without any sign of this thing turning out well for her sure rapp would be fine he was mitch rapp he had a career of successes he could point to but she was just some little peon who would be labeled an insubordinate malcontent for the rest of her career how could rapp have possibly expected her to withstand this kind of pressure washington dc stu garret exited the willard lobby onto pennsylvania avenue and turned immediately to his left it was five to seven in the morning he was tired and crabby a night owl even as he approached sixty garret didnt like to get out of bed before or if at all possible but this morning he couldnt sleep there was simply too much on his mind he needed to make a call a gust of wind hit him square in the face and he swore out loud as he clutched for the furlined hood of his puffy down jacket six more days and im done with this shit hole he grumbled to himself garret pulled the hood over his head and zipped the jacket all the way up under his double chin born in detroit he left when he was eighteen and never returned he hated the weather and the people detroit was for losers and garret wasnt afraid to tell that to people especially his clients the place was a shining example of how unions and special interest groups could come together to suck a city dry by driving off its tax base southern california was the place to be san diego in particular where democrats were liberal on social issues only fiscally they were as conservative as any northeastern republican the people who flocked to san diego sunk their money into real estate very expensive real estate they had worked too hard for their money to watch property values plummet due to the governance of a few bleedingheart liberals abortion gun control and the environment were all hotbutton issues across america but in san diego real estate was the big overarching issue peoples entire life savings were tied up in their homes and after living in sunny san diego retiring to arizona or florida made no sense garret couldnt wait to get back to san diego and his toys garret took quick strides and kept his head down his retainer for the campaign had been a million dollars that was just for him he was a oneman gun for hire stu garret the political savant by the time the campaign was over hed burned through the retainer plus another million on top of that his contract called for a milliondollar bonus if they won garret was flush with cash hed now managed two separate presidential campaigns and won both candidates across the country were reaching out for his advice hed even received a few calls from abroad he was at the top of the heap people were lining up to hand him large retainers for the first time in his career he considered bringing someone else on board garret tried to tell himself it wasnt about money his home was paid for his wife was as frugal as he was and their only child a daughter had married an sob of a trial lawyer who made gobs of money the two of them and their two children lived up in la with all the beautiful people there was one area where garret really spent money though he loved to collect vintage muscle cars and rare motorcycles beyond that he was pretty much addicted to golf and then there was the big fortytwofoot cruiser he kept down at the marina the boat and golf membership were for entertaining clients golf was a must it was an intricate part of his business hed sealed more deals on the golf course than in an office by a landslide the cars and the motorcycles those were purely for his own gratification he supposed they brought him back to his youth and his own father who had worked on the assembly line for general motors back when they made great cars garret only collected american vehicles made before everything made after that was shit although detroit had begun to turn out some decent vehicles lately ford had a new mustang shelby that was supposed to be out of this world and chevy was coming out with a new camaro if he caught another big fish this week he could buy one in every color that was part of the reason garret had given into hanging around town it was only monday but already the partys bigmoney people were arriving for saturdays inauguration he had meetings set up all week those running for the us senate or a state governorship were the only two hed touch he was done with congressional races no matter how much money they were willing to pay he already had his eye on the next presidential campaign no campaign manager had ever won three presidential elections garret cleared the treasury department and was hit with another blast of wind he turned left put his head down and reminded himself to avoid taking on any new clients from northern states he continued east passing the white house and picking up pennsylvania avenue at th street from there he angled northwest for two blocks to the building that housed what was left of the campaign offices at the height of the campaign theyd leased two full floors after their victory ninety percent of the space was converted into transition offices for the new administration the personnel and furniture all pretty much stayed the same the only real difference was who paid the bills during the race the campaign wrote the checks now it was the federal government to the victor go the spoils or something like that the lobby was enclosed in glass the floor was covered in white marble with a green border around the edges in the middle was a black elevated desk that looked like it belonged on a scifi movie set there was a black woman sitting behind the desk and beyond her were three elevator banks garret pushed his way through the main door and started for the elevator bank on the far right still chilled he didnt bother to take his hood off he walked straight past the toy cop and the stupid little signin sheet excuse me sir the security guard called from behind her desk im going to need you to sign in garret didnt break stride he pulled his office badge out of his left pocket and went straight for the elevator he took it up to the fifth floor and stepped into an empty reception area red white and blue campaign signs hung from the wall like vintage artwork the big banner right behind the reception desk was filled with signatures and a few drawings it had been rosss idea to motivate the troops they were going to present it to alexander after he was sworn in on saturday garret supposed it would be hanging in the mans presidential library someday garret looked to his left and then his right the floor was covered with dark gray carpeting and the walls were covered with light gray wallpaper the place was bland but more importantly empty garret pictured all the young volunteers still sleeping in the their hotel rooms they were no longer volunteers of course they were now on the government payroll with the pressures of the campaign behind them they were partying even harder than they had during the election which one would think impossible it was standard operating procedure on campaigns to provide volunteers with four things coffee food liquor and a place to sleep the booze the fact that the bulk of the volunteers were in their twenties and the fact that they all pretty much stayed at the same hotel created an interesting environment if the general public had any idea how much fornicating happened on these campaigns theyd be shocked to his right were some of the transition offices and to his left four actual offices and another dozen workstations for the campaign staff garrets office was in the far corner he hesitated for a moment and then decided it would be better if he made this call from someone elses desk he started toward the transition offices he passed a few rooms all empty looking out across the sea of cubicles he listened for a sign that some loser who didnt get laid was in early to impress his boss there was nothing but the hum of the overhead lights garret walked into the next office left the light off and shut the door he retrieved a piece of paper from his pocket it was from the willard with just a phone number with an international dialing prefix on it no name garret picked up the handset and entered the number this was the real reason he was still in town it helped to meet some of these fat cats in person but he could have traveled to see them or they could have visited him in san diego the negotiating always went well after a round of golf and a few cocktails on the boat he would have definitely gone back to warm sunny california if it hadnt been for this last piece of business after a few rings a woman answered and garret said i need to speak with joseph may i ask who is calling no just get him on the phone garret looked around the office there were no personal photos nothing that could tell him whose office it was on the wall next to the door was one of those stupid motivational posters it showed a mens crew team rowing on a river in large letters across the top were the words team work garret shook his head any jackass who needed to find motivation inspiration or anything else in some massproduced trite piece of junk wasnt going to get far in this business joseph speyer finally came on the line and in a cautious voice said hello weve got a problem garret blurted out ohhello stu my assistant told me there was a rude american on the line which is fairly redundant dont you think but nonetheless i should have guessed it was you very funny why did you not come to my party your boss came he isnt my boss oh stusuch a big chip on your shoulder it must be difficult going through life so angry all the time yeah garret laughed gruffly but probably not as bad as taking it up the ass like you do stu speyer said with mock surprise you are a democrat you are supposed to support my people you might want to drop using my name every other line and i do support your people go ahead get married what the fuck do i care its just not my bagwhat you guys do between the sheets maybe you should try it some time no thanks garret looked out the window and watched a cab pass by on the street below back to the point weve got a major fucking problem there was a sigh and then speyer said how could we possibly have a problem everything turned out exactly as you wanted your buddy promised that he was going to button things up on his end and as far as i know he did you dont know shit the fbi is going to hold a press conference in a few hours why theyve arrested someone there was a long pause before speyer responded do you know who i dont have a name but ive heard its the guy impossible i just spoke with your boss on saturday he said the fbis investigation was dead in the water he was being briefed daily it wasnt the fbi who found him who was it the cia that is wonderful news speyer said with feigned enthusiasm just fucking great i will make sure to pass it along to our friend yeahyou do that and on an entirely different matter tell him i want scorched earth do you follow me i think so good you know this man the cia grabbedits too bad that its probably as far as theyll get ive seen how these people operate they rarely know who hired them so ive heard i will call you back after i speak with our friend dont bother garret said just tell him if he doesnt handle this problem immediately i have no intention of following through on our end of the bargain he will not be happy to hear that i dont give a fuck what makes him happy or not he needs to do what he said he would do and he needs to do it today garret slammed the phone back into its cradle and walked out of the office langley virginia kennedy sat behind her desk and watched and listened as mcmahon and juarez worked themselves into a frenzy she knew both of them extremely well it was not abnormal to see either of them get this upset they were very passionate about their jobs the unusual part was seeing them upset at the same time well that wasnt exactly right either the abnormality lay in them being upset over the same thing their jobs dictated that they approach situations from different angles angles that didnt always intersect what juarez deemed to be best for america did not always jibe with the fbis vision in essence mcmahons job was to enforce the law and investigate and arrest those who broke it juarez s job was to send men and women to foreign countries to recruit spies gather information conduct covert operations and pretty much break laws on a weekly if not daily basis there was an undeniable conflict between the two missions mitch rapp had somehow managed to get both men on the same page which was another red flag to kennedy mitch was a disrespectful almost always unmanageable asset he was akin to a companys top sales rep who was often the same guy who thumbed his nose at the sales manager showed up late to meetings or didnt show at all and in general did whatever in the hell he wanted just so long as he kept hitting his numbers pretty much every successful company had a rep that fit that bill men and women who were at their best when management stayed out of their way smart bosses knew it was wise to turn them loose and look in the other direction in a sense rapp had been the cias top rep for tenplus years and counting and juarez was his de facto sales manager juarez did not resent rapp hed been on the messy end of black ops himself and the two men shared that unique bond which was no small thing in a bureaucracy where ninetynine percent of the employees had a desk job juarez respected rapp even revered him and depended on him in situations just like this to get results where others had failed the problem kennedy knew lay in the fact that rapp had corrupted one of juarez s precious recruits rapp had gotten brooks involved in what could quickly become a criminal investigation if this went south it would be a big blow to the clandestine service juarez might even lose his job over the deal the videotape mcmahon said from the starbucksis not enough evidence to convict this guy the attorney general is losing his mind over this you told us he was the guy he is kennedy said calmly shed had almost a day now to consider the situation and she was slightly embarrassed that she had allowed her own emotions to cloud her judgment first off getting upset with rapp served no purpose she should have known that after all these years he was going to do what he thought best regardless of orders from hq can you back that up not at the moment shit mcmahon had his dark blue pinstripe suit jacket open and a hand on each hip a bulky pistol sat on his right hip and his badge was clipped to his belt above his left front pocket as a general rule he didnt carry his passport sized fbi credentials some people acted funny around guns so he kept his badge displayed youre going to have to do better than that the agent continued the press conference is in less than three hours and i need some real evidence all ive got at the moment is a shotup greek guy who keeps claiming he was kidnapped and tortured this could get really embarrassing kennedy wondered if that was what rapp was up to punishing everyone for going public with this lets get brooks in here juarez said she knows what the hell is going on are you sure about that kennedy asked hell yes she told me herself that mitch told her to say nothing he said he would show up in a few days and take care of everything and in the meantime she was to keep her mouth shut i know thats what he told her but that doesnt mean she knows what hes up to how about simply telling us what in the hell really happened in cyprus juarez asked how about telling me anything mcmahon jumped in she shows up at andrews yesterday in a white rental van from where we have no idea we were expecting them to land on a plane my people ran down the plates on the van it was rented by some llc out of baltimore that exists on paper only we checked the gate logs at the base she showed up five minutes before the handoff we called customs and immigration they show no record of brooks or rapp entering the country yesterday i dont suppose either of you would like to tell me what aliases they were traveling under kennedy and juarez didnt bother looking at each other they both shook their heads in response to the agents question mcmahon looked down at the ground and grabbed the back of his neck with his right hand after a moment he said now i might not care how in the hell they got this guy from cyprus to the states without clearing him through customs but i know a whole lot of other people whoare going to care people at justice are already asking questions and im sure when this guy gets a lawyer he is going to want to review the chain of custody add to that the press and you guys are going to get a whole lot of unwanted attention my office tells me theyre already receiving calls theyre going to be all over you by this afternoon that was it kennedy thought to herself this was exactly what mitch was worried about their tactics and methods being exposed so the question she had for herself was what was rapp really up to was he destroying evidence or collecting evidence or both i say we get her in here juarez said in an impatient voice brooks kennedy replied yes i think you two are being a bit hard on her juarez s eyes practically popped out of his head hard on her ive had the kid gloves on until now im half tempted to get the office of security in here have them turn on the hot lights and polygraph her ass kennedy placed her glasses on top of a leather briefing folder she used both hands to square them up perfectly in the center of the smooth brown surface kennedy had thought juarez would threaten to do this but she wondered how much of it was bluster the move carried with it certain risks the office of security would start a paper trail that just might get the inspector generals office involved and then they were only one step away from the department of justice and the fbi i think shes been put in a very difficult position whats so difficult about being debriefed by your boss i think everyone needs to take a step back and look at this from a different angle what angle could that possibly be juarez asked sarcastically kennedy shot him a look and said mitchs angle irene juarez s jaw was clenched i have a lot of respect for mitch and he has pulled some pretty goofy shit over the years but this one takes the prize you were as upset as ive ever seen you yesterday mcmahon said why the hell are you all of a sudden defending him kennedy leaned back in her chair and glanced out the window before answering i was distracted yesterday i think i made a mistake what mistake i did not advise the president as closely as i should have on this how so going public kennedy shook her head this fastbad idea mitch told you this was the guy one hundred percent the smart thing for you to do was turn him over we could have waitedshould have waited a week or two or maybe we should have just let mitch take care of the problem for us i didnt hear that mcmahon said as he shut his eyes tightly whats done is done juarez added what i want are answers im willing to give brooks one more chance lets bring her in here lay out her options and get to the bottom of this i want to know what in the hell mitch is trying to hide kennedy studied juarez for a moment and then looked to mcmahon would it help mcmahon asked if i left probably juarez answered i dont think its going to matter why asked juarez i dont think shes going to talk but well give it a shot kennedy leaned forward and hit the intercom button on her phone sheila would you please send ms brooks in kennedy stood and pointed to the couch and chairs opposite her desk she read the look of disapproval on juarez s face were going to try this the civilized way first fine juarez grumbled you go ahead and play the good cop skip can play the bad cop ill just play the boss from hell in my current mood it wont require much acting washington dc the cyber café was one of those coffee shops that you could find in virtually every hip counterculture neighborhood across america each one a standalone sole proprietorship or maybe an llc with ownership of a half dozen shops at the most they were all different yet the same united in their hatred of starbucks these shops were a blind chain with an unintended common theme they were adorned with rickety secondhand furniture old laminate countertops and a wait staff who tended to be open to body piercings tattoos and bad hairdos the shops provided free internet connection service with an attitude and a refuge from america s shallow thirst for comfort through the similarity of franchise hell this particular place was called café wired a big handpainted brown and white sign hung above the large glass window that fronted the sidewalk the name was bracketed on one side by a steaming cup of coffee and the other by a laptop there were now three of the shops in the city one in bethesda another by american university and this one a few blocks away from howard university not far from rapps condo rapp was a silent investor in the cafés he and his brother steven had put up the money and marcus dumond ran the places rapp had worked with the cyber genius going on five years now dumond had attended mit with rapps brother while earning his masters degree in computer science at mit dumond had managed to get into some pretty big trouble with the feds to win a bet with some of his fellow geniuses he hacked into one of new york s largest banks and then moved over a million dollars into several overseas accounts he wasnt caught because he left a trail he was caught because he and his friends got drunk one night and began bragging about how easy it had been a fellow student got wind of it and turned him in to the authorities dumond was facing serious jail time that was until steven rapp called his brother to see if he could intervene the cia doesnt like to advertise the fact that they employ some of the worlds best computer hackers these men and women spend their days and nights trying to sneak undetected into the networks of america s adversaries more often than not they are successful and they are one of the countrys bestkept secrets dumonds skills in this arena were unsurpassed he split time between the cyber unit and the counterterrorism center rapp circled the café twice before entering he checked all the windows the cars and the people on the corner waiting for the bus it was more out of habit than any real fear of being followed he opened the door to the coffee shop and walked straight to the back past the line of customers waiting for their morning fuel the womens room was on the left the mens on the right directly ahead was a door with a security camera and call box mounted to the side rapp pressed the button and put his hand on the doorknob a second later a buzzing noise announced that the door was open rapp went down the narrow stairs to the basement and past two open office doors to a third heavy steel door with rusted rivets ringing the perimeter this one also had a call box next to it before rapp could push the button he heard the buzzing release of the lock he leaned into the heavy door twisted the handle and entered the first thing that rapp noticed was that the room was a good ten degrees warmer than the rest of the basement hed been down here before dumond kept an apartment on the second floor but for security reasons he kept his nerve center locked up in the basement rapp was not a detail guy at least not when it came to computers to him they were like cars corvette ferrari mustang gt mercedezwhen you got to the high end how much did a tenth of a second really matter in a zero to sixty challenge he knew it mattered to the purists just like he knew processor speed really mattered to dumond but in rapps casewho really cared one look at a red ferrari and youd have to be an idiot to not instinctively know it was fast no need to look under the hood same with dumonds setup all you had to do was look at the four flatscreen monitors that sat atop the halfcircle desk and you knew whatever was under the desk had to be the best that money could buy how are things going rapp asked as he took off his trench coat fine dumond answered as he took a final drag off a cigarette and stabbed it out in a large glass ashtray the twentynineyearold african american exhaled a cloud of smoke and said the blogosphere is on fire with news that the fbi is going to announce the arrest of the primary suspect in the motorcade attack did you leak the name dumond nodded drudge just ran with it itll be on the wire within the hour what about the greek embassy rapp laid his trench coat over the back of a chair i already made the call you disguised your voiceright rapp approached the desk no dumond said in a sarcastic voice i gave them my name and phone number in case they needed to get a hold of me he snatched his pack of cigarettes from the desk and fished out a stick youre a brave man this morning what the fuck do you expect from me dumond stuck the cigarette between his lips and started searching for his lighter the desk was covered with keyboards mice disks memory sticks card readers speakers and other odds and ends ive been up all night working on this shit and you wont even tell me whats going on he found his lighter under a pile of disks in clear jewel cases and lit his cigarette i told you whats going on its classic disinformation were going to get them leaning in one direction and once theyre committed were going to deliver a knockout punch you and your sports analogies dumond frowned at rapp and then went to work on one of the keyboards man you are one crabby cuss this morning whereas you are just a breath of fresh air rapp smiled he truly liked dumond thank you for working on this i owe you youre damn right you do ive been up all night and i have to be at work in an hour and a half all right rapp put his hands up in surrender i owe you bigtime the next time you get arrested ill bail you out the comment was a reference to the fact that if it werent for rapp dumond would be sitting in a federal prison how long are you going to hold that over my head im not now give me the full update i posted twentysix blogs last night under ten separate pseudonyms i started out responding to other bloggers who were reporting that the assassin was caught you could tell by most of them that the leaks were coming out of the white house traffic was pretty hot on the subject at five this morning i started putting it out there that there were major problems with the case against this guysigns of torture no real evidence the fact that he was grabbed without alerting the greek authorities who did you say your sources were all anonymous state department justice fbi cia i spread it around did you float my name rapp asked not yet i thought you wanted me to hold off on that i did when we finish up with this next thing go ahead and leak it dumond studied him for a second i have no idea what you are up to youll see soon enough when was the last time you spoke with hacket and wicker about thirty minutes ago and they dumped the bodies at gazichs house and left the gun there theyre outside the bank right now waiting for you to call they had found a safety deposit box key along with a file of financial documents at gazichs office one of the banks listed in the file was the hellenic bank of cyprus dumond penetrated the banks network and found out that they had a safety deposit box registered under the name of alexander deckas while he was inside the network he also collected some additional information dumond handed rapp a file the president of the bank is manos kapodistras he has a little more than three hundred thousand dollars in cash deposits at the bank in addition to that it looks like his ownership is about fifteen percent foreign deposits a lot of saudi money anyone we know about a fifth of the royal family rapp glanced at the file and then asked anything unusual doesnt appear to be but these bankers can be pretty sneaky with their money your advice dumond took a drag and said play it straight up tell him in his line of work his reputation is everything we can either do this in a very private manner or a very public one rapp nodded and then closed the file all rightlets call him dumond waved him behind the desk the screen on the left is a mirror image of the bankers that is exactly what hes looking at right now do you know if he opened your email yes has he replied to it no did he check the namedeckas against the bank records no okay connect me to his direct line dumond went to work on his keyboard and donned a headset using a sophisticated telecommunications program he bounced the call around so it would be untraceable when it started to ring he picked up the handset and gave it to rapp after the third ring a man answered in greek yeea sas mr kapodistras i need your assistance in a very important matter there was a long pause and then the banker asked who am i speaking with and how did you get this number neither is important at the moment what is important is that i am in a position to help you avoid a potentially embarrassing situation are you an american yes did you get the email i sent you about a press conference the fbi is going to hold today i did did the name alexander deckas mean anything to you no there was hesitation in the voice should it that depends how involved you are with your clients dumond pointed to the monitor that was mirroring kapodistrass screen the banker was searching his database looking for a match after a few seconds the client profile for deckas popped up on the screen it is the stated policy of our bank to not discuss our clients under any circumstances mr kapodistras i see that you were a vice president at the bank back in two thousand and one do you remember what it was like in your business when it was discovered that osama bin laden had been using cyprus banks to hide his alqaeda funds rapp had seen the official report greek regulators and us federal agents had descended on the mediterranean island and the banking business had been thrown on its ear decades of the cyprus banking industry marketing itself as the switzerland of the mediterranean was destroyed overnight by the actions of a militant few people banked on cyprus because it gave them the same thing the swiss did absolute privacy with exceptional service and they did it in many cases for half the fee the reduced fees were nice but the privacy was paramount clients fled in droves clients who had nothing to do with terrorism but nonetheless did not want any government knowing how much money they had or worse how they had obtained it it was a difficult time to be in my business but in difficult times comes great opportunity kapodistras sounded like a man who might be willing to deal well i have an opportunity for you today what kind of opportunity an opportunity to spare your bank from scrutiny that you do not need an army of regulators from athens and an even bigger army of us federal agents going through your bank file by fileline by line media parked out in front of your bank for a week driving your customers away it wont be pretty there was an extremely long pause before kapodistras replied whom do you work for the american government and why are you paying me this courtesy i am an impatient man and i believe the two of us can get what we both want without turning this into a public spectacle you are interested in this alexander deckas yes may i ask why yes do you remember the attack on presidentelect alexanders motorcade this past november the one that killed his wife yes what about it your client was the man who detonated the bomb there was no uncomfortable laugh no denial just silence for at least ten seconds and then what proof do you have more than you could imagine including a confession but for the sake of brevity im going to cut to the heart of the matter in two and a half hours the fbi is going to announce that they have arrested mr deckas the evidence against him is overwhelming a team of fbi agents is en route to your island right now they should be landing in a few hours i am offering you two choices the easy way or the hard way im listening rapp placed his hand over the mouthpiece and whispered to dumond tell wicker and hacket to go to his office rapp removed his hand and spoke into the phone on saturday night my people took mr deckas into custody and transported him back to america we went through his office and home in limassol and are in possession of his banking records as well as a key for a safety deposit box in your bank and you would like to see what is in that box thats correct and if i say no rapp sighed if you say no i will turn everything over to the fbi they will probably show up at your home tonight with the greek authorities and drag you down to the bank and force you to open the box the fbi being the thorough distrustful gents that they are will want to go through all of your records to make sure none of your other clients are connected with deckas the greek authorities will allow this because they will want to look like good alliesand after all the man killed the future presidents wife people will start to talk and you will become known as the bank of choice for terrorists and assassins your legitimate customers will leave out of fear of association and your unsavory customers will do the same for the exact same reason by the end of the week i would imagine your deposits will be cut in half and your fifteen percent stake in the bank will be worth considerably less who knowsyou might even be forced out whom do you work for the cia i can neither confirm nor deny that mr kapodistras how can i trust you rapp detected the tension in the mans voice he was being faced with a very tough but ultimately easy decision as far as i can tell sir you have brought none of this on yourself your job is to protect your bank your depositors and your investors the best way to do that is to give me what is in that box if my instincts are correct the sooner you distance yourself from the contents of that box the better off you and your bank will be what will prevent you from turning any evidence over to the fbi im not looking to put anyone in jail after a long pause the banker said i need some time to think about this ill give you one minute the banker laughed thinking rapp was joking im serious two of my men are probably talking to your secretary as we speak they expect you to come out of your office and take them down to the safety deposit room if you do not they will call me and i will turn everything i have over to the fbi i will also tell them that we have spoken and that you were extremely unhelpful in addition to that there are some other very nasty things i could employ but we dont want to get into that over the phone ill send someone to talk to you about it in person but there are procedures signature cards passwords the key we have the key and one of my men can forge the clients signature all you have to do is provide the password i will need to inventory the contents of the box go right ahead in factim sure theres some cash in there keep half of it for your troubles the rest of it though my men are taking with them do we have a deal yes the banker said without any hesitation we have a deal good now go straight out to your reception area and greet my men act like you have met them before the big one you may call kevin and the shorter one charlie take them straight downstairs and do whatever they ask of you if all goes well they will be out of your way in ten minutes or less any questions no good thank you for being so cooperative rapp placed the handset back in the cradle and said to dumond continue to monitor all of his calls and emails if he doesnt do exactly as we asked crash his entire system and tell wicker and hacket to get out of there rapp walked over and grabbed his jacket where are you going dumond asked i need to run down a lead what do you want me to tell them at langley if they start asking about you you never saw me you got it and find out who the russian is im working on it langley virginia brooks heard the directors voice on the intercom and her heart began to race this was it her whole career would be decided in the next ten minutes sheila with the overdone makeup and the infatuation with mitch rapp told her she could go in brooks stood her blond hair was in a tight ponytail and she was wearing a black pantsuit shed seen kennedy on tv before wearing virtually the same outfit brooks had intentionally decided to wear it today she was looking for any advantage she could get she tugged on the front of her white blouse adjusted the collar and grabbed the door handle brooks took one last deep breath and opened the door the door swung in and the first thing brooks saw were two stonefaced men sitting on a couch directly across the room it was juarez and mcmahon director kennedy stepped into view and extended her hand cindy director kennedy brooks took her hand its a real honor to meet you i just wish it was under better circumstances kennedy smiled warmly dont worry well get this mess straightened out please she gestured toward one of the armchairs opposite the couch take a seat brooks took the chair on the right and glanced nervously at her boss and the agent from the fbi neither man looked away between the two of them they had to have had sixty plus years of hard experience mcmahon was the special agent in charge of the investigation into the motorcade attack the fbi wouldnt give that job to just any agent they would bring in their best can i get you anything to drink kennedy asked as she took a seat in the chair next to brooks no thank you brooks crossed her legs and clasped her hands over her right knee gentlemen juarez and mcmahon didnt take their eyes off brooks they simply shook their heads well kennedy said as she withdrew her hand from the coffeepot in front of her it appears we have a bit of a problem she turned sideways so she was facing brooks ive known these two men here for some time ive seen them both in various states of anger but you young lady have somehow managed to really get them riled up kennedy tilted her head and smiled brooks not knowing how else to react laughed nervously why do you think that is brooks regained her composure for starters i would like to apologize mitch rapp ordered me not to discuss this operation with anyone until he cleared me to do so really juarez ran his thumb and forefinger down his mustache and then leaned forward would you like to show me the org chart where it says that mitch rapp is anywhere in your chain of command sir i brooks struggled for a response there is no such chart juarez snapped the director and i outrank mr rapp we are your bosses he isnt and if you dont get that through your thick head you are going to find yourself in a whole shitload of trouble kennedy looked at juarez her eyes telling him to back off she looked back to brooks cindy here is the situation the fbi has in custody a man who is alleged to have been behind the attack on presidentelect alexanders motorcade you delivered that man to andrews air force base yesterday afternoon correct correct do you believe this man is in fact the person we have been looking for yes why why asked brooks what evidence do you have i know this isnt what you want to hear director kennedy but i gave my word to mitch that i would not talk about this with anyone until he cleared it kennedy tried not to take offense she knew rapp was the real issue here not this young rookie i understand that mitch asked you not to talk about what happened on cyprus but im asking you as the director of the central intelligence agency kennedy put her arms out and looked around the spacious office the person who is responsible for this organization to tell me what happened brooks looked down and clasped her hands tightly together she was really in a bind she couldnt help but think that even if rapp did make good on his promise she would forever be stained by this complete lack of respect rapp had told her on the flight home not to worry just hang in there for twentyfour to thirtysix hours tops and everything would be fine she remembered him making her look him in the eye those beautiful yet intimidating almost black eyes and he asked her if she trusted him at the end of it all that was what it came down to she trusted him brooks looked up at kennedy and in a very polite voice said director kennedy may i ask you one question sure kennedy replied after a slight pause do you trust mitch at first kennedy felt blindsided by the question almost tricked but she could tell by the look on brookss face that she was sincere the debate strategy would have been to throw the question back at brooks or ask her a different one but kennedy didnt want to this young operative had just put the discussion into a very interesting light she smiled at brooks and said yes i do i trust him completely brooks nodded and brushed an errant strand of blond hair back behind her ear personally i dont particularly care for him really hes not the easiest person to work with you think so juarez asked sarcastically kennedy ignored him lone wolf very much so im afraid a great deal of that is due to his training when we recruited him he was very much a team player very social we had to teach him how to operate as an individuala lone wolf thats only part of it hes not well how so the mere mention of his wife sends him into a tirade at one point i actually thought he was going to hit me kennedy searched the young operatives eyes for a hint of dishonesty or a possible selfaggrandizing agenda but she didnt see a sign of either she was simply giving a dispassionate summary hes been through a lot yes i know but that doesnt excuse the fact that he hasnt been referred for counseling brooks watched kennedy look away from her and then check her watch she had hit a nerve it is not a criticism of management brooks added quickly hes not ready for help youd have to institutionalize him commit him to a psychiatric institution kennedy asked with a look of real shock on her face yes for his own good your graduate degree is in psychology kennedy asked yes kennedy glanced over at juarez who was shaking his head turning to brooks she said that was tried once before years ago before his wife years before how did it go brooks asked kennedy looked to juarez who said he killed the man who had him committed killed brooks said with surprise killed juarez repeated himself snapped his neck with his bare hands brooks looked at special agent mcmahon with a mix of shock and horror on her face dont look at me mcmahon put his hands up i turned my hearing aid off five minutes ago relax juarez said it turned out the treasonous bastard had it coming but thats a whole other story one that youre not cleared for the point is said kennedy you dont simply commit someone like mitch people would get hurt i think people might get hurt if he doesnt get help kennedy considered that possibility for a moment this is bullshit juarez said were completely off the subject here this meeting isnt about mitch ill deal with him when he comes in hes pulled this shit before just never quite so brazenly this is about you juarez leaned forward and pointed at brooks young lady its about you doing your job and telling me and the director here just what in the hell mitch is up to you either do that or your career is over its that simple brooks looked to kennedy the director looked at her without an expression and by the way your career isnt simply over i own your ass right now you have no rights you signed them away your first day on the job if you dont tell me what i want to know im going to march you down to the basement and have the boys from the office of security run you through the ringer hot lights and lots of difficult questions all while youre hooked up to a lie detector brooks was seriously considering telling them everything when an intercom buzzer sounded from atop kennedys desk director kennedy turned toward her desk and in a louder than normal voice asked yes sheila i have mitch for you on your direct line kennedy stood quickly did you start a trace he told me if i tried to trace the call hed never speak to me again for god sakes sheila does anyone work forme anymore put a trace on the call kennedy grabbed her handset and pressed line one mitch we were just talking about you only nice things im sure of course where are you across the street from the hoover building im thinking about turning myself in why in the world would you do that you havent done anything wrong you didnt sound so sure of that when we spoke yesterday ive had some time to reconsider i think it was a mistake to go public with this so quickly you think so rapp asked his voice full of sarcasm im trying to be magnanimous easy with the big words boss remember im not ivy league im serious no you arent youre just trying to keep me on the line so you can trace this call which we both know is a waste of time and resources as soon as were done this phone is history kennedy turned her back to the others and sat on the edge of her desk would you like to tell me what youre up to id love to boss but i think its best if i kept you out of the loop for another twentyfour hours how is brooks holding up fairly well considering youve put her entire career in jeopardy jose being pretty tough on her hes just getting started tell him to take it easy on her and tell him im one hundred percent sure this is the guy ill tell you what why dont you come in and well talk about it i cant not yet there are a few more things i need to run down just tell him to hold firm no matter what he hears this guy is guilty as shit and ive got the goods kennedy looked at the credenza behind her desk inside it was a safe and inside the safe were the photos baker had given her on saturday in a much softer voice she said i have something i need to show you what i cant talk about it right now when are you coming in tomorrowi hope all right ill give you until tomorrow and then we need to sit down am i clear crystal good tell jose ill call him in fifteen minutes and tell skip that no matter what he hears this is the guy i will thanks ill talk to you tomorrow the line went dead and kennedy slowly put the handset back in the cradle she turned around and relayed rapps message to both juarez and mcmahon and then she looked at the two men and said now if youll excuse me id like to have some time alone with ms brooks washington dc rapp got off the metro at the farragut west stop and took the escalator up to the sidewalk it was before eight and traffic was still light the wind had picked up a bit but it wasnt bad nothing wrong with a little frigid gust of wind slapping you in the face to let you know you were alive there was the inevitable starbucks directly across the street there was also one half a block down on his right and another one around the corner to his left and to the south a few storefronts rapp figured there were over a hundred of them in the downtown area rapp had been trained to avoid routines routines led to predictable behavior and identifiable tendencies things that could be used to an adversarys advantage effective people developed routines and efficiencies in their daytoday lives those routines almost always manifested as extremely predictable behavior rapp knew because hed used it to his advantage many times people woke at the same time every day or at least monday through friday they ate at the same three or four restaurants worked out at the same club typically at a set time and got their coffee at the same one or two starbucks every day usually the one closest to their home and the one closest to their office there were of course exceptions there was caribou and seattle s best and a few others plus the independents but in sheer number of stores none of them could compare to starbucks america was a caffeine nation and washington being its capital was no exception rapp wasnt sure if the person he was looking for was a coffee drinker or not there was probably a twenty percent chance that she was one of those yoga bending new age health nuts she took care of herself that much was obvious rapp had visited her shortly after the attack on the motorcade to get her version of the events he was helping put together a kind of postmortem report for the cia something that would not be shared with the other agencies the fbi was running the official investigation and the secret service had already done their own internal investigation rapp had not seen that report and hed wondered how rough it had been rapp looked west down i street and then east before crossing he entered the starbucks and walked up to the clean organized counter where he was met by a nice young black woman who greeted him warmly and asked him what she could get for him and said it like she meant it good service minus the attitude rapp grinned and ordered a medium dark roast she asked him if he wanted room for cream and he said no while she poured the coffee he checked out the other two employees behind the counter not one of them had a visible tattoo pierced body part or bad hairdo when the woman returned with his piping hot coffee rapp gave her three dollars and told her to keep the change she told him to have a nice day and then added that he should stop back in rapp smiled and thanked her he didnt feel like telling her he doubted he would be with a napkin in hand he took his coffee over to the ledge by the window set it down took the cap off and placed it on the tan recycled napkin it would be too hot to drink for at least a few minutes rapp had already noted the faces and general demeanor of the other five patrons in the place they all looked harmless enough probably accountants and admin types rapp set his phone on the counter face down and inserted the sim card and the battery after hed turned it on he opened his address book and hit w the first name that came up was jack warch former special agent in charge of president hayess secret service detail and recently promoted deputy director of the united states secret service rapp hit the send button and brought the phone up to his ear after a few rings a voice answered saying warch here rapp brought his free hand up to partially cover his mouth he whispered into the phone i have a bomb there was a long pause and then warch said excuse me rapp muttered a quick sura in arabic and then repeated his assertion i have a bomb you have a bomb the concerned voice on the phone asked yes what are you going to do with it im going to shove it up your ass rapp started to laugh there was a pause and then warch said is that you mitch you jerk come on rapp said while still laughing im just trying to liven up your day now that youre fulltime management very funny im sorry i wont do it again yes you will i know and im not sorry where the hell are you rapp looked out the window the secret service headquarters was only a few blocks away im in town i hear people are looking for you yeahso whats new some people are saying you fucked up mitch nothing im not used to is this really the guy absolutely youre a hundred percent sure one hundred percent is that your gut or your brain talking both my guy whos working with justice on this says they dont share your conviction rapp smiled that was exactly what he wanted to hear i doubt they would approve of my methods but let me tell you something jack this guy is absolutely one hundred percent the guy who detonated the bomb evidence more than enough to send him to the gas chamber we dont use those anymore well for this guy we should maybe you could get them to resurrect old sparky the electric chairconsidering the fact that he killed the next presidents wife id say it might actually happen are you going to give the justice department the evidence or is this the type of stuff you dont want dragged into open court theyll get it all in a day or two but dont tell anyone i told you that i want them to sweat it a little longer is it true what you shot the guy four times i have no idea what youre talking about i read the man his rights handcuffed him and handed him over to the fbi the last i saw of the guy he was in perfect physical health so if he was shot it was the fbi absolutely warch laughed ill have to tell the president that hell get a real kick out of it listen rapp said getting serious i need to talk to one of your people who agent rivera warch was quiet for a moment why dont worry jack im not going to get her in trouble i just have a few questions about how things went down back in october im not sure how talkative shes going to be why the preliminary internal report was released to the top brass yesterday and she got pretty beatup dont tell me you fuckers blamed the whole thing on her i had nothing to do with it but you know how it works were like the navysomething goes wrong on your command and it doesnt matter if it was your fault or not you go down with the ship either way rapp was tempted to argue with him about their tactics but he hadnt seen the report and it wasnt why he called do you have a number where i can reach her yeahhold on a minute so is she going to lose her job i dont think theyll fire her theyll stick her in a boring job pending the completion of the official investigation and then theyll stick her in an even more boring job warch found the number and gave it to rapp when is she usually in nine she works out at some karate studio over on thirteenth and li guess shes a real badass yeah right im serious so am i mitch im not kidding there isnt a guy at the service who will spar with her thats why she goes over to this other place word is shes been taking her frustration out on them thirteenth and l yep thanks rapp put the white lid on his coffee cup do me a favor we never talked you got it rapp smiled warch was a solid guy mitch one other thingthanks for catching this guy the service really appreciates it and i mean that you ever need anythingall you have to do is ask jack it was my pleasure rapp pressed the end button and considered calling rivera on her mobile he decided against it and pulled the battery and sim card out of the phone he took his first sip of the hot coffee and then headed out the door he figured it would take him about five minutes to walk to the studio it was better to surprise her and get an honest unprepared reaction rapp knew enough to finish his coffee before entering the dojo it would be a sign of disrespect to bring any food or beverage inside the karate training hall fronted th street in the typical american fashion pedestrians could stand on the sidewalk and watch the class the place had two large picture windows with a door to the left the reasons for the windows were twofold first it helped demystify the martial art to the average person which would encourage more walkins and secondly it provided an additional distraction that the students needed to get used to rapp stood at the window for several minutes watching the sensei run the class through their routines they were currently sparring eight students paired up practicing their sanbon kumite or threestep moves their sensei walked between them either complimenting or correcting everything was done low key no yelling or badgering rapp picked rivera out right away it was hard to miss her black ponytail flying around as she twirled and kicked just as warch had told him she was a black belt the man she was sparring with looked to be a few inches taller and a good forty pounds heavier he was the only other black belt in the class and she was kicking the shit out of him rapp took his last few sips of coffee and smiled as she delivered a blistering combination that left her opponent dazed and on his back the sensei stepped in giving rivera a disapproving look rapp was surprised to see rivera begin talking back to her sensei a move that was frowned upon the instructors face flushed and then in a further sign of disrespect rivera turned her back on the man rapp had been in a fair number of street fights as a kid but it wasnt until he went to work for the cia that he really learned how to fight theyd started him out with karate and then judo he had little difficulty learning both and while the fundamentals were sound and the discipline was needed he instinctively knew that in the real world fighting was far more frantic judo and karate had too many rules too many constraints it was on a trip to fort bragg for some additional training that he sat in on a jujitsu class from the first minutes he knew this was a form that was more suited for real world combat while karate used mostly feet and hand strikes and judo used mostly holds and throws jujitsu combined both and then added knees elbows head butts choke holds submission holds and even a few more rapp began training in earnest eventually spending several months in brazil learning gracie jujitsu from the grand master himself helio gracie over the years he added some thai boxing to his regimen but for the most part he focused on gracie jujitsu eventually earning a thirddegree black belt rapp looked through the glass at the redfaced sensei and wondered if he would make an example of her all instructors were not created equal some looked good in their white robes and black belts and could hold their own when practicing one and threestep moves jiyu kumite or freestyle sparring was a whole other matter worse put them in a noholdsbarred situation where any form of fighting could be used and they were in serious trouble with their narrow disciplined approach outside their particular area of martial arts their ability to predict their opponents moves was all but gone this sensei appeared to be in his fifties and looked as if hed been in a few scrapes his nose was flattened out a bit which meant it had been broken on more than one occasion and he had scar tissue built up around his eyes rivera turned around to face him and put her hands stiffly at her sides rapp couldnt tell what the sensei was saying to her but after ten seconds rivera bowed and walked away rapp laughed to himself and decided to go in he dropped his coffee cup in the garbage by the door and entered the small foyer it had benches on both sides and hooks on the wall shoes were lined up under the bench rapp looked through the glass into the training room and caught riveras eye he gestured for her to join him she shook her head and motioned for him to come into the training room rapp hesitated for a second and then figured what the hell he took off his shoes and placed them under the bench and then hung his trench coat on a hook with his gun at the small of his back he kept his suit coat on rapp stepped into the training room the floor was covered with a walltowall blue mat looking across the room at the sensei rapp bowed showing his respect and then looked at rivera and said may i please have a word with you she put one foot in front of the other and rested a hand on each hip why dont you go back to the locker room and put on a gi we can talk while we spar rapp smiled and said i dont think so really rivera walked across the mat and stopped just a few feet short of him come on tough guy are you afraid no rapp shook his head i have more important suddenly rapp was jerked off his feet he realized what was happening a split second too late he recognized the hold it wasnt karate it was judo a doublehanded shoulder throw midway through the air rapp heard a tearing noise and knew instantly it was his suit coat he was so caught off guard by riveras lack of discipline that he never saw it coming his only choice was to go with it and lessen the fall as much as possible when he hit the ground the gun that he was carrying at the small of his back dug into his spine rapps entire body arched with pain rivera held onto his arm and put her bent right knee against his side the whitehot pain at the base of his back was excruciating above it all though he heard the voice of the sensei ordering rivera to stand down the mans face appeared above rapp are you all right rapp took a shallow breath and then another the sensei offered a hand and rapp took it when he got to his feet he only had one thing on his mind he looked at the sensei and said gi please the sensei looked at rivera with extreme disappointment and then ordered one of the students to go fetch one of the white uniforms and a belt rapp walked over to the corner and took off his suit coat reaching around he grabbed his gun and its holster and unclipped them from his waistband rapp held up the gun and showed rivera what he had landed on she looked slightly embarrassed but her intensity didnt wane a bit by the time the student came back with a uniform rapp had his tie and dress shirt off not caring a bit what the class thought he peeled off his white tshirt to reveal his scarred upper torso three pucker marks from bullet holes and a big halfmoon scar on his back from a surgery hed had to remove a lodged bullet and repair some vital organs rapp stripped down to his boxers and put the gi on he paused momentarily as he looked at the brown belt it occurred to him that he had never worn one his original karate and judo training was done in secret and hed worn only white belts his training had been more about teaching him how to kill and disable than passing exams it wasnt until he showed up at the gracie school that he was run through the wringer after a solid month of training and fighting where he had beat all comers except the gracie boys themselves he was presented with a black belt at the time hed had no idea how unusual this was but the gracies made their own rules and they prized the ability to beat an opponent over all else rapp tied the belt the way hed been taught almost eighteen years ago and looked up at rivera who was now in the middle of the room bouncing around rolling her head one way and then the other like a prizefighter she held up a clear mouth guard and said freestyle rapp looked to the sensei and said jiyu kumite the sensei nodded and looked to his pupils who without having to be told lined up along the far wall and dropped to their knees rapp walked to the middle of the room his guard up this time he had no idea what her problem was or whether it was with him directly men in general or the entire world at the moment he couldnt have cared less karate was as much a discipline as a sport and what rivera deserved right now was to be taught a lesson the only question for rapp was how long to make the lesson he didnt give a shit how many black belts she may have racked up she didnt have a chance if you could last a minute on the mat with one of the gracie boys who were basically bred to fight there wasnt a woman on the planet who could take you rapp gave the ceremonial bow and rivera did the same although she had a smile on her face she had no idea what she was in for rapp took two steps back and was just settling into a relaxed back stance when she came charging forward rivera unleashed a series of combination kicks and strikes spinning and lashing out up and down the only problem was she never came within a foot of hitting her target rapps hands stayed clasped at the small of his back he countered her every move by stepping back to either his left or right and twisting his body clear of her hands and feet rivera chased him in a counterclockwise circle around the mat unleashing five separate combinations of three moves or more screeching a loud kiai or shout with each move she stopped after the last move which happened to be her best it was a spinning back kick that shed used to knock out countless opponents shed assumed rapp was good but she beat men all the time there wasnt an agent at the secret service anymore who would step onto the mat with her the first four moves usually had her opponent so confused and bewildered that they left themselves wide open for the spinning back kick a little love tap to the chin and it was over before it really got started rapp was left standing however and his hands were still clasped behind his back rivera couldnt believe it he was taunting her she paused to catch her breath and assess the situation for a second before redoubling her attack rapp reversed his retreat having identified the fact that like most fighters she preferred to mount her attack from right to left so she could get her strong side which appeared to be her right side into the fight with more velocity she was coming at him even faster now with more abandon leaving herself open to counterattack she came within inches of landing a rising elbow strike and left herself so wide open that rapp couldnt resist taking a shot he was already dropping his weight to miss her elbow so he simply continued the downward move and began to spin degrees until his back was to her his left leg shot out so fast rivera never saw it his heel struck the center of her solar plexus with about half the force he could have delivered rapp pulled out of the move and stepped back rather than press the attack rivera brought her forearms down and her elbows in to protect her midsection she paused for a beat angry that he had got the better of her blocking out the pain rivera said is that all you can put behind a kick rapp shook his head not even close he didnt know if he should admire her or send her to the hospital he decided to change styles and give her something else to worry about rapp rose up out of his relaxed back stance and moved forward a half step to his left his arms and fists came up like a boxer but higher his entire body bobbed one way and then the other suddenly he hopped forward landing on his right foot his hands were up near his face reaching out for rivera he performed the move so quickly that she was left with only one choice and that was to stay in a defensive position as rapps hands came down on her shoulders his left knee came up he leaned back slightly and thrust his rear hip forward bringing his knee up and into her stomach rivera partially blocked the blow with her right forearm but it didnt matter much it landed with such force that her whole body came off the mat and she let loose a low guttural groan rivera tried to clutch his leg before he wound up for another shot but he simply backed away rapp could have finished her off one more knee strike followed up with a downward elbow strike to her back and it would have been over but he wanted to see what she was really made of it was one thing to attack someone who you thought was an inferior opponent it was another thing to attack someone when you knew you were outmatched rivera staggered to the side and backed far enough away so she could stand up and take in a deep breath as she did so she felt a stabbing pain in her side and realized she might have a broken rib she vanquished the thought and stared across the mat at rapp there was a split second of doubt but she suppressed it he was standing tall which opened him up to a leg sweep if she could get him on the ground maybe she could put him into a submission hold rivera pulled in her core and pushed away the pain in that slight pause in the fight she saw her strategy she would deliver a flying kick which she would pull at the last second and then land and sweep his legs out from underneath him rapp saw the look in her eye hed intentionally baited her by staying tall like a thai boxer rather than dropping back into a karate stance he saw her eyes quickly check his feet and then he watched as she gathered herself up for the attack she backed up a few steps getting the bounce back in her step and then sprang forward rapp waited until the last possible second he didnt want her to abort the move as soon as she brought her right leg up for the expected flying kick rapp stepped forward and to the right closing the distance and occupying the space rivera planned on using to unleash her leg sweep rapp deflected the leg kick with his left hand and continued past her rivera landed off balance and before she could recover rapp had hold of her one arm slipped around her throat and the other came up under her left armpit he pulled her back off her feet and allowed his full weight to collapse her to the mat rapp sat her down on her ass dropping to his own knees and tightening the rear stranglehold on her throat rivera had been in this hold only once before and it hadnt ended well she drew her legs in and tried to stand but he leaned on her even harder and tightened the hold around her neck she grasped for a finger to snap but couldnt get a hold of one spots started to enter her vision from the sides she was winded from fighting and needed air she knew all she had to do was raise her fight hand and submit but she couldnt allow herself to do that with one final effort she dug her nails into his forearm and then started scratching for his eyes rapp didnt bother to ask her to submit she knew how this game was played it was hers to ask for and his to grant he also knew it was unlikely that she would in a final attempt to break free she reached up to gouge his eyes something that was perfectly expected in a street fight but here in the dojo it was strictly forbidden he turned his head away and she gave him a good scratch on his cheek rapp held the hold firmly and a few seconds later rivera went limp rapp hadnt worked up a sweat so he got dressed and waited outside for rivera she came out ten minutes later her hair wet and pulled back in a ponytail so i suppose you hung around to gloat rivera threw open the right side of her black trench coat and placed her hand on the hilt of her service pistol no but from your tone it sounds like you could use another ass kicking what do you want with me she sounded irritated we need to talk have you had breakfast she looked at her watch no time i cant be late for work im under double secret probation is that the reason for your attitude if you really care to know yes it is three months ago i was a rising star and now im an embarrassment come on rapp grabbed her by the elbow i spotted a breakfast place around the corner we need to talk about a few things i told you i cant theyre looking for an excuse to fire me i need to get to work fuck em you didnt do anything they didnt train you to do come on lets go she dug in her heels what is that supposed to mean you followed secret service procedure plain and simple and what is wrong with our procedures she said defensively oh youre a pain in the ass just drop the feminist bull dyke bravado for thirty minutes alright im buying lets go riveras eyes squinted did you just call me a bull dyke noi said drop the bull dyke attitude you knowthe whole female cop that has to prove shes tougher than any man you think im a lesbian i dont care if youre gay straight bi or whatever the hell floats your boat all im telling you is that i dont need yourfucking attitude i showed up here this morning because i have something important to talk to you about and you pull that classless cheap shot bullshit move thinking youre all tough rapp got in her face myfucking back is killing me you dropped me on myfucking gunyoure lucky i didnt break your jaw yeahwell if it makes you happy i think you broke one of my ribs rivera slid a hand under her jacket and winced as she touched her side good rapp looked around and then said can we go have breakfast now im not kidding theyre building a file on me any excuse to get rid of me it occurred to rapp that she was so outside the loop that she had no idea hed captured the man responsible for the motorcade attack did you read the paper or turn on the tv this morning no i got up and ran five miles and then came here five miles and then you came here yeahthats probably why you beat me next time im going to make sure im ready are you delusional nojust realistic rapp shook his head and started walking come on i need something to eat im serious i have to go maybe we could meet for lunch without breaking stride rapp yelled over his shoulder did i mention that i found the man in the red hat rivera hesitated for a second and then called back what you heard me three seconds later the secret service agent was at his side are you jerking me around because if you are i swear easy killer you really need to calm down you should talk im a guy there you go with the sexist stuff again rapp glanced at her sideways and decided to ignore the comment i found the guy on cyprus dragged him back here yesterday and handed him over to the fbi theyre going to announce the whole thing at ten oclock this morning does the secret service know i talked to jack warch this morning he knew bastards you think they would have called me relax theres a chance they only found out this morning rivera shook her head you dont understand i dont exist to them anymore all i am is a reminder of one of the services greatest failures rapp supposed she was right they came up on a small diner and rapp grabbed the door and held it for her they went to a booth near the back and rapp practically had to fight rivera for the side that faced the door rapp took off his trench coat and when he sat down he lifted his right arm and checked out the torn seam on his suit coat im going to pay for that rivera said rapp ignored her so i have a few questions for you im serious about paying for it dont ignore me are you always this confrontational or is this all related to work i think i used to be a pretty positive person she got reflective for a moment i was happy with my job my life was good although things were a little barren in the love department but when were in campaign mode theres no time for anything and then the damn bomb went off and its been pretty shitty ever since then rapp studied her slightly surprised by her honesty rivera was an extremely attractive woman she could use a little softening around the edges but the beauty was undeniable and it was all natural she didnt have to work at a thing without any makeup or real sense of style she was an effortless eight at a place like the secret service that would make her a ten and like all law enforcement agencies the secret service had no shortage of puss hounds if he remembered her file right she was in her midthirties any woman who was this attractive and still single at this point in her life must have some issues you ever wish you had died in the attack rapp knew it was a common reaction from survivors especially survivors whose job it was to protect those who died rivera studied rapp for a moment and then said i thinkwish might be a little strong but yeah ive thought about it the waitress pulled up to the table and killed the conversation they both ordered coffee and water and rivera ordered the hearthealthy omelet while rapp asked for the corned beef and hash when the waitress was gone rivera began peppering him with questions about the man in the red hat rapp gave her the vanilla version only maybe just a little more than what the fbi already knew and then he took control of the conversation i havent read the report in sometime so i cant remember did you use electronic jammers that morning rivera shook her head that was one of the things ive been criticized for they were available to you and you didnt use them rap asked a bit surprised thats what they say but there wasnt a person on the detail who knew that and no one back at headquarters ever told us directly that they were available they dug up some bullshit cover your ass interoffice memo that they claim was sent to us the only problem is during the campaign were on the fly nonstop we dont have time to read a fortypage memo on our blackberry so no jammers correct rapp grabbed the saltandpepper shakers and lined them up one in front of the other and then switched them but you shuffled the cars right rivera shook her head her answer shocked rapp but he hid his surprise all right walk me through the last five minutes please how were you deployed when did you begin to rollthe whole routine while rivera began to talk rapp started to consider the possibility that gazich had lied to him about the phone call telling him it was the second limo if hed lied to him about that what else had he lied to him about rapp only half listened to rivera as she relayed the details of the tragic afternoon he was already trying to figure out how he could get his hands on gazich for a more indepth interrogation geneva switzerland the idyllic town of geneva was perhaps the most conflicted city on the planet as the bedrock of puritanical calvinism the city was as buttoned up and straitlaced as any in a country that prided itself on cleanliness good manners and lots of rules that was by day the cars most of them bmws mercedes or audis were spotless the men most of them bankers financiers accountants or lawyers wore expensive handmade suits that never went out of style by some estimates as much as a quarter of the worlds private wealth was deposited in the vaults of genevas banks which meant that a town with only a quarter million people held more private assets than new york london paris hong kong or tokyo it hardly seemed possible but it was the genevese like the long line of religious hypocrites who had gone before them had somehow managed to reconcile their calvinist beliefs with an absolute lust for money how could a quarter of the worlds private wealth end up in a relatively small city you might ask the answer was pretty straightforward the swiss maintained absolute secrecy when it came to their banking records many of their clients were legitimate business people and members of european royalty who simply wanted to keep their finances their own business a disproportionate number though were reprobates and sociopaths people who had lied cheated and even killed to amass their wealth if these bad eggs had simply deposited their illgotten gains in the highpolished banks of geneva the story of the city by the lake would have been fairly boring there was a byproduct of this secret banking relationship however that the communitys modernday leaders had never predicted geneva had become a magnet for wealthy scoundrels and criminals from every continent because many of them obtained their wealth by breaking the law they were wanted by their home countries for prosecution and in some cases the gallows this influx of sociopaths and megalomaniacs had created an extremely interesting social experiment at least joseph speyer found it interesting the fiftysixyearold banker had grown up in geneva and like many gay men of his generation was forced to hide his sexuality until well into his thirties his family was strict protestant reformation lots of rules and not a lot of fun they were not unique in this regard but all this repression ended up breeding a lot of closet gays masochists and perverts in general add to that the influx of extremely wealthy people suffering from a vast array of antisocial personality disorders and you had the perfect recipe for a city with a depraved counterculture speyer was on his way to find one of geneva s chief reprobates it was monday evening mondays were the one day of the week that the citys hot nightclubs were closed nightclubs that when you stripped away the thirtydollar drinks and fancy décor were nothing more than whorehouses prostitution was legal in switzerland that had been a big dilemma for the lawmakers the fathers of the reformation would have never approved of making the flesh trade legal but it was argued that the banking business needed it to stay competitive the influx of wealthy arab princes and other international players who began flocking to the city in the seventies liked their women and they didnt mind paying exorbitant sums of money for them after several decades of lying to themselves and looking the other way the ordered society came to grips with the problem legalized it and began collecting taxes speyer took perverse joy in all of this he was a voyeur at heart and few things excited him more than meeting the needs of his sexually depraved clients cy green was one such client the man had a thirst for sex that to some might seem like an addiction but comparing it to a few other people he knew speyer saw it as simply a healthy appetite green wanted sex every night he had confided in speyer that he thought it was all part of the alpha male persona monogamous sex was out of the question green preferred two women and foreplay that almost always involved him watching speyer knew because hed been forced to sit through it speyer wedged his bmw sedan into a spot a block away from greens apartment and walked along the narrow sidewalk he stepped into the relatively small foyer and approached the bulletproof glass to speak to the doorman geneva had become a city of bulletproof glass and bodyguards far too many of its wealthy immigrants were wanted by their former governments and business rivals at least once a year if not more there was a salacious murder the man behind the glass recognized speyer and greeted him in french before picking up the phone to call the penthouse green owned the top floor of the building six thousand square feet which might not be obscene by normal wealthy standards but was huge for downtown geneva after a moment the doorman buzzed speyer through when the banker reached the elevator the door was already open he stepped in pressed the button for the top floor and took off his leather driving gloves the trip to the fourth floor was quick when the door opened speyer found two men waiting for him the older of the two was greens personal valet and butler he was dressed in a black waistcoat black vest white shirt and black bowtie speyer handed him his gloves and turned around so he could take his coat for him as soon as the valet had the gray cashmere overcoat off the bodyguard stepped in with a handheld metal detector and ran it around the periphery of speyer s body it was the same routine every time speyer never complained and green never apologized when they were finished speyer was escorted into the living room and asked if he cared for anything to drink he told the manservant he was fine and checked his watch he hoped green wouldnt make him wait too long it had been a long day and it was sure to be a long week some very big promises had been made and the time left to deliver on them was waning six minutes later green appeared in a blue silk robe with white piping and matching house slippers his dark hair was slicked back and slightly messed up in back the eternally tan billionaire strode across the room pulling on the robes belt he looked at speyer with a devilish grin and said youve come to watch havent you no speyer took off his blackframed glasses and placed them in his suit pocket im afraid im simply playing the role of messenger green considered this for a moment and with a shake of his head said follow me speyer sighed and said im afraid im short on time green kept walking nonsense we have important things to discuss plus i do not want to miss the show he disappeared down the hallway and then a few seconds later his head popped back around the corner by the way i just opened a bottle of ninetytwo screaming eagle even a french wine snob like you cant say no to that a smile formed at the corners of speyer s mouth and then his feet started to move green was right screaming eagle was very rare and very hard to resist he followed him down the hall to the master bedroom suite close the door behind you green commanded they walked through a woodpaneled library with a big screen tv and a sitting area the heavy beat of euro techno music could be heard beyond the double doors that led to the actual bedroom green thrust open the doors straight ahead was a turneddown kingsize bed with black silk sheets speyer looked to his right knowing full well that was where the action would be the large window that looked out over lake geneva was obscured by heavy black drapes that acted as a backdrop to the sex show that was taking place in the alcove of the window green had designed the small stage himself the alcove was ten feet wide by four feet deep on both sides were narrow doors that when opened revealed a series of hooks chains and ropes standing in the middle of the stage was a young blond wearing pigtails clogs and a short summer dress behind her stood a tall dominatrix covered literally in black latex from head to her spike heeled boots the only openings were for her mouth eyes breasts and crotch the woman had a riding crop in one hand and an impossibly large dildo in the other sit green ordered two chairs were already set up green brought over the bottle of wine and poured a second glass speyer even though he was gay had been titillated the first time hed attended one of these private shows green mistook his excitement as proof that he was actually bisexual speyer had experimented with a lot of things over the years but he was simply gay nothing really too complicated about it hed figured it out when he was eleven and then spent the next ten years or so trying to repress it he knew now that the aspect of the sex show that had originally excited him was the corruption of youth the fall from grace of a young heterosexual woman after that one show though speyer couldnt get past the fact that the women were simply russian prostitutes whose fall from grace had taken place long before woo a duchess or other high society type or even a straitlaced colleague over to the forbidden side and that would be worth watching these were just two hungry young women trying to earn some money by exciting a perverted billionaire what do you think green asked without taking his eyes off the women dont tell anyone since when did you get shy about this type of stuff i mean the wine speyer took a sip savoring the california wine its good isnt it very but im serious you must not tell anyone relax green grinned now what is the message youve been sent to deliver i received a call this afternoon from mr garret dont tell me that little fucker is trying to wiggle out of the deal its interesting you should put it that way because if i didnt know better i would say that is exactly what he is trying to do greens tanned face slowly turned toward speyer his eyes narrowed and he asked what in the hell did he say i want to hear it word for word supposedly the person who was hired to do the job has been captured what the man who vasili hired was caught the americans have him in custody there was a press conference this afternoon speyer knew that green was hearing this for the first time the man never watched tv and left the internet up to his assistants how is that possible vasili told me himself that it was being taken care of obviously he was premature in his promise green stood and began waving his hands stopstop girls take a break ill be back in a few minutes he grabbed the bottle of wine and said to speyer follow me they went out into the library and closed the double doors green set the bottle of screaming eagle on the fireplace mantle next to the pool table a large portrait of none other than green himself dominated the wall above the mantel speyer stood on the other side of the pool table and looked at green next to his portrait the double image spoke volumes of the man and his ego as im sure you can imagine mr garret was extremely upset when isnt that little fucker upset have you ever met a more irritating person in all your life speyer decided it was better to not answer the question he has a point this time im beginning to question your wisdom you were the one who advised me to do this thats what i pay you to do you said it would be a good return on my investment it was almost impossible for his clients to surprise him hed seen it all their selective memory their ability to rationalize or simply forget every bad decision or deed theyd ever committed was endless while their capacity to fixate or create blame elsewhere was eternal cy before we go any further i want to make it very clear that you brought this proposal to my attention you expressed your desire to proceed from the very beginning and you never vacillated you wanted to do this i merely supported you green stared at him for a moment and decided to change the subject ill tell you what pisses me off ive already spent millions of dollars on this ive leveraged some of my most important contacts ive risked a lotand what have they done speyer shrugged they havent done shit wheres my fucking pardon they always said it wouldnt happen until the last minute what are they waiting for there isnt much time left ive told you it would likely take place this saturday green began pacing in front of the fireplace are we sure the americans have the right guy i have no way of knowing plus i have no idea who the right guy is yeah green said as if he had figured something out vasili is the only one who knows have you called vasili no speyer did not like dealing with the russian mobster directly not if he could avoid it ill call him and find out whats going on and in the meantime you call that little prick garret and tell him i said i want my pardon speyer nodded took a large gulp of wine and questioned once again the wisdom of working with men like green and garret washington dc the justice department sat directly across pennsylvania avenue from fbi headquarters rosss motorcade pulled up to the building unannounced at on tuesday morning stu garret jonathon gordon and ross emerged from the back of the armored limousine and proceeded across the wide sidewalk surrounded by a phalanx of secret service agents a single agent ran into the building ahead of everyone so he could alert security that the vice presidentelect was coming in to see the attorney general much of the hassle could have been avoided if theyd called ahead but ross liked to make surprise visits the vice president to be told the agent in charge of his detail that it was a way of getting a better sense of how things actually ran the agent suspected it had more to do with ross liking to keep people off balance ross his chief of staff and his campaign manager skirted the security lines and crowded into an elevator with four tall agents they went to the top floor and down the hall to the attorney generals suite during rosss short stint as the director of national intelligence he spent many mornings attending security briefings at the department of justice they passed several administrative assistants in the hallway ross always the politician smiled and greeted them the attorney general had a goodsized outer office where three secretaries sat behind large desks ross was about to say good morning when the door to stokess conference room flew open a sixfoottall blond appeared in the doorway with her back to the reception area she was wearing a brown longsleeved formfitting dress belted at the waist and a pair of leather boots you guys are out of your minds she yelled you can find someone else im not going anywhere near this thing peggy please come back in here and sit down ross and his entourage stood motionless and silent on the threshold between the hallway and the reception area ross knew this woman and although he couldnt see attorney general stokes he knew his voice well enough to know it was he who had asked her to come back in and sit down marty the tall blond said you more than any other person in this building should know he is the wrong guy to mess with just close the door and sit down im in no mood for the theatrics this morning theatrics she yelled you want to see some real theatrics keep doing what youre doing he gets wind of this and hell eat you for lunch ross grinned it appeared they had stepped in to the middle of a disagreement the three secretaries were looking back and forth between the next vice president of the united states of america and the leggy blond deputy attorney general in the doorway the leggy blond was peggy stealey ross knew her by reputation more than anything else she was an intense lawyer who did not suffer fools lightly peggy im serious stokes said raising his voice get back in here we need to finish discussing this marty did i somehow give you the impression that i wasnt taking this seriously because if i did i would like to set the record straight where mitch rapp is concerned i take things very seriously she folded her arms across her chest if you want to continue down this path which i am advising against thats your prerogative just go find someone else because im telling you i want nothing to do with it youre the deputy assistant attorney general in charge of counterterrorism this case is yours whether you like it or not i never said i wouldnt handle the case im just not going to investigate mitch rapp and thats final stealey turned to leave but after a step she noticed the group of men standing in the doorway and she stopped dead in her tracks before she could speak the attorney general yelled from the conference room times are changing peggy rapp and his boss have made a lot of enemies in this town and this mess he created isnt going to win him any friends ross looked at the blueeyed woman standing before him with her high cheekbones and strong jaw she looked decidedly scandinavian ross extended his hand ms stealey stealey hesitated for a second unsure of which title to use mr vice president ross clasped her right hand firmly took a step closer and then placed his left hand on her shoulder smiling warmly he whispered hes right you know excuse me stealey was taken slightly aback times they are achanging that tends to happen around here every four years or so ross studied her she was nearing forty and her skin was still flawless ross leaned forward placing his mouth within inches of stealeys right ear dont worry about mitch rapp you wont recognize the cia a year from now stealeys blue eyes narrowed into an analytical stare i dont make mistakes very often but when i do i learn from them ross nodded and smiled he thought of something stokes had once told him about peggy stealey he had compared her to a thunderstorm the anticipation of her arrival was made up of equal amounts of fear and excitement over the awesome spectacle that was about to commence if she blew through quickly it made for a rather enjoyable watching but if she hovered or stalled she could cause serious damage and what am i supposed to glean from that comment ross asked stealey pulled ross closer and in a soft voice said dont fuck with mitch rapp and with that she was gone ross stood motionless for a few seconds his permasmile plastered across his face slowly he turned and watched his entourage move out of the way for stealey ross kept smiling even though inside his temper was raging stokes may have found the womans outspokenness refreshing but ross found it downright disrespectful garret came forward and in a quiet voice asked what did she say ross smiling like a ventriloquists dummy said ill tell you later he turned and walked into the conference room finding the attorney general and two of his deputies sitting at the far end of a massive conference table stokes and the other two men quickly got to their feet when they saw ross nono said ross after they were well out of their chairs dont bother getting up he gestured in a downward motion with his hands i just wanted to drop in and congratulate you on your victory presidentelect alexander asked me to personally thank you for catching the man responsible for his wifes death attorney general stokes looked awkwardly to his left and then his right the three men all shared an uncomfortable look the case might not be as strong as we were originally led to believe ross swore rumors spread quicker in washington dc than any other city in the world there were so many reporters so many political hacks on both sides of the aisle and far too many people who strived to prove their selfworth by acting like they were in the know the news of the arrest sent shock waves through dc the story was simply too big to keep a lid on president hayes made it clear that he wanted langley to finally get some credit the doj and fbi could ride the cias coattails but langley deserved the lions share people at the three agencies began leaking almost immediately by the time the press conference took place on monday morning half the town knew what was going on it all sounded like a major victory for the cia by midafternoon though the rumor mill began churning out a different story it started as a whisper there were some problems with the case by evening the whisper had grown into a murmur suddenly the three agencies were tightlipped again which was always a sign that something was wrong now this morning the press was on the offensive burning up the phones trying to get sources to confirm the worstcase scenario which was that the cia had grabbed the wrong guy garret never one to miss an opportunity went into full spin mode he quickly drafted a battle plan but cautioned ross that they needed to go over to justice and find out what was fact and what was fiction before they took a hard position so ross found himself playing dumb and looking to an old colleague from the senate for confirmation whats wrong ah stokes sighed im not even sure i know where to begin im a little miffed here martin last i heard this thing was a slam dunk thats what i was told as well but now some problems have popped up some potentially embarrassing problems such as such asthe man we have in custody might not be the right guy excuse me rosss eyes got wide and he thrust his chin out the man in question is a greek citizen he has proclaimed his innocence since the moment he was handed over to the fbi on sunday afternoon this wouldnt be the first time a criminal claimed he was innocent tell me about it if it was just that i wouldnt give it a second thought but theres more or should i say less stokes shared an uncomfortable look with his two deputies for starters the greek ambassador is filing an official letter of protest that im told will be delivered to the state department this afternoon why they are claiming that the cia kidnapped this man who really cares ross had thought this one through if this is the man who attacked the motorcade the greeks can file all the damn letters of protest they want the problem is were not sure this is the right guy what do you mean youre not sure we were told this is the guy we were told there was hard evidence against him and weve seen nothing what do you mean youve seen nothing stokes let out a frustrated sigh on sunday afternoon we received a prisoner the prisoner was wounded hed been shot four times once in each knee and once in each hand tortured ross asked id say so stokes looked to his deputies for a consensus and both men nodded has the man admitted to anything not to us but the cia claims he confessed during transit from cyprus back to the states while he was being tortured ross said with his best youve got to be kidding me look that is what hes claiming the suspect yes shit do you have a tape of the confession no why not weve been asking the cia for over a day and have gotten nowhere ross cocked his head to the side excuse me i assume youve heard it was rapp who found this guy i have heard that rumor well its true the problem is no one knows where he is this was his op he was the one who found him so whats the problem we dont have a single shred of evidence in our possession that can connect this guy to the crime the prisoner has submitted to and passed a lie detector test and the greek government has no record of him leaving cyprus during the time of the attack the suspect claims to have witnesses that will swear to the fact he was at home on cyprus the day of the attack ross turned to look at garret who in his typical unvarnished manner blurted out it sounds like rapp grabbed the wrong guy the three men from the justice department all shared uncomfortable looks and then stokes said no one is willing to say it yet but thats our worst fear for christs sake ross swore have you told the president any of this im heading over to the white house for lunch ill break it to him then what about josh stokes shook his head maybe you could break the news to him ross acted like he didnt want to but he did it was an opportunity to prove to his running mate how well connected he was im having lunch with him today ill tell him then in the meantime youd better find rapp we dont want our new administration to start out under the cloud of scandal ross had intentionally used the first person plural possessiveour stokes was a useful man in that he was both politically hungry and well liked for months theyd been dangling the possibility of carrying him over into the next administration theyd even hinted that there might be something bigger on his horizon baltimore maryland the warehouse was old built during the early days of wwii it housed crucial supplies for britain it was all part of the lendlease program that fdr had fought so hard for once the united states entered the war the brick building doubled in size and became a beehive of activity until the nazis surrendered after the war us steel moved in and the marshall plan kept things busy as the us continued to ship supplies to help rebuild western europe business remained good for us steel until the midseventies and then things really slowed down the entire area fell into a long cycle of neglect and disrepair when scott coleman first looked at the place there wasnt a window that wasnt broken the roof leaked and a series of bad tenants had come and gone without bothering to take their junk with them for most people the smell of urine and years of neglect was hard to get past but coleman who had traveled the world with the us navy was used to such things where others saw nothing but neglect coleman saw an opportunity as a friend in the navy used to say they arent building oceanfront property anymore the place was out on sparrows point just south of baltimore on the patapsco river the seal demolition and salvage corporation was colemans brainchild hed seen too many of his fellow special forces operators leave the military and grow miserable living the civilian life coleman himself used to have nightmares that one day hed be forced to take a job as a greeter at walmart during long deployments he began to flush out the idea for his own company going to work for someone else didnt seem very appealing not after taking orders from others for so long he asked himself one simple question what skills had the navy taught him there were many but some of the more unique ones were diving shooting and blowing things up legally speaking the first and last skills were more transferable than one might think ports and shipyards all over the world were in need of expert divers who knew how to get rid of debris seal demolition and salvage corporation started with that express purpose and their very first job illustrated the need for such special talents british petroleum had a problem brewing that needed to be solved before it became an international issue they had quietly contracted to have one of their abandoned oil rigs in the north atlantic demolished somehow word had leaked out and greenpeace was mobilizing a group of protesters to occupy the rig and prevent the demolition they wanted bp to dismantle the rig girder by girder to the executives at bp the decision was simple demolish the rig at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars or dismantle it piece by piece at an estimated cost of five million bp scrambled to get its people together and blow the rig before greenpeace could mobilize bps best estimate was that they could have all of the charges in place and ready to go within fortyeight hours they found out that a boat loaded with greenpeace activists was docked in reykjavik iceland and set to leave port the following morning the activists would arrive at the rig by noon the next day and storm the platform creating an international media event that would bring public and political pressure on bp to dismantle it piece by piece bp needed to slow the protesters down so that the company would have enough time to blow the rig the vice president of operations at bp was told to find a way to stop the activists from reaching the rig and to make sure bp was insulated from any fallout the executive made several calls to his contacts in america and britain and found out that there was a new upstart company in maryland that might be perfect for the job the man called coleman and explained the situation to him he had twenty hours to get to reykjavik and stop the boat from leaving the harbor he didnt care how it was done just so long as no one was hurt coleman had a rough idea of how much it would cost bp if they had to dismantle the rig so he said hed do the job for the bp exec agreed and coleman stroble and hacket were on the next flight out of dulles with their diving gear they landed in reykjavik just before sundown and were down at the pier by that evening thanks to years of training by the united states navy they knew exactly what to do during their tenure as seals they had spent countless hours swimming around dirty harbors attaching explosives to hulls and disabling propellers and rudders the only difficult aspect of this specific mission was the water temperature even with their coldwater gear they could stay in the water for no more than fifteen minutes at a time they took turns swimming over to the ship from a berth about two hundred feet away using an acetylene torch they cut away at the ujoints where the drive shafts met the propellers the boat would be able to maintain steerage and prop speed up to maybe ten knots for a limited period of time anything more than that and the laws of physics would take effect the increased torque on the propellers would cause the sabotaged joints to snap and the boat would be dead in the water they sat at a café the next morning and wagered as to whether or not the ship would make it out of the harbor coleman didnt feel guilty about the job hed been around the ocean his whole life and had a deep respect and healthy fear of it sending a couple thousand tons of steel to the ocean floor wouldnt harm it a bit as they drank coffee and waited for their am flight back to washington a tug moved in and towed the ship out to the main channel the lines were released and the ship was under way a white froth churned up behind the stern of the boat as it headed for the open sea it had just cleared the seawall when the frothy wake subsided and the ship stalled turning sideways in the middle of the channel an hour later coleman stroble and hacket were on their way back to washington that little company that coleman had started before the terrorist attacks of now had annual revenues of over twentyfive million dollars a year and had grown to over fulltime employees with another plus independent contractors under employment those plus employees were all former special forces operators men who used to make to a year who were now making a quarter of a million dollars and up coleman moved the growing company to new digs in a more business friendly area midway between dc and baltimore but hung on to the old warehouse through an off shore company he had an attorney approach the owner and acquire the building the place was simply too private to part ways with and in colemans line of work privacy was paramount two large cargo doors and one service door faced the street there was no signage only a street address painted in white above the service door and the faded remnants of the us steel logo inside the warehouse the old cracked and chipped floor had been acid washed patched and painted along the left side was a mix of storage lockers racks and large metal tables lined up on the right side were two motorcycles and a car all three under gray tarps and a twentyeightfoot boston whaler with two merc hp outboards a black chevy pickup and a big ford excursion were both backed in and parked in the middle at the back of the building were the offices bathroom and workout area a metal staircase led to the second floor there were two offices and a conference room all with large glass windows that looked out onto the floor coleman was in the right corner office sitting behind a large gray metal desk it was military surplus sturdy cheap and functional he was working on clearing his emails he received on average a hundred per day and they came at all hours he had men in iraq afghanistan kazakhstan jordan qatar kuwait and indonesia and those were only the places he could admit to a beeping noise caused him to turn around he ran a hand through his sandy blond hair and looked at the two twentyeightinch flatscreen monitors the one on the left showed a man lying on a bed in a cementwalled room the room was the buildings wwii bomb shelter that they had converted into a cell several years before the man on the cot was the mystery russian whom they had brought with them from cyprus the screen on the right was split into four separate pictures one of the stairs leading down to the bomb shelter the back door to the warehouse the front door and the fourth and final frame rotated between shots of the roof and the sides of the building two cars were lined up in front of the main cargo door waiting to be let in one was a silver audi a and the other was a blue toyota land cruiser coleman knew both vehicles and he was expecting them he turned back to his computer grabbed the mouse with his right hand and clicked on a security icon at the bottom of the screen a menu popped up listing the buildings doors and their status coleman maneuvered the mouses arrow to the main cargo door and clicked on the open tab coleman watched the vehicles roll in and then closed the big door he pushed himself away from his desk and walked out onto the catwalk coleman put both hands on the top railing and watched rapp climb out of the audi and dumond the toyota irene wants you to call her coleman said to rapp rapp looked up at coleman yeah i know everyones looking for me im sure ill be threatened with arrest if i dont turn myself in coleman started down the stairs how much longer are you going to keep this up this afternoon maybe tomorrow morning at the latest and why are you doing this again coleman reached the bottom and turned left into a hallway instead of heading the other way to meet rapp you dont want to know rapp followed coleman and dumond followed rapp youd better not push them so far that they actually end up trying to arrest you i dont need the fbi poking around here looking for you coleman entered a small break room with a table for four a coffee machine a microwave and a refrigerator someone had hung a marine corps recruiting poster on the wall and written some notsoflattering comments on the semper fi slogan coleman poured two cups of black coffee handing one to rapp and keeping the other for himself marcus what can i get you you got any coke in the fridge so what did the boys find in the safety deposit box rapp asked two guns one makarov and a beretta silencers for each and a few extra clips of ammo serial numbers removed what else six hundred thousand dollars in cash coleman said with a grin youre kidding me nope rapp looked at the far wall and thought of the agreement hed made with the banker kapodistras must have shit himself who kapodistras the banker wicker said he was a nervous wreck the whole time but as soon as he saw how much cash was in the box he stopped complaining did you have any idea there would be that much cash no rapp shook his head what else was in there passports credit cardsthe standard stuff he also had one of those new memory sticks that mirrors your hard drive rapp looked to dumond when are they due in dumond asked coleman they left paris this morning and should be landing just before noon what did they do with all the cash rapp asked they gave it all to the banker and instructed him to wire half of it to our account in the bahamas the guns left them in the box with the fake passports and credit cards nice touch there was one other thing of interest in the box two index cards one with a series of apparently random numbers the other with dates and dollar amounts they sent me photos of the cards dumond announced as he held up his pda for rapp to see the first card is a series of codes probably for other accounts he has the second card dumond pressed a button and the tiny screen showed the second photo looks like a list of deposits maybe rapp studied the tiny image for a moment and then said or they might be something else like what jobs jobs dumond wasnt following theyre notches on his belt my guess is each one coincides with a hit he made and how much he was paid dumond looked at the small screen some of them dont have a dollar amount kills he didnt get paid for rapp answered sick fucker coleman added you keep track of your kills he asked rapp no the only guys i ever knew who did were the twisted ones dumonds phone rang and he walked out into the hallway to take it rapp looked at coleman and said gazich lied to me on the plane about how things went down and that surprises you this guy has a black heart i wouldnt trust anything that comes out of his mouth rapp frowned i believed him you know how you get a feel for these things after youve been through enough of them yeah well he had no incentive to lie hes a oneman operation whoever hired him was in the process of trying to kill him when we showed up what did he lie about he told me he received a call right before the attack that told him the target was the second limo yeah coleman said i talked to rivera yesterday and she told me they didnt shuffle the limos what does that matter he was trying to take both of them out wasnt he no rapp shook his head he claims he was only trying to hit the second limo coleman leaned against the formica countertop so he was probably trying to hit both cars which means he lied about the phone call well dont get yourself too worked up skip called me this morning hed also like you to give him a call hell have to take a number he says hes under a lot of pressure gazich volunteered for and passed a lie detector test skip said they had the bureaus best guy running the machine and this fucker beat it rapp smiled this is just too perfect yeah skip says justice is freaking out state is freaking out and even some of the boys at the bureau are starting to waiver he say anything about the media he said the phone is ringing off the hook the press is digging hard good dumond came back in the break room with a big grin on his face whats got you so excited rapp asked i just found out who our guest is dumond pointed at the floor the russian coleman asked yep except hes not russian washington dc no one spoke not in the elevator not in the lobby ross wanted to speak wanted desperately to speak but didnt dare until he was away from the secret service agents and gordon they were halfway between the main door and the waiting limousine when garret reached out and grabbed rosss elbow the two men stopped and then gordon stopped and then all six agents stopped only one agent looked at the protectee the other five adjusted their positions to shield ross as much as possible the men did not look comfortable theyd been trained to move people from one secure area to the next no loitering in between forty feet away was a brandnew armored limousine engineered to handle twice the explosion that had torn apart the older model limousine that fateful day back in october all six secret service agents fought the instinct to literally grab ross by the collar and throw him headfirst into the limo special agent brown approached ross and garret excuse me sir its not good to stop in the open like this could you please get in the limo garret ignored the agent while ross shot him a withering look this was an unscheduled stop no one knows im here relax and back off i want some privacy brown concealed the anger he felt toward ross it had been building up ever since he took over for rivera and it had peaked in switzerland the previous weekend the guy was a powerhungry son of a bitch what did it matter to him if they talked in the back of the limo or here on the street brown backed away stayed calm signaled for his men to spread out and made a mental note to add the incident to the file the hell if he was going to take a fall like riveras gordon was checking email on his blackberry and began drifting back toward his boss and garret garret put out his hand and said why dont you go make a few phone calls gordon stopped and looked up at garret he was yet again the odd man out saturday couldnt come soon enough gordon thought he might even offer to drive garret to the airport himself as soon as gordon was out of earshot garret moved within a half foot of ross and in a hushed voice said this is too good to be true i know now i can go out there and really clean house i dont give a shit about the cia im talking about the fact that they got the wrong guy we dont know that for sure give me one good reason why rapp would refuse to come in he knows he fucked up hes not going to come back here and face scrutiny hes gonna run or who knows he might even try to frame this guy to save his own ass so what do we do pour gas on this thing huh we light the match and fan the flames we get you out in front of this thing are you sure absolutely even if this is the guy and thats looking pretty iffy at the moment speyer told me there is absolutely no way he can be traced back to us youre a statesman now you come out hard on this thing very lawandorder what rapp did was wrong excessive force the us doesnt condone torture and will not tolerate it then you make some statement demanding an inquiry ross shook his head too strong right now i think wed be better off taking a position off the record with tom rich from thetimes yep that way we drive the story and then when the other shoe drops we ask for rapps and kennedys head i like it garret glanced over each shoulder these damn agents make me nervous you go on without me i need to make a few calls ill see you back at the hotel for lunch ross watched garret leave and then started for the limo gordon was standing next to the open rear door replying to an email with both thumbs ross could see that he was unhappy with being excluded and a thought occurred to him it was something hed been thinking about since garret had arrived at the airport on sunday the vice presidentelect climbed into the back seat and waited for gordon to settle in jonathan have you noticed any strange behavior from stu lately the expression on gordons face seemed to say are you kidding me he put his blackberry away and took off his reading glasses ive always found stu to be a bit strange ross smiled i know the man is a real pain in the ass but hes extremely good at what he does hes shortterm youre longterm longterm friend and confidant please dont ever forget that i wont thank you sir youre welcome ross smiled the vehicle started to move he glanced out the window and said so back to stu any odd behavior lately sir to put it bluntly the man is an asshole and i mean twentyfourseven so its hard to judge but i at least expected him to relax this week me too this is our time to celebrate people are lining up to hand him retainers hell i have people calling me to see if i can set up meetings for them the victory was very good for his business and i have no problem with that id think though that the guy would let his hair down a little bit but instead he has been an even bigger jerk than usual this week i agree its almost like hes preoccupied with something else how do you mean i dont know a practiced perplexed expression fell across rosss face i dont know how to put my finger on it but something is bothering him it seems like hes worried about something gordon looked with concern at his boss do you want me to do some checking ross hesitated like he was thinking long and hard about the question and then shook his head no im sure its nothing weve put up with him this long whats five more days baltimore maryland facial recognition software was not a precise science the programs could be tricked peoples appearances often changed over time many people shared the same facial features and in the end the programs were often limited by the quality of the photograph itself beyond that you had to actually have a photograph on file that you could compare to the new image the search for the identity of the mystery man in the converted bomb shelter of colemans warehouse had been complicated by three facts the first was that the man had easily gained over a hundred pounds since his last official photo the second was that he had many of the common features associated with the slavic peoples of eastern europe which dumped him into a large pool of candidates and the third was that he was not russian rapp read the dossier thoroughly as did coleman and dumond an analyst at langley had made the discovery after talking to his contacts at french intelligence and interpol the analyst factored in the weight gain and broadened his search to include intelligence officers in ukraine belarus poland bulgaria latvia lithuania estonia and romania the man it turned out was belarusian he had never worked for the kgb but he had worked for the belarusian kgb or bkgb as it was known among intel types the bkgb was kgbs little brother where many of the former soviet republics had gone on to establish real independence belarus by far maintained the closest relationship with mother russia the man had worked for the state security service for nearly a decade during that time it was suspected that he also worked on the side for a former highranking communist official who was waging a violent war to become the mob boss in minsk his real name was yuri milinkavich french intelligence had started a file on him back in when he was running a counterintelligence team in minsk three french business executives had traveled to the belarusian capital to bid on a contract to build a hydroelectric dam the bids were to be presented in person over a twoday period the french executives were arrested on the way to present their bid and detained under suspicion of espionage for three full days and then let go with no explanation french intelligence suspected but could not prove that the german company that won the contract had paid to have the french team taken out of the picture during his tenure with the belarusian security service four more similar complaints were filed one more by the french two by the italians and one by the japanese interpol eventually started a file on milinkavich and they now suspected that he was now working for the belarusian mafia rapp considered all of this carefully the information fit which was a big hurdle to get past rapp believed without a shadow of doubt that the man in the bomb shelter was in fact yuri milinkavich now the question was why in the hell had he been trying to kill gazich rapp ordered dumond to begin pulling everything they had on the belarusian mafia russia and its former states were far from rapps area of expertise his was europe and more specifically the middle east and southwest asia rapp had followed russia s demise nonetheless with the collapse of the centralized government former regional party officials became crime bosses overnight stepping in to fill the power vacuum the ensuing battles that erupted between vying interests made chicago s infamous mob wars of the s look like a schoolyard fight rapp struggled to put it all into context how brutal was milinkavich to some this might seem ancillary at the moment but for rapp it was a crucial question there was no ticking bomb to be dealt with no lives to be saved by pulling answers out of the large man the need for torture was not pressing for the moment rapp decided he would limit the interrogation to a simple q ampa give milinkavich a chance to tell the truth and explain why he was trying to kill gazich he had already proven himself a liar by claiming to have worked for the kgb but the russians and the other slavic people were funny when it came to the truth absolutes were a rare thing there were more often than not degrees of honesty in milinkavichs mind saying he worked for the kgb might not be a lie he was more likely to see it as a partial admission he had worked for the bkgb but not its betterknown big brother but the bigger distinction was that he claimed he still worked for them gazich had been right back in his office when he laughed at milinkavichs claim that he worked for the kgb gazich had known back then that milinkavich worked for the mob that was after spending only a few minutes with him that meant the two possibly knew each other from a previous job the task as rapp saw it was to give milinkavich a chance to come clean to explain what he really did for a living and then they could move onto the bigger question just what in the hell was the belarusian mafia doing working with arab terrorists and who in particular had paid for this operation rapp descended the stairs to the bunker with a general outline in his head of the questions he would ask and how he would handle things if milinkavich continued to lie at the bottom was a small sixbyfourfoot landing with a rusty floor drain in the middle above the heavy metal door to the right was a small tv on the screen rapp could see milinkavich reclined on the cot he was a big man rapp guessed six foot three and pushing three bills rapp at six foot and a hundred eighty pounds just might provide a tempting target for the big man and part of rapp was hoping for just that as much as rapp did not like torture he also wasnt a patient man there were too many things to do and he wasnt about to waste a week trying to get inside this guys head there was no handle on the door just a bolt rapp extracted a key from his pocket and slid it into the bottom of the large padlock he hung the padlock on a hook next to the door checked the tv one more time and then opened the door milinkavich instantly sat up on his elbows rapp took one step into the room and closed the door behind him leaving it cracked just slightly rapp watched milinkavichs eyes register the fact that the door was not locked other than the bed there was a small portapotty in the corner which smelled of disinfectant a single light fixture was bolted to the ceiling and encased in a protective steel cage there was no blanket or pillow on the bed no sheet just a thin mattress milinkavich would have made a queensize bed look small the twin looked ridiculous under his girth rapp moved over to the side of the door leaned against the wall and folded his arms across his chest hed taken off his suit coat and tie and left his gun in colemans office his dark eyes studied milinkavich for a second theyd stitched up his nose and ear and although they hadnt taken xrays they were pretty sure his jaw was broken rapp pointed to a book on the floor and asked have you found time to read rapp had left a copy of george orwells in the cell in hopes that the prisoner might read some of the torture scenes milinkavich glanced down at the book and shook his head i do not need to read this book i lived it rapp smiled unfortunately you were on the wrong team what do you mean you told me you worked for the kgb there was a doubtful tone in rapps voice if you worked for the kgb you were on the wrong team not every person who worked for the kgb was a bad person a true enough statement rapp supposed we are not so different you and i the big man placed one foot on the floor and sat up rapp noted that he moved with difficulty the combination of stress confinement and his sheer size would have left his muscles stiff they had taken his shoes away as well if he tried to make a move with his socks on he would find it difficult to get traction on the smooth cement floor you know who i am rapp asked with an amused expression americanprobably cia maybe defense intelligence agency definitely special forces training rapp was happy to hear that milinkavich only had a generic guess as to who he was he was tempted to tell him he worked for the israelis it was an old ploy that often put the fear of god into godless communists especially belarusians who had been cruel to the jews maybemaybe not milinkavich looked around the room where are we interrogation confuse and disorient the subject rapp had tried to put himself inside milinkavichs head hed been drugged for most of the transport from cyprus to baltimore there was a chance he sensed that they had landed midway in between but there were no windows for him to look out the most obvious conclusion he would draw was that they were back in america but he would also think there was a chance that they had taken him from cyprus to an eastern bloc country for interrogation possibly even belarus it was no secret that the us government outsourced some of the less gentile aspects of the war on terror to the former soviet satellites we are someplace very private someplace my own government knows nothing about just the two of us i would prefer as im sure you would to solve this problem in a very unofficial way rapp watched as milinkavichs eyes darted to the unlocked door and then quickly away he would be weighing his chances of escape i did not know we had a problem milinkavich said in an upbeat voice our two countries are no longer enemies rapp seized his opening im sorry i forgot which country did you say you are from russia and you used to work for the kgb yes and you are sure about that yes absolutely and you want to be my friend yes absolutely and you seek to win my friendship by lying to me rapp said casually i am not lying to you milinkavich said with great conviction i want you to think long and hard about this because ive got a lot of questions for you you tell me you worked for the kgb which means you know how this works there is an easy way to do this and the hard way if you want to do it the easy way you need to be absolutely honest with me if you want to keep lying to me well do it the hard way which means im going to have to string you up by your ankles and play baseball with your nuts the russian brought his hands together clapped them and said no problem i only speak the truth to you rapp cocked his head to the side and his left eyebrow shot up im going to say it one last time this is not a game and im not amused by your reassurances you have two choices you either tell me the absolute truth or i will make things extremely painful for you absolutely i speak only the truth rapp wondered if maybe he hadnt broken the mans jaw he was speaking without too much difficulty where were you born moscow probably a lie rapp thought but not absolutely provable at the moment where did you grow up moscow most likely a lieand you work for the kgb yes the big man said as he slid his other foot off the bed i have already told you that rapp watched him shift his weight and inch toward the edge of the bed i guess were going to have to do this the hard way rapp turned over his left shoulder and pressed a white button on a gray intercom box bring down the car starter and the alligator clips milinkavich sat up a little straighter what do you mean car starter it looks like were going to have to run some electricity through your brain and see if it helps jog your memory no the man stood waving his hands as he took a step toward rapp sit back down rapp said in a firm but calm voice i speak only the truth he took another step rapp pushed himself away from the wall and got ready the only question left was whether milinkavich would go straight for the door or try to take rapp out first rapp was betting that the man would be misled by his size advantage sit back down right now or youre going to get hurt milinkavich only six feet away made his move he charged straight at rapp his left arm out in front of him reaching to grab hold of something and his right arm cocked and ready to deliver a forceful blow time slowed down for rapp everything so far was expected big men always attacked this way they came in high thinking they could smother their opponent the only problem was they left their legs and midsection open milinkavich had a hell of a tire around his waist rapp had noted this and knew that in these tight quarters it would be difficult to get enough force behind a blow to have much effect that left two knees and two testicles rapp decided on the right knee the big mans right arm came in straight like a battering ram rapp stepped quickly to his left and swept his right arm up and around in a clockwise motion grabbing milinkavichs right elbow using the mans own momentum rapp pulled him closer and turned him away at the same time he brought his right leg up and then sent his foot crashing down on the completely exposed outside of milinkavichs right knee there was hideous crunching noise as ligaments snapped and the knee collapsed inward milinkavich hopped once on his left leg and then fell to the floor screaming in agony rapp stood over him ready to strike another blow his jaw clenched in anger he was pissed that this idiot had forced them to go down this road where were you born rapp yelled minsk i was born in minsk and who do you work for the kgb rapp kicked him in the bad knee and the belarusian howled in pain you mean the bkgb we are one and the same the hell you are rapp kicked him in the knee again im done fucking around with you yuri rapp bent down and looked him in the eye noted the shocked expression on his face thats right you dumb fucker i know your name i know all about you i know youre not russian i know you never worked for the kgb and i know you were one corrupt motherfucker when you worked for the bkgb my friends at the kgb told me you got fat working for the minsk mob rapp mixed facts with suppositions to build his case and chip away at milinkavichs confidence i need a doctor the man wailed in pain you arent going to get shit until you start answering my questions rapp stomped on the bent knee and shouted over milinkavichs cries who do you work for the minsk mob and who do you answer to rapp brought his foot up and held it in the air aleksandr gordievsky before this morning rapp would not have recognized the name but hed just read it in the file langley had sent over aleksandr gordievsky was none other that the former communist party chairman of belarus and the current mob boss of the entire country and why were you on cyprus to kill the man which man deckas the greek why rapp yelled i dont know rapp lifted his foot i swear milinkavich put his hands up i do not know rapps foot came crashing down bullshit milinkavich screamed in agony and tears began spilling from his eyes you want me to kick you again no then tell me why you were sent to kill him all i know the big man gasped for air is he was hired to do something and he fucked up he was hired to kill someone rapp wanted to be clear on this yes who i do not know you want me to kick you again no he screamed no please i have no idea when did your boss start doing business with the arabs a look of real shock fell across milinkavichs face arabs arabsislamic radical fundamentalistterrorists mr gordievsky would never work with such people the look on his face was believable but the words werent bullshit rapp stomped on his knee again milinkavich screamed and then began sobbing i am serious he is eastern orthodox very involved in the church he thinks islam is the invention of satan he would never do business with them all rapps senses told him milinkavich was telling the truth but it didnt add up with what he already knew rapp needed to be careful if he began asking blind questions he could end up weakening his position the better thing to do at the moment was to leave and try to confirm what hed just been told then if he found out the man was lying to him he would come back and the interrogation would begin with renewed vigor im going to call my friends in the kgb and find out if youre telling the truth and youd better hope they corroborate your story or im going to come back in here and things are going to get real ugly in fact when i come back you are going to tell me from start to finish everything you know about deckas and i mean everything when you first heard of him how many jobs hes done for you everything you do that and ill get you set up with painkillers you decide to lie to me some more and ill snap your other knee rapp stepped over milinkavich and closed and locked the heavy door he climbed the steps up to the main floor and then walked past the break room and up to colemans office when he entered coleman was on the phone signaling for rapp to stay quiet irene coleman said i have no idea where he is he listened for a bit and said ill have him call you as soon as i hear from him i have to go now what did she want asked rapp she all pissed off about gazich no i asked her that she said shes not worried she knows hes the guy then whats the problem she says she has something she needs to show you what she wouldnt say all she said was it was very important that she see you as soon as possible she didnt even tell you what it was about rapp asked all she said was that it might cause you to look at something in a different way rapp took a second to guess what that might be what are you going to do coleman asked ill call her back when she was pretty adamant rap looked at his watch it was almost noon this afternoon i need to call an old contact at the kgb and then i want to see just how full of shit this milinkavich is what about dr hornig rapp had already thought about getting her involved she was a shrink the cia used to interrogate highvalue prisoners this guy might be a pathological liar mitch yeah i know pathological liars were the most difficult people to interrogate plus rapp didnt have the stomach to keep kicking the crap out of the guy ill talk to irene about it this afternoon and then ill let you know washington dc mark ross strolled down peacock alley where washingtonians and visitors went to see and be seen the willard hotel had been a washington landmark since before the civil war ross basked in the recognition of the dozens of people who were enjoying afternoon tea it was a walk that had been done by the likes of us grant mark twain and many other famous and infamous figures digital cameras snapped people reached out just to touch him and a few of the really brazen stopped him for a photo the prize for sheer audacity though went to a woman in a blue dress with a ridiculous red hat topped with a white feather plume she stepped in front of ross blocking his path and waving her cell phone her daughter was on the phone and she was a huge fan of the soontobe vice president ross disguised his irritation and played along his secret service detail looked on disapprovingly from fifteen feet away ross had been forced to give them another lecture after having already snapped at them earlier in the day they needed to give him some freedom no one was looking to assassinate a vice presidentelect the partys faithful were taking over the town planeloads trainloads and busloads were arriving by the hour the first official function was tonight and then it was a whirlwind of breakfasts lunches and balls the big affairs were reserved for saturday night eleven separate blacktie balls there wasnt a hotel room in town that wasnt booked it was really going to happen he was going to be vice president of the united states of america ross could hardly believe it he couldnt remember the first time hed dreamt of rising to such political heights but hed been young usually the dream focused on the top job but he did remember a time when he was away at boarding school and he read a book about teddy roosevelt there was a man of destiny tr was one of the greats he remembered a fellow democrat criticizing the old bull moose president for being a bully ross responded by telling him bully or not his face is on mount rushmore history favored the decisive those who werent afraid to grab power and use it ross had decided long ago that he would create his own opportunities and when the time came he would seize the reins of power without hesitation like the great teddy roosevelt he would leave little to chance he would use the press to shape his image and dispose of his enemies and just maybe hed get lucky like tr and get promoted early josh alexander was young and healthy but stranger things had happened the possibility brought a smile to rosss face he shook a few more hands and stopped briefly at the entrance to the round robin bar waving to the faithful who were well into happy hour the crowd around the circular bar began whooping and hollering ross thought it would be fun to join them for a drink but he needed to get upstairs for a meeting he smiled and pumped his fist to the crowd and then retreated four agents joined him in the elevator hed cut gordon loose to grab some downtime it wasnt that he didnt trust him it was simply that he didnt want the right hand to know what the left hand was doing an agent was posted outside the door to the oval suite the party had secured the room for him to do interviews hold meetings and stay there if he wanted although ross owned a squarefoot condo that overlooked the potomac alexander was in the opulent abraham lincoln suite and his fatherinlaw was in the spacious capitol suite without being consulted ross had been forced to settle for the hotels third nicest suite he was mildly irritated by the oversight but there were more pressing issues at the moment ross entered the suite and found stu garret sitting in the oval shaped living room with tom rich of thenew york times just like the real oval office two couches faced each other with a small table in between rich was of average height and slender with the exception of a small pouch around his midsection he had a youthful head of brown hair that he liked to show off by avoiding regular visits to the barber he looked close to forty but in truth he was actually fiftyone national security was his beat and he had a reputation for being very critical of the cia and the way they waged the war on terror rich stood garret didnt ross extended his hand tom thank you for coming to see me my pleasure sir please call me mark when were in an informal setting like this rich nodded but kept his game face on he was wearing a blue buttondown oxford a gray and black tweed sport coat a pair of jeans and brown timberland boots he looked at ross in his expensive blue suit and tie i apologize for my appearance i was at home working on a story when stu called he told me to get down here right away he said he had something that couldnt be discussed on the phone ross nodded yes im afraid hes right before we get started may i get you something to drink no thank you well have a seat ross unbuttoned his suit coat and sat on the couch across from garret and rich i assume youve been following the story about the arrest that was made in connection to the motorcade attack rich nodded enthusiastically while reaching in to his sport coat and retrieving a notebook and pen ive got a piece running in the morning whats your angle angle rich looked either surprised or offended whats your story about garret asked in his typical nononsense way rich hesitated and then said im hearing rumors grumblingsreally about ross asked that the case against this guy isnt as strong as the fbi claims ross and garret shared a knowing look and then ross said off the record of course rich wrote the wordoff across the top of the page what have you heard so far basically that this guy was dumped in the fbis lap with some very weak evidence ross nodded continue there are some major problems with the case the fbi and justice are fighting and neither of them is happy with the cia the greek government is going to file an official complaint with the un in the morning and supposedly no one knows where to find mitch rapp who my sources tell me ran the team that grabbed this guy youve got the broad brushstrokes down but theres a lot more rapp not only ran the team he was the one who identified grabbed and tortured the suspect did you say torture rich looked up with wary eyes what would you call shooting a man once in each knee and then in both hands he kneecapped him and shot him in both hands rich kept his eyes on ross while his right hand flew across the page let me guesshe tortured a confession out of the guy no one knows what does rapp say no one knows because rapp has been awol for three days now awol absent without leave rapp had his team bring this guy back from cyprus and he has yet to report in we literally have nothing on this guy other than rapps word the greek government is furious the state department is outraged the justice department says they have no case against this guy and then heres the kicker the guy volunteered to be polygraphed and he passed with flying colors so this might really be the wrong guy thats a distinct possibility and even if he is the guy rapp screwed things up so bad by torturing him that i dont think theres any chance of convicting him rich wrote frantically this was going to be a huge scoop the type of story that could win him his second pulitzer after a moment he gained control of his escalating euphoria and remembered that he was a journalist he looked up at ross and asked why are you telling me this ross was prepared for this question when i was director of national intelligence i warned president hayes that mitch rapp was a malcontent i told him sir sooner or later hes going to do something that will permanently damage america s international standing ross sat back and crossed his legs and now here we are president hayes is on his way out and were on our way in well im not going to allow this administration to pay for his poor leadership i assume you mean president hayes yes and tom i cant stress it enough this is off the record way off the record i know rich said as he scribbled frantically so this is hayess fault im not willing to go that far on or off the record youll have to draw your own conclusions so who do you blame besides rapp his boss for starters irene kennedy yes are you going to ask for an investigation im going to leave that up to the attorney general and my former colleagues on the hill is it safe to say that your administration will be looking for a new person to run the cia ross liked the ring of your administration he could get used to that he looked at rich with a very serious expression and said director kennedy and mitch rapp should make sure their résumés are up to date rich smiled as he wrote down the exact quote when he was done he pulled out his mobile phone and checked the time it was in the afternoon looking at ross he said excuse me for a second i need to call my editor and tell her to hold a spot on the front page ross nodded and kept his delight in check the article would cause a feeding frenzy he only wished that he could be there to see the expression on kennedys face when she read it langley virginia rapp was cruising down georgetown pike in a rented white van at five miles an hour over the posted speed it was almost in the evening which meant he was late for his meeting with kennedy he wasnt crazy about getting together in her office but shed insisted what she had to show him could not leave the building that bit of information got rapps imagination working overtime it also helped him make up his mind that he would transfer milinkavich to dr hornig after a long afternoon of milinkavich changing his story over and over and sobbing like a child rapp decided that he didnt have it in him to interrogate the man properly coleman couldnt stand being in the presence of hornig so rapp rented another van and drove the belarusian himself the drive from baltimore to an offbudget cia facility in northern virginia took longer than expected and then hornig wanted to talk she wanted to know every intricate detail of the subject rapp told her what he had discovered and handed over audiotapes of the interrogations hed already conducted and left as quickly as he could he turned off the pike and approached the main gate of the cia normally a rental car would cause problems but the security officers recognized rapp and after a speedy check of the cargo area he was waved through rapp parked in the visitors lot near the main door and hustled up the steps and into the lobby straight ahead to the right were the security desk metal detectors and turnstiles rapp hung his badge around his neck and stayed to his left walking past the undersized statue of wild bill donovan who was more or less the patron saint of the cia just past the statue rapp turned left into a small vestibule and then to his right up a couple steps to a small landing directly in front of him was the directors private elevator rapp grabbed his badge and held it in front of the scanner a moment later the door opened and he was on his way to the seventh floor the outer office was empty of all support staff even kennedys bodyguards were nowhere to be seen rapp knocked on the heavy office door twice and then entered kennedy was behind her desk with the phone to her left ear and twirling her reading glasses in her right hand kennedy gave rapp a slight smile and said to the person on the other end of the line i have no idea what youre talking about hes standing right in front of me rapp mouthed the words who is it kennedy let her chair spring forward hold for a moment please she hit the hold button on the black phone and looked up at rapp its tom rich from thetimes little fucking traitor what does he want thetimes is running a story on us tomorrow hed like to give us a chance to comment rapp checked his watch it was in the evening theyd be putting their east coast edition to bed pretty quickly whats the story about basically that you grabbed the wrong guy on cyprus justice the fbi state the greek government theyre all mad at us and you and i are out of a job next week and may be facing formal charges what did you tell him no comment good he also said he heard you were awol possibly had fled the country to avoid prosecution hes making shit up rapp pointed at the phone put him on speaker kennedy hit the blinking button and said tom i have mitch rapp here in my office anything youd like to ask him so youve come in from the cold the reporters voice sounded amused rapp had met rich once before at a social function rapps deceased wife had introduced them she was nbcs white house correspondent and the two ran in the same circles from time to time what a surprise i would have never guessed a big lefty like you to be a le carré fan hes my favorite the spy who came in from the cold it doesnt get any better than that and besides you know im independent like all good reporters i know how to keep politics out of the story yeah right rapp noted the levity in richs voice like all egocentric reporters he was probably already working on his pulitzer prize acceptance speech listen im kind of short on time but i was wondering if you would like to comment on a story that im working on for tomorrows paper i see youve given yourself a lot of time to get the other side of the story deadlines are a bitch what can i tell you so would you like to comment on the fact that you tortured a bogus confession from a greek national named alexander deckas are you recording this conversation tom of course he said in a patronizing tone thanks for the headsup come on mitch you know how the game is played sure do tom rapp smiled at kennedy and then asked just wonderingyoure jewish right rich didnt answer right away and then when he did the levity was gone i dont see what that has to do with anything well i know how you reporters pride yourselves on being neutral but i was wondering how proud youre going to be of that pulitzer of yours after some crazy islamic fascist nukes israel off the face of the map rapp paused to look at kennedy who was giving him a wary look rapp smiled and hovered over the speakerphone at least youll be comforted by the fact that you stayed neutral on the issue when rich spoke again he was all business i take it youre not going to comment on the accusation that you apprehended the wrong man and tortured him id love to comment on the accusation right after you tell me who your source is sources rich stressed the plural i have more than one and you know i cant reveal them i dont suppose youd consider delaying the story for a day or two let me think about that for a second rich paused one second and said i dont think so well fuck you very much and thank you for wasting my time rapp reached down and disconnected the call before plopping down in the winged back chair in front of kennedys desk i dont think that was very professional kennedy looked disapprovingly at rapp that guy thinks hes going to string me up by my balls tomorrow rapp shook his head he has no idea how big a mistake hes about to make kennedy studied rapp with suspicion would you mind telling me what youve been up to rapp pulled a memory stick from his jacket and handed it across the desk this is going to be fun kennedy held the stick in front of her and asked whats this for your press conference what press conference the one youre going to hold at the white house tomorrow in response to the grossly inaccurate front page story that thetimes is going to run in the morning i took the liberty of putting everything into a power point presentation for you kennedy smiled whats on here the video from the starbucks on the morning of the attack agent riveras official statement of what she saw seconds before the explosion customs and immigration surveillance footage of deckas at jfk the day before the attack he entered the country using a fake passport of course what else his complete confession which the media will say was coerced not after they hear it it was very convincing he admits to flying into jfk the day before the attack spending friday night in pennsylvania where he picked up the van and then driving down to dc saturday morning he even admits to standing behind the same tree that rivera saw him behind all of it without provocation kennedy shook her head theyll say you rehearsed the story with him let them say what they want because theres more the guy isnt even greek excuse me hes bosnian his real name is gavrilo gazich and heres the best part rapp grinned and added hes wanted by the war crimes tribunal in the hague for atrocities committed against civilians during the civil war youre sure one hundred percent now it was kennedys turn to smile anything else a list of people he is suspected of killing most of them in africa over the past five years or so one un official a couple of relief workers and a bunch of politicians warlords and generals all of its ironclad as solid as it gets the fbi is going to have a field day the un might even thank us the director of the cia turned the gray stick over in her fingers and thought of the photos that cap baker had given her any idea who hired him to take out the candidates no but i know who tried to kill him after he screwed up excuse me rapp folded his hands across his lap and explained to her what had happened on cyprus how he had spotted the other team keeping an eye on gazichs office how rapp watched gazich casually stroll down the street shoot the one lookout in the car and then lure the other two up to his office where he killed one and began torturing the other having watched gazich operate rapp explained that hed decided the man was too dangerous to do anything other than cripple him telling a man like that to drop his gun and lie down on the ground would have ended with one or both of them dead who were these people trying to kill him kennedy asked at first i thought they were russians one of them maintained that he was kgb kennedy gave him a youvegottobekiddingme look and said youre not serious as it turns out they were belarusian and at least one of them was former bkgb i brought the leader of the group back kennedy was surprised yet again on sunday yes and why am i hearing about it now for the first time i needed to check some things out where is this man i handed him over to dr hornig this evening you were having a hard time getting him to talk no he talked all right we just couldnt separate the truth from all of his bullshit so what does the belarusian mafia have to do with all of this thats a good question the guy we have in custody his name is milinkavich he claims he was sent to cyprus to kill gazich for screwing up some contract hed been hired for i asked him if they did a lot of work with the saudis and i got an interesting reaction out of him what was that he says his boss aleksandr gordievsky who runs the belarusian mafia hates muslims says the man is eastern orthodox and i quote thinks islam is the creation of satan he claims they would never work for the saudis kennedys thoughts returned to the photos anything else theres some stuff thats not adding up such as gazich not that you can trust the guy claims that he did exactly as he was told that he didnt screw anything up it was the people on the other end of the operation who gave him bad intel how so gazich says a half a minute or so before the explosion he received a phone call that told him the target was the second limo so i figure that the secret service must have shuffled the limos after they left the conference someone is standing on the street they watch the candidates get in the second limo and they make the call to gazich then the motorcade starts to roll and a block later the secret service has the second limo move up to the lead position they do that stuff all the time you can easily see where the terrorists screwed up it sounds like it all adds up though rapp shook his head i talked to rivera she says they didnt shuffle the limos they didnt shuffle the limos kennedy repeated her surprise obvious nope which leads me to believe that gazich is lying the sick feeling in kennedys stomach grew after a moment she said or hes telling the truth why would you say that kennedy looked across the room out the window and into the darkness and sighed i think its time i showed you something kennedy opened her safe retrieved the oversized envelope and walked over to the sitting area across from her desk rapp followed and came to a stop at her left as she laid out the photos in a slow deliberate manner at first rapp had no idea what he was looking at other than the fact that they were surveillance photographs of two people who if he had to guess probably werent married there was something vaguely familiar about the woman rapp ignored her naked body and focused on the face she was rather animated in the first six shots but in the seventh the camera had caught her with her mouth closed her face relaxed and her eyes looking off in the distance she had a detached vacant look on her face that was definitely familiar rapp finished looking at all the photos and then went back to the seventh one he almost picked it up for closer examination but his professional instincts stopped him no sense leaving his fingerprints on something that obviously had kennedy spooked again rapp focused on the face and ignored the beautiful body the high cheekbones the thin nose the long wavy chestnut hair tangled and partially obscuring the right side of her face there was something definitely familiar about the woman rapp blocked out every feature except the eyes nose and mouth suddenly everything clicked he pictured the woman with her hair up in a kind of loose ponytail dressed stylishly yet conservative playing the role of a candidates wife it was jillian rautbort the presidentelects wife rapps focus intensified as he remembered the sorrow hed felt for the political couple after the attack jillian rautbort wasnt much older than anna had been when an explosion had taken her life rapp felt alexanders pain hed seen some of the footage of the funeral and the public statements alexander had made in the immediate aftermath hed watched the man on election night when his opponent had conceded the race even in victory the man seemed irreparably wounded it appeared that the greatest achievement of his career was tempered by a loss that could never be repaired these photos now forced rapp to call those painful memories into question was it an act rapp had a hard time believing it his job depended on being able to judge people in a split second picking friend from foe in a foreign land where the wrong decision could mean his life alexanders pain seemed so genuine if hed been faking it the man was an absolute monster rapps eye settled on the man in the photos for the first time the collage started with the two standing and then with jillian riding the man on a lounge chair next to the pool the guy was big jillian rautbort looked tiny on top of him where jillian was completely naked the man still had on most of his clothes his pants were pulled down to midthigh there was something oddly familiar about him as well rapp noticed something coiling from the mans left ear his eyes opened a bit wider and he began searching the other photos for the same coil he found it in two other photos jesus christ rapp said softly he looked at the photos where the man was on his back specifically the right side of his belt line he expected to find either a radio or a gun the photo wasnt clear enough but something was there without taking his eyes off the photo rapp said please tell me this guy is not a united states secret service agent unfortunately he is you have got to be fucking kidding me i wish i was who is it special agent matt cash rapp looked at the photos again from left to right when were these taken labor day weekend at her parents palm beach estate how did they come into your possession cap baker he bought them from an unknown individual for what was probably a large sum of money can you believe him i think so he claims he had no intention of using them his candidates were ahead in the polls then why did he buy them rapp asked a bit skeptically he says the campaign was flush with cash and he thought the best move would be to take them out of circulation he thought there was a slight chance they could be released and might cause sympathy for alexander rapp laughed yeah right when did he buy them midseptember i think a lot couldve happened between then and the first tuesday in november his candidate could have fucked up in one of the debates and overnight his lead would have vanished these photos were his insurance policy i agree so why did he decide to give them to you kennedy sighed this is where things get interesting apparently theres some bad blood between baker and stu garret alexanders campaign manager yes they despise each other in early october baker decided to give garret something to really sweat over so he took three of the photos wrote youll never win on the back and had them delivered to garrets hotel room in dallas did garret know they came from baker kennedy shrugged if he did it was a guess rapp put his hands on hips looked down at the photos and then shook his head did special agent cash happen to be in the second limo on the day of the attack yes wonderful kennedy walked back to her desk and grabbed a twoinch file in a red folder she returned to rapps side and said i want you to take a fresh look at the case from top to bottom she handed the file to rapp this is the secret services preliminary report read through it and talk to special agent rivera i want to know if she knew one of her people was screwing the bosss wife rapp nodded so youre thinking gazich might be telling the truth that the second limo was the targeti think that a lot of people rushed into this thing assuming certain facts read the report especially the investigators notes the entire investigation was conducted through the prism that the attack was perpetrated by terrorists give it a fresh look and well talk about it in the morning rapp lifted the file up and looked at it for a second anything else yes kennedy hesitated briefly and then said have marcus do a thorough check on stu garret stu garret rapp said with obvious surprise that little pud you think hes capable of pulling something like this off there are some things you dont know about mr garret and im not going to get into them right now but trust me when i say the man is capable of almost anything okay ill have marcus start right away have him focus on the month before the attack you got it anything else no just be careful and move fast we dont have much time washington dc wednesday morning arrived with a bit of a hangover for mark ross he had actually tried to leave the hotel at one point but the festive atmosphere continued to build until well after midnight after the meeting with tom rich from thetimes ross had gone up to see alexander who was in a black mood thered been times over the past month when ross had wanted to grab alexander by the shoulders shake him violently and tell him the harsh truth about his deceased wife the woman was a slut she deserved to be the first lady of the united states about as much as a street hooker from new orleans did what ross wanted to do and what was prudent though were miles apart besides alexander had proved very malleable in his grief hed basically let ross run the transition team which enabled him to stack the administration with people who were loyal to him there were a lot of people from georgia to be sure but ross made sure they got jobs at transportation hud education veterans affairs and the like defense state and justice the crown jewels of any administration were loaded with his people after meeting with alexander in the abraham lincoln suite ross headed down to the round robin bar for a muchneeded drink that was shortly before six four hours later he found himself more than a little cockeyed drinking a glass of cognac and smoking a big fat dominican cigar with two big hollywood producers party bighitters from across the country kept showing up and with alexander sulking in his suite it fell on rosss shoulders to thank them for their hard work and support at midnight he finally tore himself away from the party one of his aides convinced him to stay at the hotel and offered to fetch him a change of clothes before morning less than stable on his feet ross took the young man up on his offer he awoke a few minutes before am and ordered room service before jumping into the shower the food arrived while he was shaving and he asked the young man to set it up in front of the tv he finished shaving and then sat down in his hotel robe and dug into his eggs toast and bacon he used the bacon and toast to poke at the rich yellow yolks he chased it with some grapefruit juice and then started in with the coffee within minutes he was feeling better then there was a knock on the door ross cocked his head in the direction of the sound and considered ignoring it it was rare these days that he got to spend time alone there was more knocking this time it was much louder the door shook ross threw his napkin on the table and walked across the suite he yanked open the door to find stu garret standing there with a huge grin on his face garret pushed his way past ross and said i heard you tied one on last night ross closed the door and followed him saying i was merely trying to be a good host garret went straight for the room service cart and snatched a piece of bacon from rosss plate dont touch my food stu ross was dead serious relax said garret as he grabbed a newspaper from under his arm and presented it to ross isnt this beautiful in large black type across the top of the paper was the headline cia tortures wrong man ross snatched the paper from garrets clutches and began reading in earnest the grin on his face was even bigger than the one garret had when hed answered the door this reallyis beautiful he mentions both kennedy and rapp in the first paragraph he kept reading and a few moments later added im not going to have to lift a finger the press is going to tear them apart for me like hyenas descending on a wounded rhino its already started garret picked up the remote for the tv and turned on cnn it was picked up by all the wire services and amplified on the cable news stations am radio the internet you name it the blogosphere is going nuts they might not make it to saturday ross laughed and shook his fist in the air stu this has to be one of your better calls garret nodded in agreement pretty well played if i do say so myself a former cia employee was on screen laying into director kennedy for not keeping mitch rapp on a tighter leash he claimed that he had been warning people for years that the man was out of control do you think theres a chance he could go to jail ross asked who knows its typically against the law to kidnap people and shoot them garret found his comment amusing and started laughing we should probably think about coming out with a statement not yet too early let everyone else do your dirty work maybe tomorrow or friday you could release something for now id just sit back and enjoy the implosion of kennedys career the advice sounded good to ross he wondered how kennedy was taking the news morale out at langley would not be good this morning the thought of all the long faces gave ross a delicious idea he clapped his hands together loudly and then rubbing them together started for the bedroom where are you going garret asked to get dressed ive got a busy morning and i need to squeeze in an unscheduled stop langley virginia kennedy was late for the senior staff meeting which was very unlike her even more unusual was the fact that shed slept in she needed to catch up after a long restless night she had gone to bed watching letterman and worrying about the possibility that this thing could go all the way to josh alexander she fell asleep before the first guest woke up some time around in the morning and then tossed and turned for two plus hours trying to figure out just how damaging the entire thing could be if the second limousine was the target and it was done to both eliminate a problem for the candidates and drum up sympathy an election had not simply been stolen it had been manipulated which added another layer of concern to an already horrible problem innocent lives had been taken but kennedy was being paid to worry about an even bigger picture chiefly the safeguarding of the country and its institutions from foreign attack and subversion what worried her the most was the possibility that the belarusian mafia may have had a hand in the affair russia and belarus were very close the communication between their intelligence agencies was good it didnt always flow both ways but in the end mother russia got what it wanted the separation between their intelligence services and organized crime was at times nonexistent if the belarusian mafia helped plan the attack on the motorcade it was an almost certainty that the kgb knew about it with that type of information in their possession the kgb would be in a perfect position to subvert the next administration shed fallen back asleep sometime around five and was woken up by her son at he was late for school and she was late for work normally this would have created a panic but when kennedy took a look at the front page of thenew york times she decided shed take her time langley would be rife with recrimination this morning longtime coworkers some of them friends would be weighing their options many of them would come to the conclusion that it was time to distance themselves from kennedy her tardiness would only add to the rumors and unease but that couldnt be helped after dropping tommy off at school she unfolded her copy of thetimes and read the article while her driver brought her straight to langley she read it twice and both times she smiled rapp had been right about two things the first was that rich definitely thought he was going to win a pulitzer for the story and the second was that this was going to be fun when she stepped off the elevator just outside her office her administrative assistants were both on the phone pink call messages as thick as a deck of playing cards were waiting for her sheila with the overdone makeup and the red hair gave her a look that saidhelp kennedy smiled said good morning and walked into her office three men were waiting for her at the far end of the room they were seated at the conference table kennedy set her briefcase behind her desk closed the office door and then hung her black cashmere overcoat in her closet she tugged on the sleeves of her white blouse and unbuttoned the jacket of her blue pinstriped pantsuit shed picked the outfit with the press conference in mind sitting at the table were deputy director of intelligence charles workman deputy director of operations jose juarez and deputy director roger billings all three men sat in silence with their hands resting on the polished wood surface of the long table they were obviously waiting for her to speak first kennedy walked to the far end where a singed american flag was framed it had been pulled from the rubble of the word trade center kennedy pulled a chair out and said sorry for being late this morning she was about to sit when she noticed a copy of thetimes underneath her briefing folder kennedy slid her leather bound briefing book to the side and said may i get any of you something to drink before we get started all three men declined by shaking their heads kennedy eased into her chair and set her reading glasses atop the leather briefing folder so what do you have for me this morning juarez was sitting on her left the dark circles under his eyes were more pronounced this morning she was sure tom rich had probably called him for a comment last night and she was also certain he had said nothing as for the two men on her right kennedy couldnt be sure they were good men but they did not have the screwyou attitude of a clandestine service officer juarez had survived some very nasty stuff in the field he would not be spooked by an investigation and the possibility of a new director workman and billings though were desk jockeys theyd spent the vast majority of their careers right here in washington they were ensconced in their nice suburban homes workman with three kids and billings with four the older ones were in college which added financial pressure and the younger ones were thinking about college which added even more they were both nearing fifty and they were both in a position to succeed kennedy if she got the boot which from their vantage point this morning looked like a certainty juarez on the other hand knew he would never get the top job he was more spit than polish and had the irritating habit of speaking truth to power to become the director of the cia you needed to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate thered been many presidents in tune to the fact that they needed people like juarez around to balance out all the ass kissers who were so enamored of the office the senate was a different story though especially the older senators whod been around for three terms or more they had a sense of entitlement and often perceived disagreement as a sign of disrespect juarez did not get along with these men and he made no effort to disguise his dislike of them workman and billings on the other hand worked very hard to curry favor from this crucial block of senators billings was kennedys number two hed grown up in vermont and attended dartmouth he was as steady as they came and he did not like change a worrier it showed in his wispy brown hair that he parted to the side from left to right billings gave kennedy an uneasy look and asked have you read thetimes this morning kennedy looked at the newspaper in front of her her name in large letters underneath the banner it meant nothing to her shed gotten over seeing her name in print years ago she hadnt put a lot of thought into how she would handle this she had a meeting with the president and until then she wanted to keep the information on gazich as quiet as possible i have read the article and billings asked she studied the two men on her right and saw two worried civil servants who had devoted their entire adult lives to what they thought was an honorable and worthy cause they did not want to see their agency embroiled in another scandal its interesting interesting billings repeated he did not attempt to hide his disbelief youre about to be burned at the stake andinteresting is all you have to say the right corner of kennedys mouth turned upwards showing the slightest hint of a smile i dont think anyone is going to be burned at the stake over this four senators have already called me this morning billings said and ive talked to two added workman kennedy looked to juarez i stopped counting and what have you told them kennedy asked all three none of them decided to answer kennedy turned her gaze on workman who was usually the most vocal chuck what did you tell them he fidgeted in his chair and said i told them the truth the truth ive found can be very subjective around here not on this one irene then lets hear it tell me what i need to know i know you and mitch are close but ive been warning you for i dont know how long that sooner or later hes going to get us all into a lot of hot water juarez leaned back in his chair and scowled at his counterpart from the intel side of the business im sure youll find some way to save your own ass chuck dont defend him jose do you know how many times ive sat here and heard you complain about him theres a big difference between keeping our disagreements within the family and shooting your mouth off to some reporter what in the hell is that supposed to mean you run the intel side chuck you dont need some knuckle dragger like me to explain things to you are you implying that i spoke with this reporter from thetimes jose grabbed his copy of thetimes and read according to an anonymous senior cia official mitch rapps methods and lack of control have been a growing concern for some time juarez slammed the paper on the table and said it sounds like you wrote it yourself workmans pale complexion turned bright red and he snapped how dare you accuse me of having anything to do with this kennedy watched with a critical eye as juarez and workman bandied back and forth she had also wondered who the senior cia official might be she was about to intercede and end the argument when her office door opened unexpectedly juarez and workman continued shouting across the table completely oblivious that an interloper had just entered the agencys inner sanctum kennedys face revealed nothing but inside she was fuming that this man had yet again barged in on her office without so much as a phone call or a knock vice presidentelect ross strode across the room and stopped at the far end of the conference table he was in a charcoal gray wool suit with a white shirt and a silverandblue tie in his manicured right hand he held a copy of thetimes he threw it down on the conference table unbuttoned his suit coat and placed a hand on each hip i have great appreciation for how difficult this business is but this cant continue im trying to save your jobs right now ross pointed to each of the four ive explained to josh that we have a good team at langley i dont agree with everything you do but ive told him you are competent people now this morning i wake up to this and ive got the next president of the united states asking me if ive lost my mind ross paused he looked at kennedy there she sat at the head of the table with her damn unreadable expression i explained to him that this is a business where batting a thousand is not possible even if these accusations are true they need to be tempered against rapps past successes his response was that if even half of what was printed in the article is true he wants me to come out here and clean house ross waved his hand above them as if in one fell swoop they could all be dispatched he leaned over and stabbed his index finger on top of the newspaper you know what really boils my blood about this article this quote in here from a senior cia official you people think this is hollywood where you settle your disputes by calling up a reporter and stabbing one of your colleagues in the back no one answered in fact kennedy was the only one who looked at him rosss fiery eyes settled on her im under direct orders from presidentelect alexander to get to the bottom of this and put it behind us as quickly as possible please tell me this reporter has got it all wrong that there is a simple explanation for why mitch rapp shot this man four times kennedys antennae were up there was spying there was subterfuge and then there was espionage real oldfashioned espionage where it wasnt enough to simply steal the enemies secrets one had to launch double triple and quadruple feints and get them to turn on themselves misdirection layered upon misdirection until the enemy couldnt trust their best friend during the cold war the russians had been masterful at sowing distrust among cia officers they even went so far as to send real intelligence assets over as defectors these men and women were so good they were impossible to tell from the real defectors the damage they did was incalculable kennedy couldnt help getting the feeling that ross was up to something the man did not like her he did not care for the greater good of the agency he cared for himself first and last kennedy had guessed some time ago that he was a borderline obsessive compulsive with narcissistic tendencies in everyday parlance that meant he was a backstabbing control freak just simply winning for these types wasnt enough it was boring they needed the thrill the drama of the fight winning through subterfuge was nirvana it helped validate the narcissistic ego it proved that they were smarter than everyone else kennedy could have easily taken the memory stick from her safe and showed ross the mountain of evidence that they had against the man rapp had arrested but she decided to keep it from him there was still too much to learn and her instincts told her ross could not be trusted sir kennedy said the entire matter is under investigation and i think it would be a disservice to comment on it before all the facts are in that sounds like damn lawyer speak ross snarled kennedy remained calm if you had called sir and informed me that you were coming i might have been able to put together a preliminary report but im not sure what you expect out of me on such short notice rosss nostrils flared in anger he hesitated for a split second before answering and then said i expect you to do your job and i expect you to follow the law get this mess sorted out and do it fast or youre all going to be looking for new jobs and that comes straight from alexander himself ross turned and marched out of the office kennedy had studied his every move the man could have been a stage actor the way he turned his emotions on and off at a moments notice shed made the calculated decision to push his button and find out if he would drop the savior act and he had he had displayed genuine anger that she had dared to defy him kennedy pushed her chair away from the table and stood thats all for this morning were done a surprised billings asked yes well reconvene right here at one all three men grabbed their stuff and got up to leave kennedy looked at juarez bringing up the rear and said jose im leaving for the white house in twenty minutes i want you to come with me do i need to bring anything no kennedy followed the men across the room and closed the door behind them once behind her desk she picked up her secure phone and punched in a local number rapp answered on the second ring are you going to meet rivera yes expand your search to ross see if she can get you the secret service logs from his detail and ask marcus if he thinks he can do a workup on him without raising too much suspicion ill take care of it when is your press conference im leaving to see the president shortly ill call you and let you know how it goes kennedy put the handset back in the cradle and considered the enemy she was about to make she had never trusted ross completely even during his brief tenure as director of national intelligence but she had never let on once she held the press conference with president hayes ross would know she had withheld information from him and any pretext of a cordial working relationship would be gone kennedy looked out the large picture window at the brightening day she felt a sense of relief that she had chosen her course washington dc special agent rivera sat at her desk and flipped through the yellow pages she foundkarate and underneath it saidsee martial arts she flipped through the pages to the ms and found it there were six full pages of listings in the dc area she shook her head and began searching for one between the office and her apartment when shed arrived at the dojo this morning she found the contents of her locker waiting for her in a brown grocery bag by the front door her sensei was in the middle of teaching a class and he didnt bother to come out and talk to her or for that matter make eye contact she was being thrown out after only five weeks and she didnt need to ask why rivera stopped reading the listings and closed her eyes what in the hell am i doing she asked herself she felt as if her whole life was falling apart around her for three straight months shed been in denial she knew her career was over but she was hanging on in hopes that they would give her a second chance one of her bosses had actually told her yesterday that he was recommending grief counseling the bastard she thought shed asked him if he thought she needed the counseling to deal with the loss of her fellow agents who had died in the attack or for her career which was now dead he looked at her stonefaced and told her no one blamed her for what had gone wrong he was probably right about that but it didnt change the fact that no one wanted her around she was a living breathing reminder of one of the services worst days since dallas in another colleague told her to get out of washington take an assignment in miami or la work counterfeit and fraud it was challenging and gratifying work and if she didnt want to do that she could at least apply for the joint counterterrorism center do anything just so long as it didnt involve working personal protection rivera closed the yellow pages and dropped the book on the floor why was she bothering looking for a new dojo her days in dc were numbered everyone knew it she just needed to come to grips with it life was cruel she decided shed been so close to the top the one job that every agent covets the sac of a presidential detail she was on track and it would have been hers tears welled and she fought them back the hell if she was going to break down in front of them that was what they were waiting for theyd ship her off for another round of evaluation and she wasnt going to do that she had more than a month of vacation and personal time banked it was time to take it head out west again and hit the slopes maybe shed stop by and see her family theyd been worried about her when shed gone home for christmas but after two days she couldnt take the nagging and left early to go meet some friends in tahoe shed hit the bumps hard for three straight days until her back hurt so bad she couldnt take it anymore rivera grabbed a tissue and wiped the corners of her eyes she threw it in the garbage and decided shed put in for vacation she was about to send her boss an email when her phone rang she didnt recognize the number on the screen but answered it nonetheless special agent rivera speaking meet me on the street who is this your sparring partner get your ass downstairs we need to talk ohits you nice article in thetimes sounds like you really made a mess of it rapp laughed you should know better than most not to believe what you read in the paper rivera looked over the top of her cube and said based on my current situation im not sure its a good idea for me to be seen with you listenim a busy guy i have something you are going to want to see trust me im parked at the curb silver audi a the line went dead rivera held the handset for a second and then slowly put it back in the cradle she looked around her empty desk for a moment and considered her empty career and quickly came to the conclusion that she had nothing to lose she grabbed her purse and started for the elevator two and a half minutes later she was climbing into the front passenger seat of rapps car this better be good she put her sunglasses on and looked over at rapp rapp grabbed the gear shift and pulled it back into drive put on your seatbelt he hit the gas and darted out into traffic where are we going rivera fumbled with her seatbelt nowhere she gestured with her right hand at the passing scenery were obviously going somewhere nowhere in particular i didnt want to sit in front of your building fine what did you want to show me i have a few questions for you first rapp hit his blinker and turned onto th street and headed south toward the national mall i dont like games im not in the mood today just show me what you have rapp lowered his sunglasses a bit and looked over the top at his passenger you dont like games what in the hell would you call what you did to me in your dojo the other morning she ignored the question and said i dont know if youve noticed or if you care but my career is basically over thirteen years right down the toilet rapp stopped for a red light and said i havent noticed and no i dont care i want answers and i need them fast she shook her head and looked out her window at least im honest good for you an honest spy you must be real unique rapp wasnt a spy but he wasnt about to waste his time trying to correct her the day of the attack you said you didnt shuffle the limos what are you talking about when you left the conference right before the explosion you told me everyone loaded up you got in the first limo with ross and alexander and alexanders wife got in the second limo thats right the light turned green and rapp took his foot off the brake and the limos were never shuffled they stayed in that order until the explosion yeah i already told you this im just trying to make sure who decides who rides in which limo rivera frowned her thin dark eyebrows arching above her sunglasses i was the sac typically i do but a lot of the times we work on the fly with the protectees and their staff i read in the preliminary report last night that alexander and his wife arrived in the same limousine but left in separate vehicles you have a copy of the preliminary report rivera asked her surprise obvious yes and dont worry you come out of it unscathed rapp wasnt being entirely honest but he didnt need her getting all worked up now is that right alexander and his wife arrived in the same car and left in separate cars yes and in the report it says you assigned special agent cash to ride with alexanders wife in the second limo yes rivera grew a bit tentative where are you going with all of this bear with me for a little bit longer and ill tell you the decision to put alexanders wife in the second limo was that a staff decision or was it your decision rapp took a left onto constitution avenue the washington monument looming large up ahead on the right by staff i assume you mean campaign yes was it you or the campaign it was the campaign rapps fingers flexed on the leather steering wheel and then gripped it tight he was homing in on the truth and he could feel it when were you informed of the change probably fifteen minutes or so before we were going to leave for the vice presidents residence dont hold me to that though changes like this happen all the time even more so during a campaign rapp nodded i wont i assume if the campaign wants to make a change they need to inform you personally usually but im not always on when youre on usually but not always sometimes theyll grab the closest agent and have them tell me but i made it clear that i wanted all changes to go through me directly rapp nodded as he drove so far so good it was how he had envisioned it so on the day of the attack who informed you there was going to be a change in terms of who would be riding in which car stu garret rapp felt his chest tighten a bit as he began to experience a spike in adrenalin stu garret rapp turned his head to the right cracking his neck do you know him only by reputation hes extremely rude to put it kindly so ive heard rapp got in the right lane and prepared to turn onto th street was agent cash already assigned to the second limo or was that a lastminute change what is your interest in agent cash rapp took a right turn and sighed nothing in particular just some inconsistencies weve found i dont know if this will help but we got in a fight that afternoon when i told him he needed to take jillian back to her hotel so that was a lastminute change yes and why did you decide to pick him over all the other agents i didnt she requested him rapp looked surprised youre sure about that did she tell you personally or did one of her aides tell you rivera thought about it for a moment and then said actually it was garret who told me shed requested him rapp took a hard left turn onto jefferson drive youre sure yes im sure and this was normal yes he was the campaign manager he was always running around barking at people making last minute changes was it normal for jillian to request agent cash actually it was we used to tease him about it rivera smiled as she remembered her friend some of the agents even joked that she had a thing for him rapp laughed uncomfortably they drove another block in silence and then rapp pulled over in front of the national air and space museum he had to make a decision kennedy wouldnt like it but he was going to go with his instincts he put the car in park and turned toward rivera i need you to do something for me rivera was caught off guard by both his sincerity and intensity she looked at him warily and asked what you know jack warch of course in about an hour and a half im going to have the president call him the president is going to tell jack that he wants you to look through all of the logs the secret service has on ross and alexander going back to this past september i especially want you to look at the two weeks prior to the attack i want to know if they had any foreign visitors and i want you to keep an eye out for any mention of stu garret rivera took off her sunglasses and studied rapps rugged features why did you laugh like that when i told you some of the agents used to tease cash that jillian had a thing for him laugh like what like they were probably right and they didnt even know it rapp looked out the front window and said did you really not know that they were having an affair excuse me rivera answered more than a bit shocked you truly didnt know rapp asked in a disbelieving tone i knew matt cash for a long time he was a good father and a devoted husband there is no way he was cheating on his family really rapp reached in his pocket and pulled out a color copy of one of the shots taken down in palm beach rapp tossed the photo onto riveras lap and said if thats not agent cash having sex with jillian rautbort then would you mind telling me who it is rivera stared at the photo in shock unable to speak the lobby at the willard was coming to life it was am and no one was checking out there were only arrivals and guests moving about to find food and shop garret was actually trying to get work done and if one more person came up and congratulated him he swore he was going to bash them over the head with his blackberry garret sat in an oversized mohair chair facing the door he assumed the man he was meeting for lunch knew what he looked like because he hadnt the faintest idea what the guy looked like garret focused on the small screen of his blackberry with the aid of a pair of bifocals his thumb spun the black wheel on the side of the device and clicked on the weather icon the fiveday forecast popped up after a few seconds for months hed been dreading the inauguration every time he thought about it he imagined himself sitting on the west capitol steps freezing his ass off a warm front was moving in the afternoons high was supposed to be fiftytwo degrees and they were forecasting a balmy fiftyeight for the big event on saturday garret smiled fucking weather idiots he thought to himself they had no idea what they were doing only two days ago theyd been forecasting low thirties for the weekend satisfied with the current forecast he spun the wheel and clicked on one of his saved web sites it was an online auction site that specialized in old motorcycles garret had a couple of bids he needed to check one of them was going to shut down the bidding at pm this evening as he was looking at the most recent bid the blackberry beeped and then a number one appeared in his inbox suddenly three more messages appeared garret opened the inbox and saw that the first message was a news alert from the drudge report the other three were from other news services something was brewing garret clicked on the link and a moment later was staring at the bare bones home page of the drudge report the headline across the top read president to hold noon press conference cia director expected to step down garret pumped his fist up and down and hit the speed dial button for mark ross ross answered on the second ring yes how did it go at langley shes dead and she doesnt even know it i think she does now whats going on drudge is reporting that the president is going to hold a noon press conference about he says kennedy is going to resign youre kidding rosss voice was filled with excitement nope can you believe it it took less than a day and you barely had to lift a finger where are you at the hotel im meeting some clown from indiana who thinks hes going to be their next governor keep it short ill meet you in the bar at noon well watch it together i cant wait to see the dejected look on kennedys face see you there garret hung up just as his came strolling into the lobby the guy had to be six foot six that was the first thing he noticed the second was that he had the most pronounced adams apple hed ever seen unless the people of indiana wanted a governor who looked like a stork this guy didnt stand a chance whitehouse washington dc president hayes was as relieved as kennedy had ever seen him after shed finished the powerpoint presentation he admitted that hed feared the worst when hed read the piece in thetimes for obvious reasons he did not want his administration to end with a scandal instead he was going to leave on a high note gazich was guilty there was no doubt about it the greek government had just this morning filed their official protest at the un theyd jumped the gun and were about to find that out in a very public manner and best of all his critics and foes were going to have to eat crow rapps idea to hold a press conference had been an easy sell for kennedy the president couldnt wait to turn the tables onthe new york times not only was he going out on a high note he was going to be able to do what few presidents got the chance to do and that was rub the presss face in their own mistake rapp had been right when hed told kennedy that this was going to be fun her amusement however had been brief kennedy was filled with dread over how farreaching the scandal might be and shed decided to share none of her deeper suspicions with the president it wasnt that she didnt trust him it was that she needed some proof so far all she had were some very embarrassing photos a theory a deep distrust of mark ross and the fear that josh alexander was so power hungry hed had his own wife killed to win the election kennedy stood in the small hallway just outside the white house press room with juarez at her side she wanted him there so she could give the clandestine service some much deserved positive publicity for kennedy there was no time to celebrate she was worried about the larger picture worried about the truth that rapp might discover a truth that would destroy a nations confidence in its elected officials and damage for decades to come america s international standing kennedy needed to be absolutely sure of what had happened and she needed to find out before alexander and ross took their oaths kennedys phone rang she looked at the caller id and saw it was rapp she pressed the talk button and asked how did it go she had no idea they were having an affair you believe her yes did she confirm that she was the one who ordered him to ride in the second car yes hmmm kennedy wondered if theyd just hit their first stumbling block part of her wanted it to end right here and now but another part of her wanted to prove that her instincts were right but get this rapp said garret was the one who told her to make sure cash and the wife went in the second limo she said garret told her the wife had specifically requested cash and theres no way of proving if she did or didnt there is one way how ill grab that little piece of shit garret and threaten to pluck his eyeballs out with my bare hands mitch we cant go around doing stuff like that kennedy glanced to her right and then left at least not without some more proof fine but do me a favor the president is going to have you say a few words right yes make sure you really play up the fact that we found certain records in gazichs office that have given us a good idea as to who may have hired him keep it real vague but sound confident kennedy looked up and saw president hayes coming down the hall with his press secretary i have to go ill call you when im done kennedy silenced her ringer and stuffed it in her purse are you ready the president asked with a confident smile im ready if you are sir good lets go hayes took kennedy by the arm and led her into the cramped and hot white house press room willardhotel washington dc the first thing garret did was separate the stork from his staff the five people seemed put off but garret didnt give it a second thought he walked the wannabe politician over to the far corner of the lobby grabbed two chairs and got down to business the stork was a baptist who attended church every sunday which in a state like indiana was very important even more so for a democrat the family was loaded grandpa started out buying radio stations in the s daddy added tv stations in the s and then further solidified the familys fortune with a cable monopoly in the s in the s the stork whod graduated from purdue with an engineering degree saw the future and convinced daddy to get into the satellite business the company now had three communications satellites in orbit and the familys net worth was estimated to be somewhere in the fivebilliondollar range the stork claimed to be happily married and faithful to his wife of thirteen years he had three kids no history of drug abuse and no perverse habits that he would admit to garret told the man that before he would commit he wanted to run some preliminary polls to see what the people of indiana thought of him the stork said they already had polling data but garret was adamant that he would need to do a poll of his own the aspiring candidate would of course have to foot the bill garret would also hire a private eye to check for dirty laundry it was a steadfast rule of his to have all potential clients investigated he didnt like surprises hed been burned one too many times by candidates with an over inflated sense of importance and a selective memory garret saw a secret service agent enter the main door he vaguely recognized him as one of the agents assigned to rosss detail the man stopped swept the room from right to left with a robotic gaze and then brought his left hand up to his mouth and spoke into a small microphone garret knew ross would be coming through the door shortly so he apologized for such a brief meeting and promised to call the stork early next week even if he didnt need to meet ross he would have kept it short he wasnt about to dither with a potential client garret saw two more secret service agents come through the door one stopped to survey the guests while the other continued on to the elevator bank a second later ross entered the lobby the murmurs started almost immediately those who saw him first whispered to the others and all heads turned to watch the partys second most important person one of the guests shouted something that garret didnt quite catch ross smiled and pumped his fist and then the other guests broke into applause garret set out on a course to intercept ross midway between the door and the elevators the stork called out his name but garret didnt bother to turn around the guy probably wanted to meet ross but garret had no time for introductions or pleasantries he wanted to get up to rosss suite and turn on cnn garret fell into step with the vice presidentelect and his bodyguards and marched straight for a waiting elevator no words were exchanged ross garret and four agents stepped onto the elevator when the doors closed garret looked over at ross and asked how did things go out at langley ross kept his eyes on the floor numbers above the elevator door out of the side of his mouth he gave a one word answer interesting interesting garret thought interesting meant he had something to say but he didnt want to talk about it in front of the agents they passed the rest of the short ride in silence when the doors opened another secret service agent was waiting for them they walked down the hall to rosss suite where yet another sentinel was posted the agent slid a card key into the reader and opened the door for ross and garret they entered the suite where the smell of breakfast still hung in the air as soon as the door clicked shut ross pulled off his suit coat and said i cant wait to see the look on that bitchs face when shes forced to resign garret already had the remote control in his hand and was working the buttons ross draped his coat over the back of a chair and added maybe we should get the justice department to launch an investigation if were lucky shell end up in jail garret frowned and made another attempt at entering the channel for cnn be happy with your victory and leave it at that the last thing we want is more investigations you should have seen her this morning ross placed his hands on the back of the chair and looked at the tv she was so smug she sat there in her office with her damn expressionless face and told me she didnt think it was appropriate to comment on the article when i was her boss she used to pull the same shit what did you expect her to say garret extended the remote turned up the volume and in a falsetto voice said i screwed up im sorry garret shook his head people like kennedythey always think theyre the smartest person in the room no way shes ever going to admit she blew it the image of the white house press room came on the screen it was just the podium and the blue backdrop with the cutout of the white house next to the white house logo a large flatpanel monitor hung from the ceiling the crawler at the bottom of the screen said the president was expected to make an important announcement the cnn white house correspondent was reporting the speculation that cia director kennedy was expected to announce her resignation no shit garret laughed isnt this great yes it is ross flashed a proud smile this is real power being able to manipulate world events look garret said here comes bobble head ross snickered garret could be brutally funny some times after president hayes had rebuffed the campaign for the umpteenth time and made it clear that he would not be campaigning on behalf of ross and alexander garret had taken to calling him bobble head it was a crude reference to the way the presidents parkinsons made him shake he must have taken his medicine this morning hes not shaking too bad turn it up ross commanded a series of escalating green bars appeared at the bottom of the screen while the president arranged his notes behind the podium the expression on his face was very serious finally hayes cleared his throat and then grabbed the small mike pulling it a bit closer im going to make a brief statement he said and then im going to turn things over to director kennedy hayes paused for a second to look down at his notes i have been blessed in my life to work with some extremely talented people at the top of that list i would put the woman to my right the president stopped and looked at kennedy with a paternal smile garret said hes going to build her up before he drops the ax director kennedy has been one of my closest advisors over the past four years and she and her team at the cia are some of the finest folks in public service today many of her successes you will never know about because they are classified her failures unfortunately often end up on the front pages of newspapers across the country and beyond the president stopped his eyes floating over the press corps with an expression that was somewhere between anger and disappointment i would like to say to the country today that there is no one i have depended on more over these past four years than irene kennedy i owe her a deep debt of gratitude thecountry owes her a deep debt of gratitude hayes stayed at the microphone but turned to look at kennedy i am a very lucky man to have worked with someone so talented and loyal the president stepped away from the podium and opened his arms for kennedy garret shook his head in disgust and said you see thats what happens when youre done running for office you dont give a shit who you hug if he was up for reelection theres no way hed be doing this id bet he wouldnt even be caught in the same room as her kennedy stood behind the podium with empty hands she looked decidedly smaller than the president but she exuded a quiet confidence her straight brown hair was tucked behind her ears and she was wearing a pair of diminutive blackrimmed glasses a strand of small white pearls hung around her neck she looked smart classy and in control she looked straight at the press corps and said since the terrorist attack here in washington this past october the cia has been actively trying to identify the person or persons behind the assault on the motorcade this past weekend a team of cia operatives after nearly a month in the field apprehended a man on the greek island of cyprus this man has been identified bythe new york times as alexander deckas a greek national just this morning the greek government filed an official protest at the united nations accusing the united states of kidnapping one of their citizens the greek government is demanding mr deckas be returned immediately kennedy looked to her right and gave a nod to someone offscreen a second later the flatpanel monitor that was perched over her right shoulder flickered to life kennedy moved around to the far side of the podium raised her right arm and pointed it at the screen a blackandwhite image appeared on the screen this surveillance footage was taken at a starbucks on wisconsin avenue only a few blocks away from the explosion that took place this past october based on the testimony of a secret service agent who was in the motorcade that day we believe the man standing at the counter wearing the baseball hat is the person who detonated the bomb kennedy raised her hand pressed the remote and the screen split in two the left half showed the starbucks footage and the right half showed a new surveillance image the picture on the right was taken at jfk the day before the attack using facial recognition software these two photos were analyzed experts in the field concur that there is an eightyplus percent chance that these two men are one and the same rosss eyes narrowed and he asked what in the hell is she up to the man on the right entered the us using a greek passport and was traveling under the name of nicholas panagos kennedy hit the remote again and the screen was now split into thirds this new picture on the far right is of alexander deckas the man we apprehended in cyprus this past weekend using facial recognition software our experts concur that there is a ninetynine percent match between the photo in the middle and the one of mr deckas on the right kennedy paused and looked out at the reporters assembled before her a hand shot up and then a man stood blocking a good portion of the camera angle the image on the tv quickly switched to show the reporter from the front as he began to speak his name appeared at the bottom of the screen along with the newspaper he worked for it was sam cohen the white house correspondent forthe new york times director kennedy are you denying reports that the cia kidnapped mr deckas from his home on cyprus the camera angle switched back around to kennedy i would use the wordapprehended so youre not denying it kennedy pursed her lips for a moment and then said no cohen wrote while he talked are you denying reports that mitch rapp shot this man four times once in each knee and then again in both hands once again kennedy paused and then gave her one word response no cohen had a look of surprised amusement on his face were these injuries inflicted while agent rapp was torturing mr deckas they occurred during the apprehension of the suspect but i think youre getting a bit ahead of the story here sam with all due respect director kennedy i think the torturing of a fellow human in any situation is an outrage our courts have repeatedly said the same thing the torturing of someone whose guilt or innocence has yet to be proved is an utter travesty if the man was indeedinnocent and he had in fact been tortured i would agree with you you have shown us nothing that comes close to proving that this deckas fellow was the one who attacked the motorcade and i cant conceive of a scenario where an individual gets shot in both knees and both hands while being arrested kennedys calm neutral demeanor melted into a playful smile thats because you interrupted me sam it appears to be a habit ofthe new york times to jump to conclusions before gathering all the facts the smile was what gave ross reason to pause it was the same smile one would give during a chess match when an opponent had stepped into your trap something was wrong her expression was not what he expected from someone who was about to be gang raped by the media ross watched as she turned back to the screen and pressed the remote the photo of deckas stayed on the screen and was joined by a second younger photo of him mr deckas is in fact not a greek citizen his real name is gavrilo gazich and he is wanted by the hague for war crimes committed in the former republic of yugoslavia mr gazich is a person of bosnian heritage who is charged with killing over three dozen men women and children during the war five years ago he moved to cyprus and set up a fake identity and a company that specialized in bringing aid to the impoverished nations of africa based on information we found at his office and home we are now looking into the fact that he may have been involved in as many as sixteen assassinations over the past decade his targets included a united nations official relief workers politicians warlords generals and at least one reporter garret tore his eyes away from the tv and said what the fuck is this before ross could answer kennedy continued mr gazich has admitted his role in the attack here in washington this past october was that confession made before or after hed been shot in both knees the voice was that of sam cohen of thetimes he stayed in his seat this time kennedy did not bother to look at the screen she kept her eyes on cohen while she hit the remote bringing up two new photos the screen was filled with two ashenfaced dead men while observing mr gazichs movements on the island of cyprus the cia team watched him kill these two men we do not know who they are but we have reason to believe they are russian we also think they were sent to kill mr gazich so he would no longer be a liability to whoever it was who hired him to attack presidentelect alexanders motorcade here is a brief excerpt of gazichs confession i cant play all of it for you because he told us some things that we are still investigating kennedy pressed a button again and a typed transcript appeared on the screen of the audio a second later voices could be heard how did you get into the us be careful take your time to think this one through you wouldnt want to lie to me i flew into new york the day before which airport jfk the explosives they were waiting for me where pennsylvania the state yes the state now give me my shot not quite yet youre doing a good job though so you pick up the van drive it down to washingtonwhen on friday no i told you i arrived in new york on friday so you stayed in pennsylvania on friday night yesyes the van was waiting for me and i drove it down to washington early on saturday morning i found my spot i parked it i waited and then when the time was right i blew it up end of story garret stood abruptly this is all bullshitright i mean shes making this shit up isnt she ross had his arms folded across his chest his fist balled up and under his chin without bothering to look at garret he snapped shut up so i can hear what shes saying director kennedy it was cohen again was that tape made before or after the suspect had been shot whats your point sam when someone has been shot in both knees and both hands and then interrogated its reasonable to assume that they would say anything to avoid further pain thats called coercion and if mitch rapp shot this man before questioning him theres not a judge in the land who is going to allow this confession into evidence i dont know if youve been paying attention sam but this is a pretty nasty business you dont send a boy scout out to capture a monster like gavrilo gazich you need to send someone like mitch rapp you dont yellfreeze you dont flash a badge you disable the man so you dont end up like these two guys kennedy pointed the remote at the screen and returned to the photo of the two dead men as for your question as to whether or not the confession was coerced ill let the totality of the evidence speak for itself kennedy put a photograph of gazich up on the screen this is the man who remotedetonated the bomb that killed nineteen americans this past october in addition to his confession we have discovered some key evidence in his home and office that we think will lead us to the people who hired him i thank you for your time this morning and id be more than happy to take a few questions the room burst into a freeforall as more than a dozen reporters burst to their feet and began shouting questions ross quietly swore to himself while garret let loose a string of profanity what the fuck are we going to do garret asked those assholes said they were going to take care of this ross stood motionless with his arms folded and his fist looking like he might drive it through his own chin slowly but surely he began to tremble and his face turned crimson garret paced back and forth before him ranting and raving did you hear what that bitch said he stopped and pointed at the tv as if ross might think he was talking about someone else she said they have information information that is going to lead them to the people who hired gazich did you fucking hear her yes i fucking heard her ross snapped and then clenched both fists in front of him like he wanted to pound the hell out of someone he stepped toward garret and lowered his voice i tell you what youre going to do stu you are going to get on a plane this afternoon and you are going to fly over there and you are going to tell thoseidiots that i dont care who they have to kill to put a lid on this thing i want anyone outside the immediate circle dealt with and i meananyone and dont take any shit from them they promised this guy would be dealt with and they blew it so i dont want to hear another word about a pardon until they have erased all possible connections between them and this gazich guy have i made myself clear garret did not feel like getting on a plane to go anywhere other than california but he knew ross was right they were too close to let this thing fall apart and green and his associates couldnt be trusted yes you have ill go potomacpalisades washington dc kennedy finished loading the dishwasher and dried her hands on a towel hanging from the refrigerator door handle the clock on the microwave read her son was in bed and a pot of coffee was ready to go they would want coffee even at this late hour kennedy walked through the dining room to the formal living room she looked out the window to see if theyd arrived a man was out walking his golden retriever kennedy recognized the dog before the owner it was rookie and mr soucheray her neighbor even though kennedy loved her neighborhood she had considered moving potomac palisades was in her biased opinion the nicest area in washington dc it wasnt the most expensive or the most exclusive but that was part of what made it one of the nicest it was old goodsized homes with bigger than normal city yards yards that people mowed themselves kennedy didnt mow her own lawn but instead of hiring a service she had one of the neighborhood boys handle the chore in another year or two tommy would be able to take over potomac palisades was not a bedroom community people knew each other her mother lived less than a mile away in the foxhall village neighborhood kennedy had tried to get her to live with them but the woman wanted her independence and kennedy respected that the palisades ran along the eastern edge of the potomac river with its rolling terrain and luscious growth it felt like a sanctuary far from the nations center of power in truth it was a straight threemile shot from the white house four if you wound your way down the potomac the only reason she considered moving was out of respect for the quiet neighborhood and the nice people who lived there the cia made a lot of people nervous in washington the institution tended to be less polarizing pretty much everybody knew somebody who worked for the cia or had worked for the cia when you saw those people pulling up to a soccer game or the grocery store in their minivan it took a lot of the mystique out of the job being the director of the cia was a slightly different matter though shortly after she took over the top job langley replaced all the windows in her house with bulletproof glass and installed steel doors and door frames with overlaid wood veneer they wanted to do even more like installing a tenfoot privacy fence in back she put her foot down and told them no instead they landscaped putting in pressure pads and laser and microwave sensors a panic room had been built in the basement and the home was swept twice a week for listening devices a bomb tech and his german shepherd checked her car every morning before she left for work next to the panic room in the basement theyd also built a security shack that was the nerve center for the extremely expensive security system the house was as secure as they could make it without tearing it down and starting over after all the security precautions were implemented another group at the cia took it upon themselves to do a threat assessment on kennedy at the top of their list was the suggestion that she move to a location with a long driveway the current house was a scant forty feet from the street any terrorist with a couple thousand dollars and a rudimentary understanding of chemistry could simply drive down her street and level her house welcome to the post world she was a highvalue target and her neighbors were understandably uneasy that their peaceful neighborhood might become ground zero kennedys response was to shelve the threat assessment she thought of the risks her father and stepmother had taken her dad had also worked for the cia hed been the station chief in beirut back in when a car bomb leveled the place her stepmother worked for the state department kennedys parents divorced when she six her mother it turned out wasnt cut out for the world of international espionage kennedy spent a significant portion of her teens and early twenties overseas shed lived in cairo damascus baghdad and beirut before everything fell apart having walked the streets of beirut with machinegun fire in the distance and mortars going off only blocks away it seemed ludicrous to think that such violence could come to the tranquil streets of potomac palisades when president hayes decided not to seek reelection kennedy put the decision to move on hold when alexander and ross won the race she banished any thought of moving kennedy was an exceedingly civil person always polite and rarely confrontational she was a woman in a mans world and she knew her mere presence could be threatening to the insatiable egos of the men who were drawn to work in washington thomas stansfield her mentor had warned her often about the perils of working for men who needed to constantly prove that they were right kennedy avoided most of the frays by staying respectful but firm she also avoided gossip and politics she had tried to do the same with ross but there had always been signs that there was an agenda lurking beneath the surface nothing big just little things but the little things often spoke volumes about people for example ross was habitually late for every meeting kennedy remembered stansfield telling her once that when someone is constantly late they fall into three categories the first he calledidiot savant the type of person who is so smart in his or her field of expertise that their mind is literally elsewhere in laymans terms he explained that these people were smart in school and dumb on the bus the second category was made up of perfectionists people who were incapable of letting go of one task and moving on to another these people were always playing catchup rarely rose to any real position of power and needed to be managed properly the third category and the one to be most wary of were the egomaniacs these were the people who not only felt that their time was more important than anyone elses but who needed to prove it by constantly making others wait for them kennedy was worried she looked out the window and checked for headlights rapp and dumond had said theyd found some interesting stuff and they were on their way over in the past she had always tried to keep her personal feelings separate from her job especially when dealing with those whod been elected to office ross was making that difficult it was as if shed seen him for who he really was for the first time this morning the man had yet to take his oath of office if hed called and questioned her about the article she would have understood if hed called for an appointment she would have thought hed had more important things to do but would have accommodated him nonetheless but showing up unannounced was peculiar it was as if he needed to see her beaten down a pair of bluish white xenon headlights appeared at the far end of the block a few seconds later a silver audi came to an abrupt halt at the curb kennedy watched as dumond and rapp got out of the car and started up the walk the younger man dumond moved with a carefree gait his attention focused on some small device he was carrying in his left hand rapp moved with an athletic grace there was nothing herkyjerky or rushed about his movements his head swiveled from left to right and then back like a radar searching for potential threats she remembered seeing that awareness when shed recruited him all those years ago at syracuse kennedy strode through the living room to the foyer and punched a code into the security panel on the wall somewhere behind the wall she heard the faint whirl of an electronic motor as it retracted three steel pins from the door kennedy opened the door and immediately noticed a puzzled look on dumonds face whats wrong im not sure ill know more in a minute he stepped into the foyer and kept tapping the keys of a very small laptop rapp closed the door and kissed kennedy on the cheek tommy in bed yes he has school in the morning rapp took off his coat and handed it to kennedy dumond was too focused on his computer to bother removing his jacket and continued down the hall toward the smell of coffee rapp and kennedy followed him would anyone like coffee kennedy asked please rapp backed up against the black soapstone counter and placed his hands on the edge he looked at dumond who hadnt answered kennedy and said hey dip shit dumond tore his eyes away from the small screen and said huh coffee sure how about please rapp prodded please dumond said without taking his eyes off the screen with cream and sugar kennedy poured two cups and took the cream from the fridge she handed one cup to rapp so what have you learned she placed the other cup on the table next to the cream and slid the sugar bowl over so far rapp said nothing concrete but we have a few interesting tidbits back in early october garret flew to switzerland for a day another october surprise kennedy was referencing a conspiracy theory which held that the reagan camp had met secretly with members of the iranian government and conspired to delay the release of american hostages until after they beat carter in the presidential election all we have are the dates of his departure and return we have no idea who he met with he did call a bank in geneva several times before and after the trip but again we have no idea who he spoke with emails kennedy asked were still trying to track all those down the guy has at least six different addresses and he must receive and send easily a hundred a day what about ross he was in switzerland last weekend for an environmental summit rapp held his white coffee cup by the handle rivera got me the list of the people he met with while he was over there we crossreferenced it against some of the other data and one name got kicked out joseph speyer should i know him kennedy asked with a furrowed brow no but he happens to be the president of the bank in geneva that garret called back in october what do we know about the bank rapp pointed at dumond marcus is working on that apparently its one of geneva s oldest and most secretive institutions and by far the most difficult one to hack into dumond added without looking up is that what youre working on kennedy asked no something else dumond hadnt touched his coffee his two index fingers were busy tapping keys kennedys stoic gaze shifted to rapp what about our belarusian friend nothing yet hornig says she needs a little more time to soften him up when kennedy asked impatiently she thought maybe she could start in the morning rapp could sense her frustration i didnt think we were operating under any time constraints in two days were going to have a new president and vice president who might be guilty of murder and treason and god knows what else based on how ross has been acting i dont think hes going to waste any time getting rid of me we need to get to the bottom of this while we still have the power to yes dumond said triumphantly he looked up smiling that little bastard took me longer than i expected what little bastard rapp asked tmobiles firewall they must have brought in some new hot shot it normally takes me a minute or less this time it took me a full ten minutes what are you looking for garret has two phones one is a blackberry that he has with verizon and then he has a motorola that he has through tmobile dumond spun the small computer ninety degrees so rapp and kennedy could see the screen heres all of his calls kennedy looked nervous marcus i assume theres no way this can be traced back to you huh dumond laughed anyone with half a brain can hack into a system when i do it theres no trace i was ever there anything to switzerland rapp asked as he bent over to look at the screen all it showed were the numbers that he had called or had called him no names there appeared to be no international calls can you get us a reverse directory on these phone numbers no problem dumond spun the computer made a few keystrokes and then spun it back heres the names associated with numbers he dialed and the time and date rapp leaned in close so he could read the tiny print the calls were listed in descending order with the most recent one at the top of the screen rapp scanned the column and halfway down the first page a name jumped out at him why ill be damned what kennedy asked she didnt have her reading glasses with her our little buddy tom rich from thetimes called garret right in the middle of your press conference this afternoon that seems like a bit of coincidence kennedy replied rapp scrolled down to the previous days calls look here garret called ross three times yesterday and ross called garret five times look here he called garret at sevenohnine last night i remember looking at my watch when we were in your office it was sevenohfour he got off the phone with us and must have called garret right away rapp grabbed his phone opened it hit talk scrolled down to the number he wanted and hit talk again a few rings later agent rivera was on the phone how are the logs coming slowly have yesterdays logs been filed yes but i dont have them in front of me can you get them yes i can pull them up on the computer rapp backed away from the kitchen table and waited ive got them up on the screen what are you looking for who did ross meet with yesterday rivera started reading a long list within fifteen seconds rapp lost his patience and asked did he meet with tom rich the reporter yes mitch she said uncomfortably im not sure i should be giving you that kind of information i dont have time for this right now maria trust me when i tell you its important there was a long moment of silence and then rivera said they met yesterday evening in rosss suite at the willard thanks ill call you later rapp closed his phone and pointed at dumonds computer screen these calls match up perfectly garret set up the interview and ross was the highlevel source who fed rich the story look kennedy bent forward and squinted but before she could begin reading a new screen popped up and covered the tmobile page some type of ominous law enforcement shield sat in the middle of the screen whoa kennedy said fearing their unlawful intrusion had been discovered marcus youd better take a look at this she said as she backed away dumond quickly set his coffee down and grabbed the computer he spun it around studied the screen for a split second and then began hitting keys what is it rapp asked with no real worry in his voice dumond was the master of his own little universe he would never initiate an incursion that could be traced back to him customs and immigration web site when i was in their database earlier today i put a flag on garrets passport a flag kennedy said in a slightly alarmed voice not the normal kind of flag i set it up so i would receive an alert if he tried to leave the country i also tapped into the airlines reservation system while i was checking his travel dumond typed in several commands the screen changed as quickly as his fingers flew well ill be damned dumond stopped typing and stared at the screen what rapp asked garret just checked in for an air france flight from dulles to geneva rapp and kennedy looked at each other their thoughts passing without words when does his flight leave kennedy asked twelve twenty ill call jose and have him put his best people on it kennedy said rapp checked his watch theres a chance i can get there first besides i dont think we want to use embassy people for this tell him i want nocs only youre probably right kennedy watched rapp punch numbers into his mobile phone noc stood for non official cover they were langley s most coveted operatives are you sure you should go you have any better ideas not at the moment rapp could tell she still wasnt sold on the idea like you said irene we have less than two days if these guys were involved in any way in that attack im willing to bet the answers are in switzerland rapp looked away from kennedy and spoke into his phone scramble the boys we need to be in the air by midnight rapp listened for a second and said across the pond mostly surveillance but you never know ill see you in thirty rapp closed the phone and looked at kennedy her expression radiated concern dont worry ill be fine kennedy frowned and said im not worried about you then who in the hell are you worried about stu garret kennedy shook her head i know how you think mitch i dont want you slapping him around irenecome on rapp said as if he was complaining wellat least not until he gives you a reason geneva switzerland garret was in a supremely foul mood hed boarded his flight convinced he would sleep his way across the atlantic he had it all planned out hed have a vodka on the rocks before takeoff and two or three glasses of red wine with his meal and then hed kick off his shoes recline his seat put on the little mask they handed out and hed snooze until the sun was gleaming off the snowcapped alps unfortunately he didnt account for his enlarged prostate an hour into his slumber he awoke to make his first of three trips to the head when he landed in geneva he was tired grumpy and more than a bit out of whack he was at least happy though to be out of washington no one bugging him for photographs and advice a driver was waiting for him at the airport the man took him to his hotel and on the way showed him where he would be meeting mr speyer for dinner at garret was immediately put off that they were going to make him wait for six and a half hours to discuss business but there wasnt much he could do about it speyer wasnt answering his phone and he wasnt about to call green he checked in to his hotel a little before in the afternoon and asked for a pm wakeup call just to be safe when he got up to his room the jet lag hit him hard he turned off both mobile phones and hit the do not disturb button on the hotel phone he must have been dehydrated from the flight because he slept straight through to his pm wakeup call without disturbance from his prostate garret showered and shaved and put on a blue sport coat white dress shirt and dark gray slacks when he arrived downstairs a car was waiting for him garret walked outside with his puffy down coat and stopped for a moment on the sidewalk across the street was lake geneva the city lights flickered on the surface as a political consultant garret had a keen sense of awareness when it came to people he liked geneva it was a city of scoundrels many of whom tried to portray themselves as aristocracy it was a voyeuristic heaven you got to watch the charade of social pretense that masked insatiable appetites for food drugs drinking gambling and sex it could be a very fun place to visit garret stuffed his hands in his jacket and climbed into the back of his waiting mercedes sedan the driver said hello in french and garret nodded to his reflection in the rearview mirror the car eased out into traffic and rolled down quai du montblanc toward the finest restaurant in all of geneva garret was looking forward to the meal but he was not looking forward to the company he decided he would have to order the most expensive thing on the menu he didnt have to worry about the wine speyer would take great care to make sure something extremely expensive was selected mitch rapp sat in the backseat of the car and studied garret through the opaque glass of the backseat side window the fingers on rapps right hand clamped down on the cuff of his black leather jacket the entire team was carrying miniaturized encrypted radios with wireless earpieces rapp pressed the transmit button sewn into his cuff and said hes on his way he released the button and looked at hacket who was behind the wheel you know the routine kevin hang back for a second and make sure no one else is following him the black mercedes sedan began to roll the flight from dc had taken six hours and eleven minutes they were wheels up at pm and with the time change they were on the ground in geneva a few minutes before noon a full hour before garrets plane was due to land no one slept on the way over there was too much work to be done dumond went online and hacked into the networks of seven different hotels before he found out where garret was staying he was booked at the beaurivage on quai du montblanc overlooking the lake if he had business at speyer s bank the hotel made sense it was a short walk after analyzing the rivages reservation system the best they were able to do was get a room on the same floor as garret two doors down there was no adjacent hotel with a direct line of sight to garrets room so they would have to bug his room instead after they cleared customs they found two identical black mercedes sedans with heavily tinted windows and a white volkswagen cargo van waiting for them in the trunk of each sedan they found a full complement of silenced weapons and in the back of the van a surveillance kit everyone was dressed in business attire except coleman and stroble who were wearing pilots uniforms coleman and stroble took one of the sedans and parked out in front of the air france terminal rapp dumond and hacket took the white van and followed brooks and wicker who were in the other mercedes to the rivage brooks and wicker checked into the room at the rivage while the rest of the team went to the dangleterre a few blocks away rapp and the other two waited outside until the newlyweds finished bugging garrets room dumond in the meantime managed to insert garrets mobile phone numbers into the national security agencys echelon system the cia worked closely with the nsa on overseas matters neither wanted to be embarrassed over the discovery that they were intentionally targeting us citizens abroad so theyd developed a system where numbers could be monitored for a brief period a day or two and then they would be purged from the system as if theyd never been looked at in the first place garrets email addresses were also added to the list so far the hardest part of the op had been getting a reservation for brooks and wicker at le bearn wicker slid the concierge at the rivage a hundreddollar bill and the guy barely batted an eye it took two more cnotes before the guy could guarantee a table a laptop was sitting on the seat next to rapp the screen was divided into four pictures wicker and brooks had already arrived at le bearn and had planted several miniaturized cameras and listening devices in the bar restaurant and bathroom dumond was monitoring everything from the back of the van which was parked a half block away from the restaurant the screen currently showed a picture of the street outside the restaurant the front door of the restaurant from the inside and two more interior shots of the dining area dumond was recording everything garret stepped through the front door a few minutes early and was immediately cut off by three men wearing tuxedos le bearn wouldnt let you into the bar if you didnt have a reservation for dinner the shorter of the three men greeted garret in french he was polite but unyielding garret ignored the greeting and told the man he was meeting joseph speyer for dinner their attitudes changed immediately one man grabbed his coat the third disappeared and the other began singing the praises of one of geneva s most wellrespected bankers the man himself showed up just moments later next to garret with his frumpy demeanor and illfitting clothes speyer looked as if hed just stepped out of agq ad his twobutton bluegray flannel suit had a faint light gray pinstripe the fabric hung from his thin frame perfectly the pants breaking at the perfect spot above a pair of handmade light brown italian shoes that matched the frame of his glasses speyer s thinning light brown hair was cropped short and styled slightly forward they had just made it to the bar when four men came through the door two of them were huge standing well over six feet tall and weighing upwards of three hundred pounds everything about them screamedbodyguard the two older men sandwiched in between them were cy green and aleksandr gordievsky they were opposites of sorts green had a relaxed air of confidence about him his permatan slickedback hair opencollared shirt gold necklace and watch and doublebreasted blue sport coat was the uniform of the ultrawealthy compared to green gordievsky looked a bit pasty his brown hair was mostly gone except around the sides and in back where he grew it a bit too long his suit was a bit too shiny and the mock turtleneck sweater that he wore under the jacket screamed eurotrash handshakes and greetings were exchanged and the restaurant staff made a great production out of taking care of the group they were escorted to their corner table where green and gordievsky insisted on sitting with their backs to the wall the two hulking bodyguards were given the table next to them water and bread were left and drink orders were taken a special wine list was brought to the table and offered to green who quickly declined and gestured for it to be given to speyer while speyer perused the list green looked across the table and flashed garret a devilish look you have picked a good time to visit tonight is going to be great fun when we are done with this exquisite meal we are going to hit some fabulous clubs and then we will head back to my place for some truly unique latenight entertainment garret hadnt flown all the way from dc to party he wanted to get the nasty stuff out of the way so he said we have a problem may we at least eat before we talk business green said id rather get it out of the way you guys promised me that you were going to tie up all the loose ends over here and we have green smiled at a passing woman didnt you see the presidents press conference yesterday green dismissed garrets worries with an unconcerned look im not worried they foundthe guy there is no way they can trace the bosnian back to any of us green assured him how can you be so sure tell him joseph speyer did not bother to take his eyes off the wine list everything was done with cash we never met him how did he get the money we put it in two separate duffelbags and flew it into cyprus on a private plane the assassin gave us some coordinates the bags were left behind a stone wall in the middle of the night on a deserted stretch of road outside limassol so no one ever met him facetoface nope green said and theres no financial records anywhere or emails that could be traced back to you none so the cia is lying garret smiled or the bosnian is lying green added who the fuck knows with the damn cia garret said they have got to be the most incompetent idiots on the planet he sat back and took a drink of water green folded his perfectly manicured fingers in front of his face and asked so how is my pardon coming along garret squirmed in his chair for second then looked green in the eye and said its coming along just fine i think you are lying to me green said flatly cy garret moaned weve come this far im not going to screw you on our deal i want my pardon green said in a slightly threatening tone and youre going to fucking get it garret snapped if i dont get my pardon you are a dead man garrets throat suddenly felt dry his life had just been threatened by a man who he knew was capable of following through i told you from the very beginning that we were probably going to have to wait until the last minute garret spoke in an even tone if the press finds out they could kill this thing the eleventh hoursaturday morningthats when it will be signed green ran his palms along the sides of his slicked back hair and accepted garrets answer with a nod then his face grew serious and he said that is fine but just remember if it doesnt get signed you and your boss are going to pay garret was not used to being threatened like this he was usually the one doing the bullying feeling as if his back was against the wall he decided to go on the attack for the last time hes not my boss and as long as were throwing around threats why dont you chew on this one what do you think your old business partner pinky would do if he found out you killed his daughter shhh speyer hissed garret lowered his voice a notch and said you think just maybe he might call a couple of his old mossad buddies and have them pay you a visit green flashed a thin smile at the political huckster sitting across the table pinky should have given that little slut a lobotomy like joe kennedy did to his daughter trust me green said trying to further undermine garrets threat she was a constant headache for him hes not as upset about her death as it might seem garret looked at the billionaire through squinted eyes well how about josh then how do you think the soon to be president of the us of a would react if he found out you killed his beloved wife just so you could keep some of your illgotten billions garret leaned back certain the thrust had hit home he might send a tomahawk missile right up your ass or maybe hell have one of his aircraft carriers accidentally ram that yacht of yours when youre out in the middle of the med some night garret picked up a piece of bread i sure wouldnt want to piss off the commander in chief of the worlds lone superpower greens face turned crimson with rage you ungrateful little shit this wasnt my idea the hell it wasnt hissed garret you and your boss came whining to me about your problems hes not my boss excuse me said green your soontobe vice president ourremember youre the one who wants american citizenship back so fucking bad speyer couldnt take any more the restaurant was loud but even so a few patrons had glanced their way gentlemen i think you have both made your point you have made a deal cy has completed his end of the transaction and now it is your turn stu may i suggest a toast speyer raised his glass to cys pardon which im sure will be signed on saturday they all clinked glasses and green smiled saying it had better be garret returned the smile and said dont worry it will be now if youll excuse me i need to take a piss when garret was gone speyer looked at green and said i have never trusted that man i told you this was a terrible idea what is so bad about the life you have here why do you need to go back to america youd never understand you werent born there green looked across the room there was a pretty blond sitting at the bar he held up his glass and gave her a smile looking back to speyer he asked are you going to join us later it should be a wonderful show speyer wished everyone would leave him alone so he could pick a selection of wines im not sure im supposed to meet some colleagues later green smiled his big cheshire cat smile wherele pretexte for a little male bonding green was right speyer planned on meeting a few friends at geneva s premier gay nightclub what is that american saying you like different strokes for different folks green held up his glass find a friend and bring him with i will have them send a couple of wellendowed boys along with the girls we will show mr garret how we entertain in geneva rapp had watched garret enter the restaurant via the feed on his computer by the time speyer arrived he was in a position to see him pull up to the curb and valet his car when a big black hummer pulled up to the curb rapp had a feeling he was about to get a look at the final two members of the fourperson dinner reservation his expectations increased when a man the size of an nfl lineman got out of the vehicle and went into the restaurant for a quick look before coming back out another mountain of a man climbed out of the truck while a third stayed behind the wheel then came the two men whom they were protecting rapp recognized gordievsky immediately hed studied his file on the flight over there was something familiar about the second man but rapp couldnt place it as they entered the restaurant he turned his attention back to his screen and picked up a small ear bud that was plugged into the laptops audio port the sounds from inside the restaurant instantly filled his ear rapp and dumond were the only two who were monitoring the audio feed from inside the restaurant rapp sat back and got comfortable he fully expected it to be a long evening of watching listening and waiting less than a minute later he was on the edge of his seat struggling to hear every word as garret and the man named cy argued about their arrangement when garret got up to go to the bathroom rapp pressed the transmit button for his radio and asked did you get all that dumonds voice crackled back yeah rapp took the ear bud out that was streaming audio from inside the restaurant and asked can you clean it up a bit get rid of the background noise im already on it how long maybe a minute good as soon as its ready encrypt it and send it off to irene roger rapp glanced at the computer screen and the three men at the table speyer had his back to the camera the bald man was aleksandr gordievsky rapp was certain of that hed read langley s file on him the day before the third man the one garret called cy rapp felt there was something familiar about but no matter how hard he tried to make the connection it remained just beyond his grasp his thoughts returned to the conversation so they had kept it from josh alexander rapp thought for a moment about how they would break the truth to the man and he quickly concluded that it might be better to let him go on thinking shed been killed at the hands of terrorists mitch dumonds voice crackled through rapps earpiece garret is making a call on his mobile phone where is he rapp grabbed the ear bud and put it back in his left ear the bathroom i dont fucking care it was garrets voice but it sounded tinny this guy is crazy get a hold of stokes and tell him state is all his if he can make this happen there were a few moments of silence while garret listened to whoever it was he was talking to tell the prosecutor in new york she can have any job she wants hellill make her the next senator from wherever the hell it is that shes from there was more silence while garret listened to the other person i dont care what you have to do mark just get your ass over to the white house first thing in the morning with stokes and get hayes to sign this damn pardon or im telling you cy green will make our lives miserable the name and the face connected in rapps mind and it all came back cy green was a sleazy expatriate who had fled new york under indictment for selling arms to iraq after the first gulf war and libya before they decided to play nice there was also some other problem involving the purchase of cheap tin and copper at a heavy discount from corrupt russian oligarchs and cash kickbacks for their favorable pricing the millions hed made off that deal werent enough so he shorted the market betting that the prices would go down and then unloaded all his underpriced commodities which then collapsed the world tin and copper markets rapp seemed to remember that a few years back langley had looked into grabbing green but had been overruled by the state department it made him think of the old adage that sometimes its easier to ask for forgiveness than permission this time around rapp would be asking for neither rapp looked at the screen and watched as garret rejoined his fellow traitor at the table he picked up the secure satellite phone sitting on the seat next to him and pressed the transmit button in his sleeve did you send it off to irene yeah what about the last little bit are you going to be able to pull the whole conversation off echelon im working on it right now its near real time not absolute neat time so i need a few minutes all right let me know as soon as you have it rapp punched kennedys direct line into the phone and looked at his watch it was in geneva which meant it was in dc kennedy answered by saying i was just going to call you whats up i just got off the phone with dr hornig she tells me your friend is very talkative yeah but is he saying anything worthwhile apparently he took a little trip to the states back in october of last year rapp looked up slowly and stared out the front window of the car he was the one who delivered the van to gazich youre quick thats how they found him rapp imagined milinkavich photographing gazich as he picked up the van what never mind its not important right now do you have the email yes it just landed in my inbox open it and hit the play button on the audio clip and make sure youre sitting down rapp could hear the clip start he couldnt make out every word but since hed already heard it it was easy to follow when the clip was over kennedy cleared her throat and said so ross was involved yes youre going to get a second clip in shortly garret made a phone call from the bathroom im pretty sure he was talking to ross i assume this cy i heard talking was cy green how did you know rapp asked a bit surprised he and pinkus rautbort were business partners a lot of real estate in new york and a few oil deals they parted ways when green got indicted very messy justice stepped in and seized a bunch of their joint real estate holdings in new york didnt we look into snatching him a few years ago yes someone on the national security council tipped off the state department and they went nuts well if theres any silver lining here its that alexander wasnt involved i would agree i dont think we should tell him rapp said why not itll tear the guy apart so you think ignorance is bliss i wouldnt call losing your wife blissful no matter what their marital situation was it seems like he really cared for her i think youre right then tell me how telling him the truth will make him a better president as the president he needs to know the truth in most cases i would agree but not this time if you tell him what really happened all youre going to do is turn him into a miserable bitter paranoid man after a long pause kennedy said youre probably right just let me clean things up on this end slow down a minute i want some time to think about this dont bother mitch kennedy said her voice filled with caution im going to do what someone should have done a long time ago can we at least think it through rapp laughed i dont need to the wheels are already spinning dont touch garret are you out of your mind no we have a bigger fish to fry too many coincidences will cause way too much scrutiny just let him go and take care of the others and do me a favor ask marcus if he can get rosss medical files from bethesda for me anything else no ill see you tomorrow rapp hit end and held the phone in his lap for a second marcus he said as he pressed the transmit button for the secure radio find out where green and gordievsky live he paused and then added and see what you can find out about this le pretexte place they were talking about the nightclub speyer was going to was not far from the restaurant but then again nothing was far in geneva green and gordievsky were taking garret to a different club farther away the place was filled with young belarusian girls who worked for gordievsky the going rate was a thousand dollars for a romp in the sheets gordievsky bragged during dinner that he pocketed ninety percent of the fee garret had tried to get out of it but green had insisted one stop at a club and then they would take him back to his hotel speyer agreed to meet them back at greens penthouse for the midnight show rapps plan was falling into place it was in the evening when the four of them came out of the restaurant at the moment rapp was only worried about speyer he was going to be the key rapp had detected something in his voice during dinner a certain regret that he was associated with the others speyer handed the valet his ticket and the man took off at a trot speyer waved goodbye as the others piled into the hummer kevin rapp said to the guy in the front seat you think those bodyguards are wearing vests hacket shook his head i dont think they make em that big rapp nodded he was sure somebody did but these guys were probably already uncomfortable enough from their extra girth he doubted they would put on a stiff hot bulletproof vest here comes the valet when he pulls in to give speyer the car pull out and get in front of him well have him follow us to le pretexte the valet jumped out of speyer s bmw and held the door for the banker hacket put the car in drive and pulled out onto the quai de la poste and headed east speyer fell into line behind them their destination was just a half mile away speyer stayed a polite distance back the entire way rapp and hacket had already checked the place out while speyer and his guests were eating their main course rapp wanted to see the exact layout he spotted the club from a block away it was hard to miss with its huge neon sign looming above the street even with the temperature hovering in the midforties patrons were lined up halfway down the block remember slow down rapp said let me out right here rapp was ready to go before the car came to a complete stop he had the door opened and he was out he slammed the door closed behind him and darted between two parked cars and up onto the sidewalk rapp was wearing a black leather jacket with the collar turned up a pair of dark jeans and heavysoled black laceup shoes turning left he started down the sidewalk toward the front door of the club rapp watched hacket drive off with the bmw right behind him the patrons were now lined up against the building on his right he was going to have to adjust his pace to time it perfectly hacket approached the intersection and turned right stopping immediately the bmw pulled up to the valet and speyer got out he took the ticket and walked around the trunk just as rapp expected rapp sped up there was no way a guy like speyer was going to wait in line with the others again rapp was right speyer stepped onto the curb and was heading straight for the door his attention was on his valet ticket which he was trying to slide into his wallet rapp met him midway between the curb and door he reached out with his left hand grabbing the banker by the right elbow joseph rapp said loud enough for the bouncers to hear it has been a long time rapp kept moving taking a startled speyer with him in a much quieter voice rapp said youre lucky my boss wants you alive because id just as soon kill you right here right now speyer looked at the strange man with shock in his eyes he tried to pull away but the mans grip was simply too tight what his words were cut short by a stabbing sensation in his side dont put up a fight and dont raise your voice look at my right hand rapp held his knife out in front of him so the banker could see it the tip of it was crimson with blood if you dont do exactly as i say ill slit your throat and leave you to die right here i know what you and cy green have been up to rapp saw a flicker of worry in the mans eyes thats right im an american if you cooperate youll make it through this fine which is more than i can say for your friend green lets go rapp started toward the waiting mercedes who are you rapp kept walking im the guy whos going to solve all your problems they reached the mercedes and rapp opened the rear passenger door instead of getting in speyer s eyes darted back in the direction of the club rapp smiled and said tell me you dont regret getting into business with green and ill let you go ill go kill the fucking piece of shit myself and then ill tell president alexander that you helped facilitate the murder of his wife and eighteen other americans rapp looked past the glasses into the bankers eyes he could see the man running the numbers asking himself which was the path that would save his hide in a more reasonable voice rapp added either that or you can get in the car and you can help me what do i get out of it rapp smiled and said you get to live rapp sat sideways with his left leg up on the seat hed already frisked the banker all he found was a wallet and phone he took both and dropped them onto the front passenger seat hed switched the knife from his right hand to his left and pointed the tip at speyer s face why should i believe a word that comes out of your mouth the banker gave him an analytical look and said you shouldnt thats right but you were correct when you noted that my life would be much easier if cy green were out of it rapp had picked up on speyer s tone during dinner it was obvious that he did not enjoy the company of men like green and gordievsky that didnt make him any less guilty at this point just slightly more likable rapp saw potential in speyer it wasnt every day that the cia had the opportunity to own the president of one of geneva s most influential banks the information they could get from speyer would be extremely valuable so tell me again about the security rapp turned and looked down the block at greens building i already told you three times tell me again rapp wanted to make sure speyer wasnt leaving anything out the lobby has bulletproof glass the doorman is not on at this hour so we call the penthouse they buzz us in and send the elevator down and once we get to the fourth floor the door opens and one of the bodyguards is waiting for us sometimes two and they run a metal detector over you yes what about the butler sometimes hes there sometimes he isnt it usually depends how late it is rapp didnt like the idea of killing the butler i thought you said he lives there i mean there when you get off the elevator even at midnight working for cy green is a twentyfourhour job speyer pushed his glasses up on his nose through rapps earpiece he heard coleman say they just dropped garret off at his hotel and are en route rapp passed the information onto speyer who began wringing his hands nervously thats not going to work what you getting all nervous you need to stay calm how can you honestly expect me to stay calm just relax and think about how nice your life is going to be without green and this belarusian pig in it yes but how do i know you wont shoot me in the back rapp smiled and checked his watch it was at least these guys were punctual speyer had given them the name of greens favorite escort service rapp called the service and told them mr green wanted to let them know he was running an hour late the person at the service said she would change the arrival time to am joseph i know a good opportunity when i see one what do you mean if you go in there and do exactly as i say im not going to shoot you youre going to get up in the morning and go to work youll get to keep your house in the mountains and your flat in paris the only thing thats going to change is that youll be rid of these two assholes i dont get it what are you going to get out of this rapp smiled you are going to start spying for the cia i cant the look on speyer s face was one of shocked indignation yes you can and you will or ill have that little talk with president alexander about your role in the death of his wife and then the bank the mountain house the flat in paristhey all go away and then hell send me back over here to kill you rapp shook his head trust me take option a the other way will be no fun at all speyer tilted his head back and took in a nervous breath i can do this youre damn right you can rapp said happy that speyer was finally seeing things his way all you have to do is stay calm and let me take care of the rest the hummer came rolling down the narrow street towering over the smaller europeanmade cars it stopped in front of greens building and one sumosized bodyguard got out rapp smiled to himself the big ones were great for show and good for deterrence but they moved too slowly to be effective against a welltrained attacker green and gordievsky got out next and then another of the giants stepped down from the truck all four men continued into the building and the truck drove away to find a parking space rapp presumed coleman would follow the man and take him out when the time was right rapp looked down at his watch just as it struck midnight looking at speyer he said lets go both men got out of the car rapp slid his knife into the right outside pocket of his leather jacket and transferred his silenced glock to the left pocket he walked around the front of the car and joined speyer as they crossed the street they continued down the sidewalk to the front door of the building speyer adjusted his glasses and reached out for the buzzer remembersmile rapp whispered were supposed to be having fun speyer grinned awkwardly and pressed the buzzer a few seconds later greens voice came out of the tiny box joseph you came and you brought a friend how good of you come straight up a clicking noise sounded the release of the lock rapp leaned into the door with his shoulder not wanting to touch the glass with his hand he pushed it open and gestured for speyer to go in first they walked across the relatively small lobby to the elevator the white lights above it told them the lift was descending from the fourth floor rapp flexed his knees several times and cracked his neck from side to side speyer looked at him sideways what are you doing loosening up bend your kneesrelax the banker tried it now take a few deep breaths and just think about how happy youre going to be when this is over the elevator doors opened and they entered speyer turned around and leaned against the back wall rapp did the same and slid close to him so their shoulders were touching he wanted it to actually look like they liked each other the doors closed and the elevator began to move rapp smiled and asked so how long have you been in the banking business please dont shoot me rapp got the feeling positive reinforcement didnt work well with speyer he put his mouth up to speyer s ear and said if you fucking bring it up one more timei might he then moved away and smiled all you have to do is stand still and stick your arms out ill take care of the rest a tense moment later the elevator doors opened slowly as they did rapp turned to face speyer and gripped his pistol there was just enough play in his jacket that he could fire from the hip if he needed to the bodyguard was standing in the middle of the foyer with a handheld metal detector the second bodyguard had already taken up a notsoalert position in a chair against the wall to his left no butler rapp casually checked out the entire room from right to left as speyer stepped off the elevator he did a quick inventory of both bodyguards hands feet and eyes the feet were flat and the hands so puffy rapp bet he could count to five before they were able to wrestle their guns from their holsters their eyes were bloodshot and dull there was a good chance theyd been drinking speyer stuck his hands out like a scarecrow so the big guy could give him the onceover with the metal detector rapp stayed behind him turning a touch to his left as he drew his pistol concealing it against the black leather jacket the guy did a sloppy job checking speyer rapp began circling around to his left and acting like he was interested in the artwork as soon as speyer put his hands down rapp pulled his knife out of his pocket with his right hand and held it up above his head i suppose you guys will want to take this from me rapps eyes darted back and forth between the two men both of them were frozen by the sight of the knife neither saw the pistol rapp fired from the hip two shots in under one second the man in the chair was hit in the exact middle of his forehead the man standing was hit just under his right eyebrow he took one step forward and started to fall rapp moved quickly to try to break his fall with the knife still in his right hand he reached out and tried to slow the man just enough to keep him from hitting the floor too hard the guy thudded to his knees and then fell onto his left side rapp put one more in each guys head and stuffed the knife back in his pocket lets go rapp grabbed the back of speyer s coat and propelled him down the hall they made it to the big living room and turned left everything was exactly as speyer said it would be the double doors to the library and billiard room were straight ahead rapp could see shadows and hear voices he drove speyer forward keeping him where he could see him they reached the doorway the room ran to the right rapp turned speyer that way and then continued straight so he could gain a full field of fire he was more exposed than he would have liked but he didnt want speyer making some unpredictable move that might screw up a shot gordievsky was at the far end of the table getting ready to break his bald head shining from the overhead light his mouth started to form a word but the sound never made it out the bullet hit him in the top of his forehead forming a red dot the size of a dime gordievskys knees gave way and his chin slid down and bounced off the end of the table just like that he was gone green stood on the far side of the table both hands gripping his cue the tip in front of his chin all his weight was back and his posture slouched here was a man who paid others to do his dirty work green looked at rapp and without blinking said whatever theyre paying you ill double it rapp laughed and said im not for sale this is courtesy of the us government you piece of shit rapp squeezed off a round it struck green right between his eyes and the billionaire fell over with pool cue in hand rapp walked over to him and put three more rounds into the right center of his chest rapp pressed the transmit button and said everything is secure up here ill send the elevator down remember we want all the garbage packed up and out of here within an hour the bankers face was white and he was shaking uncontrollably rapp walked over to him and said let this be a lesson joseph as long as youre honest with me and you dont do anything to harm me or my country this will never happen to you but so help me god if you fuck me over just once youll end up just like these greedy assholes whitehouse washington dc kennedy clutched her purse in one hand and the presidents daily brief in the other shed lost count how many times shed delivered the pdb to president hayes but it probably averaged out to four days a week for the past two years the pdb was essentially a highly classified newspaper that was prepared by the cias office of current production and analytical support president hayes read the document every morning as well as several newspapers kennedy stopped outside the presidents private dining room and smiled at the secret service agent standing post the director of the cia had not slept well and it had absolutely nothing to do with rapp by the time she went to bed he was at the airport preparing to take off greens penthouse had been scrubbed clean and the bodies disposed of she had other things on her mind everything had to work perfectly or she could make an already pathetic situation worse the hardest part had been placing her trust in several individuals individuals who carried badges and had sworn an oath to uphold the law and protect and defend the constitution what she had to offer them was justice there was no doubt about it the alternative was to go public and watch america descend into suspicion and chaos kennedy knocked on the door once and entered president hayes was sitting at his private dining table he was in a white dress shirt and tie reading glasses perched on the end of his nose as always he had his four newspapers the new york times the washington post the washington times andusa today each paper was folded in quarters two on the left and two on the right carl the presidents navy steward arranged them just so every morning irene the president said rising slowly i think this is going to be one of the things ill miss most about this job irene could hear someone working in the pantry right around the corner you mean carls cooking the president laughed whats so hard about a bowl of blueberries and half a grapefruit carl came around the corner with a plate in hand and said it is not my fault you have turned into a health nut he set the plate down inbetween the presidents perfectly folded newspapers then ignoring the commander in chief he turned to kennedy and in a much nicer tone asked how are you doing this morning director kennedy fine carl and you counting the minutes until he is gone the filipino steward jerked his head toward hayes it wont be the same will it yes very sad i remember once i had an abscessed tooth pulled i was equally upset to see it go the president laughed he loved ribbing and being ribbed by carl what would you like to eat this morning carl asked kennedy and please dont order the other half of his grapefruit that was exactly what kennedy had been about to do but she didnt want to disappoint carl how about an omelet the best you have ever had carl disappeared down the hall and into the pantry kennedy turned to face the president she handed him the pdb hayes took it and held it for a second then looking at kennedy he said ive never been one to live life with regrets even more so since the parkinsons it is one of your most admirable qualities sir well as carl said the minutes are ticking away and theyve got me running crazy today so i dont want to forget to tell you how much youve meant to me thank you sir i mean it irene you have given me nothing but wise and measured council during some very difficult times im going to miss having breakfast with you every morning hayes opened his arms and gave kennedy a big hug when they parted she said ill have to visit you in ohio maybe i can bring carl they both laughed while they took their seats at the table carl brought kennedy some tea and refilled the presidents coffee the president skimmed the pdb but his heart wasnt in it with a little more than a day left in office there wasnt much he could do besides there was something else on his mind so youre sure it was ross and garret who planted that smear piece with thetimes yes kennedy said with absolute confidence he called late yesterday who kennedy asked even though she knew ross he said hed like to bury the hatchet with me thats good i dont trust him you should follow your instincts hayes looked out the window with a troubled expression what does he want to talk about a pardon of some sort hayes turned his attention back to kennedy and said and you kennedy feigned surprise me yes he claims he may have been wrong about you thats interesting kennedy knew all about the meeting knew that ross and stokes were going to ask for a pardon but she didnt know that she was going to be dragged into it so directly yes hayes said skeptically i think hes up to something probably would you like me to join you hayes thought about it and nodded i dont want any backstabbing on my last day if he has anything hed like to say he can say it with you in the room good kennedys omelet arrived browned to perfection hayes was a fast eater and kennedy was a light eater kennedy had made the decision not to tell hayes what they had learned it wasnt that she didnt trust him it was that he had given so much seen so much that he deserved to leave office unburdened by what they were about to do kennedy heard footfalls coming from the oval office behind her and turned to see jack warch the deputy director of the united states secret service entering the dining room well look what the cat dragged in hayes said good morning mr president director kennedy warch stopped at the side of the table how are you feeling on your last day i still have tomorrow last full day warch had served as the special agent in charge of hayess detail for the first three years i feel good fantastic warch clapped his hands together with your permission id like to accompany you and the first lady back to your home in ohio tomorrow hayes looked touched you dont have to do that jack i know i dont sir i want to that would be great id really like that and i know the first lady will appreciate it itll be my pleasure now i hate to break up your breakfast but lorie asked me to tell you that the attorney general and vice presidentelect are ready when you are though before you meet with them i need to go over a few things with you kennedy set her napkin on the table ill leave you two alone and ask lorie to send in the attorney general and vp ross are you sure the president asked absolutely we dont want you playing catchup on your last full day thank you hayes smiled kennedy grabbed her purse and her cup of tea and started down the short hallway from the presidents private dining room to the oval office on the left was the pantry kennedy stopped and said carl the omelet was fantastic thank you ohyou are always welcome would you please do me a favor and set up coffee service for two and maybe some water in the oval absolutely kennedy continued down the hallway through the oval office and into the outer office where the presidents administrative assistants were located good morning lorie good morning director kennedy would you please send the attorney general and vice presidentelect ross in kennedy went back into the oval office the setup was always the same two arm chairs were in front of the fireplace and two long sofas stretched out taking up the majority of that side of the room in between the sofas was a fairly large glass coffee table there was a pecking order when it came to the seating arrangement in the oval office the president always sat in the chair to the right of the fireplace the chair to the left was reserved for the vice president a visiting head of state or in a less formal setting anyone the president offered the chair to kennedy doubted the president would offer the chair to ross he simply didnt like the man well enough that meant ross would sit on the couch closest to the president stokes would likely sit next to him carl appeared with the coffee service and set it in the middle of the glass table ill be back with the water in a moment thank you kennedy was wearing a black pant suit the jacket had three buttons down the front and two small pockets on either side kennedy tugged on the bottom of the jacket to straighten it and patted each pocket for a last check ross entered the office first there was a flash of surprise on his face but he quickly covered it up with a phony smile irene he said as he walked across the room what a pleasant surprise the vice presidentelect extended his hand across the coffee table kennedy took it good morning mr vice president not for another day ross wagged his finger playfully at kennedy irene attorney general stokes said good morning martin i didnt expect to see you here this morning ross said his voice void of any obvious malice i was having breakfast with the president he got hung up with something so he asked me to keep you two company for a few minutes kennedy pointed at the couch behind the two men sit may i get either of you coffee kennedy had sat through countless meetings with both men and she couldnt remember a time where either had said no sure said ross as he lowered himself into the spot closest to the presidents chair stokes set his briefcase on the floor and said please kennedy reached out to grab a cup her hand hovering over the top of it for a second looking across at ross she said cream and sugar right yes kennedy placed the cup on top of a saucer and filled it three quarters to the top with coffee she then added cream and a cube of sugar before stirring it thoroughly she set the spoon on the tray and placed the cup and saucer directly into rosss hands thank you ross blew on the coffee for a second and then took a sip kennedy poured stokes a cup and slid it across as carl returned with a crystal pitcher of water and four glasses he set them on the table next to the coffee service and left kennedy looked at stokes and said i assume your people are happy with the information we put together on gazich she took an empty glass of water and filled it to the top are you kidding me the guy is as good as fried good ross took another drink of coffee and said any luck running down the financial leads no kennedy frowned im afraid we ran into a wall there i thought you were pretty confident that you were going to make a connection ross sounded a bit let down it took all the composure kennedy could marshal just to sit in the same room with the man to have to watch him fake concern was nearly unbearable more than anything we floated that to see if we could spook some potential suspects into making a stupid move she took another sip of her water and then placed it on the table with both hands thats too bad ross said with a disappointed voice but great work on tracking that other guy down president hayes entered the room with his suit jacket on carl closed the door behind him and the other door to where the administrative assistants sat was also closed sorry im late gentlemen ross stokes and kennedy stood hayes marched over with his large coffee mug in hand so how is everyone feeling today hayes asked in an upbeat voice fine sir ross answered kennedy kept her focus on ross as the president and stokes exchanged pleasantries hayes extended his coffee mug and asked kennedy to top him off she picked up the pot and filled his mug sit hayes said so what can i help you gentlemen with this morning let me guess someone wants a pardon you are very astute mr president ross said with a big smile kennedy saw perspiration beginning to form on rosss forehead before we get to that though i would like to apologize to irene kennedy wondered where the snake could possibly be going with this ross looked directly across the table at her i was wrong to doubt you over an article written by a reporter with an obvious ax to grind thank you kennedy lied in her most congenial tone and i have spoken to josh and he has agreed that it would be a good idea for you to stay on as director of the cia for as long as youd like thats great news president hayes said with genuine relief kennedy watched ross reach up and tug on his shirt collar his forehead was really beginning to shine just as juarez had told her it would irene president hayes said do you have anything youd like to say kennedy had a lot shed like to say but she didnt want to spoil her very well rehearsed plan continuing the charade she said i would be honored to serve your administration vice president ross good ross said as he tugged at his collar he blinked once and gave his head a quick shake now about this pardon business he shook his head again and rubbed his eyes we have managed to get everybody at justice who matters to sign off on this thing which will really help insulate you from any fallout ross stopped abruptly and took in a deep breath are you feeling all right asked hayes im not sure kennedy seized her opportunity she reached across the table and handed ross her glass here have some water ross eagerly grabbed the glass and took several large gulps kennedy watched with a kind of analytical detachment juarez had explained how it would work the drug that she had dropped into his coffee was designed to increase heart rate and bring on nausea but more importantly it was designed to mask the second drug the one that she had slipped into her own water glass after taking several sips unknown to all but a few the secret service had a tiny camera in the ceiling of the oval office it was for security reasons everything was taped unless the president specifically asked for the system to be turned off this morning kennedy wanted it on ross took a few more sips of water and then looked at the president his breathing seemed labored i think its my heart i have a bad heart suddenly he seemed to wilt the water glass dropped from his hands tumbling to the carpeted floor and spilling the president was out of his chair coming to rosss aid he grabbed him by the shoulders ross looked across at kennedy his breathing was really shallow no one knows i have a bad heart i do kennedy thought to herself without an ounce of guilt she stood and moved quickly to the door fully aware that she must keep up the proper appearance she yanked it open and yelled we have a medical emergency get the doctor up here and grab the defibrillator kennedy hustled back to the sitting area ross was slumped forward in hayess arms lets get him on the floor kennedy yelled as she grabbed the end of the coffee table and dragged it from between the two couches hayes and stokes grabbed ross and laid him on the floor kennedy picked up the fallen water glass and stood over the vice presidentelect for a moment until she was forced to back away as the first agents arrived the room was filling up with people fast kennedy looked over and saw carl standing in the doorway that led to the presidents private dining room special agent warch appeared at his side just as they had planned he pointed at the coffee table and said something to carl the fastidious navy steward hurried over to the table and began clearing the dishes as more and more bodies piled into the room with a steady hand kennedy set the water glass on carls tray and walked around the couch on the left to retrieve her purse the doctor arrived a half minute later and yelled for everyone to clear the room kennedy took one last look at rosss pale face and left the oval office langley virginia rapp stood in front of kennedys desk he was wearing the same clothes that hed had on in geneva he was exhausted and in desperate need of sleep but he was even more desperate to find out just how in the hell mark ross ended up dead in the oval office theyd landed shortly after am when one of the mechanics at the hangar told them about ross rapp tried for close to an hour to get ahold of kennedy but she wouldnt pick up finally one of her secretaries told him she was on her way back to langley rapp made a beeline for cia headquarters and found kennedy sitting alone in her office writing in a file i see you didnt bother to wait for me rapp said kennedy finished writing a note and closed the file jose said we needed to handle this one with a deft touch what in the hell is that supposed to mean kennedy didnt want to argue with him an opportunity presented itself i see that a fucking heart attack in the oval office whoever pulled that one off has got a gigantic set of balls kennedy took off her reading glasses and leaned back in her chair what did you guys do poison him she nodded jose likes that sneaky stuff i heard on the radio that he had some heart problem that ran in the family yes a reporter uncovered it during the campaign but i already knew about it how when he applied here after college he wanted operations doesnt everyone he failed his physical they discovered that he had mitral valve prolapse what in the hell is that basically a heart murmur so who the hell poisoned him jose kennedy looked at rapp for a long moment and calmly said i did rapp couldnt speak at first he stood there dumbfounded eventually he whisperedyou poisoned him yes are you all right she nodded im fine rapp studied her are you sure yes im sure you should also know that i had to bring jack warch maria rivera and skip in on it rapp thought about it for a second and said you needed their help yes what about an autopsy with the existing heart condition skip doesnt think rosss wife will ask for one plus the secret service has the whole thing on tape warch already looked at it he says theres nothing suspicious what if the widow wants an autopsy rivera planted some viagra in rosss shaving kit this morning one of the poisons was also heavily laced with the drug rapp looked skeptical politicians wives know how to keep things quiet he wasnt sleeping with her so shes going to assume he was using the viagra with other women trust me she will not want to open that can of worms what if she does jose says even if they do an autopsy this stuff wont show up on a toxicology report rapp considered how she was handling all of this some people could kill and go through life as if nothing had happened for rapp it depended on whom he killed he was happy to get the chance to kill green and gordievsky proud that they were no longer part of the human race the two bodyguards he was less excited about they were foot soldiers who had chosen the wrong side that was all and he felt no pride in killing them so youre okay rapp asked i wasnt sure how id handle it but so far so good the man had to be dealt with and putting him on trial was not a good option i agree rapp looked away from kennedy feeling slightly awkward he would have never guessed that she had it in her almost as if she could read his mind kennedy said you know mitch this morning wasnt that big of a stretch for me what do you mean all the times ive ordered you to kill its really not all that different than slipping some poison in a mans drink rapp saw her point you dont get your hands dirty but youre involved i got them a little dirtier than i would have preferred this morning she said wryly rapp smiled im proud of you you did a good job you executed a traitor this morning ross chose his path you have any problem sleeping just think of those nineteen people who were killed last october ross got exactly what he deserved thats good advice thank you rapp covered his mouth and yawned god i need to get some sleep why dont you go home you look tired rapp looked at his watch and shook the sleep from his head how long do i have to wait before i kill garret i think at least a year comeon rapps voice was full of disappointment mitch a year is a long time think of it this way word will eventually get out that green and gordievsky are missing with rosss sudden departure garret is bound to get a little paranoid probably just the opposite knowing garret hes halfway to los angeles by now all smug thinking hes the luckiest man on the planet i cant wait to be the one to tell him hes not mitch kennedy cautioned stay away from him until i say the time is right fine but we are going to kill him arent we yes we are
